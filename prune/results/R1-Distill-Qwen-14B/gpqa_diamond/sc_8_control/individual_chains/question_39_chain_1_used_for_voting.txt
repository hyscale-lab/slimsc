Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. Alright, so there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, they weren't found anywhere except between x=1 and x=3. So the probability of finding the particle must be zero outside that interval. 

Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. Oh, right, the wave function's complex, so the absolute square is (real part squared plus imaginary part squared). But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that would mean the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)². 

But wait, the wave function needs to be normalized, right? Because the total probability must be 1. So the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. Hmm, let me think. The wave function is zero outside of x=1 to x=3, but wait, in the problem statement, it's said that when measuring, the particles weren't found outside. So maybe that's implying that the wave function is zero outside of that region. Hmm, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and that would be valid in the region where the particle exists. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the given expression is only in the region x between 1 and 3.

Wait, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. But wait, hold on. The wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, which is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1. Because the wave function is zero outside, so the integral of |ψ|² from all x is 1.

So let me set up the integral. The integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this into two parts: a² * integral of 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus 0.25 * integral of 1 dx from 1 to 3, equals 1.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2). 

The integral of 1 dx from 1 to 3 is 2 (since 3-1=2).

So putting it together: a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5: a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is sqrt(0.7213). Let me calculate that. Square root of 0.72 is about 0.8485, and 0.7213 would be a bit higher, maybe around 0.85. So a is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the setup. Because the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the absolute square is |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, which is correct. So the setup is right. The integral is calculated correctly, and the rest follows. So yes, a should be approximately 0.85, which is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function, which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the wave function is zero outside this interval. The normalization condition requires that the total probability equals 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) \, dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \),
2. \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx \).

The first integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

The second integral evaluates to:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} 1 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
