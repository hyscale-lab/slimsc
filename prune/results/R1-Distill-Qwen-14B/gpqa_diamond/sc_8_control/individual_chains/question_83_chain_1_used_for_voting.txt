Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The Ka for acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5. 

Wait, so the initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we're adding the same volume of water, which is 20 cm³. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. That means the concentration of acetic acid after dilution would be half, right? Because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the moles are constant. So, 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react completely with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid first. The diluted solution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Moles = concentration × volume. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. 

So, moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question asks about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. That would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Because 10 cm³ is 100%, so 25% is 2.5 cm³.

So first, I need to find the pH at 25% titration. Then the pH at equivalence.

Starting with 25% titration. At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Let's see, the moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO^-.

So the initial moles of acetic acid was 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume now is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Ah, so this is a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)). Wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So using the Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Calculating that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Hmm, so around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But let me cross-verify.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the math more accurately.

Calculating [A^-]/[HA] = (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) → the 0.0425 cancels out. So it's 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is indeed approximately -0.477. So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. So the first part is 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water.

Wait, sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion (A^-) is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

The concentration of acetate comes from the moles of NaOH added, which is 0.001 mol (since the equivalence point is when you've added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.001 mol, as calculated earlier).

The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ NaOH: 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from Ka of acetic acid. Since Kw = Ka * Kb, so Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, the hydrolysis equation. The initial concentration is 0.02 M acetate, which will produce x concentration of OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So, Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.516, so pOH ≈ 5.484. So pH = 14 - 5.484 ≈ 8.516. So about 8.52.

Wait, but that's higher than the given options. Let me double-check the Kb calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. That part is correct.

But wait, when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution is basic, so pH should be above 7. Looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value, option D has 6.92.

Wait, but wait, let me re-examine the math. Maybe I should set up the equation more accurately.

The initial concentration is 0.02 M acetate.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation:

CH3COO^- ↔ H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

Let x be [OH^-] = [CH3COOH] = x.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x is very small.

x² = 0.02 * Kb = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.5169, so pOH=5.4831 → pH=14-5.4831=8.5169, so about 8.52. So the equivalence pH is around 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, option D has 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the concentration at equivalence. Let me recheck the moles and volume.

Wait, at equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.01 L = 0.001 mol. The diluted acid is 0.001 mol, so they neutralize each other, producing 0.001 mol of acetate.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the Kb calculation? Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact solution without approximation. Let's try that.

Equation: Kb = x² / (0.02 - x).

Since Kb is 5.405e-10, which is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds. So the calculation is correct.

So the equivalence pH is about 8.52. But looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. So that's a possible answer.

But wait, the options are: option A) 4.26; 8.52, option D) 4.57; 6.92.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the equivalence point. Another way to calculate pH is to compute the pH based on the hydrolysis of acetate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of a different approach, like considering the solution as a buffer, but no—equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's a solution of the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405405e-10, yes.

So Kb is 5.405e-10.

So for the acetate hydrolysis:

Concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 → x = sqrt( Kb × 0.02 ) → as before, 3.288e-6 M.

So pOH = 5.483, pH = 8.517, so 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which matches option A.

But wait, looking back at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52, so that would be the first option.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me recompute the Henderson-Hasselbalch part.

Wait, at 25% titration, how much of the acid has been neutralized?

The volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³. So moles of NaOH is 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So moles of CH3COOH neutralized: 0.00025 → moles remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) = 4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647) = 4.733 + log(0.3333) ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 → ~4.26. That's correct.

So the pH at 25% is ~4.26, and equivalence is ~8.52. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options again: option A is 4.26; 8.52.

But wait, the options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52  
B) 3.17; 6.73  
C) 4.73; 7.00  
D) 4.57; 6.92  

So option A is the one that matches. But another thought: when you dilute the acetic acid, the concentration changes, which affects the pH. But wait, after dilution, the pH would change, but in the titration, the initial pH is not part of the problem; we're concerned with during the titration.

Wait, but the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Its pH can be calculated as pH = ½ (pKa - log C), since for a weak acid, pH = ½ (pKa - log C).

Wait, 0.025 M is 2.5e-2, log(2.5e-2) is log(2.5) + log(1e-2) = 0.39794 -2 = -1.602. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = ½ (4.733 - (-1.602)) = ½ (6.335) ≈ 3.1675 → ~3.17. So the initial pH is about 3.17.

But that's not relevant to the question, which starts after adding the NaOH during titration.

Wait, but in the problem, we have diluted the acetic acid first. So, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Then titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. So, I think the calculations I did earlier are correct.

So, the two pH values are approximately 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. So the correct option is A.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Did I make a mistake in the equivalence point calculation?

Wait, another thought: when the solution is at equivalence, the solution is the acetate ion in water. But perhaps I should consider that the acetate comes from a strong base (NaOH) and a weak acid (acetic acid), so it's a basic solution. But what if I miscalculated the Kb?

Wait, let me compute Kb again.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

So, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

The expression: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] → assuming x is small, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = log(3.288e-6) = 5.484 → pH = 14 -5.484 =8.516 ≈8.52.

So that's correct.

Hmm, so the answer should be option A. But looking again, perhaps I should consider that the initial dilution might affect the pH, but in the titration, the solution's pH depends on the buffer or the salt solution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in the 25% titration, the solution is a buffer with HA and A^-, and I correctly applied the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So, I think my calculations are correct. So the answer is option A: 4.26; 8.52.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and it is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. The concentration of acetic acid after dilution is halved:  

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M}}{2} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:  

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### At 25% Titration:
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:  

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

NaOH reacts completely with acetic acid, neutralizing 0.00025 mol of CH₃COOH and forming 0.00025 mol of CH₃COO⁻. The remaining moles of CH₃COOH are:  

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:  

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of CH₃COOH and CH₃COO⁻ are:  

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:  

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point:
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming 0.001 mol of CH₃COO⁻. The total volume is:  

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of CH₃COO⁻ is:  

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( \text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of OH⁻ produced. Then:  

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.0200}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):  

\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.0200) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:  

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:  

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.
