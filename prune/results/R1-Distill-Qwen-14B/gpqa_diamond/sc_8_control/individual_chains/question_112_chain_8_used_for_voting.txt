Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I remember that spin states can be represented as vectors, and |up> and |down> form an orthonormal basis.

First, the state is given proportional to that combination, which probably means we need to normalize it because quantum states are typically normalized to 1. So, I should find the normalization constant. 

The coefficient for |up> is (1+i), and for |down> it's (2 - i). The normalization would involve taking the magnitude squared of each coefficient and adding them. Let's compute that.

The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). So its square is 2. For (2 - i), the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5). So the square is 5. So the total squared norm is 2 + 5 = 7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Next, the question asks about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so the matrix would be 2x2 because the states are up and down. Let me write that out.

The operator matrix A would be:
[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, no, because for i≠j, Aij is hbar/2. So A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So yeah, that's correct.

I think this operator is the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yeah, A is (hbar/2) * X. Since the eigenstates of Pauli X are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So perhaps the operator A is measuring the spin in the x-direction, scaled by hbar/2. 

Wait, actually, the Pauli matrices correspond to spin operators. The spin operator Sx is (hbar/2) σx, so yes, A is the Sx operator because A is (hbar/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σx, which are the |+x> and |-x> states.

So, to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A (i.e., |+x> and |-x>), and then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation values for the eigenstates, but maybe not. Let's think.

Wait, another approach: since A is the Sx operator, which is (hbar/2) σx, then the possible eigenvalues are ±hbar/2, and the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

So, the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is the square of the amplitude of |+x> in |alpha>, and similarly for -hbar/2.

So, first, I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

But wait, perhaps I can express |alpha> in the computational basis (|up> and |down>) and then compute the overlap with |+x> and |-x>.

I remember that the eigenstates of σx are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, let's write |alpha> in terms of these.

|alpha> = c_up |up> + c_down |down>, where c_up = (1+i)/sqrt(7) and c_down = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So, substituting, |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Let me write this as a vector in the |up>, |down> basis:

c_up = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
c_down = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Now, express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

We can express |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>, as I wrote earlier.

So,

a = < +x | alpha >
b = < -x | alpha >

Compute a:

a = < +x | alpha > = [ 1/sqrt(2) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So,

a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Because <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and cross terms vanish because |up> and |down> are orthogonal.

So,

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

So a = 3 / (sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute b:

b = < -x | alpha > = [ 1/sqrt(2) ( <up| - <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So,

b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

Which is (1+i -2 +i ) = (-1 + 2i )

So,

b = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2:

a = 3 / sqrt(14) → |a|^2 = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |b|^2: 

(-1 + 2i) has magnitude sqrt( ( (-1)^2 ) + (2)^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4)= sqrt(5). So |b|^2 is 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.357. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, adding to 1, which is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 for the expectation. Option C has 0.28 and 0.72, which doesn't match. D has 0.61, which is close but not exactly 9/14 (which is about 0.642). So A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which align with our calculation.

Now, the average value of the operator A. Since A is (hbar/2) σx, the average value is <alpha| A |alpha>. 

But since A is (hbar/2) σx, and since <sigma_x> is the expectation value of σx for the state |alpha>, the average of A would be (hbar/2) <sigma_x>.

Alternatively, I can compute this expectation directly.

Another way: the expectation value is Tr[A rho], where rho is the density matrix of |alpha>. Since |alpha> is a pure state, rho is |alpha><alpha|.

But perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Wait, A is (hbar/2) σx. So,

<alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) <alpha| σx |alpha>

So, I need to find <sigma_x> for the state |alpha>.

Alternatively, since sigma_x is the Pauli matrix,

sigma_x = |up><down| + |down><up|

So,

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ <up| + <down| (1+i) and (2 -i) coefficients ]

Wait, let me compute it more precisely.

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So <alpha| is [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7) <up| + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) <down| ]

Now, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) <up| + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) <down| ] ( |up><down| + |down><up| ) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Let me compute this step by step.

First, expand the sigma_x term.

sigma_x is |up><down| + |down><up|.

So,

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) <up| + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) <down| ] ( |up><down| (1+i)|up> + |up><down| (2 -i)|down> + |down><up| (1+i)|up> + |down><up| (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>

Which is:

= [ (1 - i) <up| + (2 + i) <down| ] / sqrt(7)
   [ sigma_x ]
   [ (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

But sigma_x acting on |up> is |down>, and on |down> is |up>.

So,

= (1/7) [ (1 -i) <up| + (2 + i) <down| ] ( |down> (1 + i) + |up> (2 -i) )

Now, because <up|down> is 0 and <down|up> is 0,

= (1/7) [ (1 -i) <up| up> (2 -i) + (2 +i) <down| down> (1 +i) ]

So,

= (1/7) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)(-i)
= 2 - i - 2i + i^2
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2=-1)
= 1 -3i

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 + 2i +i +i^2
= 2 +3i -1
= 1 +3i

So sum:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2

So,

<sigma_x> = 2 /7

Therefore, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the |alpha> expansion. Because another approach could be to compute the expectation value using the matrix representation.

Alternatively, perhaps express |alpha> as a column vector and compute A |alpha>, but that might be more involved.

But given the steps I took earlier, it seems correct. So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357. So the options are A) 0.64, 0.36..., which is the closest.

The problem involves an electron state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise, as well as the average value of \( A \).

### Step 1: Normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \),
- \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5 \).

The total squared norm is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \). Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, and its eigenstates are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Expand \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
To find the probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), compute the overlaps:
\[
a = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
b = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes:
\[
|a|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |b|^2 = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), this becomes:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), the expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = |a|^2 - |b|^2 = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
