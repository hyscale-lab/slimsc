Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. I remember LTE means that each small region of the star's atmosphere behaves like a blackbody at a certain temperature, and the conditions in that region are uniform enough to treat it with thermodynamic equations.

So the question is about finding the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the two stars. The options are A, B, C, D, each involving logarithmic terms and combinations of T1 and T2.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population of particles in different energy states. The formula I recall is that the ratio of populations (n_upper / n_lower) is equal to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the excitation level is twice as high in star_1. So for star_1, the population ratio is 2 times that of star_2. Let me define the populations: let's say n1 is the population in the excited state for star_1, and n2 for star_2. The problem says n1 = 2*n2. Alternatively, the ratio n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the excited state in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. So the ratio n1_upper / n1_lower would be different for each star. Or wait, perhaps I should model the ratio of excitation in each star.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation for each star. For star_1, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state (or lower state) is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly, for star_2, it's (n_upper' / n_lower') = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But in the question, it says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 relative to their own ground states.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is such that for star_1, the population in the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. Let me clarify.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, R2 = (n_upper2 / n_lower2) = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2. Or wait, no, the problem says that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the ratio between upper and lower states is higher in star_1. So R1 = 2 * R2.

So R1/R2 = 2.

Taking the ratio of R1 and R2: [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = 2.

Which simplifies to exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ] = 2.

Wait, let me double-check the algebra. The exponents subtract when you divide. So:

exp(ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2.

Wait, no. Let me make that again. R1 is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and R2 is exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))]/[exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So this equals 2.

So exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by k:

ΔE (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) = k ln(2)

But wait, I can rearrange the equation. Let's write it as: (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE.

Alternatively, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (k ln 2)/ΔE.

Wait, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to the Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, so let me substitute k into the equation. Let's see:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (k ln 2) / ΔE.

But wait, in the problem, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So if I plug in ΔE = k, then (k ln 2)/k = ln 2. So the equation becomes (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln 2.

Wait, but that's only if ΔE equals k, which it doesn't. Wait, no. Wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann's constant is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * (1 K) * something? Wait, no, the units for ΔE would be J, so ΔE = k * T, where T is in Kelvin.

Wait, in our case, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k=1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * 1 K? Because 1 K times k gives J.

So ΔE = k * 1 K. So 1.38e-23 J = (1.38e-23 J/K) * 1 K.

So in that case, our equation becomes:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (k ln2) / (k * 1 K) ) → (k ln2)/(k) = ln2 / 1.

So the equation simplifies to (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2.

Wait, but wait— that would make (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2. Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this.

Wait, let me write the equation again: (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2.

We can rearrange this: 1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln2.

But that's not the form of any of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1 → ln(2) = T2/T1. Hmm, that's not matching.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) → ln2 = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) → which is (1/T2 + 1/T1) = ln2.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2 → Not sure, but that seems more complicated.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) → Let's see: (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2.

Wait, because (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2) = (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)).

Wait, let me compute that:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = [ (T1/T1 T2) ) - (T2/T1 T2) ) ] = 1/(T2) - 1/(T1).

So, yes, (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

So from our earlier equation, (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln2 → which is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln2. So the equation is ln2 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Looking back at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches.

Wait, but let me think again. So from the problem, the ratio of the excited states is R1 = 2 R2. So R1/R2 = 2.

Which gives us (n_upper1/n_lower1) / (n_upper2/n_lower2) ) = 2.

Which is [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = 2 → exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) -1/(T1) ) ] = 2.

Taking ln: ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln2.

But since ΔE = k (because 1.38e-23 J = k), then:

(k)/(k) (1/T2 -1/T1 ) = ln2 → (1/T2 -1/T1) = ln2.

Which is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln2 → equation in option D.

So the correct equation is Option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population of atoms in different energy states, given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to ground state populations are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, so \( R_1 = 2R_2 \). Taking the ratio of \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \):

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since \( \frac{R_1}{R_2} = 2 \), we have:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the value of \( k \), we substitute \( \Delta E = k \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{k}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2),
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting this as:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2),
\]

we find that this matches the form of option D. The other options do not align with the derived relationship. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
