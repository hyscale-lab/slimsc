Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: total cobalt is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species. The options are A to D, with various percentages.

Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on stability constants, but I remember they have to do with the formation of complexes. The stability constant, β, tells us how much a complex will form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is.

The question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]²+ complex. Because the term 'dithiocyanato' implies two SCN- ligands attached. The blue color might correspond to a particular complex, like maybe the tetrathiocyanato [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Wait, no, wait. I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. Oh wait, but the problem mentions dithiocyanato, which is two SCN. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check that.

Wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato". Wait, I remember that in the Co(II) thiocyanate complexes, the color changes with the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue, [Co(SCN)_3]^3- might be something else, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is probably a different color. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which would be the dithiocyanato species. So the percentage we're looking for is the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ in the solution.

So the plan is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and sum them up, then find the percentage for the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex.

But wait, how many complexes can form? The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the complexes are: [CoSCN]^+ (β1=9), [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (β2=40), [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63), and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (β4=16). Wait, but β4 being 16 is lower than β2. That's interesting because usually higher β implies more stability. So the sequence is β3>β2>β1>β4? Or wait, the β values are: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β3 is the highest, followed by β2, then β1, then β4. Hmm. So the most stable is [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

But wait, the problem is about the percentage of dithiocyanato, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ with β2=40. So how do I calculate that?

I think the approach is to model the distribution of Co species considering all possible complexes. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species: Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But wait, wait. The problem says "dithiocyanato" (two SCN-), so that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So I need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ over the total cobalt species.

The formula for each complex's concentration can be derived using the stability constants and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN^-.

Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of x and the β values.

But wait, the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. That includes all the Co species. So the sum of all Co species is 1e-2 M.

The overall approach is to write expressions for each complex's concentration in terms of x and the stability constants, then find x by considering the sum of all species equals 1e-2 M.

Wait, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the formation of each complex in the order of their stability constants. Higher β complexes form more, so the most stable (highest β) will dominate.

But the β for [Co(SCN)_3]^- is 63, which is higher than β2=40. So that would suggest that the [Co(SCN)_3]^- is the most abundant, followed by [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, then [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc. But wait, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has β4=16, which is lower than β2 and β1. So perhaps the order is [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63), [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (β2=40), [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1=9), and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (β4=16). Wait, no, because β4 is 16 which is less than β1=9? No, 16 is more than 9. So the order of β is β3 (63) > β2 (40) > β4 (16) > β1 (9). Oh wait, no, 16 is larger than 9. So the order would be β3 (63) is highest, then β2 (40), then β4 (16), then β1 (9). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the β4 is for the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are for the stepwise formation. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]+: Co²+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN]^+; β1=9.

β2 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ from [CoSCN]^+ and another SCN^-. So [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^2+; β2=40, so the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is β1*β2 = 9*40=360.

Similarly, β3 is the formation constant for the next step: [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^-; β3=63. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_3]^- would be β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=2520.

β4 is the next step, but here it's given as 16. So [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^2-; β4=16. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_4]^2- would be β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16=362880. But wait, that seems really high, but perhaps the stepwise constants are given, not the overall.

Wait, no, maybe each β is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So [Co(SCN)_1]^+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ has β2=40, [Co(SCN)_3]^- has β3=63, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has β4=16. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each step's stability would be a product of the previous β and the next β.

Wait, perhaps each β represents the formation of the next complex from the previous. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, the formation constant is the product of β1 and β2. Similarly for each subsequent complex. So the overall stability constants for each complex would be:

β_total_1 = β1 =9

β_total_2 = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360

β_total_3= β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=2520

β_total_4= β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16=362880

Wait, but that can't be right because β4 being 16 would make the overall β for [Co(SCN)_4]^2- very high. But in the problem statement, it says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So perhaps each β is the stepwise formation constant, and the overall is the product up to that step.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β values are the overall stability constants for each complex. But that's less likely because for such a case, the [Co(SCN)_3]^- would have a higher stability than [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which might not align with what's expected.

Wait, but perhaps the given β's are the successive stepwise constants. So to get the overall β for each species, we'd multiply all β's up to that step. So [CoSCN]^+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ has β1*β2=9*40=360, [Co(SCN)_3]^- has β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=2520, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has β1*β2*β3*β4= 9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, but that would mean that [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is the most stable, then [Co(SCN)_3]^- is next, then [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, then [CoSCN]^+. But the β4 is only 16, which is lower than β3=63. So that would mean that the last step has a lower formation constant, which could imply that beyond a certain point, the complex isn't as favored. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the given β values are the overall stability constants, not the stepwise. So [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} has βn. So for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, β1=9. Second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β2=40. Third, [Co(SCN)_3]^- has β3=63. Fourth, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has β4=16. But in that case, the β4 is much lower than β3 and β2, which might not make sense, as usually, more ligands would lead to higher stability.

So perhaps I should consider that the given β's are the stepwise formation constants. So each β represents the step to form the next complex from the previous one. So the overall β's for each complex would be the product up to that step.

But wait, the problem states the stability constants of the complexes as β1=9, β2=40, etc. So perhaps each β is the cumulative product. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed regardless and see where that leads.

Let me think about the general approach. The concentration of each complex can be written in terms of the free Co²+ concentration (let's call it x) and the SCN^- concentration (0.1 M).

For each species:

[Co²+] = x

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = β1 * x * 0.1

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-] = β2 * (β1 x 0.1) * 0.1 = β1 * β2 * x * (0.1)^2

Wait, but if β2 is the stepwise constant, then [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-]

Which would be β2 * (β1 * x * [SCN^-]) ) * [SCN^-} = β1 * β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ * [SCN^-] = β3 * (β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2) ) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3.

And [Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3]^- * [SCN^-] = β4 * (β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3) ) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4.

So the total concentration of Co is:

x (free Co²+) + β1 x [SCN^-] + β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN^-]^4 = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

So substituting [SCN^-] = 0.1 M:

x + β1 * x * 0.1 + β1 β2 x (0.1)^2 + β1 β2 β3 x (0.1)^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x (0.1)^4 = 1e-2.

We can factor out x:

x [1 + β1 (0.1) + β1 β2 (0.1)^2 + β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2.

So let's compute all those terms.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each term:

Term 1: 1

Term 2: β1 * 0.1 =9 * 0.1=0.9

Term3: β1 β2 (0.1)^2 =9*40*(0.01)=360 *0.01=3.6

Term4: β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3=9*40*63*(0.001). Let's compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4=9*40*63*16*(0.0001). Let's compute step by step.

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16= 362880; 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Wait, but wait: (0.1)^4 is 0.0001. So term5 is 9*40*63*16 * 0.0001.

Compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16= 362880; 362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Wait, that seems high. Let me make sure:

9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880. Then 362880 *0.0001 =36.288.

So now summing all terms:

Term1:1

Term2:0.9 → sum so far 1.9

Term3:3.6 → sum 5.5

Term4:22.68 → sum 28.18

Term5:36.288 → sum 64.468.

So the sum of the terms is 64.468.

So x * 64.468 =1e-2 → x= (1e-2)/64.468 ≈ 0.00015516 M.

So x is approximately 1.5516e-4 M.

Now, the concentration of each species is:

[Co²+] = x ≈ 1.5516e-4 M.

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-] =9 * 1.5516e-4 *0.1=9 *1.5516e-5 =1.3964e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2 =9*40 *1.5516e-4 *0.01.

Wait, alternatively, using the earlier expression, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2.

Which is 9 *40 *1.5516e-4 *0.01.

Compute 9*40=360; 360 *1.5516e-4=0.0558576; multiply by 0.01 → 0.000558576 M.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each species' concentration using the x we found.

Alternatively, the concentration of each complex can be expressed as:

[Co²+] = x.

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-] =9 * x *0.1 =0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-] =40 * (0.9 x) *0.1 =40 *0.09 x =3.6 x.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Each complex's concentration is determined by the stepwise formation. So:

[Co(SCN)_1]^+ = β1 [Co²+][SCN^-] =9 *x *0.1 =0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = β2 [Co(SCN)_1]^+ [SCN^-] =40 *0.9x *0.1 =40 *0.09x =3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ [SCN^-] =63 *3.6 x *0.1=63 *0.36 x=22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 [Co(SCN)_3]^- [SCN^-] =16 *22.68 x *0.1=16 *2.268 x=36.288 x.

Wait, but wait, I think that's correct. So now, the sum of all species is x +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = total x*(1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) = x*(64.868).

But earlier I calculated the sum as 64.468. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation error earlier.

Wait, let me recompute the sum:

Term1:1

Term2:0.9 → total 1.9

Term3:3.6 → total 5.5

Term4:22.68 → total 28.18

Term5:36.288 → total 64.468.

Wait, but when I compute the sum of the coefficients from the complexes, it's 1 (free Co²+) +0.9 ([CoSCN]^+) +3.6 ([Co(SCN)_2]^2+) +22.68 ([Co(SCN)_3]^-) +36.288 ([Co(SCN)_4]^2-).

Adding them: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468. So same as before.

So the sum is 64.468 x=1e-2 → x≈1.5516e-4 M.

So now, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is 3.6 x =3.6 *1.5516e-4 ≈5.58576e-5 M.

Wait, that's 5.58576e-5 M. But wait, the sum of all Co species is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M.

But wait, let me compute each species:

[Co²+] =1.5516e-4 M.

[CoSCN]^+ =0.9 *1.5516e-4 ≈1.3964e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ =3.6 *1.5516e-4 ≈5.586e-5 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =22.68 *1.5516e-4 ≈3.523e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- =36.288 *1.5516e-4 ≈5.641e-3 M.

Let me sum these to check:

1.5516e-4 ≈0.00015516

1.3964e-4 ≈0.00013964 → sum so far: 0.0002948.

5.586e-5 ≈0.00005586 → sum: 0.00035066.

3.523e-3 ≈0.003523 → sum: 0.00387366.

5.641e-3 ≈0.005641 → total: 0.00951466.

Wait, but the total should be 0.01 M. Hmm, but I got approximately 0.009515 M. Which is about 0.9515 of 0.01. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 36.288 *1.5516e-4.

Let me compute 36.288e-4 *1.5516e-4 → Wait, no, 36.288 is multiplied by x=1.5516e-4.

So 36.288 *1.5516e-4 = ?

1.5516e-4 is 0.00015516.

36.288 *0.00015516 = ?

Calculate 36.288 *0.00015516:

Let me do 36 *0.00015516 =5.58576e-4.

0.288 *0.00015516 ≈0.0000446.

So total ≈5.58576e-4 +0.0000446=5.630e-4 M.

So [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is approximately 5.63e-4 M.

Sum all again:

[Co²+]:1.5516e-4 ≈0.00015516

[CoSCN]^+:1.3964e-4≈0.00013964 → sum:0.0002948.

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ :5.586e-5≈0.00005586 → sum:0.00035066.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- :3.523e-3 ≈0.003523 → sum:0.00387366.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- :5.63e-4 ≈0.000563 → sum: 0.00443666.

Wait, wait, that's only about 0.00443666 M, but the total should be 0.01 M. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I approached the problem. Let me rethink.

Alternative approach: The distribution of Co species can be modeled using the formation constants. The formula for each species is based on the stepwise formation.

Let me denote the concentrations as follows:

[Co²+] = x.

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN^-] =9 x (0.1) =0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ =β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN^-] =40 *0.9 x *0.1=3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =β3 * [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ * [SCN^-] =63 *3.6 x *0.1=22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- =β4 * [Co(SCN)_3]^- * [SCN^-] =16 *22.68 x *0.1=36.288 x.

So the total Co concentration is x (free) +0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = x*(1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) → x*(64.868).

So x = 1e-2 /64.868 ≈0.00015414 M.

So [Co²+]= x ≈1.5414e-4 M.

[CoSCN]^+ =0.9 x ≈1.3872e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ =3.6 x ≈5.549e-5 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =22.68 x ≈3.508e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- =36.288 x ≈5.597e-3 M.

Now, let's sum these:

1.5414e-4 +1.3872e-4 = 2.9286e-4.

+5.549e-5 → 3.4835e-4.

+3.508e-3 → 3.8563e-3.

+5.597e-3 →9.453e-3.

Hmm, that's 0.009453 M, which is less than 0.01 M. So something's wrong. I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each β is the overall stability constant, not the stepwise. So, [CoSCN]^+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ has β2=40, [Co(SCN)_3]^- has β3=63, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- has β4=16.

In that case, the expression would be different. Because the overall β for each complex is given.

In that case, the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} is given by [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n / (1 + other terms), but it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to express each species' concentration relative to the free Co²+.

The general formula for each species is [Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn) [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n / (1 + sum of all terms).

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Another approach is to use the distribution equation.

The fraction of each species is given by (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n).

So for each n, the fraction f_n is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n) / denominator, where the denominator is the sum of all terms from n=0 to n=4.

Wait, but wait, each β is the stepwise formation constant. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the first n β's.

So for [CoSCN]^+, K1=β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, K2=β1*β2=9*40=360.

For [Co(SCN)_3]^- , K3=β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=2520.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, K4=β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, but then the denominator would be 1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4.

But [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

Let me compute each term:

K1 [SCN^-] =360 *0.1=36? No, wait, K1 is for [CoSCN]^+ which is β1=9.

Wait, no. Let me correct this. Because each K for the nth complex is the product up to βn. So:

K1 = β1 =9.

K2 = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

K3= β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=2520.

K4= β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So the denominator is 1 + (K1 [SCN^-]) + (K2 [SCN^-]^2) + (K3 [SCN^-]^3) + (K4 [SCN^-]^4).

Wait, no. Wait, the denominator is 1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4.

So substituting [SCN^-]=0.1 M:

Term1:1.

Term2: K1 * (0.1) =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term3: K2*(0.1)^2 =360*(0.01)=3.6.

Term4: K3*(0.1)^3=2520*(0.001)=2.52.

Term5: K4*(0.1)^4=362880*(0.0001)=36.288.

Summing these terms:1 +0.9 =1.9; +3.6=5.5; +2.52=8.02; +36.288=44.308.

So denominator=44.308.

Now, the fraction for each complex is (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / denominator.

Wait, no. Wait, the fraction for [Co(SCN)_n] is (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / denominator.

So for [Co²+], the fraction is 1/44.308 ≈0.02257.

For [CoSCN]^+, fraction is (K1 [SCN^-])/denominator = (9 *0.1)/44.308 =0.9/44.308 ≈0.0203.

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ fraction: (K2 [SCN^-]^2)/denominator = (360 *0.01)/44.308 =3.6 /44.308 ≈0.0813.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- fraction: (K3 [SCN^-]^3)/denominator= (2520 * 0.001)/44.308=2.52 /44.308≈0.05685.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- fraction: (K4 [SCN^-]^4)/denominator= (362880 *0.0001)/44.308=36.288 /44.308≈0.8186.

Wait, but let's check the sum of fractions: 0.02257 +0.0203 +0.0813 +0.05685 +0.8186 ≈0.9996, which is approximately 1. So that works.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which has a fraction of approximately 0.0813, which is 8.13%. But that's not among the options. The options are 42.3, 25.6, 38.1, 16.9.

Hmm, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions. Let me recheck.

Wait, the denominator is 44.308. Let me compute each fraction again.

[Co²+] fraction =1 /44.308 ≈0.02257 → 2.257%.

[CoSCN]^+ fraction= (K1*[SCN]) / denominator = (9 *0.1)/44.308=0.9/44.308≈0.0203 → 2.03%.

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+ fraction = (K2*(0.1)^2)/44.308= (360 *0.01)/44.308=3.6/44.308≈0.0813 →8.13%.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- fraction= (K3*(0.1)^3)/44.308= (2520 *0.001)/44.308=2.52/44.308≈0.05685 →5.685%.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- fraction= (362880 *0.1^4)/44.308= (362880 *0.0001)/44.308=36.288/44.308≈0.8186 →81.86%.

Wait, but the sum is 2.257 +2.03 +8.13 +5.685 +81.86≈99.96%. Close to 100%, which is correct.

But the problem asks for the percentage of dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ →8.13%. That's not matching any of the options given. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato as [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, which is the tetra complex. But in that case, the percentage would be around 81.86%, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps I got the definition of the β's wrong. Maybe each β is the overall stability constant for the nth complex, not the stepwise.

So for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ β2=40, [Co(SCN)_3]^- β3=63, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- β4=16.

In that case, the formation constants are as given, not as stepwise.

So the fraction of each species is (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum from n=0 to 4 of βn [SCN^-]^n).

Wait, but n=0 is [Co²+], which has β0=1? Maybe.

So the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4.

Wait, substituting [SCN^-]=0.1 M and β values:

Denominator =1 +9*(0.1) +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

Term1:1.

Term2:9*0.1=0.9 → sum=1.9.

Term3:40*(0.01)=0.4 → sum=2.3.

Term4:63*(0.001)=0.063 → sum=2.363.

Term5:16*(0.0001)=0.0016 → sum=2.3646.

So denominator=2.3646.

Now, the fraction of each species is:

[Co²+]:1/2.3646≈0.4225 →42.25%.

[CoSCN]^+: (9 *0.1)/2.3646=0.9/2.3646≈0.3807 →38.07%.

[Co(SCN)_2]^2+: (40*(0.1)^2)/2.3646= (40*0.01)/2.3646=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%.

[Co(SCN)_3]^-: (63*(0.1)^3)/2.3646=63*0.001/2.3646=0.063/2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2-: (16*(0.1)^4)/2.3646=16*0.0001/2.3646=0.0016/2.3646≈0.000677 →0.0677%.

Adding all fractions:42.25 +38.07=80.32 → +16.9=97.22 → +2.66=99.88 → +0.0677=99.9477%. Close enough.

So the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is about 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. If the blue one is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, then the answer is 16.9%, which is option D. But wait, option D is 16.9%.

But earlier, when considering stepwise β's, the fraction was around 8%, but that approach didn't match any options. So perhaps the initial assumption that the given β's are overall stability constants is correct. Hence, the correct answer would be 16.9%, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ (10⁻² M) and SCN⁻ (0.1 M). The stability constants are interpreted as overall stability constants for the respective complexes.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Species**:  
   The fraction of each cobalt species is determined by the formula:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{\text{Denominator}}
   \]  
   where the denominator is the sum of all terms:  
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4
   \]  
   Substituting \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), the denominator is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

2. **Fractions of All Species**:  
   Using the denominator, the fraction of each species is:  
   - Free Co²⁺:  
     \[
     f_{\text{Co}^{2+}} = \frac{1}{2.3646} \approx 0.4225 \, (42.25\%)
     \]  
   - [CoSCN]⁺:  
     \[
     f_{\text{[CoSCN]}^+} = \frac{\beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{9(0.1)}{2.3646} \approx 0.3807 \, (38.07\%)
     \]  
   - [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺:  
     \[
     f_{\text{[Co(SCN)]}_2^{2+}} = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{40(0.1)^2}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, (16.9\%)
     \]  
   - [Co(SCN)₃]⁻:  
     \[
     f_{\text{[Co(SCN)]}_3^-} = \frac{\beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{63(0.1)^3}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \, (2.66\%)
     \]  
   - [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻:  
     \[
     f_{\text{[Co(SCN)]}_4^{2-}} = \frac{\beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{16(0.1)^4}{2.3646} \approx 0.000677 \, (0.0677\%)
     \]

3. **Verification**:  
   The sum of all fractions is approximately 100%, confirming the calculations are consistent.

4. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**:  
   The blue dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, corresponds to the fraction \(f_{\text{[Co(SCN)]}_2^{2+}} \approx 16.9\%\).

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
