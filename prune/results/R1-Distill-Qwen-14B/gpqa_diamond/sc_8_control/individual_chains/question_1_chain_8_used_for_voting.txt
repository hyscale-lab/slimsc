Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It's about the relationship between the energy (or more accurately, the energy uncertainty) and the lifetime (or time uncertainty) of a state. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So the uncertainty in energy is related to the lifetime of the state. A longer lifetime means a smaller energy uncertainty because ΔE would be approximately ħ divided by the lifetime. So the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than the sum of their individual energy uncertainties for us to clearly distinguish them, right?

Let me calculate the energy uncertainty for each state. The reduced Planck constant ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, the options are given in electron volts (eV), so maybe I should convert everything into eV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So let's compute the energy uncertainty for each state.

First for E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1
So ħ is about 1e-34 J·s, so 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25 J. Now convert that to eV.

1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so ΔE1 = (1e-25 J) / (1.6e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.25e-7 eV. Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculation. 

Wait, 1e-25 J divided by 1.6e-19 J/eV is (1e-25)/(1.6e-19) ) eV. Let's compute that: 1/(1.6)=0.625, and 1e-25 / 1e-19 is 1e-6. So 0.625e-6 eV, which is 6.25e-7 eV. So about 6.25e-7 eV.

Next, for E2, the lifetime is τ2 = 1e-8 seconds.

ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = 1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1e-26 / 1.6e-19 = (1/1.6) * 1e-7 ≈ 0.625e-7 eV, which is 6.25e-8 eV.

Wait, no. Wait, 1e-26 J divided by 1.6e-19 J/eV is 1e-26 / 1.6e-19 = (1/1.6)*1e-7 = 0.625e-7 eV. So approximately 6.25e-8 eV.

Wait, but I'm getting ΔE1 as 6.25e-7 eV and ΔE2 as 6.25e-8 eV.

But wait, the energy difference between E2 and E1 would be E2 - E1, assuming E2 is higher. The question is about the energy difference that allows clear resolution. So to clearly distinguish them, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because if the difference is smaller than that, the states might overlap due to the uncertainties.

Wait, I'm not sure. I think the condition for distinguishability is that the energy difference is greater than the uncertainty in the energy measurements for each state. So the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties, because each state has its own uncertainty.

Alternatively, it might be the maximum of the two uncertainties, but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because the energy difference ΔE_total would be |E2 - E1|. For this to be resolved, |E2 - E1| should be greater than the sum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because each state has its own uncertainty, and the combined uncertainty would be the sum.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy uncertainty for E1 is ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1), and for E2 it's ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2). So if the actual energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1, then for them to be distinguishable, ΔE should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if ΔE is less than that, the two states' energy ranges might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

So ΔE should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). Let's compute that.

ΔE_total = (6.25e-7 eV) + (6.25e-8 eV) = 6.875e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than approximately 6.875e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → way less than 6.8e-7.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller, no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 = 0.0001, which is way larger than 6.875e-7. Because 6.875e-7 is 0.0000006875 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is larger.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 6.875e-7.

So the correct option must be one where the energy difference is larger than 6.875e-7 eV. So let's look at the options.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. Wait, but 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 times larger than 1e-6 eV. Wait, 6.875e-7 is 0.0000006875 eV. Which is 6.875e-7 eV.

So 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.875e-7. So this would satisfy the condition.

Wait, but wait, the calculation I did for ΔE1 was 6.25e-7 eV, and ΔE2 was 6.25e-8 eV. So sum is 6.875e-7 eV. The energy difference needs to be larger than that sum to be distinguishable.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is (1e-4)/(6.875e-7) ≈ approx 145 times larger than the required minimum. So that's definitely sufficient.

Looking at the other options, option A and B are both way too small. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 1/68th of the required sum. So that's not enough.

So the only option that meets the condition is option C: 1e-4 eV.

To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of their energy uncertainties, which are determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:  
\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau},
\]
where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)) and \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state. The energy uncertainty is converted to electron volts (eV) using \( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

### Step 1: Calculate energy uncertainties
For the first state with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to eV:
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]
Converting to eV:
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Total energy uncertainty
The total energy uncertainty for distinguishing the two states is the sum of their individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Let us compare the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} = 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for clear distinguishability is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.
