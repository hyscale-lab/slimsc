Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking for the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out what the starting material is and what transformations are needed to reach the target. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond connected to another carbon) attached. So it's like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH or cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2? Wait, no. Ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH group attached? Wait, no, wait. Ethynyl is the group where one carbon is triple-bonded to another, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So it's CH2-C≡CH attached to a cyclohexane ring. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a C≡C-CH3 group? Wait no, ethynyl is -C≡CH so it's cyclohexane with a -CH2-C≡CH group? Wait no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane where one of the CH2 groups is replaced by a -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Wait, ethynyl is the group -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a substituent where one of the hydrogen is replaced by -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached directly to the ring. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, that's ethenyl. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so the cyclohexane is connected to a carbon that is triple-bonded to another carbon. So the structure is cyclohexane with a group like CH2-C≡CH? No, that's if it's a propynyl group. Wait, no—ethynyl is just -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane attached to a carbon which is triple-bonded to another carbon. So it's cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3? No, because ethynyl is -C≡CH. So it's just a single carbon attached to the ring, triple bonded to another carbon. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Ethynyl is -C≡CH. So when it's attached to cyclohexane, it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait. Wait, ethynyl group is directly attached. So for example, if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH substituent. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent where the ring is directly attached to the triple bond. So it's cyclohexane-C≡CH. Wait, that's possible. So the starting material is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached.

Now, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let's parse that name. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. The substituent is at position 1, which is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So the substituent is a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) attached to a cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is cyclohexyl-CH2-OH attached to the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the structure would be: cyclohexane ring with a CHO group at position 1, and another substituent which is a CH2OH group attached to a cyclohexyl group. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the cyclohexane ring has a CH2 group attached, which then has a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane ring. Hmm, not sure, but maybe I should think about the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to this target.

So, ethynylcyclohexane to target. Let me think about possible reactions. The target has two rings, so perhaps some cyclopropane-opening or some kind of coupling. Alternatively, perhaps some kind of alkylation or oxidation.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a triple bond attached to a cyclohexane. Reactions on triple bonds can include reductions, oxidations, or additions. Let me think about the possible steps.

First, perhaps we need to reduce the triple bond. If we reduce ethynylcyclohexane, we can get either an alkene or an alkane, depending on the conditions. For example, using H2 and a catalyst like Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, but wait, triple bond hydrogenation with H2 and Pd might give cis or trans addition. Wait, no, hydrogenating a triple bond (ethynyl) to a single bond would give a single bond. So from -C≡CH, hydrogenation would give -CH2CH2-. Wait, but wait: the triple bond is between two carbons. If ethynyl is -C≡CH, then hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules. Let's see, H2 and Pd would add H across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So -C≡CH becomes -CH2-CH2-? No, that's not right. Wait, when you hydrogenate a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and a catalyst like Lindlar's, you get cis addition, but with a different catalyst, you might get trans. But regardless, the triple bond (alkyne) would become a single bond, so the ethynyl group (-C≡CH) becomes a CH2CH3 group? No, wait. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. When you hydrogenate that, you add two H2's. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, and you get -CH2-CH3. So the triple bond is converted into a single bond, making a CH2CH3 group. So ethynylcyclohexane would, upon hydrogenation, become cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group attached. So that's cyclohexane-CH2CH3.

But looking at the target, I don't see a CH2CH3 group. Hmm. So perhaps that's not the first step. Alternatively, the triple bond could be used in another reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that the triple bond undergoes a hydration reaction. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 (Hg(OH)2) in water, which is a hydration of the alkyne. So the triple bond would become a ketone. Wait, no, hydration of an alkyne under certain conditions can give either a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the alkyne structure. Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne (C≡CH). Hydration of a terminal alkyne with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O would typically give a ketone? Or an aldehyde? Wait, no, a terminal alkyne hydration would give a ketone if the triple bond is between two carbons, but in ethynylcyclohexane, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH. So perhaps the hydration would give a ketone. Let me think: If the triple bond is R-C≡CH, then hydration would add an OH to the triple bond, giving R-CH2-COOH? Wait, no. Wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne (HC≡CR) typically yields an enol, which tautomerizes to a ketone. Wait, no, wait: for R-C≡CH, when you hydrate it, it would add water across the triple bond, giving R-CH(OH)CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the hydration would give R-CH2-COH, which would tautomerize to a ketone. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's think about the reaction mechanism. Hydration of a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH) with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (and H2O) would produce a ketone. Because the triple bond is between R and CH. So the addition of water across would give R-C(OH)-CH3, which is an enol. Then, under acidic conditions, it would tautomerize to a ketone. So the product would be R-CO-CH3, which is a ketone. So in ethynylcyclohexane (R = cyclohexyl), the product would be cyclohexylacetone (cyclohexyl-C(O)-CH3). But wait, the target molecule is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So that suggests that perhaps the first step is to convert the triple bond into a carbonyl group, but maybe an aldehyde group instead of a ketone.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Another approach is to consider the possible reactions in the options and see what each option's steps would do.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl, which is an alkylating agent. So the first step could be an alkylation. H2 and Pd would be hydrogenation. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination or epoxide opening. Then the last step is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which sounds like the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation or perhaps an oxidation. Alternatively, HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O is a typical condition for hydration of an alkyne.

Wait, but if the first step is alkylation with methyl chloride and NaNH2, perhaps that's an alkylation of a strong base. Maybe that's forming a quaternary ammonium salt or something. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkyne alkylation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the target structure.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So there's a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached at position 1. Then, attached to that same carbon (or perhaps another position) is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CHO with a substituent that's -CH2-OH attached to a cyclohexyl group. Or perhaps it's -CH(OH)-cyclohexane? Hmm, the name is a bit unclear, but I think it's a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is in turn attached to the main cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the main part is the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group.

So, perhaps the starting material ethynylcyclohexane can undergo some kind of cyclopropanation or another reaction to form the rings needed.

Wait, another approach: think about how to form the rings in the target. The target has two cyclohexane rings. The starting material has one cyclohexane. So perhaps the other cyclohexane comes via some kind of cyclopropanation or through a ring-opening.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is used to form a new ring via some kind of addition or cycloaddition.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond can be used in a Grignard reaction or some kind of addition. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted to a carbonyl group, then used in some aldehyde chemistry.

Wait, another thought: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps we need to form a new ring via a ring-opening of an epoxide or via some kind of cyclopropane.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reagents in each option and what they would do.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps deprotonating something. Methyl chloride would then alkylate. So first step would be alkylation. Then H2 and Pd would hydrogenate. O3 is ozone for ozonolysis. (CH3)2S is a reductive workup, perhaps giving aldehydes or ketones. Then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxide opening.

Hmm, perhaps this sequence would do the following: start with ethynylcyclohexane, alkylate to add a methyl group, hydrogenate the triple bond, ozonolyse to break a double bond, then treat with Ba(OH)2.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to map this.

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base, deprotonates something. Methyl chloride would methylate. But where would the proton be? Maybe the triple bond is acidic. The alkyne proton is more acidic than alkanes, but less than alkenes. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated by NaNH2, giving a cyclohexyl acetylide. Then, methyl chloride would alkylate the acetylide, adding a methyl group. Wait, but acetylides are strong bases. So the alkyne (ethynylcyclohexane) would react with NaNH2 to form the acetylide ion, which would then react with CH3Cl to form cyclohexylacetylide with a methyl group.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is RC≡CH, adding a methyl via CH3Cl would give R-C≡C-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, the acetylide would attack CH3Cl, giving R-C≡C-CH3. So the product would be R-C≡C-CH3, which is 1-methylethynylcyclohexane. But not sure if that's the right direction.

Then step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So hydrogenation of the triple bond. The product would be R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane with a propyl group: cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a single bond. So now the molecule is cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached, so maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the triple bond is converted into a double bond. Wait no, step 2 is hydrogenation, which would add H2 across the triple bond, making a single bond.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right approach. Let me think about another option.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liquid NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

NaNH2 and methanol? So perhaps deprotonation followed by alkylation. Then Li and liquid NH3 is a Birch reduction condition, which reduces aromatic rings, but maybe it's for some other purpose. Ozone would break double bonds into carbonyls. Then ammonium hydroxide would do something.

Alternatively, NaNH2 could deprotonate an alkyne, making an acetylide, which is then treated with methanol. Hmm, but methanol is a poor electrophile for alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 and methanol is for a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering the possible functional groups in the target. The target has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

So how to get a formyl group? That could come from oxidation of a primary alcohol or perhaps from some kind of aldehyde formation reaction. Alternatively, oxidation of a benzylic position.

But wait, the target also has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. Perhaps that comes from some kind of epoxide opening or from a Grignard reaction followed by hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material's triple bond is involved in forming a ring, creating the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is used in a cyclopropanation. Using a Simmons-Smith reaction, which is CH2I2 and Zn/Cu, but that's not in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl, then undergoes some kind of addition.

Wait, another idea: the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane with a formyl group. So perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation or hydration.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C's last step is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is often used in epoxide ring-opening, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's used for elimination reactions, like in the formation of epoxides or for creating carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is used in a Dieckmann condensation, but that's for cyclic ketones.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider each option's steps and see which sequence could lead to the target.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: maybe alkylation of the alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: hydration of the double bond to a carbonyl. So after step 4, you'd have a ketone or aldehyde.

But the target has a formyl group. So if step 4 hydrates a double bond adjacent to the cyclohexane, perhaps that would form a carbonyl. Let's see.

But let's outline the steps:

Step 1: Ethynylcyclohexane → treated with NaNH2 and CH3Cl → forms R-C≡C-CH3 (propargylcyclohexane?).

Step 2: Hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propylcyclohexane?).

Step 3: Ba(OH)2 would probably induce elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. So propylcyclohexane → cyclohexene with a longer chain?

Wait, wait. If after step 2, we have cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3, then elimination with a strong base like Ba(OH)2 could abstract a beta hydrogen, forming a double bond. So cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH3 → cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH2- after elimination would lose H2O, forming cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH2 → wait, maybe more accurately, forming a double bond. So perhaps the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2CH2 with a double bond? No, perhaps it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2CH2 → wait, no, elimination would form a double bond between carbons. So, perhaps cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3 after elimination would form cyclohexane-CH2-CH2- (but that doesn't make sense). Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide formation, but I'm not certain.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3/H2O.

4. NH4OH.

So step 1: alkylation with ethyl chloride, making R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonating something, or for a Birch reduction which would reduce aromatic rings, but I don't see any in the starting material.

Step 3: Ozone followed by workup with H2O. Ozone would break double bonds into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH would do what? Maybe hydrolysis.

But I'm not sure how this would lead to the target.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base, methanol is a weak acid. Maybe deprotonation and then quenching with methanol. Alternatively, perhaps it's for a Grignard-like reaction, but with methanol, which would form an ether. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the target molecule. It has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps the triple bond is oxidized to a carbonyl group. But how?

In the target molecule, there's also a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So maybe that comes from a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a cyclohexylmethyl group. Then, perhaps through some epoxidation and ring-opening, we can form the necessary substituents.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the problem in terms of the possible reactions each step in the options would do.

Wait, perhaps the target's structure involves a cyclohexyl group and a formyl group, so maybe the ethynyl group is used to form a new ring.

Wait, another idea: The starting material has a triple bond, which can be converted into a carbonyl group via hydration (step 4 in option A and some other options). So perhaps step 4 is where the formyl group comes from.

But let's think about option C's steps:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis would break any double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if step 3 is ozonolysis, that implies there's a double bond after step 2.

Wait, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which would hydrogenate a triple bond to a single bond, so after step 2, there's a single bond. So ozonolysis in step 3 wouldn't have anything to act on. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is R-C≡CH.

Option C:

Step 1: Alkylation with methyl chloride and NaNH2 → R-C≡C-CH3 (propargylcyclohexane).

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenates the triple bond to single bond → R-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propylcyclohexane).

Step 3: Ozonolysis would require a double bond, but after step 2, there's a single bond. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe after step 2, the molecule has a double bond from some other process. Alternatively, perhaps another reaction occurs in step 2.

Wait, maybe step 2 is a hydrogenation that only partially reduces the triple bond, but that's unlikely. No, triple bonds are generally hydrogenated completely to single bonds.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the target again. It has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So that hydroxymethyl group must come from some kind of substitution or addition.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and another substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from an epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, but how would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the starting material's triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, which then undergoes some kind of addition, like a Grignard reaction, to form the cyclohexyl substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a ketone, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to outline each option's possible steps.

Option C:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Reduce triple bond to single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave a double bond, but after step 2, I don't see a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Ozonolysis wouldn't act on that. So perhaps I'm missing something. Or maybe the hydrogenation in step 2 doesn't go to completion, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a double bond in a different step. Alternatively, maybe after alkylation, the triple bond is in a different position.

Wait, another possibility: the acetylide formed in step 1 is methylated, making a longer alkyne. Then hydrogenation would produce a longer alkane. But I don't see how that would lead to the target.

Perhaps I should consider the target's structure again. The target is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent that is a cyclohexyl hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the substituent comes from a ring-opening of an epoxide, which would require the formation of an epoxide.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It's used in epoxide ring-opening, but if the epoxide is formed elsewhere, perhaps via ozonolysis and then some reaction.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence involves forming a ketone from the alkyne, then performing a conjugate addition or something to form the rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is reduced to a double bond, then further processed. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. That suggests that perhaps an epoxide was opened in a basic or acidic environment to form a diol, which could then undergo some elimination or cyclization. But I'm not sure how that would fit in.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne undergoes alkylation to form a longer alkyne.

2. Alkyne is hydrogenated to an alkane.

3. Ozonolysis breaks a double bond (but where's the double bond?), maybe from a previous step.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group, then the carbonyl is used in a Grignard reaction to form the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but that would require the alkyne to be converted into a carbonyl, which would happen via hydration (HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O).

In option C, the last step is Ba(OH)2. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which inserts an oxygen adjacent to a ketone, forming a ketone oxide (lactone if cyclic), but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could be used for elimination. For example, if there's an alcohol and a neighboring leaving group, it could eliminate to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 3 in option C, which is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, the molecule has carbonyl groups. Then, Ba(OH)2 could induce some elimination or ring formation.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the target has two rings, so perhaps the ethynyl group is used to form a new ring via some kind of cycloaddition or via a ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, and then a Grignard reagent adds to it to form a new carbon chain, which can then cyclize to form the rings.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about each reagent's function in each option.

Looking back, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group at position 1 and a substituent which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a cyclopentenone or something that can undergo a Diels-Alder reaction to form the rings. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps option C is the right one. Let's think:

Step 1: Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group, making R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: Hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond, making R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis requires a double bond. Wait, but after hydrogenation, we'd have a single bond. So maybe in step 2, the triple bond is partially hydrogenated to a double bond. But that's not common. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is dehydrogenation, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe step 2 is hydrogenation of something else. Wait, no, the starting material is an alkyne, so step 2 would hydrogenate that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond elsewhere. But I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering step 2's conditions. Let me check:

The step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That's a standard hydrogenation condition for reducing triple bonds to single bonds. So the alkyne becomes an alkane.

Step 3 in option C is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So perhaps after step 2, the molecule undergoes some reaction to form a double bond. But how?

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, perhaps Ba(OH)2 in step 3 is used for elimination, forming a double bond. So step 3 would be elimination to form an alkene. Then step 4 would be ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in option C, step 3 is ozonolysis, and step 4 is Ba(OH)2. No, that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about what each reagent does in each option and see which sequence logically leads to the target.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps the first step is to form a ketone from the alkyne, then perform some kind of reduction or oxidation to get the formyl group and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, another thought: The target's formyl group could come from the oxidation of a benzylic position. So perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a benzyl group, then oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group via hydration. Then, the carbonyl could be used in a Grignard reaction to form the rings.

Wait, but how does that fit into the options?

Looking at option C:

Step 1: Alkylation of alkyne → R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → but ozonolysis requires a double bond, which isn't present. So this doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group (perhaps via hydration with HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O).

2. Then, the carbonyl is converted into a Grignard reagent, which adds to another position, forming a new carbon chain.

3. Hydrogenation or another step forms the rings.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that includes HgSO4 and H2SO4 as the first step, except perhaps option A.

Wait, option A's last step is HgSO4 and H2SO4. So let's check option A.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2 → elimination to form a double bond, perhaps.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration of the double bond to a carbonyl.

So step 4 would create a carbonyl group. Let's see:

After step 2, we have R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Ba(OH)2 in step 3 would eliminate, perhaps forming R-CH2-CH2-CH2, but I don't see the elimination. Wait, perhaps the structure after step 2 is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a straight chain. To form a double bond, we need adjacent H's. So maybe Ba(OH)2 would dehydrate it to form R-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, but that's not possible without adjacent H's. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has branching.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's think of the possible products of each step.

In option A:

After step 1: R-C≡C-CH3.

After step 2: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

After step 3: perhaps elimination to form R-CH2-CH2-CH2 (but that's not correct). Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 in step 3 is used in a different way.

Wait, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used to form an epoxide. But that would require a double bond, which isn't present. So perhaps not.

Then, step 4 is HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O, which is the hydration conditions for a triple bond. But after step 2, the triple bond is gone.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Perhaps I should think of the target's structure again.

The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. So perhaps the formyl comes from the aldehyde group, which could be generated by oxidizing a primary alcohol.

So, perhaps one of the steps is the oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But to get the aldehyde, maybe the triple bond is first converted into a primary alcohol, then oxidized.

Wait, but how would that happen? Let me think.

If the starting material is R-C≡CH, and we reduce it to R-CH2-CH2-CH3, that's a primary alcohol only if we have a CH2CH2CH2OH group. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group (R-CO-CH3), which is a ketone. Then, perhaps a Grignard reagent adds to the ketone, forming a secondary alcohol, which can then be oxidized to a ketone again, but that's not helpful for forming an aldehyde.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the target's formyl group comes from the alkyne via a Markovnikov hydration. So, the alkyne R-C≡CH would hydrate to R-C(OH)-CH3, which tautomerizes to R-C(O)-CH3. But that's a ketone, not an aldehyde.

But the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps the starting material's triple bond is converted into an aldehyde via some other method.

Wait, maybe through a Gattermann–Koch reaction, which converts an alkyne into an aldehyde, but I'm not sure about the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is reduced to a cis-alkene, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde. But oxidation of alkenes typically gives ketones or carboxylic acids, not aldehydes, unless it's an allylic alcohol.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C.

Let me try to go through option C's steps:

1. NaNH2 and CH3Cl → alkylation of alkyne to R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → reduce triple bond to single bond → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → cleaves any double bonds, but after step 2, there's no double bond. So this doesn't make sense. Unless step 3 is acting on a different part of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, and step 3 is ozonolysis, which won't do anything. So option C is probably incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the alkyne is first alkylated, then hydrogenated, then perhaps some elimination occurs to form a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, perhaps in option C:

After step 2: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ozonolysis would require a double bond, so unless there's some previous step that forms a double bond, this doesn't make sense. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Another approach: looking for the formyl group in the target. Which option includes a step that would produce an aldehyde?

Option D's step 4 is NH4OH. NH4OH is a mild oxidizing agent sometimes used in the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes under certain conditions. So perhaps after forming a primary alcohol, treating with NH4OH would oxidize it to an aldehyde.

Hmm.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But methanol is a poor electrophile for alkylation. Alternatively, perhaps this step is for something else.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a weak acid. Perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, then treated with methanol to form an ether. But that would be R-O-CH2-O-R? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a alkyne alkylation, but I'm not certain.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. This is a condition for the Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings. But the starting material doesn't have any aromatic rings, so perhaps it's for a different purpose, like deprotonating or forming a Grignard-like reagent.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozone cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So perhaps step 3 is acting on a double bond formed in step 2.

Wait, but step 2 is Li in NH3. Li is a strong reducing agent, but perhaps it's for deprotonating a compound to form a strong base, which could then eliminate to form a double bond.

So perhaps:

Step 1: Alkyne is treated with NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps forms an ether or adds a methyl group.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3 → deprotonates to form a strong base, which eliminates to form a double bond.

Step 3: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH → perhaps hydrolysis of some kind, maybe to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → deprotonate the alkyne to form acetylide, then quench with methanol to form R-C≡C-OCH3. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is forming a Grignard-like reagent, which then reacts in step 2.

But I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should try to think of each option's possible end product.

The target has a formyl and a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group (like a ketone), then a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a new carbon chain which can then be oxidized to form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps that comes from a substitution reaction, where the hydroxyl group is introduced via epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, if we have an epoxide, treating it with a strong base like Ba(OH)2 could open the epoxide to form a diol, which could then cyclize to form the hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane.

But how would the epoxide form?

Perhaps via oxidation of an alkene. Ozonolysis would break the alkene into carbonyl groups, but Ba(OH)2 might not be the right reagent for that.

Hmm. I'm really stuck on this. Maybe I should look for the option that includes both reduction and oxidation steps to form the necessary groups.

Wait, option C's steps:

1. Alkylation → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond.

So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Option D's steps:

Step 4 is NH4OH, which could be for oxidizing a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps:

- Step 1: Alkyne is converted into something else.

- Step 2: Li in NH3 → maybe forms a Grignard-like reagent.

- Step 3: Ozonolysis forms carbonyl groups.

- Step 4: NH4OH oxidizes a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Another thought: The target has a formyl group which is a CHO, so perhaps one of the steps is an oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. NH4OH (option D's step 4) can do that under certain conditions.

So, putting this together, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to form a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Oxidation to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not entirely sure.

After considering all this, I think option C is the correct sequence. Let me try to outline it again:

Option C:

1. Alkylation of alkyne → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenation → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond; perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, and Ba(OH)2 in step 3 is used to eliminate H2O, forming a double bond. Then, step 4 would be ozonolysis, which would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. But in option C, step 3 is ozonolysis, not Ba(OH)2. Oh wait, no. Let me check:

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, no. I think I got the steps wrong earlier. Let me recheck.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkylation of alkyne → R-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozone cleavage. But after step 2, the molecule has a single bond, so perhaps there's a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which upon ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, the correct sequence probably involves alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and then Ba(OH)2 or another reagent to form the necessary groups.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the target has a formyl group, which is often formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, another angle: The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, which could come from a diol formed via ozonolysis. So perhaps the molecule after ozonolysis has two carbonyl groups, which are then reduced to alcohols, and then one is oxidized to aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

After considering all this, I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Likely alkylates the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: Could induce elimination to form a double bond.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration of the double bond to form a carbonyl group.

This sequence could potentially form a carbonyl group, but it does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group or the formyl group is introduced.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely a Birch reduction, but the starting material lacks aromaticity.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis would cleave double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Could hydrolyze intermediates, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.

This option does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-CH₃.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present after step 2, making this step unclear.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or epoxide formation, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target.

While steps 1 and 2 are plausible, the role of ozonolysis in step 3 is ambiguous, and the sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxymethyl or formyl group.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Could deprotonate the alkyne and form an ether or other intermediate.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely deprotonates to form a strong base or initiate a reduction.
3. **O₃/(CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis would cleave double bonds, but no double bond is present after step 2.
4. **NH₄OH**: Could oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

This sequence is unclear, as the steps do not logically lead to the formation of the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible sequence, as it involves alkylation, hydrogenation, and subsequent steps that could potentially lead to the target molecule. However, the exact role of ozonolysis in step 3 remains ambiguous. Despite this, Option C aligns most closely with the transformations needed to form the hydroxymethyl and formyl groups.

**Answer: C**
