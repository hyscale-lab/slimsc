Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me go through it carefully.

Hmm, the question is about a reaction involving substance X. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. They mention the melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So, B is probably a solid that melts just above freezing, maybe like ice? Or another substance with a similar melting point. Wait, ice's melting point is 273 K, which is 0 degrees C, so 277 is a bit higher. Maybe something else. Or perhaps B is another compound, but let me not jump ahead.

The gas W has molecules where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. That's interesting. For a molecule, each atom contributes. But wait, wait—wait, the molecule as a whole has same number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, if the molecule is H₂O, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons? Wait no, H₂O has H (each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons would be 2*1 + 8 = 10. Neutrons would be 2*0 +8 =8. So 10≠8, no. Not that.

Another option: CO₂. Let's see, C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (since it's the most common isotope, but wait, maybe it's another isotope. But assuming average, but no, the problem says W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So each atom in the molecule contributes to both.

Wait, perhaps the gas is something like NH3? Let's see: each N has 7 protons, each H has 1. So total protons in NH3: 7 + 3*1=10. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (since N is usually ^14N, which has 7 protons and 7 neutrons). So each N contributes 7, each H 0. So total neutrons: 7 + 0=7. So 10 and 7, not same. Hmm.

Alternatively, what about CO? Let's see. Each C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons:14. Each C has 6 neutrons (since ^12C has 6), O has 8? Wait, O is usually ^16O, which has 8 neutrons. So total neutrons:6 +8=14. Oh, that works! So CO would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So gas W could be CO (carbon monoxide). Alternatively, maybe another molecule.

Wait, but also, another possibility: H₂O. Let me recalculate. H has 1 proton, so H2O would have 2*1 +8=10 protons. Neutrons would be 2*0 +8=8. No, doesn't match. How about CH4? C has 6 p, each H 1. Total protons:6+4=10. Neutrons: C has 6, each H 0. So 6. Doesn't work. Hmm.

Another option: maybe O₂? Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 p, 16 n. That's a match. So gas W could be O₂, but then what reaction produces O₂? Or maybe another diatomic gas.

Wait, another idea: maybe it's CO₂. Let's check. Each C has 6 p, 6 n (assuming ^12C), O has 8p, 8n (assuming ^16O). So CO₂ would have (6 + 2*8) =22 p, and (6 + 2*8)=22 n. So yes, 22 each. So W could be CO₂. But where does CO₂ come from? Maybe a carbonate reacting, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is N₂. Each N has 7 p and 7 n. So N₂ has 14 p and 14 n. So that's another possibility. But how would that fit into the reaction?

Wait, but the reaction is X reacting with Y to produce W. Let me think. What's Y? It's a liquid. Common liquids include water, maybe alcohol, but more likely something like water or oil. Wait, the reaction is violent, which makes me think of something reactive, like a metal reacting with acid. So perhaps X is a metal, and Y is an acid, like HCl or H2SO4.

Wait, but let's think. If X is a metal, reacting with an acid (Y) would produce hydrogen gas (H₂), but H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (if it's H¹), so protons=2, neutrons=0. Not equal. So W can't be H2 in that case. So perhaps another scenario.

Wait, but another possibility: if X is sodium or another metal, reacting with water (Y) would produce H2. But again, H2 doesn't fit W's condition.

Alternatively, Y could be a carbonate. Let me think about the reaction: metals reacting with carbonates produce CO2 and metal carbonates. So maybe Y is a carbonate, but that's a solid, not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. So G is likely a carbonate which, when heated, decomposes into B and CO₂. Because, for example, heating a carbonate gives a metal oxide and CO₂. So if that's the case, then B would be a metal oxide. But wait, the melting point of B is close to 277 K. Let's see, 277 K is about 4°C. So, solid B has a melting point just above 0°C. What substances have such melting points? Well, water is 0°C, but maybe another oxide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is sodium oxide (Na2O). Let's check its melting point. I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's higher than 1000°C. So that's not it. What about something like MgO? Its melting point is around 2800°C, so no. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else. Wait, maybe B is not an oxide. What else?

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. Keto acids are like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which has two carboxylic groups? Or wait, a keto acid is an acid with a keto group, like acetoacetic acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a base. When a base reacts with a keto acid, it could form a salt and water. But the product has two O atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is an alkali metal, like Na or K. When a metal reacts with a keto acid, like perhaps reacting with a carboxylic acid, you get a salt. For example, Na and acetic acid form sodium acetate. Sodium acetate has the formula CH3COONa. Let's see, the formula is C2H3O2Na. So the product has O atoms, but the question says the product has 2 O atoms. Wait, the product is the salt, but how many O's does it have? Sodium acetate has two O in the acetate ion (O is in COO^-). So maybe that fits.

Wait, but the product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So maybe the product is a metal oxide, but that doesn't make sense in that reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a metal carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y to form G, which upon heating gives B. So maybe G is a carbonate, and B is the metal oxide. So, the precipitate could be a metal carbonate. Let's say X is a metal (like Na), Y is a carbonate solution (but wait, carbonate is a solid, so perhaps Y is a carbonate in solution, like a sodium carbonate solution. But Y is a liquid, so maybe it's a liquid solution, like Na2CO3 in water.

Wait, but if X is a metal, like sodium, and Y is water, then the reaction would be 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2↑. But then gas W would be H2, which doesn't fit the earlier condition. Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate solution, perhaps X is a metal that doesn't react with water but reacts with carbonate to produce CO2. Wait, but metals usually react with acids or water, not directly with carbonates unless it's a strong enough metal.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate. Let me consider that. If X is a metal, Y is a carbonate solution, then the reaction would be: X (metal) + carbonate → metal carbonate + CO2 gas. So if X is, say, sodium, then sodium would react with carbonate? Wait, sodium is more reactive than the carbonate, so the reaction would likely occur, producing CO2 gas and sodium carbonate. So G would be sodium carbonate, which when heated doesn't decompose. Wait, sodium carbonate decomposes upon heating to sodium oxide and CO2, but I think it requires high temperatures. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says that when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a hydroxide? No, because hydroxides usually decompose into metal oxides and water upon heating. Wait, but then B would be the oxide, and water vapor. But B has a melting point close to 277 K. So if B is water ice (H2O), which has a melting point of 273 K, but the problem says 277 K. Close, but not exact.

Wait, but another angle: the initial reaction is X + Y → W↑ + G. So Y is a liquid. Let's say Y is a carbonate solution, like sodium carbonate in water. Then X is a metal that reacts with carbonate. Let's say X is sodium. But sodium reacts with water, not carbonate. So perhaps Y is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a hydroxide solution. Wait, but that's a liquid. For example, Y is NaOH, but then X could be something else. Alternatively, Y is something like ethanol, but then the reaction with X would produce what?

Wait, maybe X is calcium or another metal. Let's think: if X is calcium, Y is water. Then the reaction is Ca + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2 + H2. So W is H2, which doesn't fit. But if Y is a carbonate solution (like CaCO3 in water?), but that's not a liquid; carbonate is a solid, but in solution, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the gas W. Its molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Earlier, I thought CO could be a candidate (p=14, n=14), but I'm not sure.

Wait, what about CH4? No, that's 6p, 6n? Let's see: C is 6p, 6n (isotope ^12C), each H is 1p, 0n. So CH4 has 6+4=10p, 6+0=6n. Not equal. So no.

Another idea: maybe the gas is C2H2 (acetylene). Each C has 6p, 6n, H has 1p, 0n. So for C2H2: 2*6 + 2*1 =14p; 2*6 =12n. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider the possible isotopes. The problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is a compound where one atom is a heavier isotope.

Wait, and the substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is also a reagent. That makes me think about something like DMSO (which is a reagent) or maybe something like Grignard reagents. Hmm. Wait, Grignard reagents are RMgX, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is something like THF (tetrahydrofuran) or another solvent. Wait, but THF is a solvent, but is it a reagent? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if X is a deuterated compound. Like, for example, D2O (heavy water). But D2O would have two deuterium (H with one neutron) and an oxygen. But the problem says that X includes a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe X is H2O, but with one H replaced by D. So HDO. But how does that fit into the reaction?

Wait, but the reaction of X with Y releases gas W. If X is HDO and Y is something else, perhaps a base, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal hydride. For example, NaH. But NaH reacts with water to produce H2 gas. So W would be H2, which doesn't fit the earlier condition.

Wait, but the problem says that in the product of X with a keto acid, the product has two O atoms. So, perhaps the product is a salt with two O atoms. Maybe X is a metal and the product is a metal carbonate or something.

Wait, another angle: the problem says that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So maybe X is something like D2O (deuterium oxide), which is heavier than H2O. So X is D2O, which is a heavier isotope of H2O.

So, in that case, when X (D2O) reacts with Y (maybe a metal), perhaps it produces gas W. But I'm not sure what reaction that would be. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and the reaction is D2O + carbonate → DCO3 (but that's not a common reaction, I think).

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a hydroxide. Hmm.

Wait, but another thought: if X is NaOH, which is used in organic chemistry. But NaOH doesn't have a heavier isotope necessarily. Wait, but the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope, so perhaps one of the elements in X is a heavier isotope. For example, NaOH where the O is a heavier isotope, like O-18.

But I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but I don't think that fits.

Wait, going back to the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. So what's a solid that melts just above 0°C? Well, water (H2O) melts at 273 K (0°C). So B could be water. But if G is a hydroxide, like sodium hydroxide, heating it doesn't produce water. Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into CO2 and B (oxide), but that doesn't directly explain B's melting point.

Wait, another possibility: B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate loses water upon heating, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think of other substances with melting points around 277 K. Let me think: maybe paraffin wax? No, it's higher. Alternatively, maybe something like camphor? No, higher.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid with a low melting point. For example, gallium has a melting point around 300 K (~27°C), which is higher than 277. Mercury is a liquid at room temp. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's another oxide. Let me think: magnesium oxide's melting point is around 2800 K. Way too high. So perhaps B is not an oxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. Wait, another thought: maybe B is a form of carbon, like graphite or diamond. No, diamond's melting point is way higher. Graphite is a solid, but I don't know its exact melting point.

Wait, perhaps B is another diatomic molecule. Wait, O2 (oxygen) has a melting point of about 54 K (when it solidifies under pressure), which is way lower. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different kind of water. Wait, heavy water (D2O) has a higher melting point than H2O. H2O melts at 273 K, D2O at around 3.8°C (276.9 K). Oh! So B's melting point is very close to 277 K, which is 4°C. So if B is D2O (heavy water), its melting point is about 3.8°C, which is 276.9 K, very close to 277 K. So that fits.

So B would be D2O, heavy water. Then, how is B formed? From the decomposition of G upon heating. So, what could G be?

If G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into CO2 and an oxide. But we're getting B as a product, which is D2O. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps G is a hydrate. For example, when a hydrate is heated, it loses water (as vapor) and becomes an anhydrous salt. But in this case, B is D2O, which is heavy water. So perhaps the hydrate contains D2O.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to put the pieces together.

So, assuming B is D2O. Then, G upon heating gives D2O. So what is G?

Wait, perhaps G is a hydrate of a metal or something. For example, sodium hydroxide is NaOH, which when heated doesn't decompose into water. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: if X is a metal with a heavier isotope, like perhaps a deuterated metal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound that, when reacted with Y, produces a precipitate containing deuterium.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a deuterated acid and a base. Let me think: if Y is a deuterated acid, and X is a base, they would form a deuterated salt and release hydrogen gas (H2), but that doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of the possible elements in X. The question says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering all isotopes. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Wait, the cumulative atomic masses. So if X has elements A and B, and their lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their masses.

For example, if X has H and O, and the lightest is H (1) and the heaviest O (18), sum is 19. But that's not one of the options. So maybe X has two elements, each contributing a light and heavy isotope.

Wait, perhaps X is a molecule with two different isotopes. Let me think: for example, if X is D2O, which has D and O. D's atomic mass is about 2, O's is 16. So lightest element is D (2), heaviest O (16). Sum is 18. Not in the options.

Alternatively, if X is something like HDO, which has H, D, O. Lightest element is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Still not an option.

Hmm. Or perhaps X has more than two elements. Another possibility: X is a compound like NaOH, which has Na, O, H. But Na's lightest is 23, H is 1, O is 16. So lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24. Close to option B (25), but not quite.

Wait, another thought: the problem says the product of X reacting with a keto acid has two O atoms. So perhaps the product is a salt with two O's. For example, if X is a metal (like Na), reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid, CH3COOH) would form NaCH3COO. The formula is CH3COONa. The acetate ion is CH3COO^-, which has two O's. So the product has two O atoms. That fits.

So in this case, X would be Na. But Na's isotopes are mainly ^23Na, with a small amount of ^25Na. So if X is Na, which has a heavier isotope (like ^25Na), then X's elements are just Na. So the lightest and heaviest elements in X are both Na. So their atomic masses sum would be 23 (lightest) +25 (heaviest) =48, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, but the problem says to consider all isotopes, including multiple instances, but sum the lightest and heaviest elements present. So perhaps X has more than one element.

Another possibility: X is a compound like D2O (heavy water). So elements are D (a heavier isotope of H) and O. So the lightest element in X is H (1), and the heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Hmm, maybe X is something else. Let me think about the other clues.

The gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of another possibility. What about CF4? Carbon tetrafluoride. Let's see: C has 6p, 6n (assuming ^12C). Each F has 9p, 10n (since F is ^19F, 9p, 10n). So total for CF4: C gives 6p, 6n. Each F: 9p,10n. So four Fs: 4*9=36 p, 4*10=40n. Total p:6+36=42. Total n:6+40=46. Not equal.

Hmm. Alternatively, what about O2? Each O has 8p,8n. So O2 has 16p, 16n. That works.

So if W is O2, then Y must be a solution of a carbonate, perhaps. So X (metal) reacts with Y (carbonate solution) to produce O2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, metals reacting with carbonate usually produce CO2, not O2.

Alternatively, perhaps W is O2, but that would require a different reaction. Like electrolysis of water, but that's not a violent reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and something else. Alternatively, maybe X is a peroxide. For example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacting with water would produce O2. Let me think: 2Na2O2 + 2H2O → 4NaOH + O2↑. So W would be O2. That fits the condition since O2 has 16p and 16n. So that's a possibility.

So X would be Na2O2. Let's see. Sodium peroxide. Sodium has isotopes: ^23Na and others. The peroxide ion is O2^2-, so each O is in the peroxide form. The peroxide O is in a higher oxidation state, but in terms of isotopes, each O could be ^16O or a heavier isotope.

So the problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is Na2O2, where one of the O's is ^18O (heavier isotope). So X would have Na, O, and another O. So the elements present are Na and O.

So the lightest element in X is Na (if considering isotopes, the lightest is ^23Na? Wait no, in terms of atomic number, the lightest element is Na (11), but if considering isotopes, the lightest would be the isotope with the smallest mass. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question says to compute the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. So X's constituent elements. So if X is Na2O2, the elements are Na and O. So the lightest element is Na (atomic number 11), but wait, wait! No, O has a lower atomic number than Na. O is 8, Na is 11. So the lightest element in X is O, and the heaviest is Na.

So their atomic masses: O's lightest isotope is ^16O (16), and Na's heaviest isotope is ^25Na (25). So 16 +25 = 41. Hmm, not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps X has more than two elements. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, another possibility: the product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So, perhaps X is a molecule that when reacts with a keto acid (like a base), the product has two O's. For example, if X is NH3, reacting with a keto acid like acetic acid would form ammonium acetate. The formula is CH3COONH4. Each acetate has two O's, so the product has two O atoms. But wait, the product is CH3COONH4. So that fits.

But then, what is the initial reaction? X (NH3) reacts with Y (maybe a liquid acid) to produce W and G.

Wait, NH3 is a gas, but Y is a liquid. So perhaps Y is water. But then NH3 and H2O would form NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide), which is a solution. So that doesn’t form a precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, Y is a carbonate solution, reaction produces CO2 (W), and the precipitate is the metal carbonate.

But earlier we thought about X being Na2O2, but the sum didn't match.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the possible answers.

The options are 25, 29, 31, 35. These are sums of two atomic masses. So what two elements could sum to these numbers.

For example, 25 could be 12 (C) +13 (Al?), but Al's atomic number is 13, higher than C's. Or maybe 1 (H) +24 (Mg), but that's 25.

Wait, let me think: what's 25? Let's see, 1 (H) + 24 (Mg) =25. Or 12 (C) +13 (Al) =25. Or 15 (O) +10 (Ne) =25. Hmm, but Ne is a noble gas; not sure if that's relevant.

Another option: 1 (H) + 24 (Mg) =25. So if X has H and Mg, the lightest being H (1), heaviest Mg (24), sum 25, which is option B.

But does X have H and Mg? Let me think.

If X is MgH2 (magnesium hydride), then when it reacts with Y (maybe water), the reaction would be MgH2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + H2↑. So W would be H2. But earlier we determined W must have equal protons and neutrons, which H2 doesn't.

Hmm, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is another compound.

Wait, another approach: the product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So if the product is a salt with formula RCOO-M, where M is the cation from X. For example, if X is Mg metal, then reacting with acetic acid would form Mg acetate, Mg(CH3COO)2. The formula is Mg(C2H3O2)2. Each acetate has two O's, so the product has 4 O's. Wait, but the question says the product has two O atoms. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else. Not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a base like NaOH. Reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would form sodium acetate and water. Sodium acetate has two O's in the acetate ion. So the product is sodium acetate, which has two O's. So that fits the condition.

So if X is NaOH, which is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. NaOH is known for its various reactions, like saponification, etc.

But then, what about the initial reaction of X with Y? X is NaOH, Y is a liquid. If Y is a carbonate, perhaps. But NaOH and a carbonate would react to form a salt, water, and CO2. But wait, that's a possibility.

Wait, let's say Y is a carbonate solution, like K2CO3. Then NaOH + K2CO3 → Na2CO3 + K(OH). But that doesn't form a precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfate or another salt.

Wait, but perhaps Y is an acid. Let me think: X is NaOH, Y is an acid. Then they would neutralize each other, producing water and a salt. But that doesn't form a precipitate.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 in water. Then NaOH and CaCO3 would react: CaCO3 + 2NaOH → Na2CO3 + Ca(OH)2. Ca(OH)2 is a precipitate. So G would be Ca(OH)2.

Then, when G (Ca(OH)2) is heated, it decomposes into CaO and H2O. So B is H2O, which has a melting point of 273 K, but the problem states it's close to 277 K. Wait, that's a bit off. But perhaps B is something else. Or perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Y is a liquid like ethanol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like D2O (heavy water), which reacts with a metal to produce H2 (but deuterium gas, D2). Then, W would be D2, which has same number of protons and neutrons. D2 has 1 proton and 1 neutron each, so 2p and 2n. So that fits W's condition.

If X is D2O, then the product of X and a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid) would form a deuterated salt. For example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with D2O would form CH3COOD (deuterated acetic acid). The product would have two O's (from the COO group), which fits.

So, X is D2O. Now, the elements in X are D (a heavier isotope of H) and O. So the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. Not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps X is a compound with multiple elements. Let me think: what if X is NaOD, a mix of H and D with O. But that's stretching it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a molecule with two different isotopes. For example, CHCl3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: looking back at the options. One of the options is 31. Let's see, 31 could be 15 (O) + 16 (S), but no. Or 12 (C) +19 (K), no. Alternatively, 1 (H) +30 (Zn) =31. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but I don't see how that fits the other conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal like Li. If X is Li, Y could be water. The reaction would produce H2 gas, but as before, H2 doesn't fit W's condition. But if Li reacts with a carbonate, Y is Na2CO3 solution, then Li would react to produce CO2, making Li2CO3. So W would be CO2.

Wait, CO2 has 12p (C) + 16*2=32p from O's. Wait, no, each O has 8p, so two O's have 16p. So total p:12+16=28. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8. So 6+ (2*8)=22. So 28p and 22n. Not equal. So W can't be CO2.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think differently.

The options for the sum are 25, 29,31,35. Let me see what combinations could lead to these.

Option D:35. 35 could be 16 (O) +19 (F)=35. So if X has O and F, then lightest is O (16?), no—F is 9, O is 8. So F is lighter. So 9 (F) +26 (Fe)=35. So if X has F and Fe, sum is 35.

But I'm not sure what compound that would be.

Option C:31. 15 (P) +16 (S)=31. But P is 15, S is 32, so that's 47. No. Alternatively, 12 (C) +19 (K)=31? No, 12+19=31. So C and K. C is 6, K is 19. So the lightest element is C (12?), no. Wait, the elements are C and K. Lightest is C (atomic number 6, mass 12), heaviest K (mass 39). 12+39=51, not 31.

Hmm. Maybe 1 (H) +30 (Zn)=31. So if X has H and Zn. But Zn is a heavy metal. Not sure.

Option B:25. 12 (C) +13 (Al)=25. So if X has C and Al. Their masses are 12 and 27. Sum 39. No. Alternatively, 1 (H) +24 (Mg)=25. So H and Mg. Sum is 1 +24=25.

So if X contains H and Mg, the lightest is H (1), heaviest Mg (24), sum 25. Which is option B.

So, if X is a compound containing H and Mg, like MgH2 (magnesium hydride), which is a known compound. But would that fit the other conditions?

When MgH2 reacts with Y (a liquid), perhaps water. MgH2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 + H2↑. So W is H2, which has 2p and 0n. Doesn't fit W's condition. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, another thought: if X is MgO (magnesium oxide), which reacts with a liquid acid (Y) like HCl. The reaction would be MgO + 2HCl → MgCl2 + H2O. W would be H2O. But H2O has 10p and 8n (assuming H is 1p, 0n; O is 8p, 8n). So 10 vs 8. Doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide, like MgO2. But I'm not sure if that's a real compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound. Let me think about the other clues.

The product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So, if X is Mg, and the keto acid is, say, acetic acid, then Mg would react to form Mg acetate, which has four O's. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, another angle. The product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. That suggests a molecule like H2O2, which has two O's. But how would X and a keto acid produce H2O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider the likely answer based on the options and the information. The sum is 25, which is option B. So probably, the elements are H (1) and Mg (24), sum 25.

So, X contains H and Mg. Let me think of a compound with Mg and H. MgH2 is a possibility.

But earlier, that didn't fit the W condition. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaOH, which has Na (23) and O (16). So the lightest element is O (16), heaviest Na (23). Sum 16+23=39. Not an option.

Hmm. Another possibility: the product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms, so maybe X is something like NH3. Reacting with acetic acid would produce ammonium acetate, which has two O's per acetate group. But again, the initial reaction doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like DMSO (CH3SOCH3). It's a polar aprotic solvent and a reagent in organic chemistry. So it has C, H, S, O. So elements present are C, H, S, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest S (32.07). Sum is 33, not an option.

Wait, but the options are 25, 29,31,35. So perhaps the sum is 25.

Wait, another thought: if X is a molecule with two isotopes, like H and O. For example, HDO. So the elements are H and O. Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but I don't see how that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like Hg (mercury). But Hg doesn't have isotopes that are much heavier than the lightest, and I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, going back to the reaction: X reacts with Y to produce W and G. W is a gas where each molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons. So W could be O2 (16p,16n), or CO (14p,14n), or N2 (14p,14n).

In the case of O2, the reaction would be X + Y → O2 + G.

If O2 is the gas, perhaps X is a peroxide reacting with an acid. For example, Na2O2 reacts with H2SO4 to produce O2, Na2SO4, and water. So:

Na2O2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O + O2↑.

So X is Na2O2, Y is H2SO4 (liquid). Then, the precipitate G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble. Hmm, so that doesn't form a precipitate. So maybe Y is a different acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal peroxide like CaO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a carbonate. Let's say X is Na, Y is Na2CO3. Then, Na + Na2CO3 → Na3CO3. But that doesn't release gas. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: if X is a metal carbonate, like Na2CO3. Reacting with Y (maybe an acid) would produce CO2 gas. But CO2 doesn't fit W's condition (equal protons and neutrons). As earlier, CO2 has 22p and 22n, which works.

Wait, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. CO2 has 1 C (6p,6n) and 2 O's (8p,8n each). So total protons:6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons:6 + 2*8=22. So yes, CO2 fits W's condition.

So, if W is CO2, then the reaction is between X (a carbonate) and Y (an acid). For example, Na2CO3 (X) reacts with H2SO4 (Y) → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. So G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble, so no precipitate. That's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that doesn't form a precipitate. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base. For example, X is Na2CO3, Y is NaOH. Then, no reaction. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing a metal ion that forms a precipitate with carbonate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: X is a carbonate, Y is water. No reaction.

Alternatively, X is a carbonate, Y is a strong acid, producing CO2 and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, CaCO3 (X) reacts with HCl (Y) → CaCl2 (soluble) + CO2 + H2O. So no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a hydroxide. For example, Al(OH)3 reacts with H2SO4 → Al2(SO4)3 + 3H2O. No gas produced.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite. Reacting with an acid would produce SO2 gas, which doesn't fit W's condition.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

The sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is one of the options:25,29,31,35.

If the sum is 25, possible elements are H (1) and Mg (24).

If X contains Mg and H, then X could be MgH2.

But when MgH2 reacts with Y (liquid), perhaps water, produces H2 gas, which doesn't fit W's condition.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound.

Wait, another angle: the product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So, perhaps X is a metal (like Mg), and the product is a salt where each formula unit has two O's. For example, Mg(OH)2 has three O's, but maybe another compound.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base like Mg(OH)2, which reacts with a keto acid to form a salt with two O's.

But I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 31, which would be sum of 15 (P) and 16 (S). But I don't see a direct relation.

Alternatively, sum could be 1 (H) +30 (Zn) =31.

Wait, but Zn is a metal. If X is Zn, then reacting with Y (maybe a carbonate) would produce CO2 and Zn carbonate. So W is CO2, which fits.

Then, the product of X (Zn) with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would form Zn acetate. The formula is Zn(CH3COO)2. Each acetate has two O's, so the product has four O's. But the question says the product has two O atoms. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a different compound.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the information, the sum is likely 25, option B. So I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a reaction where Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W and form a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C). Gas W has molecules where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Additionally, the product of X reacting with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. The task is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include O₂ (16 protons, 16 neutrons) or CO (14 protons, 14 neutrons). These are consistent with the condition that W is a gas released in the reaction.

2. **Precipitate G and Product B**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. This suggests B could be a compound like heavy water (D₂O), which has a melting point of ~276.9 K. If X incorporates a heavier isotope, this aligns with the problem's description.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This suggests X could be a metal that reacts with a keto acid to form a salt with two oxygen atoms in the product.

4. **Atomic Masses of Elements in X**: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must match one of the given options (25, 29, 31, 35). Considering possible elements:
   - If X contains hydrogen (H, atomic mass ~1) and magnesium (Mg, atomic mass ~24), their combined mass is 1 + 24 = 25, which matches option B.
   - Other combinations, such as carbon (C, 12) and aluminum (Al, 27), or oxygen (O, 16) and sulfur (S, 32), do not align with the given options.

5. **Consistency with the Reaction**: If X is magnesium hydride (MgH₂), it could react with a liquid like water to produce hydrogen gas (H₂). However, H₂ does not satisfy the condition for W. This suggests X may not be MgH₂ but another compound where the elements hydrogen and magnesium are present.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (H, ~1) and heaviest (Mg, ~24) elements in X sum to 25. This aligns with option B.
