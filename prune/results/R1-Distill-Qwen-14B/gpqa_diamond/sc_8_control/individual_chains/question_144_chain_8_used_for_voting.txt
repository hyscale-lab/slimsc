Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a different distance in meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the lifetime of the particle and its speed. Oh right, the formula should be something like L = gamma * v * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I find tau? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The formula for lifetime is tau = hbar / Γ, with hbar being the reduced Planck constant. But wait, I also need to make sure about the units here because everything needs to be in compatible units.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau of the meson X.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson.
3. Compute the Lorentz factor gamma.
4. Multiply gamma, v, and tau to get the mean decay distance L.

Starting with step 1: tau = hbar / Γ.

I remember that hbar is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, let me confirm that; yes, because hbar is about 197.33 MeV·fm, but when converting to GeV·s, it's 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Wait, Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert that to GeV to match units. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = let's calculate that.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. So tau ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

Step 2: Find the velocity v. To get v, I can use the relativistic energy relation. The energy E is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. The total energy E = gamma * m c². So gamma = E / (m c²). Wait, but c is a big factor here—since we're working in natural units often, but I need to account for it properly.

Wait, in particle physics, energies and masses are often in GeV, and c is taken as 1 in those units. So E = gamma m. So gamma = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... So approximately 6.6667.

But to find velocity, I think the formula is beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, that's because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So solving for beta:

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Given gamma is 6.6667, 1/gamma² is 1/(44.444...) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's see, 6.6667 squared is 44.4444. So 1/gamma² is 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225.

0.9775 is the value inside the square root. Let's compute sqrt(0.9775):

Well, sqrt(0.9801) is 0.99, because 0.99^2 is 0.9801. 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775. Let me check: 0.9887 * 0.9887 ≈ (0.98)^2 = 0.9604, plus some. Wait, perhaps a better way: 0.9887 * 0.9887.

0.9887 squared:

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + (0.0087)^2.

= 0.9604 + 0.017112 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.9604 + 0.01718769 ≈ 0.977587. So yes, 0.9887^2 ≈ 0.977587, which is very close to 0.9775. So beta ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c. Since c is about 3e8 m/s, v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. But perhaps I'll just keep it as a fraction for calculations.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute beta and gamma together. Maybe using the relation E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Hmm, but perhaps I can compute beta as v/c = (pc)/E. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact expressions.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of momentum. Momentum p = gamma m v. Wait, no, p = gamma m v, which is also equal to gamma m beta c, since v = beta c. So p = gamma m beta c. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, another formula for beta is beta = (E² - m² c^4)^(1/2) / (E c²). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The correct formula is:

E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

If I solve for p c:

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Wait, maybe it's better to express p in terms of E and m.

Wait, let me think. From E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v.

Expressing v in terms of E and m: v = c * sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2).

Wait, since E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. So m c² = 1.2 GeV, E = 8 GeV.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So same result as before. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Now, step 3: compute gamma. Gamma is E/(m c²), which is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666..., so gamma ≈ 6.6667.

Step 4: Compute the mean decay length L = gamma * v * tau.

We have:

gamma ≈ 6.6667,

v ≈ 0.9887 c,

tau ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds,

c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

So putting it together:

L = gamma * v * tau.

Wait, but v is in m/s, tau in seconds. So v * tau is in meters.

So v * tau = (0.9887 * 3e8 m/s) * (2.057e-24 s) = 0.9887 * 3e8 * 2.057e-24.

Wait, let me compute that:

0.9887 * 3e8 = approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.057e-24 s: 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 = (2.966 * 2.057) × 1e8-24 = (6.117) × 1e-16 ≈ 6.117e-16 m.

Now, multiply by gamma, which is approx 6.6667.

6.117e-16 * 6.6667 ≈ 4.078e-15 m.

Wait, let me compute 6.117 * 6.6667.

6 * 6.6667 is 40, 0.117 *6.6667≈0.78, so total around 40.78.

So 40.78e-16? Wait, no—wait, 6.117 * 6.6667 is about 40.78, but in exponents, it's 6.117e-16 multiplied by 6.6667 becomes 40.78e-16. So that's 4.078e-15 m.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close to this. Option C is 5e-15, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculations to get the exact value.

Let me recalculate the steps with more precise numbers.

First, calculate tau precisely.

hbar = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

tau = hbar / Γ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Next, calculate beta:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m_X c^2 / E_X)^2 )

But since E and m are given in GeV, and c is 1 in those units, so beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 )

m/E = 1.2/8 = 0.15.

So 1 - (0.15)^2 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887, but let's compute it more accurately.

Using calculator-like approach: sqrt(0.9775).

We can approximate it as follows:

0.9887^2 = 0.9775, so beta is exactly 0.9887? Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, let me compute 0.9887 squared:

0.9887 * 0.9887:

Compute 0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

Compute 0.0087 * 0.98 = ~0.008526.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

Let me write it as (0.98 + 0.0087)^2 = 0.98² + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087².

0.98² = 0.9604.

2*0.98*0.0087 = 2 * 0.008526 = 0.017052.

0.0087² = 0.00007569.

Adding them up: 0.9604 + 0.017052 = 0.977452. Plus 0.00007569 is 0.97752769.

Hmm, but our target is 0.9775, so 0.97752769 is very close. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So v = 0.9887 c.

Now, computing L = gamma * v * tau.

gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... (exactly 20/3).

So gamma = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667.

v = 0.9887 * (3e8 m/s) ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So v * tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.9661 * 2.056875 * 1e-16 m.

Compute 2.9661 * 2.056875:

2 * 2 =4.

Let me compute it step by step:

2.056875 * 2.9661.

I'll compute 2 * 2 =4, 0.056875 * 2 = 0.11375.

Wait, perhaps a more precise way:

2.056875 × 2.9661 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.056875 * 3 = 6.170625.

But since it's 2.9661, which is 3 - 0.0339.

So 2.056875 * (3 - 0.0339) = 6.170625 - (2.056875 * 0.0339).

Compute 2.056875 * 0.0339 ≈ 0.06983.

So 6.170625 - 0.06983 ≈ 6.1008.

So v*tau ≈ 6.1008e-16 m.

Then multiply by gamma (20/3 ≈6.6667):

6.1008e-16 * (20/3) = (6.1008 * 20) /3 * 1e-16.

6.1008 *20 = 122.016.

122.016 /3 ≈40.672.

So 40.672e-16 m is 4.0672e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

Option C is 5.02e-15, which is larger, so not this.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exact numbers. Let me check each step again.

Tau calculation: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Beta: sqrt(0.9775) = 0.9887 approx.

v = 0.9887 *3e8 = 2.9661e8 m/s.

v * tau: 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.9661 * 2.056875 )e-16.

Let me compute 2.9661 * 2.056875:

2.9661 * 2 =5.9322

2.9661 * 0.056875= approx 0.1688.

So total is 5.9322 +0.1688≈6.101.

So v * tau is approx 6.101e-16 m.

Multiply by gamma (20/3=6.6667):

6.101 *6.6667 ≈40.673e-16 m=4.0673e-15 m.

Which is about 4.067e-15 m. The option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close, so B is the correct answer.

Wait, but why is option D 4.0655e-16? Could it be a mistake in exponent? Because 4.06e-15 is much larger than 4.06e-16.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \cdot v \cdot \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( v \) is the velocity of the meson,
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the meson.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime is related to the width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) can be determined using the relativistic relation:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m_X}{E_X}\right)^2}
\]

Given:
- \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - (0.15)^2} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Thus, the velocity is:

\[
v = \beta \cdot c = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
Substituting the values into the formula \( L = \gamma \cdot v \cdot \tau \):

\[
L = 6.6667 \cdot (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( v \cdot \tau \):

\[
v \cdot \tau = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.1008 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Then, multiply by \( \gamma \):

\[
L = 6.6667 \cdot 6.1008 \times 10^{-16} = 4.0673 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The closest value to the calculated \( L \) is:

**Option B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
