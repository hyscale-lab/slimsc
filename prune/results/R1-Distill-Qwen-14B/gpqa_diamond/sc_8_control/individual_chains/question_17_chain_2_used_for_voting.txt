Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where the calcium is complexed with EDTA. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium, forming a complex.

So, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stoichiometric means that the molar ratio is 1:1, right? Because CaEDTA would be Ca^2+ with EDTA^4-; so each Ca is surrounded by one EDTA molecule.

The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. K is the formation constant, which tells us how strong the complex is. A larger K means the complex is more stable.

The question asks for the concentration of calcium ions in solution. Hmm. So, normally, if EDTA is in excess, the calcium would be almost entirely complexed, and the free Ca^2+ would be very low. But wait, in this case, the solution has a stoichiometric amount of the complex. So it's exactly the right amount of Ca and EDTA to form the complex without any excess? Or maybe the solution is made by dissolving the complex, which dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, the complex is given as 0.02 M. So the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So let's think about the dissociation of the complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So the reaction would be:
Ca-EDTA ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is for the reverse reaction. Wait, no, the formation constant is for the formation of the complex from the ions. So K is [CaEDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, formation constants are usually written as the equilibrium for the formation of the complex. So, if K is given as 5e10, that's a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable.

So, the dissociation would have a very small K, which would be 1/K, right? Because the formation constant is K = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]), so the dissociation K would be [Ca][EDTA]/[complex] = 1/K.

So, for the dissociation, K_dissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, initially, [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M. The other ions, Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, both start at zero, but as the complex dissociates, some of them form.

Let me denote the change as x. So, when the complex dissociates, it produces x amount of Ca^2+ and x amount of EDTA^4-.

So, at equilibrium, the concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is so large, x is probably very small, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02)

[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

So, the dissociation constant K_d is equal to [Ca][EDTA]/[CaEDTA] = (x * x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02 = K_d.

Wait, K_d is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So,

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13

Take the square root:

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13.

The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7.

So, x ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

So, [Ca^2+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M.

Wait, but let me think again. Since the complex is 0.02 M, which is the initial concentration, and the dissociation is x, but in reality, as the complex dissociates, the concentrations of Ca and EDTA are both x. Then, their product is x², which is in the numerator of the K expression.

Since K is so large, the amount of dissociation x is very small, so the approximation [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M holds.

So, yes, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{Ca-EDTA} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), which corresponds to the equilibrium:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}.
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_{\text{dissociation}} \) is the reciprocal of \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \), so:

\[
K_{\text{dissociation}} = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) at equilibrium be \( x \). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Ca-EDTA}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \quad \text{(since \( x \) is very small)},
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x.
\]

Substituting into the dissociation constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{dissociation}} = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Equating to \( K_{\text{dissociation}} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) 6.3x10^-7 M**
