Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in a state that's an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, let me write that down:

State vector ψ = [ -1/2; (1/sqrt(2)); -1/2 ]

But wait, I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the sum of squares of the components.

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4
(1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2
(-1/2)^2 = 1/4
Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Oh, so it's already normalized. Good.

Now, I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

The matrix form of P_z is given as:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So, P_z is a diagonal matrix. That should make calculations easier because when I operate it on the state vector, it's just scaling each component.

Wait, but wait. The state is in the basis of P_z eigenvectors. Oh right, because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state vector's components are in this basis. So the state ψ is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is simply the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities (squares of the components).

Wait, let's think again. The state is written in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So each component of ψ corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z.

So, the first component (ψ₁) corresponds to the eigenvalue P_z = ħ, the second component ψ₂ corresponds to P_z = 0, and the third component ψ₃ corresponds to P_z = -ħ.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is:
|ψ₁|² * (ħ) + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|²*(-ħ)

Let me compute each |ψ_i|².

|ψ₁|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4
|ψ₂|² = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2
|ψ₃|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ)
= (1/4 - 1/4) ħ + 0
= 0 * ħ
= 0

Hmm, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element.

So the matrix for P_z² would be:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ ħ², 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, ħ² ]

So, again, since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of |ψ_i|² multiplied by (eigenvalue)^2.

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = |ψ₁|²*(ħ²) + |ψ₂|²*(0²) + |ψ₃|²*(ħ²)
= (1/4) ħ² + (1/2)(0) + (1/4) ħ²
= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ²
= (1/2) ħ²

So now, putting it all into the uncertainty formula:

ΔP_z = sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² )
= sqrt( (1/2) ħ² - (0)^2 )
= sqrt( (1/2) ħ² )
= ħ * sqrt(1/2)
= ħ / sqrt(2)

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2, which is what I got. So the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix of $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

In the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the components of $\psi$ correspond to the eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components) are:

\[
|\psi_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |\psi_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |\psi_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The expectation value of $P_z$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |\psi_1|^2 (\hbar) + |\psi_2|^2 (0) + |\psi_3|^2 (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$
The matrix $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |\psi_1|^2 (\hbar^2) + |\psi_2|^2 (0) + |\psi_3|^2 (\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty in $P_z$
Substituting into the uncertainty formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.
