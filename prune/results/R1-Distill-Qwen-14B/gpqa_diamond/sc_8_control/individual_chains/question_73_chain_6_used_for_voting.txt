Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in special relativity doesn't just add up like in classical mechanics, right? Because when objects are moving at speeds comparable to the speed of light, you can't just say v_rel = v1 - v2. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), but wait, I think I might have that backwards. Let me recall: if frame S' is moving at speed v relative to S, then the velocity u' of an object in S' is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). So in this case, one astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c, but from whose perspective are we calculating the relative speed?

Wait, the question says "relative speed" between them. So perhaps it's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. Let me clarify. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait no, no. Wait, are both moving in the same direction? The question says "in the positive x-direction". So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c, same direction. So from the perspective of astronaut 1, what is the relative speed of astronaut 2?

Wait wait, no. No, wait, astronaut 2 is slower than astronaut 1. So if you're in the frame of astronaut 1, which is moving at 0.6c, you see astronaut 2 moving at a speed relative to you. Let me think. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), where v is the speed of the frame, and u is the speed in the original frame.

Wait, let me get that right. So, the velocity of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame would be (u' = (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/(c²)))), right? Because astronaut 2's speed in the original frame is v2 = 0.5c, and the frame (astronaut 1's) speed is v1 = 0.6c. So u' is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 1 - 0.3= 0.7. So u' is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction but since the question asks for speed, it's 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's one part.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. The total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each astronaut when considering their relativistic speeds.

Each astronaut's total energy is given by gamma multiplied by m c squared. So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), his energy E1 is gamma1 * 2m c². Similarly, E2 is gamma2 * 3m c².

Calculating gamma for each: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

For astronaut 1: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma1 is 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660. So gamma2=1/(0.8660) ≈ 1.1547.

E2=1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c² and v_rel=0.14c. So option C is correct.

Wait, but wait another moment. Is the relative speed calculated correctly? Let me double-check that part because sometimes signs can be tricky.

So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c. Astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from astronaut 1's frame, the speed of astronaut 2 would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/0.7 = -0.142857c. The negative indicates that astronaut 2 is moving in the opposite direction from astronaut 1's frame. But since we're talking about speed, it's 0.14c. So yes, that part was correct.

So the two answers are v_rel≈0.14c and E≈5.96 mc². Looking at the options, only option C matches both.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the frame of the other. The formula is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (astronaut 1's speed) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (astronaut 2's speed). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but since the question asks for speed, we take the magnitude:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 1
For astronaut 1 (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of Astronaut 2
For astronaut 2 (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} = \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m c^2) = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
