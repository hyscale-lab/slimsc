Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The question is about why the expected green signal isn't showing up when they look under the confocal microscope.

Let me start by breaking down the setup. So, the experiment involves creating a bicistronic vector with two ORFs: one for the ligand and one for the receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element. 

The vector is bicistronic, so it produces two proteins from one transcript. The ligand's ORF is first, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. But wait, the stop cassettes are a bit confusing. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between itself and mCherry, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 between it and eGFP. 

So, the way these work is that the stop cassette prevents expression unless a Cre-recombinase is present to excise the stop. So if the Cre is active, it would remove the stop, allowing the downstream reporter to be expressed. 

The vector is introduced into primary astrocyte culture, and they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins to check with Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, meaning the loading controls are working. So, the proteins are being expressed, but perhaps not in the way expected.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed this mouse with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so likely the Cre is under SOX10 regulation, meaning it's active in neural crest-derived cells. 

After the offspring are born, they're visualized under a confocal. No green signal. The green would come from the eGFP on the receptor construct. So why isn't it there?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells, perhaps? Or maybe the expression is not happening because the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship, but I'm not sure how that affects the Western blot or the GFP expression. I'll have to think more.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't getting to the cell surface, it wouldn't fluoresce. But why would this happen only in certain contexts? The Western blot would still show the protein is made, unless it's not being expressed at all. But the question says the blot detected the proteins, so the receptors are made. So maybe the stop cassette wasn't properly excised, so eGFP isn't being made. Or perhaps the receptor is misfolded and stuck in the ER or Golgi, but I'm not sure if that would prevent the Western blot from showing it. Because the Western blot detects the protein regardless of its location.

Option C: Enhancer for expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is an internal ribosome entry site, so it's usually a weaker form of expression. But if the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't happening. But the Western blot detected the proteins, implying they were expressed. So maybe this isn't the issue.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't properly removed, then the receptor and eGFP would be translated together. But the stop is flanked by lox2272 sites. Cre would excise it if present. If the Cre isn't active, the stop remains, so the receptor's ORF is terminated, and the eGFP isn't expressed. Wait, but in the mouse model, they're using SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre should be active there. So in the offspring, the Cre would have recombined the lox2272 sites, removing the stop cassette, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in the experiment, they didn't see the GFP. So maybe the Cre didn't recombine the sites. Why? Could it be that the Cre isn't active? Or maybe the vector wasn't properly set up. 

Wait, the vector is bicistronic with two stop cassettes. The ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. Cre is an enzyme that recognizes loxP sites. But lox2272 is a variant of loxP; it's a loxP derivative that doesn't recombine with wild-type Cre. Oh wait, no, I think lox2272 is a site that requires Cre with a certain mutation, or maybe it's a site that doesn't recombine unless a specific Cre is present. Wait, no, the loxP and lox2272 are different. Lox2272 is a site that Cre does not recombine with. Or is it that only Cre variants can recombine with it? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think that loxP is the original site, and lox2272 is a mutant version that cannot be cut by wild-type Cre. So, if you have a lox2272 site, wild-type Cre won't recombine it. So if the vector has a lox2272 between the receptor and eGFP, and the Cre used is wild-type (like from SOX10-Cre), then the lox2272 site won't be cut. Which means the stop cassette remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the receptor is expressed, but not the eGFP.

Wait, but the vector is constructed such that the receptor is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So the idea is that Cre would remove the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But if the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites, then the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So when they look for GFP, they don't see it.

But why would the stop cassettes be using different lox sites? Oh, because the initial setup uses loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor. So, perhaps the idea is that the vector would allow for different expression patterns. But in this case, the Cre used is SOX10-Cre, which is wild-type Cre. So it can only cut loxP sites, not lox2272.

Wait, no, the ligand has a loxP-stop, so in the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor construct has lox2272, which wild-type Cre can't cut. Therefore, the eGFP would only be expressed if a different Cre (like one that can recognize lox2272) is used. But in this case, they have SOX10-Cre, which uses wild-type Cre. So the lox2272 stop isn't removed, meaning the eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the mouse model, when you cross the homozygous construct with SOX10-Cre, the Cre will only remove the loxP stops for the ligand, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, when they look for eGFP fluorescence, it doesn't show up.

Looking at the options, Option D is about the receptor and eGFP not being in frame. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in between. So that would mean the eGFP isn't made, so no signal.

But wait, the question says the mice are homozygous for the construct. So each allele has the ligand and receptor. The Cre is hemizygous, so each mouse has one copy. But the Cre is from SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the Cre should be active. But if the lox sites are of different types, then only the ligand's stop is cut. So the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, but the receptor and eGFP would not be expressed.

But the question is why no green signal. The green is from the receptor-eGFP. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, maybe because the stop is still present.

Alternatively, maybe the vector isn't working correctly because the stop cassettes aren't being removed. So the eGFP isn't being expressed, hence no signal.

So looking at the options, the most likely reason is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, but if the stop is present, the receptor would be expressed but the eGFP wouldn't be. Or, perhaps the stop is still present, so the receptor isn't even expressed, but the Western blot detected the proteins. Hmm, but the blot would show the receptor if it's expressed, regardless of whether the eGFP is.

Wait, the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into astrocyte culture. So that test was just to check if the proteins are expressed, which they were. But when they made the mouse model, perhaps the expression relies on Cre. So when the construct is in the mouse, the Cre is only active in certain cells, like neural crest-derived ones.

Wait, but in the mouse, the Cre is under SOX10, which is expressed in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the Cre would remove the loxP and lox2272 stops. Wait, no, because lox2272 can't be cut by wild-type Cre. Therefore, the ligand's mCherry would be expressed (since the loxP stop is removed), but the receptor's eGFP would not be expressed because the lox2272 stop remains.

So the receptor is expressed (from the IRES), but without the eGFP. But wait, the receptor ORF is after the IRES. So the IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, allowing the receptor to be expressed. The eGFP is after the lox2272 stop. So if the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the receptor is expressed, but without eGFP.

So in the Western blot, they would detect the receptor, perhaps as a fusion with eGFP if expressed. But in the mice, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So when they look for eGFP fluorescence, it's not there.

The question is why the eGFP isn't being expressed. The issue is that the lox2272 stop isn't being cut by the Cre used. That means the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking again at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that without the stop being removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But that's more about the vector constructionâ€”if the stop is in between, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the presence of the stop is due to the lox2272 not being cut.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP isn't being translated because the stop isn't removed. So the most likely reason is that the stop is present, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the options don't directly address the stop cassette. So perhaps the real issue is that the IRES is not working, or the promoter is not active. But the Western blot showed expression, so maybe the promoter is working.

Wait, the vector has the ligand under CBA, and the receptor is after IRES. So the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF. But in the mouse, perhaps without the Cre, the IRES isn't active. Or, the IRES is only functional when the stop is removed.

No, that doesn't make sense. The IRES is part of the construct upstream of the receptor. So if the CBA promoter is driving the bicistronic mRNA, the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed regardless. But perhaps in the mouse construct, the receptor is only expressed when the stop is removed. Wait, no, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. The lox2272 stop is after the receptor's ORF. So the receptor would be expressed regardless of the stop. But the eGFP wouldn't be. So the receptor would be present, but without the eGFP tag.

But the Western blot detected the proteins, so the receptor is expressed. So in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't cut. So the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. Therefore, when they look for eGFP, it's not there.

So the reason is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. Why isn't the stop removed? Because the lox2272 can't be cut by the wild-type Cre from SOX10-Cre. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options:

A) Paracrine relation: Doesn't explain the lack of GFP.

B) Stuck in Golgi: GFP would be expressed but not traffic properly. But Western blot would show the protein. But if it's stuck, maybe it doesn't fluoresce. However, the question says no signal, so perhaps none is expressed.

C) Enhancer missing: But the Western blot shows expression, so this is unlikely.

D) Not in frame: If the stop isn't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So D is talking about the frame. Wait, if the stop is present, the receptor is expressed but the eGFP isn't. So the eGFP isn't in frame because the stop is in between. So D would be the correct answer.

Wait, but D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would happen if the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the Western blot would show the receptor, but not the eGFP. But in the mouse, they have the eGFP construct, but it's not expressed because the stop remains. So the answer is D?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 stop isn't being cut, so eGFP isn't expressed. But none of the options directly address this. The closest is option D, which relates to the construct's expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes were not correctly placed. If the loxP and lox2272 are in the wrong places, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly address this.

Wait, another angle: if the vector uses loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor, then when you use Cre, which only cuts loxP, only the ligand's stop is removed. The receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, only the ligand is expressed with mCherry, and the receptor is expressed but without eGFP. So when they look for eGFP (which is on the receptor construct), they don't see it.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the lox2272 stop isn't cut by the Cre. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed. But in the options, none of them directly mention this. So perhaps the correct answer is D, because the stop isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't in frame. Or perhaps option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't functional. But the Western blot showed the receptor was expressed, so the IRES worked.

Wait, another point: The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The stop is before mCherry. So in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. So in the mouse, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed in neural crest cells, but the receptor and eGFP would not, because the lox2272 stop isn't cut.

Therefore, in the offspring, you'd see red (mCherry) but no green (eGFP). But the question says they observe no green signal. So the reason is that eGFP isn't expressed, which is because the lox2272 stop isn't cut. That's because the Cre used (wild-type) can't cut lox2272.

So the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. Which would mean that the eGFP construct isn't expressed, hence no signal.

Looking again, the options don't directly address the lox site issue, but option D says the receptor and eGFP aren't in frame. If the stop remains, then the eGFP isn't expressed, so they're not in frame.

Wait, but the vector is designed so that the eGFP should be in frame when the stop is removed. If the stop remains, then the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop codon is in the way. So the eGFP isn't being translated because the stop is present. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the correct answer would be that the stop isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address this. The available options are A to D. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't cut, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So the proteins are not in frame. So D is the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the stop is still present, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the correct answer is that the stop isn't removed because the Cre can't cut lox2272. But since that's not an option, the best fit is D.

The experiment involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and a receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. Two stop cassettes are present: a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry, and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. The vector is introduced into mice, and SOX10-Cre mice are used to activate Cre-recombinase, which should excise the stop cassettes in neural crest-derived cells.

The key issue is that no green signal (from eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope. The Western blot confirmed that the proteins are expressed, but the absence of the green signal suggests that eGFP is not being expressed. This is likely due to the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette remaining intact. Wild-type Cre, such as the one used in SOX10-Cre, cannot excise lox2272 sites. As a result, the stop cassette prevents the expression of eGFP, even though the receptor itself may still be expressed.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This does not explain the absence of the green signal, as the issue lies in the expression of eGFP, not the relationship between the ligand and receptor.
- **B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: If the construct were stuck in the Golgi, the eGFP would still be expressed and detected, albeit improperly trafficked. This does not explain the complete absence of the green signal.
- **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The Western blot confirmed that the proteins are expressed, so this is unlikely to be the issue.
- **D) The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**: This is the most plausible explanation. The lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette remains intact because wild-type Cre cannot excise it, preventing the expression of eGFP. As a result, the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, leading to its absence.

The absence of the green signal is due to the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette remaining unexcised, which prevents eGFP expression. This aligns with option D, as the eGFP is not expressed because it is not in frame with the receptor due to the stop cassette.

Answer: D
