Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through what I remember.

The question says the interaction Lagrangian is given by L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, okay. So this looks like a Yukawa interaction, which typically involves a fermion, a boson, and some coupling. In the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction is responsible for giving fermions their mass when the Higgs field gets a vacuum expectation value (VEV). So in this case, the boson X is interacting with fermions through this term.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. So, the possible decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because the interaction term involves fermions, so X can decay into two fermions.

But wait, which fermions are possible? The mass of X is 6 GeV, which is the energy available. The fermions produced must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV to be kinematically allowed. Also, each fermion's mass must be less than half of 6 GeV, which is 3 GeV, otherwise the pair can't be produced.

So let's list the possible fermions. But wait, the problem is about which fermions are included in the Lagrangian. The term has ψ_f, which I guess is a fermion field. The Lagrangian seems to be written for some specific fermions f. Wait, the interaction is -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe the f here is a type of fermion. But perhaps it's a general term, so X can decay into any fermion that's part of the interaction.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the possible decay options are given. So perhaps I just need to figure out which fermions are light enough (mass less than 3 GeV each) to be decay products.

So, let's think about the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, but probably negligible here if they're considered as massless.

Wait, but in the decay, the X boson would decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So, for each fermion f, the mass of f must be less than 3 GeV since 6 GeV is the total mass of X, and each particle in the pair would take up some of that mass. So let's see:

Looking at each fermion:

- e: 0.5 MeV → definitely allowed.
- μ: 105.7 MeV → allowed.
- τ: ~1.78 GeV → each τ is 1.78 GeV, so two would sum to 3.56 GeV. But wait, the sum of the masses must be less than 6 GeV, but each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV. Wait, no. Because the rest mass of each fermion is m, so the energy available is X's mass, which is 6 GeV. So for a pair of fermions, each with mass m, the threshold is 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

So for each fermion, if m_f ≤ 3 GeV, then X → f f̄ is allowed.

So let's check each fermion's mass:

e: 0.5 MeV → yes.
μ: 105.7 MeV → yes.
τ: 1.78 GeV → yes, because 1.78 < 3.
u: 2 MeV → yes.
d: ~5 MeV → yes.
s: ~100 MeV → yes.
c: 1.3 GeV → yes.
b: 4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3, so not allowed.
t: 173 GeV → no way.
What about the others: like maybe other particles, but in the options, the possible decay channels are given as combinations.

Wait, but the problem says the interaction is with fermions f. So the fermions that are present in the Lagrangian must be those that have a coupling to X. The Lagrangian given is for ψ_f, so perhaps X can decay into any of those fermions f.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify which fermions are included in the interaction. So perhaps the Lagrangian term is more general, allowing for all possible fermions, but only those with mass less than 3 GeV can be decay products.

So the possible fermion pairs are:

- e+ e-
- μ+ μ-
- τ+ τ-
- u ū
- d đ
- s s̄
- c c̄

Wait, but wait. The tau has mass about 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is ~3.56 GeV, which is above 3 GeV, but wait, X has mass 6 GeV. So 3.56 is less than 6, so that's fine. So X can decay into τ+ τ-.

But what about the bottom quark? The mass of the b quark is about 4.5 GeV. So each would need to be (4.5) GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b̄.

Wait, but wait, the X has a mass of 6 GeV. The rest mass of the two b quarks would be 2 * 4.5 = 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So that's not allowed. So X cannot decay into b b̄.

So which options include all possible decay channels except those that would require more than 6 GeV?

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ-, e+ e-
But including b b̄ is incorrect because 4.5*2=9>6.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-
So, c has 1.3 GeV each. 2*1.3=2.6 GeV. So that's allowed. So yes, c c̄ is allowed.

Option C: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, t t̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-
But t is 173 GeV, so no way.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-
Again, including b b̄ which isn't allowed.

So the correct decay channels should exclude b b̄ and t t̄.

So which option is correct?

Looking again at the options:

Option B includes c c̄, which is allowed, and excludes b.

Option D includes b b̄, which is not allowed.

Wait, but wait, what about the tau? Its mass is 1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 is ~3.56 GeV. X's mass is 6 GeV, so it's allowed because 3.56 <6.

So the possible decays are:

e+, e-
mu+, mu-
tau+, tau-
u, ū
d, đ
s, s̄
c, c̄

But not b b̄, nor t t̄.

So looking at the options, which one includes these but excludes heavier quarks?

Option B includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, tau, mu, e.

So the decay channels would be c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but also, the interaction term may involve all possible fermions, but for decay into a pair, the individual masses must be under 3 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So for each of these, their decay is possible.

But the options given are A to D.

Looking at option B: It includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d đ, tau, mu, e.

Yes, that's correct.

Option D includes b b̄, which is incorrect.

So the correct option should be either B or D, but D includes b b̄ which is wrong, so B is the correct answer.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided suggests that \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \rightarrow f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of each fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or equivalently, \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
2. **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
3. **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed since \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
4. **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
5. **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 4.5 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
6. **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
7. **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.3 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed since \( 2m_c \approx 2.6 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), **not allowed** since \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
9. **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), **not allowed** due to its extremely high mass.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
