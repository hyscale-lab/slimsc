Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question gives me three different characterization techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Each of these should give me clues about the structure of the compound.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates O-H stretching. Broad peaks in IR usually mean hydrogen bonding, which is common in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the presence of a broad peak could also suggest a carbonyl group with an O-H, like a ketone or something else, but I'm not sure. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 cm^-1 might be another carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide. But wait, amides typically have peaks a bit lower than 1650, maybe around 1680? Hmm, not too sure.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond. So the structure likely includes an alkene group.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry (MS) shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. What could that be? Well, 45 is a common mass for a fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. Maybe a (CH3)2O group? Because (CH3)2O is 45 (12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 45). Alternatively, a CH2CH2O group? Or maybe it's a ketene ion or something else. Wait, another possibility is that it's the tropylium ion (C7H7+) but that's 91, so not 45. Hmm, another approach: common fragments. The mass 45 is often seen in the mass spectrum of compounds that have ester groups because the ester might break into a fragment with the OCH2CH3 part. Or perhaps it's a methylene group attached to something else.

Putting this together, the compound has a carbonyl group (from the IR), an alcohol or something with O-H (the broad peak), a double bond (from the NMR), and a fragment of 45 in MS.

Let me think about possible functional groups. The O-H in the IR could be an alcohol, but if there's a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester. Wait, esters have both carbonyl and O in the structure. Let's think about the possible formulas.

The possible options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O2.

Looking at degrees of unsaturation might help. The formula for each option:

For C6H12O:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0 and N=0.

So, (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond.

C6H10O: (12+2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees: maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

C6H10O2: (14 -10)/2= 2. So again two degrees.

C6H12O2: (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond (so at least one degree). If the compound has a double bond, then the degrees of unsaturation might be higher.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1650, which might be a conjugated carbonyl. So perhaps an aromatic ring with a carbonyl, like in a substituted benzaldehyde or something similar. Or maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a double bond. Esters have the formula R-O-CO-R', which would give O2 in the formula. So looking at the options, C6H10O2 and C6H12O2 are the ones with two oxygen atoms.

But the MS fragment is 45. Let's think about that. If the compound is an ester, maybe it breaks into an ethyl group or something. For example, an ethyl propionate would have an ethyl group in the ester, which could fragment to give the ethyl group as a fragment.

Wait, the fragment m/z=45 is likely (CH3)2O+ (that's 45), which is the methoxy group. Or perhaps a CH2CH2O+ group.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment might be a ketene ion, which would be (CH3)2CO+ breaking off. The ketene ion has a mass of 45. So if the compound has a ketene group, that would make sense. But wait, ketenes are not very common; maybe it's more likely an ester.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from an ethylene oxide group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what's the molecular formula? Let's consider the options and see which ones fit the data.

The presence of two oxygen atoms in the formula (like C6H10O2 or C6H12O2) would suggest possible ester or other oxygen-containing groups. Since the FTIR shows both a carbonyl (1700) and a broad peak (O-H), perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol group, but that seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch and a strong carbonyl around 1700. But a carboxylic acid would have the formula CnH2nO2. Let me check the options: C6H10O2 would be 2n=10 → n=5. Wait, 6 carbons. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Lactones have an ester group and can have a carbonyl peak at around 1700.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester, but that's less common.

Wait, let's go back to the MS. The fragment at 45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at 114. If it breaks into a fragment of 45, that would require losing 69. Hmm, but 45 is a significant fragment. Alternatively, the 45 could be a specific part of the molecule.

Another thought: The fragment m/z=45 could correspond to the tropylium ion, but that's for benzene derivatives. Alternatively, it could be a CH3CO+ group, which is 43. Hmm, not 45. Wait, (CH3)2CHO+ would be 59. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2CH2O)+, which is 45 (12*2 + 6 + 16 = 45). So perhaps the molecule has an ethoxy group attached to something else, and upon fragmentation, the ethoxy breaks off as CH2CH2O+.

Wait, but in that case, the molecular formula would have an O. Let me think.

Looking at the options again:

Option A) C6H12O2: molecular weight 6*12=72 +12=84 +32=116. So MW 116.

Option C) C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

So, if the molecular ion is at 114, and a fragment is at 45. So 114 -45=69. So maybe the molecule breaks into 45 and something else of 69. Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is from a part of the molecule.

Another approach: looking for the possible structure that would give these spectral data. Let's say the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Lactones have an ester group and often show a carbonyl peak around 1700 cm^-1. They can also have an O-H if it's an open lactone, but wait, lactones are cyclic esters, so they don't have an O-H. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, but the IR has a broad peak at around 3000, which is O-H. So that's an alcohol or acid.

Wait, maybe the compound is an acyclic ester with an alcohol group? No, that would require more O's. Or perhaps an ester with a hydroxyl group nearby. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. But that would require two O atoms. So, the formula would be C6H12O2 or C6H10O2.

Another thought: the O-H stretch is broad, which suggests it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. A carboxylic acid has a very strong, broad O-H around 2500-3000, but wait, the question says a very broad absorption at 3000. Hmm, carboxylic acids usually have two O-H stretches (symmetric and asymmetric), but they're both strong and broad, around 2500-3000. So the broad peak in the question is at 3000, which could fit a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR also shows a peak at 1700, which is about right for the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid (which is typically around 1700). The peak at 1650 would be a bit lower, maybe due to conjugation with an oxygen or something else.

Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid, it would have formula CnH2nO2. Let's see the options: C6H10O2 is 6 C, 10 H, 2 O. So n would be 5, since 2n=10 → n=5. So 5 carbons in the acid? But the formula is C6H10O2, which would be a 5-carbon acid plus another carbon, maybe as a substituent. Hmm, but maybe that's complicating it.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an alcohol group. But that would be unusual as esters are usually more stable.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a hemiacetal or something like that, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests an alkene. So the structure likely has a double bond. So perhaps it's an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Those can show a conjugated carbonyl, so their IR peaks might be shifted.

In that case, the IR would have a strong peak around 1700 for the carbonyl, and a peak around 1650 for conjugation with the double bond. The broad peak at 3000 might be from an O-H, perhaps an alcohol group elsewhere.

Now, the mass spectrum. If the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like something with a structure like CH2=CHCOO-R, then upon fragmentation, it could break at the ester group. For example, the ester group could cleave, producing an ion that includes the ethyl part. Wait, but I'm not too sure about the exact fragments.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something like methyl acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its molecular formula is C4H6O2. But our options are for C6, so perhaps a larger ester.

Wait, another approach: what's the molecular formula for each option and the possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So if the compound has a double bond and an ester group, that would take up two degrees of unsaturation (double bond and carbonyl). So maybe that's not possible for option A, which only has one degree.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the degrees of unsaturation for each.

For C6H12O2:

DOU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So only one degree. So maybe a ring and a double bond? No, that would be two. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

DOU formula: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

Assuming X=0, N=0.

So for C6H12O2:

(2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree.

So the compound could have one ring and no double bonds, or one double bond and no ring, or a combination.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond. So the compound must have a double bond, which would account for one degree. So if the formula is C6H12O2, then the only other possibility is a ring, but that would require two degrees, which isn't possible. So perhaps this option is not correct.

Let me check for option C: C6H10O2.

DOU= (12 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. So that could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

If the compound has a double bond (from the NMR) and a ring (like in a cyclic ester), that would account for the two degrees.

So for example, a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond elsewhere. But lactones are cyclic esters, so perhaps that's possible.

Another option: an ester with a benzene ring. Wait, benzene would account for 3 degrees (3 double bonds) but that's more than two, so that's not possible here. So perhaps a cyclohexene ring with an ester group? That would have a ring and a double bond, which uses up both degrees.

Alternatively, the double bond is in the ester group, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would have a double bond and the ester carbonyl, which is two degrees.

Wait, but the IR for that would have a carbonyl around 1700 and the conjugated double bond might shift the peak a bit lower, perhaps around 1650. Which aligns with the IR data given.

So that's looking promising.

Now, the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. So the molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10 +32=114.

In mass spectrometry, the molecular ion would be at 114. Then, a fragment at 45. So perhaps when the molecule breaks, the ester part breaks off, giving a fragment with a mass of 45.

Wait, if the ester group is, say, an ethyl group, then the fragment would be (CH2CH3O)CO, which doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a larger structure.

Wait, considering the possibility of the fragment being (CH2CH2O)+, which is 45 as I thought earlier. So if part of the molecule is an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), that would contribute 45 (12*2 + 6 + 16 =45).

So perhaps the compound is an ester where the oxygen is connected to an ethylene group, and upon fragmentation, that ethylene group breaks off as a fragment.

Putting it all together, the structure could be something like CH2CH2O-CO-R, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted ester with a double bond.

Another point is the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the double bond is not part of an aromatic ring (since aromatic protons are usually more deshielded and appear downfield). So perhaps it's an isolated double bond, like in an alkene.

So, considering all the clues:

- FTIR: O-H (broad, suggesting maybe an alcohol or carboxylic acid), carbonyl at 1700 (ester or ketone), maybe conjugated carbonyl at 1650.

- 1H NMR: vinyl hydrogens → double bond.

- MS: fragment at 45 → possibly an ethoxy group.

So, the compound is likely an ester with a double bond and an ethoxy group. Let me think of a possible structure: perhaps an ester like vinyl acetate, but that's ethylene with an ester group.

Wait, vinyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH2. Let me check its formula: C4H8O2. But our options are for C6H10O2. So perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, maybe it's something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But let's count: that would be 3 carbons in the acid part, 3 in the ester, but that might not add up. Alternatively, perhaps a six-membered ring with an ester and a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring where one oxygen is part of the ester and another part has a double bond. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester, but that's less likely.

Wait, another approach: the fragment at 45 could be a ketene ion, which has a mass of 45. A ketene has the structure RC=O+, but wait, no, the structure is R2C=O, but the ion would be R2C+=O. Or maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at m/z=45 could be a methyl group attached to something else. But methyl is 15. Hmm, perhaps it's (CH3)2O, which is 45 as I thought before.

So, if the compound has a methoxy group, that would fit. So, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH3. Wait, that's methyl acrylate. Its formula is C4H6O2. But our option is C6H10O2. So we need two more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is something like ethyl propenoate: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That would have the formula C5H8O2. Still not matching our options.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. That's ethyl 3-pentenoate. Formula: C6H10O2. Yes, that's option C.

So, let's see: the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3.

IR: The carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might cause a peak at 1650. The O-H is not present here, but wait, earlier I thought the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which would imply an O-H group. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, so if the structure is an ester without an O-H group, then the broad peak at 3000 wouldn't fit. So perhaps that's not the right structure.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol group somewhere else. So perhaps the compound has both an ester and an alcohol group. But that would require more oxygen atoms, which would change the formula. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a different functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol ester, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto ester. Those have structures like RCOCOR', which would have two carbonyl groups. But the IR only shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester with an alcohol substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an enol form. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the O-H comes from a phenol group. But then the IR would have a peak around 1250 cm^-1 for the C-O stretch, which isn't mentioned here. So that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

Key points:
- IR: O-H (broad, 3000), carbonyl at 1700, another peak at 1650.
- NMR: vinyl Hs → double bond.
- MS: fragment at 45 → possibly (CH3)2O or similar.

The formula options are C6H10O, C6H10O2, etc.

Earlier, I thought option C (C6H10O2) makes more sense because it has two oxygen atoms, fitting an ester and a possible O-H group. But if the structure is an ester with a double bond, which would fit the NMR, and the MS fits a fragment from the ethoxy part.

Wait, but the O-H in IR would require a hydroxyl group. So if the compound is an ester and has an alcohol group, that would require additional oxygen. Let me see, the formula for a diol ester would be something like C6H10O4, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the O-H is from an acid, but then the formula would have two O's, which matches C6H10O2.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a beta-keto acid. For example, something like CH2=C(OH)COOH. But that would have two carboxylic acid groups, which may not fit the formula.

Wait, the formula for a beta-keto acid would be CnH2n-2O3. For n=4, it would be C4H6O3. Not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester with an O-H group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the broad peak in IR at 3000 could be from an alcohol (O-H). But if the compound is an ester, which doesn't have an O-H, then perhaps the O-H is from a different functional group, like an alcohol and an ester in the same molecule. But that would require more O's. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the options again.

Option A: C6H12O2 → molecular weight 116.

Option C: C6H10O2 → molecular weight 114.

The MS fragment is at 45, which is 45. So if the molecular weight is 114, and the fragment is 45, then the remaining would be 69. 69 could be a fragment from the rest of the molecule.

Wait, what's the structure of the compound that would give a fragment at 45?

If the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group, then the ethoxy could break off as CH2CH2O+, which is 45. So the rest of the molecule would have a mass of 114 -45=69.

So the other part would be a 69 mass fragment.

What could that be? Let me think.

69 could be a (CH2)3CO+ group, which is 69. Hmm, 69 is (5*12) + (10*1) +16 = 60+10+16=86, no, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyrate group or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the base structure is an ester where the ethoxy group breaks off, leaving a larger fragment.

Wait, perhaps the compound is methyl cyclohex-2-enoate. Its structure would be O=C-OCH3 attached to a cyclohexene ring. The formula would be C7H10O2. But our options don't have C7, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted acrylic ester.

Another approach: the molecular formula with two O's and a double bond. So for option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond, and the IR shows a carbonyl, which is another double bond. So that would account for two degrees, which fits option C.

So the structure could be an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3 (ethyl acrylate), but that's C5H8O2. So to get to C6, perhaps the acid part is longer.

Wait, maybe it's an ester where the acid is a four-carbon with a double bond, and the alcohol is ethyl. So, for example, CH2CH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, that's three carbons in the acid, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. But I'm not familiar with the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is methyl vinyl benzoate, but that would bring in a benzene ring, which would require more carbons and different degrees.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 is likely from the ethoxy group. So the ester is an ethyl ester. So the structure would have an ethyl group attached via an ester. Then, the rest of the molecule would be a 69 mass fragment.

So, the rest is 69. What could that be? 69 could be a butyl group with some oxygen, but perhaps it's a propyl group with a carbonyl.

Wait, 69 is the mass of (CH2)3CO, which is 5*12 + 8*1 =68? No, wait, (CH2)3CO is 4 carbons (three CH2 and one CO?), but that would be 4*12 + 8 = 56. Hmm, not 69.

Alternatively, 69 could be a propenoyl group (CH2CH2CO), which is 4 carbons: CH2=CHCO-. That would be 56 (3*12 + 6*1 +16)=3*12=36, 6*1=6, 16=58? No, 36+6+16=58.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring attached to something, but not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the structure. Let me think about the options again.

The correct answer is either A, B, C, or D.

We have to pick between C6H10O2 and C6H12O2.

I think the presence of the O-H (from IR) suggests that the compound has an alcohol group. So the formula would have one more O, making it C6H10O2 or C6H12O2.

Wait, but esters have two O's. If the compound is an ester and an alcohol, that would require three O's, which isn't an option here.

Wait, no. Another possibility: the compound is a hemiacetal, which has an O from the carbonyl and an O from the hydroxyl. So the formula would have two O's. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a phenol group, but that would require a benzene ring, which would have more degrees of unsaturation.

Hmm.

Another angle: the O-H in the IR is very broad, which suggests it's a strong hydrogen bond, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But in a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 2500-3000 and very broad. The peak here is at 3000, which could fit a carboxylic acid. But the formula for a carboxylic acid would be CnH2nO2. So, for C6H10O2: 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O. That would fit a five-carbon carboxylic acid (since 2n=10 → n=5). So, pentanoic acid would be C5H10O2. But the formula here is C6H10O2, which is one more carbon. So perhaps it's a substituted acid, like 4-pentenoic acid or something, but I'm not sure.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the IR would have a strong carbonyl at 1700, and the conjugated double bond might cause the 1650 peak. The O-H would be broad around 3000.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so that fits a double bond. So, if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, that would fit the data.

But wait, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2. For a pentenoic acid, it would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. That's five carbons in the acid and one in the double bond? Wait, no, the formula would be C5H8O2, but our option is C6H10O2, which is one more carbon and two more H's. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzoic acid, but that would require more carbons for the benzene ring.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating again.

Let me think about the possible structures again. The key is the IR, NMR, and MS.

If the compound is an ester with an O-H group, but that doesn't seem to fit the oxygen count. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a different functional group.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. But that would have two O's. So the formula would be C6H12O2 (option A) or C6H10O2 (option C). Let's see.

A ketone has a carbonyl, which would explain the 1700 IR peak. The 1650 could be from a conjugated double bond. The O-H would explain the broad peak at 3000. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

So, structure could be something like CH2=CHCH2COCH2OH. Wait, but that's a secondary alcohol and a ketone? No, the carbonyl would be a ketone.

Wait, the structure could be a dihydroxyketone, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexenone with an alcohol substituent. For example, cyclohexenone with an -OH group attached. The formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

In that case, the IR would show the O-H (broad) and the ketone carbonyl (around 1700). The conjugated double bond in the cyclohexene would cause a peak around 1650.

The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens from the cyclohexene double bond.

In mass spec, the fragment at 45 could come from the ethyl group if present, but if the structure is a cyclohexenone, then perhaps the fragment comes from a ring-opening or other process. Alternatively, maybe the -OH group is lost as water, but that would affect the molecular weight.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let's think about the molecular formula for option C: C6H10O2.

If it's a cyclohexenone with an -OH group, the structure would have a six-membered ring with a ketone and a double bond. The formula would fit.

Another possibility is that the structure is a bicyclic compound, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted furan or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the MS fragment at 45 could be from the cleavage of the ester group, leaving an ethoxy fragment. So perhaps the compound is an ester with ethoxy group, and the rest is a four-carbon chain with a double bond and another O.

Wait, another thought: the compound could be an orthoester, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl ester of a substituted acrylic acid. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH3. The formula would be C4H6O2, but again, our options are six carbons.

Hmm, I'm going around in circles here. Let's try to make a decision based on the data.

The presence of O-H suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. For six carbons, that would be C6H12O2 (since n=6 → 2n=12). So the formula would be option A: C6H12O2.

Wait, C6H12O2 would have a molecular weight of 116. The degrees of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So the structure would have a double bond and a ring? No, that would require two degrees. So perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane with a ketone and an O-H group. But that would require two O's and a double bond (from the ketone), which would fit the IR data.

Wait, but cyclohexanone has a ring and a ketone (one double bond equivalent from the ketone). So the formula would be C6H10O. That's option B: C6H10O.

But then the IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1700, which is what's observed. The broad peak at 3000 would be from an O-H group, suggesting perhaps a hydroxyl group attached. So the structure would be cyclohexanol with a ketone? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, cyclohexanone with an additional O-H group elsewhere, but that would require more O's.

Wait, no, that's getting confusing. Let me think again.

If the formula is C6H10O2, the degrees of unsaturation are two. So maybe a double bond and a ring.

So, the structure could be a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group. That would give a double bond (from the ring) and a carbonyl (from the ketone), which accounts for two degrees.

The IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1700 and a conjugated double bond (1650). The O-H in the IR would be from an alcohol group attached to the ring. Then the NMR would show the vinyl hydrogens from the cyclohexene.

But wait, the formula would be C6H10O2. If it's cyclohexene with a ketone and an alcohol, that would require more O's. Hmm, perhaps it's a dihydroxy ketone, but that's getting too complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclopentanone with an ethyl ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted benzaldehyde, but that would require more degrees.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the answer based on the data without getting too deep into the structure.

The key points:

- O-H (broad, 3000): so O-H group.

- Carbonyl (1700): possible ester, ketone, acid.

- Another peak (1650): conjugated carbonyl or double bond.

- Vinyl H in NMR: double bond.

- MS fragment at 45: likely an ethoxy group.

So, considering the formula options and the O's:

If the compound is an ester (O2) with an O-H group, the formula would require O3, which is not an option. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, which has O2. So the formula would be C6H12O2 (option A) or C6H10O2 (option C).

If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. For n=6, it would be C6H12O2 (option A). But that would require no double bonds, which conflicts with the NMR showing vinyl Hs.

Alternatively, if n=5, it would be C5H10O2. To get C6, perhaps it's a substituted acid with a double bond, which would account for the vinyl Hs.

But for C6H10O2, n would be 5, which is C5H10O2. Wait, no, the formula C6H10O2 would imply n=5 for a carboxylic acid, but that would be C5H10O2 (since 2n=10 → n=5). So perhaps the actual structure isn't a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, this is getting really tricky. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me look at the degrees of unsaturation again.

For option C: C6H10O2 → DOU=2.

So, two double bonds or one double bond and one ring.

If the structure has a double bond (from the NMR) and a ring, that uses up the two degrees.

So perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. Like a lactone with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, it's a benzene ring with an ester group, but benzene has three degrees, which would require more than two.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, a six-membered ring with a double bond and an ester group (O-CO-O), but that might require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, which would have two ester groups, but that would require four O's, which isn't an option.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess.

The presence of vinyl Hs and a carbonyl suggests an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The O-H suggests maybe an acid or an alcohol. But the formula options don't allow for an additional O, so perhaps the O-H is from a conjugated system, like an enol.

Wait, enols have O-H and conjugated double bonds. So maybe the compound is an enol ester. Enol esters have structures like CH2=CH-C-O-R. Their IR would show a conjugated carbonyl, which would explain the 1700 and 1650 peaks. The O-H would be from the enol form, which would be broad around 3000. The NMR would show vinyl Hs. The MS fragment of 45 could come from the ester part.

So, if the structure is an enol ester, the formula would be C6H10O2. So option C.

So, the answer would be C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound's spectroscopic data provides the following key insights:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.  
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), with the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak possibly due to conjugation with a double bond.

2. **¹H NMR Analysis**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry (MS)**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of an ethoxy group (CH₃CH₂O⁺), as this fragment is common in compounds with ester functionalities.

### Analysis of the Formula Options:
- **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
  - Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or one double bond).  
  - However, the NMR data indicates the presence of a double bond, which would require at least one degree of unsaturation. This option does not account for the observed vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum.

- **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
  - Degrees of unsaturation = 2 (one ring and one double bond or two double bonds).  
  - While this option accounts for the double bond, the absence of a second oxygen atom makes it inconsistent with the IR data, which indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).

- **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
  - Degrees of unsaturation = 2 (one ring and one double bond or two double bonds).  
  - This option fits the data well:  
    - The double bond explains the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum.  
    - The two oxygen atoms account for the carbonyl group (C=O) observed in the IR spectrum.  
    - The broad O-H peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and the fragment at m/z = 45 in the MS are consistent with an ester or a compound with an ethoxy group.

- **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
  - Degrees of unsaturation = 1 (one ring or one double bond).  
  - Similar to Option A, this option does not account for the observed vinyl hydrogens in the NMR spectrum.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula accounts for the observed IR, NMR, and MS data, including the presence of a double bond, a carbonyl group, and an ethoxy fragment in the mass spectrum.
