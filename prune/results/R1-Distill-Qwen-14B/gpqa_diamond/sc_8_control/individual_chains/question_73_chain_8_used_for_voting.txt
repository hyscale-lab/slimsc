Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, the question gives me two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. The second is 3m moving at 0.5c in the same direction. The options are about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. You have to use the velocity addition formula. I remember it's something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be the speed of the faster one minus the slower, but considering relativity.

Wait, wait. Let me get the formula right. The relative speed formula is u = (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1*u2)/c²). But since u1 is the speed of the first astronaut relative to the second's frame, or vice versa? Wait, no. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, then from B's frame, A's speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let's compute that.

So the numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel=0.14c. So that's a good start.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic kinetic energy, so I need to calculate their energies and sum them.

The total energy E is the sum of their rest masses plus their kinetic energies. Wait, no, in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass as well. The total energy of each is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36)=1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25.

So his energy E1 is gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy E2 is gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and option B is 4.96. So option C seems to match the energy part.

So combining both, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². So I think the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait. Another thing to consider: the rest mass energy. Wait, no, in the calculation I included the rest mass. Because E = gamma m c² includes the rest mass as when v=0, gamma=1, so E=mc². So yes, I think it's correct.

Double-check the relative speed: 0.6c and 0.5c, same direction. So (0.6-0.5)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)/1) = 0.1/(1-0.3)=0.1/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c, so yes.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed formula in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
