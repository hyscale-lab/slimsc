Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, so the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔQ = sqrt⟨Q²⟩ - ⟨Q⟩², right? So for ΔP_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩², then take the square root.

But wait, the state is already given as a vector. Let me write that down. Let's denote the state as |ψ⟩. The components are |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but wait a second. In quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually column vectors, and the components are in the basis of the eigenstates of P_z. So the basis here is the eigenbasis of P_z, which makes sense because the matrix for P_z is diagonal in this basis. Because P_z has a diagonal matrix, its eigenvectors are the basis vectors.

So first, let's find ⟨P_z⟩. Since |ψ⟩ is a vector in the P_z basis, ⟨P_z⟩ is the expectation value, which is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Looking at the matrix for P_z: it's diagonal with elements ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ (for the first basis vector), 0 (second), and -ħ (third).

The state ψ is [ a, b, c ]^T, where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c= -1/2. So the coefficients for each eigenstate are a, b, c.

The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is a* (ħ) + b* (0) + c*(-ħ). Wait, but wait. Wait, the expectation value is the sum of the coefficients squared times the corresponding eigenvalues. Because the state is already normalized, right?

Wait, let me think. The state is ψ = a|eigenstate_1> + b|eigenstate_2> + c|eigenstate_3>.

Each |eigenstate_i> has eigenvalue p_i for P_z. So the expectation value is a* p_1 + b* p_2 + c*p_3. Wait, no. Wait, no, because the expectation value is ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, it's just the sum of |a|^2 * p_1 + |b|^2 * p_2 + |c|^2 * p_3.

Wait, but wait: the state given is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of squares is (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25) = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * p1 + |b|^2 * p2 + |c|^2 * p3.

Calculating each term:

a is (-1/2), so |a|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

p1 is ħ.

b is 1/√2, so |b|^2 is (1/2), and p2 is 0.

c is (-1/2), so |c|^2 is 1/4, p3 is -ħ.

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = [ (1/4) - (1/4) ] ħ = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. So the average is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩?

Well, P_z squared is just (P_z)^2. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² will have the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal.

So P_z^2 has eigenvalues (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So,

⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|^2*(ħ²) + |b|^2*(0) + |c|^2*(ħ²) = (1/4) ħ² + (1/4) ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Wait, that's because (1/4) + (1/4) = 1/2.

So ΔP_z = sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) ħ = (1/√2) ħ.

So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, let me double-check. The state is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Its components squared are 1/4, 1/2, 1/4. So yes, each term in ⟨P_z⟩ is (1/4)*ħ, (1/2)*0, (1/4)*(-ħ) → 0.

And for ⟨P_z²⟩, each term is (1/4)*ħ², (1/2)*0, (1/4)*ħ². So 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 ħ².

So sqrt(1/2 ħ²) is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$. Since the basis vectors are the eigenstates of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The squared magnitudes are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ has eigenvalues $\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2$ (the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$). Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the squared magnitudes:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
