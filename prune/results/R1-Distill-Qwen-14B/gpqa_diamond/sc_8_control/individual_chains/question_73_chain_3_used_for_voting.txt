Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. So the formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, which one is moving relative to the other? Let's see, if one is moving at 0.6c and the other at 0.5c, the relative speed isn't just 0.1c because that's what you'd get classically. But relativity says otherwise.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)) when you're finding the speed of one object as seen from the other. But which way? Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the 2m astronaut as seen from the 3m one would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, no, actually, wait: the problem says 'relative speed' without specifying direction. So I should compute the speed of one as seen from the other. Let me pick the 3m astronaut's frame. So the velocity of the 2m astronaut relative to the 3m would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the 2m's speed (0.6c), and v is the 3m's speed (0.5c).

So plugging in: (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c. Then denominator: 1 - (0.6 * 0.5) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, that matches some of the options.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, could I have mixed up the order? Because if you take v as the 2m's speed and u as the 3m's, then the formula would give (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5*0.6)) which gives negative 0.1c / 0.7, so that's -0.14c. But relative speed is a magnitude, so it's 0.14c either way. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, which is option C and D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. I think the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. So the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 *3m *c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc², which is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c, which fits. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower.

Wait, but I thought the options would sum to that. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, wait, E1 = gamma1 * m1 c². So for first astronaut: gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/0.8=1.25. m1 is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc². Correct.

Second astronaut: gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. m2 is 3m, so E2=1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc². Sum is 5.964, which rounds to 5.96 mc². So the answer should have E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. So that's option C.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Yes. So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of one object as seen from the other. The formula is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) (speed of the 2m astronaut) and \(v = 0.5c\) (speed of the 3m astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the 2m astronaut (\(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For the 3m astronaut (\(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**.
