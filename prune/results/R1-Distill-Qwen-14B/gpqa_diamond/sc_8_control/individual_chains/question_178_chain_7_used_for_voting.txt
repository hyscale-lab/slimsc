Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and then determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, what's σ_{μν}? Oh right, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which for electromagnetism would be ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, but I guess here it's a general tensor.

So, to find the mass dimension of κ, I need to determine the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 since it's integrated over spacetime (which is dimension 4) to get an action dimensionless in natural units.

Let me remember the mass dimensions of the fields. For a Dirac field ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the kinetic term is ∫ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ d^4x, so the Lagrangian term ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have dimension 4. ψ and ψ̄ each have dimension 3/2, so their product is 3. Adding ∂_μ which is dimension 1, the whole term is dimension 4. So each ψ is 3/2.

Now, F^{μν} is a field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, it's ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1, and Aμ has dimension 1 (since the action term is ∫F^2, which is dimension 4. F has dimension 2, so (∫ F^μν F_{μν} d^4x) would be (∫ (dim 2)^2 d^4x ) → 4 dimensions? Wait: Each F is dimension 2, because A is dimension 1, and each derivative in F brings a dimension 1. So F is dimension 2. Then F^2 is dimension 4, and ∫ F^2 is dimension 4 + 4 (wait, no, the integral is over 4 dimensions, so the integrand must have dimension 4. So yes, F^2 has dimension 4, so F has dimension 2.)

So, F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Now, in the term σ_{μν} ψ̄ ψ F^{μν}, let's break it down. Each σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are built from gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless because they're just matrices; their indices don't contribute to mass dimension. So each σ_{μν} is a tensor with two indices, but more importantly, in terms of mass dimension, because it's made from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, σ_{μν} has the same dimension as the product of two derivatives (since it's a commutator of γ matrices and you're considering their indices as part of the tensor). Wait, no. Wait, in terms of the field content, σ_{μν} is actually a product of γ matrices, so each term in [γ_μ, γ_ν] is γ_μ γ_ν, which is dimensionless because γ matrices are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. Hmm, wait, that might not be right. Because when you have [γ_μ, γ_ν], each γ has dimension 0, so their commutator is dimension 0. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

So putting it all together: the term in the Lagrangian is κ times ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ is dimension 3. σ_{μν} is dimensionless. F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the entire term is ψ̄ σ ψ F → dimension 3 + 0 + 2 = 5.

The Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term κ times (dimension 5) must have dimension 4. So κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The Lagrangian term is κ times ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the dimensions of each part: ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2, so 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. F has dimension 2. So 3 * 2 = 6? Wait no, because it's ψ̄ σ ψ multiplied by F. Wait, the structure is ψ̄ (σ_{μν}) ψ F^{μν}, so all four factors are multiplied. So the product of their dimensions is (3/2) * (0) [σ is dimensionless] * (3/2) * (2) → (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2 = 4.5. So the entire term is 4.5. The Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by that, so κ must make up the difference to 4. So 4.5 + [κ] = 4 → [κ] = -0.5. Wait, that can't be right, because I thought [κ] was -1. Did I do the dimensions wrong?

Hmm, perhaps I messed up F's dimension. Let me think again. The field strength tensor F^{μν} for a gauge field A^ν is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. Each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1. So F is dimension 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So, in the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3 (because 3/2 + 3/2). F is 2, so the product is 3*2=6? No, wait, no. Wait, no, in the term, it's ψ̄ σ F ψ? Or is it ψ̄ σ ψ times F? So the term is (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. So ψ̄ σ ψ is dimension 3, F is 2. 3 * 2 = 6? Wait, but then the Lagrangian's term is κ times (something of dimension 6). But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So κ must have dimension 4 -6 = -2. But that seems conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Let me parse the term correctly: it's κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Wait, the term is a product of ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. So each of these is multiplied together. So the total dimension is [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F].

Wait, no. Wait, the Lagrangian is a sum of terms, each with their own dimensions. Each term must have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

So L_int is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

So the dimensions:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2.

σ_{μν} is [γ matrices], which are dimensionless. So dimension 0.

ψ has 3/2.

F has 2.

So adding them up: 3/2 + 0 + 3/2 + 2 = (3/2 +3/2) is 3, plus 2 is 5.

So the term is dimension 5. So κ must have dimension -1 to make the term dimension 4. Because 5 + (-1) =4.

Yes, that's correct. So [κ]_M is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the interaction terms' mass dimensions. In general, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its mass dimension is less than or equal to 4. Because in the counterterms, operators can only have up to dimension 4 (since higher dimensions would require higher-order terms in perturbation theory that grow with energy, making the theory non-renormalizable).

Wait, no. Wait, the dimension of the coupling constants is what determines renormalizability. For a term of the form g φ^n, the coupling g must have dimension [g] = 4 - n*(d/2), where d is the spacetime dimension. For 4 dimensions, it's 4 - (n/2)*d. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. The coupling κ in our term must have dimension [κ] = 4 - [ψ̄ σ ψ F]. But earlier, we calculated that the term has dimension 5, so [κ] is -1.

In terms of renormalizability, couplings in the interaction terms must have mass dimension >=0. Because if their dimension is negative, the interactions become relevant, and the theory might not be renormalizable.

Wait, I think the rule is that a renormalizable theory requires all couplings to have positive mass dimension. Wait, no, wait. The mass dimension of the coupling determines the superficial degree of divergence. In a renormalizable theory, all couplings have dimension ≤4 (but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact condition).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the superficial degree of divergence. For a Feynman diagram with a vertex of a certain type, the number of loops is related to the superficial degree. If each vertex contributes a certain negative dimension, the theory could be non-renormalizable.

Wait, another way: The dimension of the coupling [g] must be positive or zero for the theory to be renormalizable. Because if [g] is negative, the interaction becomes strong at low energies, which suggests the theory is effective and not fundamental (non-renormalizable).

So, in our case, [κ] is -1. Negative. That implies the theory is not renormalizable. Because the coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction terms are of higher dimension, leading to non-renormalizable interactions.

So putting it together: κ has dimension -1, and the theory isn't renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option A says [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable. No, because [κ] is negative.

Option B: [κ]=1, renormalizable. No, [κ] is not 1.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. Yes.

Option D: [κ]=1, not renormalizable. No.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from the commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must have mass dimension 4, as the Lagrangian is integrated over spacetime. Breaking down the dimensions:
- $[\bar{\psi}]_M = [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.

Thus, the combined dimension of $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
\left[\bar{\psi}\right]_M + \left[\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right]_M + \left[\psi\right]_M + \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right]_M = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
To ensure the Lagrangian term has dimension 4, $\kappa$ must have dimension:
\[
\left[\kappa\right]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is of higher dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M$ is negative, and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M$ is not 1.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as $[\kappa]_M$ is negative, and the theory is non-renormalizable.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M$ is not 1.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
