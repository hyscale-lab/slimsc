Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out which energy difference would allow us to clearly distinguish between these two energy levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with the lifetime of a state. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, I think the exact value might be a bit fuzzy, but I know that ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s. But wait, the question gives the lifetimes in seconds, and the options in eV. So I need to convert units properly.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to calculate exact numbers. The idea is that for the energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy due to their lifetimes. If the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty might be larger, making it hard to tell them apart.

So each state has its own lifetime. Let me think about each one.

The first state has a lifetime τ1 of 1e-9 seconds. The uncertainty in time for this state would be roughly τ1, so Δt ≈ 1e-9 s. Plugging into the uncertainty principle:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2 * τ1)
Similarly for τ2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2*τ2)

Wait, but wait. Since τ2 is larger, ΔE2 would be smaller than ΔE1. Because a longer lifetime means lower energy uncertainty. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

But wait, how does this relate to distinguishing the energy levels? I think for the two states to be resolved, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe larger than the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps each state's uncertainty is a consideration.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the uncertainty in each state's energy. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the two states might overlap and not be distinguishable.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement, which is tied to the lifetime. So, the minimal detectable ΔE is on the order of ħ/τ.

Wait, the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy levels are too close, the uncertainty from each state's lifetime would make it hard to tell them apart.

Wait, but the two states each have their own lifetimes. So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1), and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2). The energy difference between them, ΔE, needs to be greater than the sum of these two uncertainties? Or perhaps each one's uncertainty.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the energy resolution. The energy resolution in an experiment is often limited by the time over which you measure. If you measure for a time Δt, then the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt. To resolve two energy levels, the difference between their energies must be larger than this uncertainty.

But wait, in this case, each state has its own lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty is ΔE_i = ħ/(2τ_i). So for the two states, their uncertainties would be ΔE1 and ΔE2.

So, to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or perhaps the maximum of the two. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. No, because if ΔE is larger than, say, the larger of the two uncertainties, then it's definitely larger than both.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate for each state the minimum detectable energy difference. So, for a given state, the uncertainty is ΔE = ħ/τ (ignoring the 1/2 for simplicity). So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps just greater than the larger of the two uncertainties.

Wait, no. Let me think: if you have two states, to distinguish them, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the measurement. But where does the measurement uncertainty come from? It would be the uncertainty in each state's energy, which depends on their lifetimes.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the measurement time. Suppose you measure the energy for a duration Δt, then the energy uncertainty is about ħ/Δt. But in this question, each state has a specific lifetime. So for state 1, the uncertainty is ħ/(2τ1), and for state 2, it's ħ/(2τ2).

So the energy difference between the two must be larger than the sum of these two uncertainties, or perhaps larger than the maximum of the two. Because if the energy difference is smaller than either, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, I think the correct condition is that the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because each state's energy is uncertain by their own ΔE. So the difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than the maximum of the two ΔE's, because if it's not, then the uncertainty in one state could overlap with the other.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient that the energy difference is greater than the sum of the two individual uncertainties. Let me think: if E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2, then they are clearly separated. Because their uncertainties are around each state, so the total possible overlap would be the sum. So the energy difference has to be more than the sum to ensure no overlap.

Wait, but let's compute the numbers. Let's compute each state's ΔE.

First, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Calculating ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-9) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-9 = approx 5.25e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 5.25e-26 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 3.28e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) = 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.25e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.25e-27 / 1.602e-19 = approx 3.28e-8 eV.

So for E2 and E1, the uncertainties are about 3.28e-7 eV and 3.28e-8 eV, respectively.

So the sum of the uncertainties is about 3.6e-7 eV. The maximum is ~3.28e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than, say, 3.28e-7 eV. That would ensure that the two states are distinguishable because their energy levels don't overlap within the uncertainty.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is smaller than 3.28e-7. So no, this is smaller than the maximum uncertainty, so cannot be resolved.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → way too small.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → way larger than the required ~3e-7 eV. So yes, this would work.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is smaller than the maximum uncertainty of 3.28e-7 eV. So no.

Wait, so the correct answer should be option C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recalculate the uncertainties.

Wait, tau for E1 is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 is ħ/(2τ1). Let me compute that again numerically.

Compute ΔE1 in eV:

ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s.

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * 1e-9 s) = 1.055e-34 / (2e-9) = approximately 5.275e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.275e-26 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(2 * 1e-8 s) = 1.055e-34/(2e-8) = 5.275e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.275e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the maximum uncertainty is 3.29e-7 eV (from E1), and E2's uncertainty is smaller. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than (ΔE1 + ΔE2) if I'm considering the sum. Or perhaps, it just needs to be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because that would ensure that there's no overlap between the two states' energy ranges.

So, sum is 3.29e-7 + 3.29e-8 = approximately 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 3.62e-7 eV. Let's see the options again.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 3.62e-7. So that would definitely work.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is much smaller than 3.62e-7. So that's insufficient.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine which energy difference allows us to clearly distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately equal to \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant. For a state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau}.
\]

The lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using these values, we calculate the energy uncertainties:

1. For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.275 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{s}} \approx 5.275 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.275 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient to resolve the energy levels.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient to resolve the energy levels.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it satisfies the condition for resolving the energy levels.
