Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm supposed to find out how many possible organic products there are. Hmm.

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, that's meta-bromobenzene or para-bromobenzene? No, wait. The numbering is 1 and 2. Benzene has six carbons, so 1 and 2 are adjacent. Oh, so it's 1-bromo-2-d something. Wait, maybe the 'd' stands for deuterium? Like, the compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? So the structure is a benzene ring with a bromine on carbon 1 and a deuterium on carbon 2.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Oh, that's a strong base, right? It's used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Oh, wait, but in aromatic substitution maybe? Or is it a benzene ring undergoing some kind of substitution?

Wait, I'm a bit rusty. Let me think. Benzene with a leaving group like Br. In aromatic substitution, like a Friedel-Crafts, but wait, that's for electrophilic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base. Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond, like a benzyn or something? Or perhaps it's a ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, another thought: maybe the bromide is undergoing elimination. If the solvent is ammonia, that could lead to a benzene ring with a triple bond. Wait, but how? Oh, wait, considering the presence of a deuterium, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation with a neighboring hydrogen.

So the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the bromine is on carbon 1, and the deuterium is on carbon 2. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, which is a good source of NH2^- ions, perhaps it abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination.

Wait, but in benzene, the positions are adjacent. So if the Br is on C1 and D on C2, then maybe the base abstracts a proton from C3 or C6? Because those are the positions adjacent to the Br and not the D.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so carbon 1 has Br, carbon 2 has D. The adjacent carbons to Br are C2 and C6. Oh, but C2 has D. So if the base wants to abstract a proton adjacent to Br, it would have to be from C6 or maybe C3? Hmm, maybe in this case, the base can't abstract from C2 because it's deuterated. So the possible positions are C3 and C6. But wait, wait, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others. So the Br is on C1, adjacent to C2 and C6. So if C2 has D, then the adjacent H would be on C6 and perhaps C3? Or is the base only able to abstract from positions that are meta or something else?

Wait, another approach: when a benzene ring has a leaving group (like Br), and a strong base is present, it can lead to elimination, forming a triple bond. The reaction would form a benzyn intermediate, perhaps. So the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzyn (a diradical or a triple bond).

Wait, so in this case, the Br is on C1, and the D is on C2. So the H adjacent to Br could be from C2 or C6. But C2 has D, so the H is not present there. So the only available H adjacent to Br is from C6. Wait, because in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So the only H adjacent to Br (on C1) would be on C2 and C6. But if C2 has D, then only C6 has H available for abstraction.

Wait, so the base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton from C6, adjacent to Br on C1. That would lead to the formation of a benzyn between C1 and C6. So the Br would leave, and the ring would form a triple bond between C1 and C6.

But wait, then the product would be benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C6, but the D is on C2. Wait, but how does that affect substitution?

Wait, no, maybe the product is benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C2? No, because the D is on C2 and the Br is on C1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzyn intermediate, and then undergoing some ring expansion or contraction, or perhaps undergoing a hydrogen shift.

Wait, another thought: when benzene has a Br and a H adjacent, the elimination would form a triple bond. So in the starting material, the Br is on C1, and the D on C2. So the only H adjacent to Br is on C6. So the base abstracts that H, leading to elimination of Br^- and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6.

But wait, that would result in a triple bond between C1 and C6, making a benzyn. But then, how does the D on C2 affect this? Since the D is on C2, maybe it's part of the ring and doesn't affect the position of the triple bond.

So the product would be a benzyn with a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, benzyn is a very unstable structure, so perhaps it rearranges. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a biradical or undergoes some kind of ring expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, no, because elimination of H and Br would form a triple bond, not just a double. Or maybe it's a single elimination to form a double bond, but I think with NaNH2, it's more likely to go all the way to the triple bond.

Wait, but in this case, since the deuterium is on C2, the adjacent H is only on C6, so elimination can only happen in one way, leading to a single product.

But wait, wait. Benzyn can have different positions for the triple bond. Or is the position fixed based on where the Br and D are?

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

C1 has Br, C2 has D. So the ring has positions 1 (Br), 2 (D), and the others are Hs. The base abstracts a proton from a carbon adjacent to the Br, which would be C2 or C6. But C2 has D, so only C6 has H. So the base abstracts H from C6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6.

So the product would be a benzyn with triple bond between C1 and C6. Then, perhaps it can undergo various reactions, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So if only one elimination product is formed, then the number is one.

Wait, but wait. The D on C2 is a deuterium, which is a heavier isotope of H. Does that affect the reaction? Well, in this case, the base is looking for a proton adjacent to Br. Since C2 has D, the H is not available there, so the only possible site is C6. So elimination can only occur in one way, leading to a single product.

But wait, could the base abstract a proton from another position, like meta to Br? No, because the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent (beta hydrogen) for elimination. So only C6 and C2 are adjacent to Br on C1, but C2 has D, so only C6 is available.

Alternatively, maybe the base can abstract a proton from a position that's not directly adjacent but in a way that allows for some kind of shift. But I'm not sure about that. Maybe the possibility of a benzyne intermediate allows for some ring migration, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. When the base abstracts a proton from C6, the Br leaves, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. So the product is a benzyn. But benzyns are highly strained and can undergo various reactions. However, in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the benzyn would not form, but instead, a different reaction occurs.

Wait, maybe instead of elimination, the Br could undergo some kind of substitution. But NaNH2 is a base, not a Lewis acid. So substitution reactions like nucleophilic aromatic substitution are less likely because they usually require activating groups, and NaNH2 might not provide the necessary conditions for that. Also, the D on C2 is a deuterium, which is a heavier isotope but doesn't activate the ring towards substitution.

Hmm. Alternatively, could the deuterium have any effect on the reaction? Since deuterium is a heavier isotope, it might have a kinetic isotope effect. So if the base is abstracting a proton, it's more difficult when the adjacent H is D because of the lower zero-point energy. So in this case, since the H on C6 is regular H, the base can abstract it easily, but the H on C2 is D, so it's not abstracted. So the only possible elimination is from C6.

So the product after elimination would be a benzyn with a triple bond between C1 and C6. Now, considering the structure of benzene, a triple bond is between two adjacent carbons. So the benzyn would have that triple bond. But wait, in benzyn, the triple bond can be in different positions, but in this case, it's fixed between C1 and C6 because that's where the Br and H were.

So the product is a single compound. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is one.

Wait, but wait another moment. Could there be any other products? For example, if the base abstracts a proton from a different position, but I don't think so because the only possible H adjacent to Br is on C6. So only one product.

So the answer should be option B) 1.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with a bromine atom on carbon 1 and a deuterium atom on carbon 2) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base that facilitates dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzyn intermediate. 

In this case, the bromine atom is located on carbon 1, and the deuterium atom is on carbon 2. The base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine to form a triple bond. The only available proton for abstraction is on carbon 6, as carbon 2 is deuterated and cannot donate a proton. This results in the formation of a benzyn with a triple bond between carbon 1 and carbon 6.

Since the deuterium on carbon 2 does not interfere with the reaction and there is only one possible site for hydrogen abstraction (carbon 6), the reaction produces a single product. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **1**.
