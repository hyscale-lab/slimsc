Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about the luminosities of two stars. Let me try to unpack what's being asked. 

The question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They observed the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest and found they're the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same because b is a constant. That makes sense.

Wait, but what about their luminosities? Luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I remember is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So since both stars have the same temperature (because their lambda_max are the same), the luminosity should depend on R squared times T to the fourth. But since T is same, L is proportional to R².

Wait, but wait. Star_1 has radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So if R_1 = 1.5 R_2, then L_1 would be (1.5)^2 times L_2, right? Because L is proportional to R². So 1.5 squared is 2.25. So L_1 is 2.25 times L_2. So the factor would be about 2.25. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. Hmm, but wait, the question mentions something about radial velocities. Oh right, they give radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 is 700 km/s. How does that factor in?

Wait, wait. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. How does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, that's the Doppler effect. When a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. The formula for Doppler shift is something like delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, but that's for non-relativistic speeds. Alternatively, the observed wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, but if the star is moving away, v_r is positive, making the observed wavelength longer (redshifted). If moving towards, v_r is negative, shorter wavelength (blueshifted).

But wait, in the question, the peak wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. But their rest lambda_max would depend on their actual temperatures. Wait, but earlier I thought that since observed lambda_max are same, their temperatures would be same. But wait, if one star is moving towards us and the other away, their rest wavelengths would be different, but observed same. Wait, but in the problem, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. So Star_1 isn't moving, but Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So the observed lambda_max for both stars is same. Let me think.

Star_1's rest frame: lambda1 = b / T1. Star_2's rest frame: lambda2 = b / T2. But observed lambda_max for Star_2 would be lambda2_obs = lambda2 * (1 + v_r2 / c), where v_r2 is 700 km/s. Since the observed lambda_max for Star_2 must equal that of Star_1, which is lambda1.

So, lambda1 = lambda2_obs. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c)

Since b cancels out,

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c)

Which can be rearranged as:

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2 / c)

Wait, but wait. v_r is 700 km/s. What's the speed relative to the speed of light? Let me compute v_r2/c. 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. The speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333... So about 2.33% of the speed of light.

So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.023333.

So T1 = T2 / (1.023333) ≈ T2 * 0.977.

Wait, but that's a problem. Because earlier, I thought that the temperatures were the same because the observed lambda_max are same. But now, with the Doppler shift considered, the temperatures are different. So I need to correct the earlier assumption.

So let me reevaluate. Let me denote:

Star_1: R1 = 1.5 R2; M1 = 1.5 M2; v1 = 0 km/s.

Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s.

Observed lambda_max for both is same: lambda_obs_1 = lambda_obs_2.

For Star_1: lambda_obs_1 = lambda1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2: lambda_obs_2 = lambda2_rest * (1 + v2/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Set them equal:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v2/c)

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

So, T1 is lower than T2. Because denominator is greater than 1, so T1 = T2 * (1/(1 + v2/c)).

So, T1 < T2. Therefore, Star_2 is hotter than Star_1.

Wait, but earlier I thought the temperatures were the same, but that's only if the stars are not moving towards or away. But here, Star_2's light is redshifted, so its observed lambda_max is longer. But in the problem, the observed lambda_max is same for both stars, so Star_2 must have a longer rest wavelength, meaning lower temperature, but wait no, no: because Star_2's observed lambda_max is (lambda2_rest) * (1 + v2/c). Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, v2 is positive, so (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1, so lambda2_obs is longer than lambda2_rest. So if lambda1_rest (Star_1's rest lambda_max) equals lambda2_obs, then lambda1_rest = longer than lambda2_rest. But lambda is inversely proportional to temperature, so longer lambda means lower temperature. So Star_1's rest frame has a longer lambda than Star_2's, implying T1 < T2.

Hmm, so earlier assumption that T1 = T2 was wrong because the Doppler effect changes the observed wavelengths, so the stars have different temperatures, but their observed peak wavelengths are same.

So, the luminosity L is given by L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So, L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.
L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

The ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4)

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

We need T1 and T2. From earlier, T1 = T2 * (1/(1 + v2/c)).

Wait, no, from earlier, T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c), right? Because 1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v2/c) → T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + (v2/c)).

Let me compute 1 + (v2/c):

v2 = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s = 300,000 km/s.

v2/c = 700/3e5 = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.0023333.

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.0023333.

So T1 = T2 / 1.0023333 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So, (T1 / T2) = 0.99767.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4.

Compute 0.99767^4: Let's see. Let me compute 0.99767^2 first.

0.99767^2 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.00233) + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.9953454.

Then, square that result: 0.9953454^2 ≈ (1 - 0.0046546)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.0046546) + (0.0046546)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093092 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.9907124.

Wait, wait, but 0.99767 is approximately 0.99767.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation (1 - x)^n ≈ 1 - nx when x is small.

x here is 0.002333 for v2/c. So, T1 is T2*(1 - x), x=0.002333.

So, (T1/T2) = (1 - x).

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x.

So x is 0.002333, so 4x = 0.009332. So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1 - 0.009332 = 0.990668.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990668.

Wait, but the exact value, using a calculator, would be better. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more precisely.

But for the sake of this problem, let's proceed with the approximation.

So, (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ 0.990668.

Now, the ratio L1/L2 is (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = ( (1.5)^2 ) * (0.990668) )

1.5 squared is 2.25.

So 2.25 * 0.990668 ≈ 2.2275.

So approximately 2.2275.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.2275 is approximately 2.23. So the factor is about 2.23.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, because T1 is (T2)/(1 + (v2/c)), so T1 = T2 * (1/(1 + 0.002333)) = T2 * (1 / 1.002333) ≈ T2 * 0.997667.

So, (T1 / T2) = 0.997667.

So, (T1 / T2)^4 = (0.997667)^4.

Let me compute 0.997667^4 more accurately.

Compute 0.997667^2 first.

0.997667 * 0.997667:

= (1 - 0.002333)^2

= 1 - 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2

= 1 - 0.004666 + 0.000005444

≈ 0.995339444.

Now, square that result to get the 4th power.

0.995339444^2 = ?

= (1 - 0.004660556)^2

= 1 - 2*(0.004660556) + (0.004660556)^2

= 1 - 0.009321112 + 0.000021717

≈ 0.9907006.

Hmm, so (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * 0.9907 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23.

So the factor is about 2.23. So option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I might have confused the Doppler shift formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But if the object is moving away, v_r is positive, so lambda_obs is longer. But what if the star is moving towards us? Then v_r is negative, so lambda_obs is shorter.

In this case, Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away, so lambda_obs_2 = lambda2_rest * (1 + 700/(3e5)).

Wait, 700/(3e5) is 0.0023333, as before.

So, lambda_obs_2 = lambda2_rest * (1.0023333).

And lambda_obs_1 = lambda1_rest.

Since the observed lambda_max are the same,

lambda1_rest = lambda2_rest * 1.0023333.

So,

lambda1_rest / lambda2_rest = 1.0023333.

But lambda is inversely proportional to temperature: lambda = b / T.

So,

lambda1_rest / lambda2_rest = T2 / T1.

Thus,

T2 / T1 = 1.0023333 → T1 = T2 / 1.0023333 ≈ T2 * 0.997668.

So, the earlier calculation was correct.

Hmm, so the ratio L1/L2 is ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * (T1/T2)^4.

R1/R2 is 1.5, so squared is 2.25.

T1/T2 is (T2/(1.0023333)) / T2 = 1/(1.0023333) ≈ 0.997668.

So (0.997668)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23. So the correct answer is option D.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant physics principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars.

2. **Luminosity Formula**:
   Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   Thus, the ratio of luminosities is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
   \]

3. **Wien's Law**:
   The peak wavelength of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
   \]
   Since the observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars, we account for the Doppler effect:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{v_r}{c} \right)
   \]
   For Star_1 (\( v_1 = 0 \)):
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}
   \]
   For Star_2 (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{700}{300,000} \right)
   \]
   Setting \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we find:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{700}{300,000} \right)
   \]
   Using \( \lambda \propto 1/T \), this implies:
   \[
   T_1 = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{700}{300,000}}
   \]
   Compute \( \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333 \), so:
   \[
   T_1 = T_2 \cdot \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx T_2 \cdot 0.997667
   \]

4. **Temperature Ratio**:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.997667
   \]
   Raise this to the fourth power:
   \[
   \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \approx (0.997667)^4
   \]
   Compute \( (0.997667)^4 \):
   - First, \( (0.997667)^2 \approx 0.99534 \).
   - Then, \( (0.99534)^2 \approx 0.9907 \).

5. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   Substituting into the luminosity formula:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
   \]
   Given \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), \( \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 = 1.5^2 = 2.25 \). Thus:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   The factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 is approximately **2.23**.
