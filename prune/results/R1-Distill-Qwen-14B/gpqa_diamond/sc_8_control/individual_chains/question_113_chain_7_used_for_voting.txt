Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let's start with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretches. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Also, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's hydrogen bonding, which is common in acids or maybe something else.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, aromatic rings like benzene, but the 1650 is lower than a typical aromatic C=C which is around 1600. Or maybe it's conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe in an alkene group or maybe part of a ring.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments might include CH3CO+ (which is 43, but maybe with some isotopes), or maybe something else. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment like (CH2)2O or similar. Let me think: the molecular ion breaks down into smaller ions. For example, in esters, maybe the ester group breaks off. Alternatively, a fragment like C3H7O might be 45? Let me calculate the molecular weight for 45: 45 is C3H7O? Carbon is 12, H7 is 7, O is 16. 12*3=36, plus 7=43, plus 16=59? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe it's another structure. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2)2CO, but that's getting more complicated. Maybe I should think about this more after looking at other data.

Looking back at the possible formulas, let's list them:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

Each of these has different possible functional groups and structures.

The FTIR has a broad peak around 3000 cm^-1, which suggests an OH group. So the compound likely has an alcohol (-OH) or a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually even broader and might show a peak around 2500-3300 as a very broad peak. But the question says a very broad peak, so maybe either.

The carbonyl peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong carbonyl, maybe an ester, ketone, or aldehyde. The 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, such as an enone. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl with an aromatic ring, like in an aromatic ketone.

So putting this together, perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl group and an OH group. For example, an ester with an OH group, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an alcohol. Wait, but if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700. If it's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring or another conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: the 1700 and 1650 could be two different types of carbonyl groups, but that's less likely for a small molecule. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C. But wait, aromatic C=C is usually around 1600, so 1650 is a bit higher. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone system. So perhaps the compound has an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. That would explain the 1650 cm^-1.

Looking at the NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So perhaps the compound has both a carbonyl and a double bond nearby, making it an enone. Then, with the OH group, maybe it's a cyclic ketone with an OH group or something else.

Wait, the options have different molecular formulas. Let's think about possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X and N are 0 here. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2= (14-12)/2= 1 degree. So one ring or one double bond. But if it has both an OH and a carbonyl, maybe that's two groups, but how?

Wait, wait, let me compute the degrees of unsaturation correctly. The formula is C6H12O2. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So 2*6 +2=14. 14 -12=2. 2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. So that could be one ring or one double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So this structure must have a double bond.

But wait, if it's C6H12O2, with a double bond, then maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) or an ester with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe a diol with a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Option C is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 2*6 + 2=14, 14 -10=4. 4/2=2. So two degrees. That could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, perhaps a double bond is present. So maybe a ring and a double bond. Or maybe two double bonds, but less likely in a six-carbon molecule.

Option D is C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond. But it also has an OH group (from the IR), so maybe a cyclohexanol with a carbonyl group? But how?

Wait, another thought: the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which could be an -OH. So the compound has an -OH group. So the formula must include at least one O for the hydroxyl. Let's check which options have that.

All four options have O, so that's fine. Now, which of these could have both an -OH and a carbonyl group?

Looking at the options, options A, C, and D have O in their formula. Let's see:

Option A: C6H12O2. With two oxygens, perhaps an ester (which has two O's) and an OH. But wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R. So that would have two O's in the ester group. If the compound also has an OH elsewhere, that would require three O's. Wait, but option A has two O's. So maybe it's an ester plus another O somewhere. Hmm, perhaps not. Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. So, a secondary alcohol and a ketone. But then the formula would have one O for the alcohol and another for the ketone, making two O's. So option A would fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Then, it would have two O's (COOH has two O's in the functional group). But the IR could show a very broad peak for the -COOH O-H. But in that case, the carbonyl would be around 1700, which matches the first peak. So a carboxylic acid would have an O-H stretch around 2500-3300 as a broad peak. But the problem says the broad peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower than typical for -COOH. But it's possible.

The other peak at 1650 could be from an aromatic ring, but without more information, it's hard to say.

Moving on to the NMR: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So the structure has a double bond. So in a six-carbon molecule, perhaps it's something like cyclohexene with substituents.

Wait, but if the compound has both an -OH and a double bond, and a carbonyl, perhaps it's an enol. Wait, but enols have adjacent double bonds and OH groups. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with a double bond.

Wait, but the options are limited. Let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So either a ring or a double bond. But in this case, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so it must have a double bond. So a ring isn't necessary. So a structure like an ester with a double bond? For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So perhaps something like CH2=CHCOO-R. But wait, that would require more carbons. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester with a double bond? Or perhaps a diester? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone, but that would require a ring, which would account for the degree of unsaturation.

But in any case, let's think about the mass spec. The fragment peak at m/z=45. Let me think what that could be. Common fragments include CH3CO+ (43, but with some isotopes). Maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, 45 could be the molecular ion of a fragment like C3H7O, which has a molecular weight of 45 (3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16; 36+7+16=59, no). Wait, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment like (CH2)2CO, which would be C3H4O. Molecular weight: 3*12=36, 4=4, 16=16. 36+4+16=56. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is one of the four. Let's compute the possible molecular ions and see how they fragment.

Let's think about molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight: (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72 +12 +32=116.

Option B: C6H10O. MW=72 +10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. MW=72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. MW=72 +12 +16=100.

So the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about what could fragment to give 45.

Suppose the molecular ion breaks into a smaller ion. For example, in an ester, the ester group might break, leading to a fragment like the acyl part. For example, if the compound is an ester R-O-CO-R', the fragment could be the R-O-CO group, which if R is CH3, then R-O-CO is CH3O-CO, which would be (CH3O)(CO). The molecular weight of that would be 45? Let me calculate: CH3O is 31 (12+3*1 +16=31), CO is 28 (12+16=28). Wait, no, that's 31 + 28=59. Hmm.

Another possibility: a fragment like C3H7O. But as I thought earlier, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH2)2O, which is 14 +16=30. No. Alternatively, maybe a ketene fragment?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me approach it differently. Maybe the peak at 45 is a common fragment. For example, the tropylium ion (C7H7+) is around 91, so that's not it. Alternatively, a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is 45. Let's see, the molecular formula for a fragment with 45 would be something like C3H7O (which would be 3*12 +7 +16=36+7+16=59, no), or C2H5NO? Not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2O) which is formaldehyde? No, that's 30. Or something like (C3H5O), which would be 3*12=36 +5=41 +16=52. No.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures of each option and see which one would give a fragment at m/z 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: esters, maybe an ortho ester, or a cyclic ester. Let's say it's an ester with a vinyl group. For example, methyl vinyl something. Wait, if the ester is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, maybe a smaller ester with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester, but that's unlikely in a six-carbon molecule.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could correspond to a CH2=CH-O- group. Let's compute its molecular weight: CH2=CH-O- would be (12*2)+(2*1)+16=24+2+16=42. Close, but not exactly 45. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2=CHO-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion (like in the case of a ketone). A ketene is O=C=O, but that's more like 64 g/mol. Hmm.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere with the mass spec. Let's think about the other data again.

The FTIR has a broad O-H peak, which I think is the key here. So the compound has an -OH group. The presence of a carbonyl (1700 cm^-1) and a peak at 1650, which could be conjugated.

So the compound has both a carbonyl group and an -OH group. So possible functional groups are a ketone and an alcohol, or an ester and an alcohol. But the options have varying numbers of oxygen atoms.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Two oxygen atoms. So if the structure has both an alcohol (-OH) and a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester), that would account for two O's. So that's possible.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two O's as well. So same logic applies.

Option B: C6H10O. Only one O, so maybe just an alcohol and something else, but the carbonyl would require another O. Wait, no. If the structure has a carbonyl group, that O would come from the formula. So for example, a ketone would have one O, and an alcohol would have another O, but that would require two O's. So option B only has one O, which can't account for both groups. So option B is probably not the answer.

Similarly, option D is C6H12O, which has one O. So again, it can't have both an -OH and a carbonyl group (which requires two O's). So options B and D can be eliminated because they have only one O, but the IR shows two carbonyl peaks (or a carbonyl and an O-H), which would require at least two O's.

Wait, actually, the IR has a broad peak at 3000 (probably OH), and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (carbonyls). So that's two carbonyl peaks. Wait, that's confusing. Two strong peaks in the carbonyl region? That's unusual. Maybe one is a carbonyl and another is something else, like an aromatic ring. But I thought aromatic C=C is around 1600. So perhaps the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps in an enone system. So the compound has an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So the structure would have a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In that case, the compound would have both an -OH group and an enone. So the structure could be something like cyclohexenone with an alcohol group, but I'm not sure.

Now, looking at the options again, only options A, C, and maybe others have two O's.

Wait, for option C: C6H10O2. Two O's. So it could have an -OH and a carbonyl group. Let's see: C6H10O2 would have a degree of unsaturation of 2. So either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

If there's a double bond (from the vinyl protons in NMR), that accounts for one of the degrees. The other could be a ring. So perhaps a cyclic ketone with an -OH group and a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are on a double bond. So if the structure is a cyclic enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic compound with a carbonyl, but I don't think that fits the data.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like methyl vinyl ketone with an -OH group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with an -OH group. But a cyclic ester (lactone) would have a carbonyl and an ester oxygen. So two O's. If there's an -OH group as well, that would require another O, making three, which isn't the case here because the formula only has two O's. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe the structure is an ortho ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol with a carbonyl group. But that would require at least three O's, which isn't the case.

Wait, maybe the compound is an alpha-hydroxy ketone. That would have both an -OH and a ketone group (two O's), fitting option A (C6H12O2) but wait, option A has two O's, but the molecular formula would have two O's. Let me see: for an alpha-hydroxy ketone, the formula would be like C6H12O2.

Let me think about the structure. For example, something like cyclohexenone with an adjacent OH group.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 could be a CH3 group attached to something. Wait, another idea: the fragment could be (CH2)2CO, which is 45? Let's compute: (CH2)2CO is C3H4O. Molecular weight is (3*12)+(4*1)+(16)=36+4+16=56. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is (CH2)COOH. Wait, that's 45? Let me see: C2H3O2. Molecular weight: 2*12=24, 3=3, 2*16=32. 24+3+32=59, no.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2=CH-O group. The molecular weight would be 42, which isn't 45. Close, but not quite.

Wait, what about a CH2CO group? That would be 44 (12*2 +1*4 +16=24+4+16=44). Close, but not 45. Maybe a CH2COH group? Then molecular weight would be 45: 12*2 +1*4 +16 +1= 24+4+16+1=45. Oh, that's it! So the fragment could be CH2COH. That's 45. So the structure might have a CH2COH group, which could break off as a fragment.

So if the compound has a CH2COH group, then the fragment would be at 45. Now, which of the options has that?

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. If the structure is something like CH2=CHCO-O-R, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic structure where a fragment breaks off, leaving a CH2COH group.

Wait, but how would that fit into the molecular formula? Let's see, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 and the fragment is CH2COH (which is C2H4O2?), wait: CH2COH is C2H5O? No, wait, CH2COH is C2H5O? No, wait: CH2COH is C2H5O (but that would be 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, one O). Molecular weight is 59. But the fragment is at 45, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)2O. That's 42. No. Or maybe CH3CHO (which is 44). No.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecular formula is C6H12O2 (option A). If the compound is an ester with a CH2CH2O group, but I'm not seeing it.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this systematically.

The key points:

1. Broad peak at ~3000 cm^-1: likely -OH group.
2. Peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1: likely a carbonyl group and possibly conjugated or another functional group.
3. Vinyl H in NMR: double bond present.
4. Fragment at 45 in MS.

Possible structures:

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be an ester with a double bond. Maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, methyl acrylate (but that's C4H6O2). Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two O's, two degrees of unsaturation. Could be a ring and a double bond. Maybe a cyclic ketone with a double bond and an -OH group.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a conjugated carbonyl (like in an enone) would explain the 1650 cm^-1 peak. So the structure has an enone group. Enones are conjugated double bonds next to a carbonyl, like CH2=CH-CO-R.

In that case, the structure would have a double bond and a carbonyl. Also, the presence of an -OH group would require another O.

So, for such a structure, the molecular formula would have the enone (which is C=C-CO-) and an -OH. Let's see:

If it's an enol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclohexenone derivative with an -OH group. For example, 3-cyclohexen-1-one with an -OH substituent. But I'm not sure about the formula.

Wait, the molecular formula for such a structure:

Cyclohexenone is C6H8O. Adding an -OH would make it C6H8O2, but that's not one of the options. Wait, but the options have C6H10O, C6H10O2, etc. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is a dienone or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with a ketone and an alcohol group.

Wait, but if the structure has a double bond (from the vinyl H in NMR), a carbonyl (from IR), and an -OH group, then the molecular formula must have enough O's. So either option A (C6H12O2) or option C (C6H10O2).

Now, let's think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl H suggests a double bond. So, perhaps the structure has a conjugated diene? Or maybe the double bond is near the carbonyl group, making it an enone.

The mass spec fragment at 45 could be a CH2CO+ group, which is 45 (12*2 +1*4 +16=44? Wait, 12*2=24, 4=4, 16=16. 24+4+16=44. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, maybe CH2COOH would be 45? CH2COOH is C2H4O2: 2*12=24, 4=4, 2*16=32. 24+4+32=60. No.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion (O=C=O) but that's 64. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, but that's 44. No.

Another approach: think about the molecular formula of the options and see which one can produce a fragment of 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight is 116. So a fragment of 45 would be about 45/116 ~39% of the molecular ion. Which is plausible.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114. 45 is about 39% as well.

So either could have a fragment at 45.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structures. For option A, the formula is C6H12O2. If it's an ester, like methyl cyclopentene carbonate or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol with a carbonyl, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another angle: the presence of both a carbonyl and an -OH group could indicate an acetylated alcohol, like an acetate ester. For example, an R-OAc group. So the structure would have an ester (OAc) and an -OH. But wait, that would require two O's from the ester and one from the -OH, making three O's. But the formula only has two, so that's not possible.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to think about each option's structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a gamma or delta lactone with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could be a benzene ring with substituents, but I don't see a peak at 1650 cm^-1 as a strong indication of aromatic rings. Alternatively, a dihydroxy ketone, but that's unclear.

Wait, thinking about the IR again: the peak at 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone. So perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl with an -OH group.

If the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone with an -OH group, then the molecular formula would have two O's (the ketone O and the -OH O), which fits options A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2). Let's compare the degrees of unsaturation.

Option A: 1 degree. So either a ring or a double bond. But the structure has a double bond from the enone, so that would account for the one degree. So the structure would have an enone (C=C-C=O) and an -OH group. So the molecule would have the structure R-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, in an enone, the structure is R-C=C-C=O. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ketone is C3=O.

So for option A, C6H12O2: Assuming a six-carbon chain with an enone and an -OH, let's calculate the structure.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another clue. The presence of vinyl H in NMR suggests that the double bond is isolated, not conjugated. Or maybe it's in a conjugated system but still shows up as vinyl H.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has an ester group and a double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have the structure CH2=CHCOOR. But the molecular formula would vary. Let's say R is a methyl group, then the formula would be C5H8O2. But our options are C6, so maybe R is ethyl, making it C6H10O2. Which is option C.

But option C has C6H10O2. So if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, that would be C5H8O2 plus C2H5, making C7H13O2, which is more than six carbons. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a cyclic alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a simple ester with a double bond elsewhere. For example, CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. But again, that's more than six carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclopentene with an ester group. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Another approach: let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: esters, cyclic esters (lactones), ketones with an -OH group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Possible structures: esters with a double bond, cyclic ketones with a double bond and an -OH, etc.

The mass fragment at 45 could be a CH2CO+ group, which is 44, but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH3CH2O+ group, which is 45 (12+2*1 +16=30? No, 12*2=24 + 5=29 + 16=45? Wait, CH2CH2O would be 3 carbons? No, CH2CH2O is C2H5O, molecular weight 45 (24 +5 +16=45). Oh, yes! So a fragment like C2H5O would have a molecular weight of 45. So if the compound has a C2H5O fragment, that could explain the mass peak.

So which options can have a C2H5O fragment?

Looking at the options, if the structure has a ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), that would contribute to such a fragment. So the molecular formula would include an ethoxy group.

For example, if the compound is an ester like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, but that's seven carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a smaller ester.

Wait, but let's take option C: C6H10O2. If the structure is an ester with an ethoxy group, like CH2CH2COOCH2CH3, but that's five carbons in the ester part, which would make the formula C5H10O2 plus the ethoxy's two carbons, totaling seven, which is more than six. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester. For example, a six-membered ring with an ester linkage. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that's less likely in a six-carbon compound.

Another thought: the mass fragment at 45 (C2H5O) could come from the cleavage of an ester group. For example, in an ester R-O-CO-R', the O-CO-R' part could break off, leaving R-O as a fragment. If R is CH2CH3, then R-O is C2H5O, which has a molecular weight of 45.

So if the compound is an ester where R is ethyl (CH2CH3), then the fragment would be C2H5O.

So the molecular formula would be (R) O CO (R'), where R is CH2CH3 and R' is some group that makes the total formula fit one of the options.

But let's see. For example, if R is CH2CH3 and R' is CH2CH2COO, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the compound is methyl vinyl ether, but that's OCH2CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a methyl ester of a compound that upon fragmentation releases a C2H5O group. But I'm not seeing it.

Another angle: the presence of a conjugated carbonyl (enone) would cause the carbonyl peak to be lower than a regular ketone. So maybe the 1700 is a regular ketone, and the 1650 is an enone. But I'm not certain.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2. Because it has two O's, which can account for the -OH and the carbonyl groups. The degrees of unsaturation are two, which could be a ring and a double bond. The fragment at 45 could come from a CH2CH2O group, which would fit if the structure has an ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with an ethoxy group and a double bond. For example, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, which has the formula C5H8O2. But our option C is C6H10O2, which has two more hydrogens and two more carbons. So maybe it's a substituted version, like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3, but that's seven carbons.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but I think I've narrowed it down to options A and C.

Wait, another thought: the presence of an ester group would have a carbonyl peak around 1700 cm^-1. The 1650 could be from an adjacent double bond (conjugated), making it an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure would be CH2=CHCOO-R.

In that case, the molecular formula would be C5H8O2 (for CH2=CHCOO-) plus R. So if R is methyl (CH3), the formula becomes C6H10O2, which is option C.

So the structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3? Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Alternatively, maybe R is a methyl group attached to the ester, making the formula C5H8O2 + C1H3 (from methyl), but that doesn't add up right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's C6H10O2. Let me count: CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. So together, it's C6H11O2. That's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something else, like a six-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2. Because it fits the IR data (two O's for OH and carbonyl), the NMR data (double bond), and the mass spec (fragment at 45 could come from an ethoxy group).


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options provided are four chemical formulas: **C6H12O2**, **C6H10O**, **C6H10O2**, and **C6H12O**. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an -OH group.
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl group, such as in an enone system.

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a fragment such as **C2H5O** (e.g., an ethoxy group, -OCH2CH3).

4. **Elimination of Options**:
   - **Option B (C6H10O)** and **Option D (C6H12O)** are eliminated because they contain only one oxygen atom. This is insufficient to account for both the -OH group and the carbonyl group observed in the FTIR spectrum.
   - **Option A (C6H12O2)** and **Option C (C6H10O2)** remain viable, as they each contain two oxygen atoms, which can account for both the -OH group and the carbonyl group.

5. **Further Analysis**:
   - **Option A (C6H12O2)** has a degree of unsaturation of 1, which could correspond to a ring or a double bond. However, the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond, and the IR data suggests a conjugated system (e.g., an enone). This makes it less likely that the structure is a simple cyclic compound.
   - **Option C (C6H10O2)** has a degree of unsaturation of 2, which could correspond to a ring and a double bond or two double bonds. The presence of vinyl hydrogens and the IR data support the presence of a conjugated system, such as an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or a ketone with a double bond. Additionally, the fragment peak at m/z = 45 aligns with the presence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), which is consistent with this formula.

### Conclusion:
Based on the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, **Option C (C6H10O2)** best fits the observations. It accounts for the -OH group, the carbonyl group, the vinyl hydrogens, and the fragment peak at m/z = 45.
