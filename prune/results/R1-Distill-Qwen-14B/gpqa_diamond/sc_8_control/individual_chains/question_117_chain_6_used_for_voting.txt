Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism refers to compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? These are also called enantiomers. So, the question is asking which of the given compounds show this property.

The question lists four organic moieties, numbered 1 to 4. The options are combinations of these, and I need to figure out which ones can exhibit optical isomerism.

Let me go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 2' positions for the carboxylate groups and 6 and 6' for the nitro groups. Wait, the structure is such that the substituents are on adjacent carbons. Now, if the two rings are connected by a single bond, that single bond allows for rotation, but in this case, the substituents are in such a way that their arrangement can lead to stereoisomerism. Wait, but wait, for a compound to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or some form of asymmetry that leads to non-superimposable mirror images.

But in this case, the biphenyl system might have a plane of symmetry. Wait, or does it? Let me think. If the substituents are at positions that are symmetric, maybe. Oh, but in this compound, the substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring. So each ring has a carboxylate at position 2 and a nitro at position 6. Wait, that's each ring having two substituents? Because the way it's written, the main chain is the biphenyl, and the substituents are at 6 and 6' for nitro and 2 and 2' for carboxylate. So each benzene ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in ortho positions.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism. So for that to happen, the molecule must have a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element. Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetric, it might not have optical isomerism.

Wait, the molecule in 1 is dimethyl, so each carboxylate group is a methyl ester. So each benzene ring has at position 2 a COOCH3 and at position 6 a NO2.

Wait, the arrangement might be such that the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 position, so each has substituents in the 2 and 6 positions. So perhaps each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. But how does the structure look? Are the substituents arranged in a way that allows for a plane of symmetry? Like, if the substituents are in positions that make the entire molecule symmetric, then it might not have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe each substituent is in such a position that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. But I'm a bit unsure here. Let's think about whether this compound can have enantiomers. If the molecule has a center of asymmetry, like a chiral center, then yes. But I don't see any obvious chiral centers in the description. Each ring is connected via a single bond, but the substituents are in positions that might lead to some kind of asymmetry. Alternatively, maybe this compound has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Hmm, I'm not very confident about this one. I'll come back to it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The formula would be CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COO- as the acid. So the ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Its ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is (CH3)COO- connected to CH2CH(OH)CH3. Wait, no, the ester is from the acid, so the structure is: the ester is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the molecule would have the structure where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. Let me draw it out mentally: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the carbon chain is three carbons, with the COOCH3 on the third, and a hydroxyl on the second. So, the molecule has the structure: the middle carbon (second carbon) has a hydroxyl group. So, is there a chiral center here? Let's see: the second carbon has four different groups. The groups attached to the second carbon are: one CH3 (from the first carbon), one OH (hydroxyl), one COOCH3 (from the third carbon), and another CH3 (wait, no: wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon has a CH3, an OH, a COOCH3, and a single bond to the third carbon, which is connected to O and the ester group. Wait, wait, no, the third carbon is the COOCH3. So the second carbon is connected to CH3 (first carbon), OH, COOCH3 (third), and the rest? No, I think the second carbon is connected to four different groups: a methyl group (CH3 from the first carbon), an OH, a carbonyl group (as part of the carboxylate), and another CH2 group? Wait, no, the second carbon is CH(OH), so the groups are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a CH2 group? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (the middle one) is connected to:

- First carbon: CH3
- Second group: OH
- Third group: COOCH3
- Fourth group: the next carbon (the third carbon, which is attached to the COOCH3 group).

Wait, the third carbon is part of the COOCH3, so the second carbon is connected to:

CH3 (from C1), OH (on C2), COOCH3 (from C3, which is a carbonyl), and another CH2 group? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (second) has:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (top)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and the other bond is connected to the third carbon, which is the carbonyl.

Wait, no, the third carbon is part of the COOCH3. So the second carbon is connected to the first (CH3), the OH, the COOCH3, and the third carbon (which is the carbonyl group). But wait, the third carbon is double-bonded to oxygen? So, the second carbon has four different groups: a methyl, an OH, the COOCH3 group, and a single bond to the third carbon (which is part of the carbonyl). So, the second carbon would be a chiral center. Because it's connected to four different groups. So, this compound has a chiral center, which means it can exhibit optical isomerism. So, number 2 definitely shows optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So, two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. Structure: Ar-CO-Ar. In this case, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen. Is there any possibility of optical isomerism? Well, for a compound to have enantiomers, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center or another form of asymmetry. The central carbon in benzophenone is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to oxygen. So, it's sp2 hybridized. That carbon doesn't have four different groups attached to it because it's double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center. Also, the two phenyl groups are on either side. If the two phenyl groups are identical, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Because, imagine looking at the molecule, if the two phenyl groups are mirror images, then the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So benzophenone itself is symmetrical. Therefore, it doesn't have any chiral centers and is achiral. So, it cannot have optical isomerism. So, number 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid has a trans double bond. So, the structure of fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, with the trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate would be OMe groups on both ends. So structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, wait: fumaric acid structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait: Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but with the two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, in the trans configuration. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), but in the trans arrangement.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. Fumaric acid is a diacid: HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, where the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, so the double bond is trans. So, when converted to the dimethyl ester, it's (COOCH3)2C=CH, but wait, no: the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but that's for maleic acid. Wait, no, maleic acid is cis, fumaric is trans. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3) on either end of a double bond, but in a trans configuration.

So, the molecule is (COOCH3)C=C(COOCH3), with the substituents on opposite sides. Now, this molecule has a double bond with substituents on either side. So, the question is whether this can lead to optical isomerism. Wait, a double bond with substituents on either side can lead to geometric isomerism (cis-trans), but can it lead to optical isomerism?

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't have optical isomerism.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is symmetric. Because the two groups on either end of the double bond are identical (both COOCH3), and they are in a trans configuration. So, the molecule is symmetrical because each substituent on either side is the same. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, and it's not chiral because it's symmetrical. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, if you rotate 180 degrees, the substituents swap but the structure remains the same. So, the molecule would not have optical isomerism because it's achiral.

Wait, but wait, dimethyl fumarate is an example of a trans double bond. The molecule is (COOCH3)–C=C–(COOCH3) with the two ester groups on opposite sides. So, in this case, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. So, any plane of symmetry would make the molecule achiral. For example, a bisecting plane through the double bond would result in mirror images on either side, meaning the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another thought: Fumarate is a meso compound. Because, in the case of maleic acid, which is the cis isomer, the diacid is not symmetrical, but when you esterify it, it becomes a meso compound. Wait, no, wait, let me think. For maleic acid, the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH in the cis configuration. When it's converted into the dimethyl ester, it's (COOCH3) on either end of the double bond, in cis configuration. Wait, no, the confusion arises because fumaric acid is the trans isomer, and maleic is the cis. So dimethyl maleate would be cis, and dimethyl fumarate would be trans. So, for dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (COOCH3)C=CH(COOCH3), but in a trans arrangement. So, the two substituents (COOCH3) on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides.

Wait, but that would make the molecule symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. Because each substituent is the same and on opposite sides. So, the molecule is symmetrical and hence achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, if the substituents were different, then the molecule would be chiral, but in this case, they're the same. So, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. I've heard that fumarate is a diastereomer, but I'm trying to recall if it has optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: a molecule must have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. In dimethyl fumarate, the central carbon (the ones attached to the double bond) are each connected to two COOCH3 groups and the double bond. So, the structure is (COOCH3)–C=C–(COOCH3), trans. So, each of those carbons (the ones attached to the double bond) has two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a single bond. Wait, no, each is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and the double bond. So, each of those carbons has three substituents: two COOCH3 and one double bond. Wait, no, each is bonded to two COOCH3 groups, the double bond, and another carbon. Wait, no, for a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two substituents. So, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, the structure is symmetric across the double bond. So, the molecule as a whole is symmetric, hence not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think of another possibility. If the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical and can't have optical isomers. So, dimethyl fumarate, which has identical substituents on each end of the trans double bond, would be symmetrical and hence not chiral. So it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another thought: what if the molecule has a different kind of asymmetry, like a center of chirality elsewhere? But in dimethyl fumarate, the entire molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, so I don't think there's any chiral center or other asymmetry.

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused between cis and trans. If the substituents are in the trans configuration, the molecule is symmetrical. So, dimethyl fumarate, being trans, is symmetrical. So, it's not chiral, hence no optical isomerism.

Wait, but now I'm confused because I've heard that some diesters can be chiral. Let me think. For example, tartaric acid is a chiral molecule, and its diesters can also be chiral if the substituents are different. But in this case, the substituents are the same.

So, back to the four compounds:

1. I was unsure about this. Let's reevaluate. The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring has two substituents. The key is whether the arrangement of the substituents on the biphenyl system leads to a chiral center or not.

Wait, the biphenyl system has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Hmm, so each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So, for the biphenyl, each ring has substituents in the 2 and 6 positions. But if you look at the two rings, the substituents are in such a way that each ring has substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting bond. So, for example, if one ring has substituents at 2 and 6, the other ring would have substituents at 2 and 6 as well, but perhaps mirrored.

Wait, but the way the biphenyl is connected might mean that the substituents are arranged in a symmetric fashion. Or perhaps not. Let me imagine the structure. The biphenyl is connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Then, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, but since the rings are connected at the 1 position, the substituents at 2 and 6 might not be symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the arrangement of substituents. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged mirror-symmetrically, then the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be achiral. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere, but I don't see any chiral centers in the substituents. The substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate esters, which are themselves planar.

Wait, the biphenyl system itself can have a twist, leading to different diastereomers. But that's more about the conformation rather than the structure.

Alternatively, if the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, then it's chiral and would exhibit optical isomerism. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, for the biphenyl, if the two rings are arranged such that each substituent has a corresponding mirror image, then the molecule is achiral. But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule is chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, substituents are in the same positions on each ring. So, if the two rings are connected such that the substituents are mirrored, then the molecule would be symmetric. So, for example, if the two substituents on each ring are in such positions that the entire molecule is symmetrical. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are both in positions that are symmetric with respect to the connecting bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, in the biphenyl structure, if each ring has substituents that are symmetric across the bond, then the molecule would be achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a lack of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral.

I think I'm getting stuck on this one. Let me think of another approach. I remember that for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must not have a plane of symmetry and must be chiral.

So, for compound 1, does it have a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine: each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. If the two rings are connected in a way that their substituents are mirror images, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, but if one ring has a nitro at 6 and the other also has a nitro at 6, but considering the biphenyl structure, maybe the two nitro groups are on the same side or opposite sides, which could affect symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical because substituents are arranged in a symmetrical fashion. In which case, it's not chiral.

But without a clear idea, perhaps I should tentatively decide that compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism, but I'm not very sure. Alternatively, maybe it does.

Wait, another thought: the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. The 2 and 6 positions are adjacent, but on a benzene ring, that's meta to each other. Wait, no: positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, etc. So, 2 and 6 are two positions apart on each ring, but that's actually the para position. Wait, no: on a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 go around. So, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. So, 2 and 6 are across from each other (para) on the ring. So, each ring has substituents at para positions.

Wait, but in the biphenyl system, if the substituents on each ring are at para positions relative to the connecting bond, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps not.

Wait, suppose the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1'. Then, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, substituents at 2 on one ring and 2' on the other. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the overall arrangement is asymmetric, then the molecule would be chiral.

I think I'm stuck on this, so perhaps I should move on and come back to it.

So far, the compounds I'm certain about are:

2: shows optical isomerism (chiral center)
3: doesn't show it (symmetrical)
4: doesn't show it (symmetrical)

Wait, what about compound 1?

Wait, another approach: does the molecule in 1 have any chiral centers? I don't think so. The substituents are on the benzene rings, which are planar, so the carbon atoms attached to them are sp2 hybridized. So, no chiral centers there. So, the molecule must have some other form of chirality, perhaps due to the arrangement of the rings.

Wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality. Axial chirality arises when there's restricted rotation around a single bond, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. For example, in binaphthyl compounds, the two naphthyl groups are connected by a single bond, and if they are in a certain configuration, the molecule can be chiral.

In the case of compound 1, is the rotation around the biphenyl bond restricted? Well, in reality, biphenyl compounds have a certain degree of rotation, but sometimes it's restricted enough that axial chirality is possible.

But wait, for axial chirality to occur, there needs to be a barrier to rotation, which leads to a preference for a certain conformation. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para positions. So, when connected, the substituents on each ring are in positions that could lead to a non-symmetrical arrangement. But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say.

Wait, another thing to consider: if the two rings are connected such that the substituents are arranged in a way that they are not mirror images, then the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For example, if each ring's substituents are arranged in a way that they mirror each other across the bond, then the molecule is achiral.

Hmm, perhaps in this specific case, the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the entire molecule is achiral. Or maybe it is chiral.

Wait, the compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

So, each ring has a substituent at 2 and 6. So, the substituents on each ring are at para positions relative to the connecting bond (which is at 1 and 1').

Wait, perhaps the two substituents on each ring (at positions 2 and 6) are in such a way that the entire molecule is symmetrical. For instance, each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, but in the case of 1,1'-biphenyl, each ring is attached at position 1, so substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would be in the same relative positions on each ring. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

I'm not entirely sure, but maybe I can find another way to think. Let's look at the options. The options given are combinations of the four compounds. The options are:

A) 1,2,4
B) 3,4
C) 2,3
D)1,2

So, from earlier analysis, I know that 2 shows optical isomerism, 3 and 4 do not. What about 1?

If 1 shows optical isomerism, then option A or D would be a possibility. If 1 doesn't, then only 2 shows it, which isn't any of the options because the options don't have just 2. Let's look. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3,4 → no, since 3 and 4 don't.

C) 2,3 → no, 3 doesn't.

D) 1,2 → possible if 1 shows it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about 4. Let me think again about 4.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate. Structure: (COOCH3)C=CH(COOCH3), trans. So, each substituent is the same on both ends, and in trans configuration. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, back to compound 1, perhaps it is chiral.

Wait, another angle: if the biphenyl has substituents on each ring that are arranged such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it is chiral. So, for example, if the substituents on one ring are on the same face, and the substituents on the other ring are on opposite faces, leading to a non-symmetrical arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical.

Alternatively, considering that the substituents on each ring are in positions that make each ring's arrangement asymmetric. For example, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate, but in a way that the overall arrangement is not symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to tell. Maybe I should think of specific examples. For instance, the biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring: do such structures exhibit axial chirality?

Wait, another approach: the biphenyl group in 1 has two substituents on each ring, both at positions 2 and 6. So, each substituent is para to the connecting bond. So, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, if the substituents are both on the same side of the biphenyl bond, then the molecule might be chiral. Alternatively, if they are on opposite sides, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so it's achiral.

I think I'm stuck here. So, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

From what I know, dimethyl fumarate (4) doesn't show optical isomerism, and benzophenone (3) also doesn't. So the only ones that do are 2 and 1, or 2 only.

Looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4 which would be incorrect since 4 doesn't. Option D includes 1 and 2. If 1 shows optical isomerism, then option D is correct. If 1 doesn't, then none of the options would include only 2. But the options don't have an option with only 2.

Wait, looking again at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → 4 doesn't, so no.

B) 3 and 4 → both do not show, so no.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 doesn't, so no.

D) 1 and 2 → if both show, then correct.

So, the only option left is D if 1 and 2 show optical isomerism.

But earlier, I was unsure about 1. So, perhaps I should think that 1 does show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps 1 doesn't.

But given the options, I think the correct answer must be A, D, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate. The molecule is (COOCH3)C=CH(COOCH3), trans. So, each substituent is the same on each end, in trans configuration. So, the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond. Therefore, it's not chiral.

So, only 2 shows optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let's reevaluate compound 1. Maybe it's chiral.

Wait, considering that each ring has two substituents: 2 and 6. So, substituents are para to each other on each ring. So, for each ring, substituents are at para positions. So, each ring itself is symmetrical. So, when the two rings are connected, the entire molecule could be symmetrical.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, then the molecule as a whole may have a plane of symmetry. So, it's not chiral.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of substituents on the biphenyl ring leads to a lack of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

Without further information, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none have only 2. The options are A) 1,2,4; B)3,4; C) 2,3; D)1,2.

So, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 actually shows optical isomerism. How?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer. What if the molecule is not symmetrical and has a chiral center elsewhere? But where?

The structure is (COOCH3)C=CH(COOCH3), trans. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, for the molecule, each of the double-bonded carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So, each of these carbons is bonded to two identical groups and a double bond. So, each of these carbons has two identical substituents. Therefore, they are not chiral centers.

So, the only other possibility is that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, for each of the two carbons in the double bond, they're bonded to two identical substituents and the double bond. So, the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral.

So, compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. The only compounds that do show optical isomerism are 2 and possibly 1.

If option D is 1 and 2, then that's a possibility.

But why would 1 show optical isomerism? Because it's a biphenyl with substituents arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral because of the arrangement of substituents on the biphenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and not chiral.

Another thought: the molecule in 1 has two nitro groups and two carboxylate groups. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Wait, considering that each ring has two substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So, each ring is symmetric with respect to the connecting bond. When connected, the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the entire molecule is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the options. Since I've determined that 2 is correct, and none of the options have only 2, perhaps the correct answer includes 2 and another compound.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 4 does show optical isomerism. How?

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the double bond are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents are different, then the molecule could be chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are the same. So, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is trans, but when esterified as dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is (COOCH3)C=CH(COOCH3), trans. So, each substituent is COOCH3, which is the same on both ends. So, the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, it's not chiral.

So, going back, perhaps the only correct answer is compound 2.

But none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake about one of the other compounds.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The rings are connected at position 1 and 1'.

So, on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para positions relative to the connecting bond.

So, for each ring, substituents are at para positions. Now, if the two substituents on each ring are both on the same face of the ring, then the biphenyl arrangement could lead to a chiral molecule.

Wait, but in the biphenyl system, the rings can rotate, but if the substituents are arranged in a way that the overall structure is not symmetrical, then the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to decide. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral, so it shows optical isomerism.

So, if 1 and 2 show, then option D is correct.

Therefore, the answer would be D: 1 and 2.

But I'm not entirely confident about compound 1.

To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound based on the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound is non-superimposable on its mirror image, often due to the presence of a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl system with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. The substituents on each ring are in para positions relative to the connecting bond. The molecule may lack a plane of symmetry due to the arrangement of the substituents, potentially making it chiral. Biphenyl systems can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically. Based on the description, this compound likely shows optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (middle carbon) is connected to four different groups: a methyl group (CH3), a hydroxyl group (OH), a carboxylate ester (COOCH3), and the adjacent carbon. This makes the second carbon a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and does not have four different groups attached, so it is not a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical due to the identical phenyl groups on either side of the carbonyl group. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (COOCH3)C=CH(COOCH3). The molecule is symmetrical across the double bond because the substituents on either side of the double bond are identical. This symmetry prevents the molecule from being chiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 likely shows optical isomerism due to axial chirality in the biphenyl system.  
- Compound 2 shows optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry or the lack of a chiral element.

The correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**.
