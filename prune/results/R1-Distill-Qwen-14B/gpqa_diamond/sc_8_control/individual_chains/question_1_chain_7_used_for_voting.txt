Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A through D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ΔE)(Δt) ≥ ħ/2, or as (ΔE)(Δt) ≥ 1/2 ħ. Maybe I should think in terms of the natural units or orders of magnitude.

The question is about distinguishing two energy levels. To clearly see the difference, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty introduced by the measurement time. So the minimum detectable energy difference would be on the order of ħ divided by the lifetime of the state. But wait, each state has its own lifetime. Oh, but wait, how does the lifetime relate to the energy uncertainty?

I think the energy uncertainty ΔE for each state is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime τ. Because the lifetime is the time during which the energy is measured or observed. So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

But wait, each state has a different lifetime. So for E1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(1e-9 s). Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(1e-8 s). But since τ2 is longer, ΔE2 would be smaller than ΔE1.

Wait, but in the question, we're looking for the energy difference between E2 and E1. So we have E2 - E1 = ΔE. For them to be distinguishable, this ΔE must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or something like that. Or perhaps, each energy's uncertainty must be less than the energy difference between them. Because if the uncertainty is larger than the energy difference, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, that makes sense. If the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the two states would appear as a single energy level, so you can't distinguish them. So to clearly resolve them, their energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because if, say, E2 is only slightly higher than E1, but the uncertainty in E2 is larger than the difference, you can't see the difference.

Wait, but each state's energy has its own uncertainty. So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1), and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2). So for the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 to be resolvable, it must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the scenario. Suppose we have two states: the first has a short lifetime (1e-9 s), so its energy is uncertain by a larger amount, ΔE1. The second has a longer lifetime (1e-8 s), so its energy is uncertain by a smaller amount, ΔE2.

If the actual energy difference between E2 and E1 is much larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then it's easy to distinguish them. But if the difference is close to or smaller than the uncertainties, the two might appear as a single peak or something in a spectrum.

So the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each individual uncertainty. Wait, I think the correct condition is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of each state. Because if the difference is larger than each uncertainty, then each state's energy is well-defined enough to see the separation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in the energy, which is the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, you can see the separation. Because if the difference is smaller than the larger uncertainty, you can't resolve them.

Let me calculate the uncertainties. Let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

First, ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. Let's convert that to eV·s because the options are in eV. I know that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So ħ in eV·s is (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) )= 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) )= 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, so ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, which is 0.658 microeV. ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV, which is about 0.0658 microeV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the maximum of these two uncertainties, which is ΔE1 (6.58e-7 eV). Because if the difference is smaller than ΔE1, it's possible that the two states' energies overlap in their uncertainties. So at least, the difference must be larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, but wait, the options given are:

A) 10^-9 eV = 1e-9 eV = 0.001 microeV.

B) 1e-11 eV = 0.00001 picoeV, which is way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV = 0.1 milli-eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

D) 1e-8 eV = 0.01 microeV.

Wait, so ΔE1 is 6.58e-7 eV, which is 6.58e-7 = 658e-9 eV. So for the energy difference to be resolvable, it needs to be larger than 6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 6.58e-7 eV. So that would satisfy the condition.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is less than ΔE1 (6.58e-7 eV) and less than ΔE2 (6.58e-8 eV). So it's not larger than either. So the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but wait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much bigger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. So that would definitely be resolvable. But are there any other options that are larger than ΔE1?

Looking again, option C is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV. It's much larger than 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, but what about option D? 1e-8 eV is much less than ΔE1 (6.58e-7) and less than ΔE2 (6.58e-8). So that won't do.

So the correct energy difference must be larger than 6.58e-7 eV, which is approximately 6.6e-7 eV. So looking at the options, only option C is larger than that. Because 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 0.0001 eV, while 6.58e-7 eV is 0.000000658 eV. So yes, option C is much larger.

Wait, but why is option C the only one that's larger than both uncertainties? Because the question asks which could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar \), the reduced Planck's constant. For a state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is approximately \( 6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). The lifetimes of the two states are \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Calculating the energy uncertainties for each state:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, \( \max(\Delta E_1, \Delta E_2) \). Since \( \Delta E_1 > \Delta E_2 \), the critical threshold is \( \Delta E > 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \), so it can resolve the two states.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.

The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
