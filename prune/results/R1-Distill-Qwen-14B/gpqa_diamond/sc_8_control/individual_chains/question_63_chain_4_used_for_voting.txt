Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. They're using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find out what momentum an absorbed photon should have so that the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, okay. So the molecule is in its ground state right now, and when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state. But what's the next state? I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially for diatomic molecules, the energy states are quantized both for rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. Oh, right, that's the Morse potential model, which treats both vibrational and rotational energy states. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states.

In the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, the rotational quantum number is usually J=0, and the vibrational quantum number is ν=0. When the molecule absorbs a photon, it will transition to a higher energy state. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state?

I think the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are different. Vibrational energy levels have higher spacing than rotational ones because vibrations are higher in energy.

So, the fundamental state is ν=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be either ν=1, J=0, or J=1, ν=0. Which of these has a lower energy?

Vibrational energy levels are given by E_vibrational = (ν + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. Rotational energy is E_rotational = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The energy difference for a vibrational transition from ν=0 to ν=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω. For a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E_rot = [ (1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)) ] * (ħ²/(2I)) ) = (2)(ħ²/(2I)) )= (ħ²)/(I).

So which is smaller, ΔE_vib or ΔE_rot? Let's compute.

Given:
Masses: Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.
Bond length R = 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.
Angular frequency ω = 4e14 rad/s.

First, let's compute the moment of inertia I. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 * 2) / (22) ) amu. 20*2 is 40, divided by 22. That's 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. But wait, need to convert that to kg because we'll be using SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ Let's see. 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988, but 0.018 *1.66 is ~0.03, so total about 3.018e-27 kg? Wait, wait, no: 20/11 is approximately 1.81818, so 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, 20/11 is approximately 1.81818, so 1.81818 times 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that:

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ Let's calculate step by step.

1.8 * 1.66 = 2.988

0.01818 * 1.6605 ≈ approx 0.03012.

So total is about 2.988 + 0.03012 = 3.01812. So μ ≈ 3.01812e-27 kg.

Now, R is 2e-10 m. So I = μ R² = 3.01812e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.01812e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Wait, wait, 3e-27 * 4e-20 would be 12e-47 = 1.2e-46 kg m². So I ≈ 1.2e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is (ħ²)/(I) * [ (2) / (2) ] because J(J+1) for J=1 is 2, J=0 is 0, so difference is 2* ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

Compute ħ²/(I).

ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.266e-23 J.

Wait, that's the energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is ħω. ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Comparing the two, the rotational energy difference is about 9.266e-23 J, and the vibrational is 4.218e-20 J. So the rotational change is much smaller.

So to get the next lowest energy state, the molecule would need to absorb a photon that provides the energy for the smallest possible transition, which is the rotational one. Because 9e-23 is much less than 4e-20, the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, but wait. The question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". So which transition gives the lower energy? The rotational, because it's smaller.

So the photon's energy must match the energy of the rotational transition.

But wait, in the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. But in this case, since the molecule is in the fundamental state (ν=0, J=0), the next state would be either ν=1, J=0 or ν=0, J=1. Which of these has lower energy?

Since the rotational energy is much lower than the vibrational, the J=1, ν=0 state is lower in energy than the ν=1, J=0 state. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the rotational one.

So the photon must have energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Wait, but is that correct? Because the vibrational energy is higher. Let me think again.

The energy levels for the molecule would be a combination of vibrational and rotational states. So the ground state is the lowest vibrational (ν=0) and lowest rotational (J=0) state.

The next possible states are either increasing ν by 1 (ν=1, J=0) or increasing J by 1 (ν=0, J=1). But which of these is lower in energy? The J=1, ν=0 state would have lower energy than ν=1, J=0 because the rotational energy increment is smaller.

So the molecule would transition to the J=1, ν=0 state upon absorbing a photon with the energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

So the energy of the photon is ΔE_rot = ħ²/(2I) * (J=0 to J=1) → 2 * ħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, no. Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = [ J (J+1) ] * ħ²/(2I). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = [ (2) - 0 ] * ħ²/(2I) ) = (2)(ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

Yes, that's correct. So the energy needed is ħ²/(I).

So the photon's energy must be E_photon = ħ²/(I).

But wait, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Photons have energy E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. So p = E/c.

So compute p = (ħ²/(I)) / c.

Let me compute that.

We have:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

I = 1.2e-46 kg m².

c = 3e8 m/s.

Compute ħ²: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ²/(I) = 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ 9.266e-23 J.

Divide by c to get momentum: 9.266e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.089e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but that's in SI units. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, I = μ R².

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

Wait, μ is the reduced mass.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) amu = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

So converting to kg: 1 amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605390666e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that.

1.8 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 2.9889e-27 kg.

0.01818 * 1.6605e-27 = approx 0.03014e-27 = 3.014e-29 kg.

Total μ ≈ 2.9889e-27 + 3.014e-29 = approximately 3.019e-27 kg.

I = μ * R² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/(I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (1.2076e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (1.2076e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

So p = E/c = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, they are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. Hmm, that's much lower than what I'm getting. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the energy levels. Because in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering only the vibrational transition. Because the question says 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' So perhaps the molecule is moving to the next vibrational state, but that would require a higher energy.

Wait, perhaps I confused the next state. Maybe the molecule's next state is the first vibrational state, but that's higher in energy. So the photon must have enough energy to cause that transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition because the rotational transitions are forbidden or not allowed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. The question refers to the 'fundamental state' as the initial state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is likely ν=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next possible state, which is either J=1, ν=0 or ν=1, J=0. Which of these is lower in energy.

Earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition requires about 9e-23 J, and the vibrational requires 4e-20 J. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the J=1, ν=0 state, so the photon must have energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

But why are the options so much larger than my calculation? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recompute the momentum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ² / I.

Wait, I'll recalculate:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

I = μ R² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ 9.207e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.207e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.069e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's 3.07e-31, which is 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But looking at the options, the smallest is 1.4e-28, which is two orders of magnitude higher. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the question is about the photon's momentum. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition not just to a higher rotational state but a vibrational state as well. Let me think.

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the next higher energy, but the minimal possible. So the minimal possible is the rotational transition.

So the energy required is the rotational transition energy: ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) = 9.2e-23 J.

But the options are all in the order of 1e-27 or 1e-28 N s (which is kg m/s).

Wait, 1 Ns is kg m/s. So the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, but my calculation gives 3e-31 kg m/s, which is way lower than the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about Raman transitions which change the rotational state without changing the vibrational state. But that's more advanced, and I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question is considering the transition from the ground vibrational state (ν=0) to first excited (ν=1), regardless of rotation. But that would require a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a purely vibrational transition. Let me compute that.

Energy for vibration: ΔE_vib = ħω.

ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vib = 1.05457e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

Then, the momentum of the photon is p = ΔE / c = 4.218e-20 J / 3e8 m/s = 1.406e-29 kg m/s.

Again, that's 1.4e-29 kg m/s, which is even smaller than the previous value.

So why are the options so much larger?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (ν=0, J=0) to the next state, which is ν=0, J=1. So the energy is the rotational transition.

But according to my earlier calculation, the momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31, but none of the options are that small.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) ) = 40/22 = 20/11 = approx 1.81818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that again.

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute 1.8*1.6605 = 2.9889e-27, and 0.01818*1.6605e-27 = approx 3.015e-29. So total is (2.9889 + 0.03015) e-27 = 3.019e-27 kg. So that seems correct.

So I is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor in the rotational energy.

Wait, the rotational energy is E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * (ħ²) / (2 I).

So ΔE_rot from J=0 to J=1 is (2 * ħ²) / (2I) )= ħ²/(I), which I correctly computed.

So the problem is that I'm getting a momentum of about 3e-31 kg m/s, but the options are 1e-27 or larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for R. Let me check: R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 m. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the bond length R is in a different unit? No, the question says R is 2 angstroms.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor approximation but in a different way. Or maybe it's expecting the energy from the vibration, but perhaps I miscalculated the energy.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state (ν=1) without considering rotation. So the required energy is ħω, which is 4.2e-20 J. Then, the momentum p is 1.4e-29 kg m/s.

But the options don't have that either.

Looking at the options, the smallest is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me check again.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu = 1.81818 amu.

Wait, no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about a different model. Wait, the question says "quantum rotation-vibration model (or non-rigid rotor model)", so perhaps it's considering the non-rigid rotor, which includes the vibration. But in that case, the energy levels are a combination of both. But the initial state is the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state.

So the next state would have either higher vibrational or higher rotational energy. Which has lower energy? The rotational.

So the required photon energy is the rotational energy.

So my calculation seems correct, but the options don't match.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

μ is 3.019e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² = 3.019e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ squared over I is 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = 9.207e-23 J.

p = 9.207e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.069e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm. That's way smaller than the options given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition in which both rotational and vibrational states change. Like from (ν=0, J=0) to (ν=1, J=0), which would require a vibrational transition. Then the energy is ħω, as earlier.

But that gives p = 1.4e-29 kg m/s, which is also not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the units. Let me recheck.

Wait, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. So E = pc, so p = E/(c).

But perhaps I should not have used c, but the speed of light in a medium? No, photons in a vacuum, so c is correct.

Wait, maybe I forgot to consider the vibrational energy contribution in the moment of inertia. No, because I is based on the bond length and reduced mass, which are independent of the vibrational state.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is assuming that the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor, and the energy levels are quantized for rotation. The fundamental state is J=0, and the next state is J=1.

But even then, the calculation would be the same as before, yielding p=3e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm. But none of the options match this. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would require even higher energy. No, because the question is about the next state, which would be J=1.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me recheck the calculation.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 * 2) / (22) ) amu = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency ω is given for rotation, but no, the question says ω is the angular frequency of vibration. So I was correct in using it for the vibrational energy.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps the question is considering the transition to a different vibrational state but with the same rotational state, and the minimal possible energy is the vibrational transition. So the photon's energy is ħω.

But that gives p = (ħω)/c which is 1.4e-29 kg m/s, not matching the options.

Looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s. So the options are:

A: 1.9e-28 kg m/s

B:2.3e-27 kg m/s

C:1.1e-27 kg m/s

D:1.4e-28 kg m/s

Wait, my calculation for the rotational transition gave p=3.07e-31 kg m/s. That's about 3e-31, which is three orders of magnitude smaller than option D (1.4e-28), which is 1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of ħ²/(I). Did I forget the factor of 1/2 somewhere?

Wait, E_rot = (J (J+1) ) * ħ²/(2I). So the energy difference between J and J+1 is ( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) * ħ²/(2I) ) = ( (J+1)(J+2 - J) ) * ħ²/(2I) )= (J+1)*2 * ħ²/(2I) )= (J+1) ħ²/(I).

For J=0 to J=1, difference is (1) * ħ²/(I) = ħ²/(I).

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ²/(I).

Let me recompute that.

I = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 ≈ 9.207e-23 J.

So p = 9.207e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.069e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 3.07e-31 kg m/s. The smallest option is D, 1.4e-28 kg m/s. So there's a discrepancy of about four orders of magnitude. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents when calculating I. Let me recheck I.

μ = 3.019e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

R squared is (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = μ * R² = 3.019e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the energy not just for the rotational transition but a combined rotation and vibration transition? But that would be higher in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different model or has a typo in the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the moment of inertia for the vibration, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as the selection rules. But the selection rules for rotation usually allow ΔJ = ±1, and for vibration Δν = ±1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to cause a transition to the next higher vibrational state, regardless of the energy.

But that would require much higher energy, which would lead to a momentum of about 1.4e-29 kg m/s, which is still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (ν=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (ν=1, J=0), which would require a photon with energy ħω.

So let's compute that.

E_photon = ħω = 1.05457e-34 J s *4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E_photon / c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-29 kg m/s.

But again, that's 1.4e-29 kg m/s, which is 1.4e-29 Ns. The smallest option is D, 1.4e-28 Ns, which is 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when calculating ħω.

Wait, ω is 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = (1.05457e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic form of the energy, but that's unlikely for such a small energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next vibrational state, but the given options are based on the rotational transition. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the given options are based on a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, I think the correct approach is that the photon must provide the rotational energy, which we calculated as 3.07e-31 kg m/s. But since none of the options match that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31. The options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit. Oh! Wait, the given R is 2 angstroms. Did I convert that correctly into meters?

Yes, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the bond length is in picometers or another unit, but the question states it's in angstroms.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass calculation is incorrect. Let me recheck that.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would require more energy. But the problem states the next state with the lowest possible energy, so J=1 is the correct next state.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and ground rotational state, and the next state is the first vibrational state, but that's higher in energy than the rotational state.

But then the photon's momentum would be higher. But the options have a much lower order.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the problem statement.

Question: Molecule is in its fundamental state. What momentum should the photon have to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

So, the next state with the lowest energy would be the first rotational state, J=1, ν=0.

So the photon energy is ħ²/(I). So i think my approach is correct.

But the calculated momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's energy multiplied by 1e-3 or something. Or perhaps a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps the given angular frequency is 4e14 rad/s, which is in the infrared region. So the photon's energy is about 0.4 eV, which makes sense.

But that doesn't change the momentum calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's wavelength or something else. No, the question is about momentum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the moment of inertia incorrectly, perhaps as (Mx + My) instead of μ. Let me see.

If I mistakenly used the total mass instead of the reduced mass, what would happen?

I = (Mx + My) R².

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, so total M =22 amu.

μ = 20 *2 /22 = 40/22=1.818 amu.

But if I used M=22 amu, then I would be:

I = (22 amu) * (2e-10 m)^2.

But that would be a much larger I, hence smaller p.

Wait, let's compute that.

22 amu = 22 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.653e-26 kg.

I = 3.653e-26 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.653e-26 *4e-20 = 1.461e-45 kg m².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.461e-45 = 7.62e-24 J.

p = 7.62e-24 / 3e8 = 2.54e-32 kg m/s, which is even smaller than before.

No, that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of I once more.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Correct.

μ is 3.019e-27 kg. Correct.

So I = μ * R² = 3.019e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg m². Correct.

Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the photon's momentum to be in units of Ns (which is kg m/s). So the options are in Ns, which is the same as kg m/s.

But my calculation of 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 Ns.

The options are A:1.9e-28, B: 2.3e-27, C:1.1e-27, D:1.4e-28.

Hmm. So 3e-31 is three orders of magnitude smaller than option D.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition that involves both rotation and vibration. Let me compute that.

If the molecule transitions to a state where both ν and J change, but that would be a higher energy state. But the question is about the next lowest, so it would be the rotational transition.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the vibrational energy only.

Wait, let me compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition again.

E_photon = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

p = E/c = 4.218e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-29 kg m/s = 1.406e-29 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:1.4e-28 Ns, which is 10 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the exponent.

Wait, 4e14 rad/s. So ħω =1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

Yes.

p =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-29 kg m/s =1.406e-29 Ns.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for ħ, like using h instead of ħ. Because h is about 6.626e-34 J s, so ħ = h/(2pi) ≈ 1.054e-34.

If someone mistakenly used h instead of ħ, let's see what happens.

E_photon = h * ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately option D:1.4e-28. Not quite, but perhaps closer.

Wait, but that's if someone used h instead of ħ.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the problem is treating the photon's energy as the rotational energy, but using a wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon's energy to be the sum of rotational and vibrational transitions, but that would be higher.

Hmm.

Well, given that I'm getting p=3e-31 kg m/s for the rotational transition, but none of the options match, I'm starting to think that perhaps the intended approach was to compute the vibrational transition, which gives p=1.4e-29 kg m/s.

But that's not among the options either. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy difference between J=0 and J=2, which is a larger transition.

E_rot from J=0 to J=2: (4 -0) * ħ²/(2I) )= 2 ħ²/(I).

So energy is twice the previous value, so p would be 6.13e-31 kg m/s. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to a higher vibrational state, but the options are not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo in the given parameters. Like, perhaps the bond length is 2e-8 meters instead of 2e-10, which would change I by 1e4, which would change p by 1e4, leading to 3.07e-27 kg m/s, which is near option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given as 2e-12 meters (2 picometers), which is 0.2 angstroms, which would be incorrect, but let's see.

R =2e-12 m.

I = 3.019e-27 * (2e-12)^2 =3.019e-27 *4e-24=1.2076e-50 kg m².

Then, ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 /1.2076e-50 ≈ 9.207e-19 J.

p =9.207e-19 /3e8=3.069e-27 kg m/s, which is about 3e-27. Looking at the options, option B is 2.3e-27, which is close.

But why would R be 2e-12 m? That's 0.2 angstroms, which is too small for a bond length. So probably not.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia calculation, perhaps using R in a different unit.

Wait, perhaps R is given in picometers instead of angstroms. 2 angstroms is 200 picometers. So if someone mistook 2 angstroms as 2 picometers, R would be 2e-12 m, leading to a much larger I.

Wait, let's compute that.

R =2e-12 m.

I = μ R² =3.019e-27 kg * (2e-12 m)^2 =3.019e-27 *4e-24=1.2076e-50 kg m².

Then ħ²/I =1.112e-68 /1.2076e-50=9.207e-19 J.

p=9.207e-19 /3e8=3.069e-27 kg m/s.

Which is about 3e-27 kg m/s, near option B (2.3e-27). So perhaps the problem intended R to be 2e-12 m instead of 2e-10 m.

But the question states R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct approach is to pick the smallest p, which would be the rotational transition. But none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the intended correct answer is option C: 1.1e-27 kg m/s.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as using the energy from the harmonic oscillator model for the vibration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum as the rotational energy divided by c, but perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let me recompute the rotational energy.

E_rot = ħ²/(I) =1.112e-68 /1.2076e-46 =9.207e-23 J.

p=9.207e-23 /3e8=3.069e-31 kg m/s.

But no option matches. Hmm.

I'm stuck, but I think the correct approach is that the photon must provide the energy for the rotational transition. So the momentum is 3.07e-31 kg m/s, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=0 but ν=0 to ν=1, which would be the vibrational transition.

So E_photon = ħω=4.218e-20 J.

p=4.218e-20 /3e8=1.406e-29 kg m/s.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, which doesn't consider bond length changes, thus using a different I.

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, I is fixed, so same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy per molecule, but the question refers to the momentum of a single photon, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option A:1.9e-28 Ns.

But I don't see how to calculate that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different reduced mass, but I've checked that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit, but I've checked that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the photon's momentum to be for a transition that includes both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would be a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum in the rotational transition, but with a different I.

Wait, perhaps I should compute I again using Mx + My instead of μ. Let me see.

If I mistakenly used I = (Mx + My) R², what would that give?

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu, M=22 amu.

μ =20 *2/(22)=40/22=1.818 amu.

But if I used M=22 amu instead, I would have I =22e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2.

Wait, 22 amu is 22 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.653e-26 kg.

So I =3.653e-26 *4e-20=1.461e-45 kg m².

So ħ²/I=1.112e-68 /1.461e-45=7.62e-24 J.

p=7.62e-24 /3e8=2.54e-32 kg m/s.

Still way too small.

Hmm.

Well, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, but using a different formula.

Wait, the energy for a vibrational transition is (ν+1/2)ħω, so the difference from ν=0 to ν=1 is ħω.

So p= ħω /c = (1.05457e-34 *4e14)/3e8= (4.218e-20)/3e8=1.406e-29 kg m/s.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited rotational state (J=1) and first vibrational state (ν=1), but that's a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state, but the next state is a combination of both, but that would be a higher energy.

Hmm.

Well, I think that perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the momentum for the vibrational transition, which would be approximately 1.4e-29 kg m/s. But since none of the options match, perhaps the problem expects the rotational transition.

But in that case, the answer isn't among the options. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in meters instead of angstroms. Wait, no, R is given as 2 angstroms, which I correctly converted to 2e-10 m.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass is to be calculated in a different way, but I've double-checked that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Planck's constant, but even so, the discrepancy is still large.

In any case, based on my calculations, the correct answer should be around 3e-31 kg m/s for the rotational transition, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct approach is to calculate the vibrational transition, giving p=1.4e-29 kg m/s, which is closest to option D: 1.4e-28 kg m/s.

But wait, 1.4e-29 is an order of magnitude smaller than option D, which is 1.4e-28.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when calculating p. Let me recheck.

E_photon = ħω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 =4.218e-20 J.

p =4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-29 kg m/s.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the energy in terms of eV instead of J. But that doesn't change the momentum calculation.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps the intended approach was to compute the vibrational transition, so the answer is closest to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option A, which is 1.9e-28 kg m/s. But I don't see how to get that.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the momentum for the transition from J=0 to J=2.

E_rot = (2)(2+1) * ħ²/(2I) - 0 =3 * ħ²/(2I).

Which is 3*(9.207e-23)/2 =1.381e-22 J.

p=1.381e-22 /3e8=4.603e-31 kg m/s.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time on this. I'll proceed with the conclusion that the correct answer is the rotational transition, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27. But I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is initially in its fundamental state (ν=0, J=0), and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Energy Levels and Transitions**:  
   The energy levels of the molecule are determined by both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state corresponds to (ν=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy is either (ν=1, J=0) or (ν=0, J=1). The rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) requires less energy than the vibrational transition (ν=0 → ν=1), as the spacing between rotational energy levels is smaller.

2. **Rotational Energy Difference**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{J(J+1)\hbar^2}{2I}
   \]  
   where \(I = \mu R^2\) is the moment of inertia, \(\mu\) is the reduced mass, \(R\) is the bond length, and \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck's constant. The energy difference for the transition \(J=0 \to J=1\) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]  
   Substituting the given values:  
   - \(M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu}\), so \(\mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}\). Converting to kg:  
     \[
     \mu = 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]  
   - \(R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\).  
   - \(I = \mu R^2 = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m}^2\).  
   - \(\hbar = 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s}\).  
   - \(\hbar^2 = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2 \approx 1.112 \times 10^{-68} \, \text{J}^2 \, \text{s}^2\).  
   - \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{1.112 \times 10^{-68}}{1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.207 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\).  

3. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}}\):  
   \[
   p = \frac{9.207 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.069 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m/s}.
   \]  

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated momentum (\(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m/s}\)) is significantly smaller than all the provided options, which range from \(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m/s}\) to \(2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m/s}\). This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem's parameters or a misinterpretation of the question.  

5. **Vibrational Transition Consideration**:  
   If the problem instead considers a vibrational transition (\(\nu = 0 \to \nu = 1\)), the energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34})(4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m/s}.
   \]  
   This value is also much smaller than the options provided.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   Based on the calculations, the correct momentum for the rotational transition is \(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m/s}\), but this does not match any of the given options. If the problem intends to consider a vibrational transition, the momentum (\(1.406 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m/s}\)) is still an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest option (\(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m/s}\)). Given the mismatch, the closest plausible answer is **option D**.

Answer: D
