Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the brightness of a star, as seen from Earth, determines which instruments can observe it. 

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So wait, wait, magnitude is a bit tricky because lower numbers mean brighter. So if something is brighter than 17, it's magnitude less than 17. Because like, a star of magnitude 17 is dimmer than one of 16.

So ESPRESSO can see down to 17 mag. And HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So a star must be brighter than 16 for HIRES, which is better (brighter) than ESPRESSO's 17. Wait, no, because if ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, then anything above 17 (i.e., magnitude higher than 17) would be too dim for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the apparent V magnitude is what's given. Let me get this straight.

Wait, each star's apparent magnitude is what's important here. Because that's what the telescopes can detect. So the key is to find which stars have V magnitudes bright enough for both telescopes.

Wait, but I see that for Star2, the apparent V is 16.5. So for HIRES, which can go down to brighter than 16, meaning V magnitude less than 16. So 16.5 is dimmer than 16, so HIRES can't see it. Oh wait wait, no, because if HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, that means any star with V magnitude less than or equal to 16 would be observable. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So a V mag of 16.5 is higher, meaning dimmer than 16. So it's too faint for HIRES, but maybe within ESPRESSO's limit of 17. So Star2's V mag is 16.5. So ESPRESSO can observe it (since 16.5 <17), but HIRES can't (since 16.5 >16). So Star2 can be observed by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V mag is 15.5, at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude would be same as absolute if at 10 pc, right? Because apparent magnitude (m) equals absolute magnitude (M) when distance d is 10 pc. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5. So both telescopes can see it? Because 15.5 is less than 16 (HIRES limit) and less than 17 (ESPRESSO). So Star1 can be seen by both.

Star2: apparent V mag is 16.5. So its apparent magnitude is 16.5. For HIRES, can it be observed? HIRES requires V mag <=16. So 16.5 is higher, so no. But for ESPRESSO, 16.5 is less than 17, so yes. So Star2 is only detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So it's a candidate for only one, not both.

Star3: apparent V mag is 15.5, but we have to consider interstellar extinction, right? Because E(B-V)=0.6. The note says that the total absorption in V is E(B-V) * 3.1. So the extinction A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the true apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m0 = m_observed + A_v. Wait, wait, no. Because extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so the observed m is brighter than the intrinsic m0? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Extinction (absorption and scattering) makes stars appear dimmer, so their apparent magnitude increases. So, if a star's true apparent magnitude is m0 (without extinction), the observed m would be m0 + A_v.

Wait, no, wait another moment. Let me think. The extinction (which is the amount the star is dimmed) adds to the apparent magnitude. So if a star's intrinsic apparent magnitude is m0, with extinction, it's m = m0 + A_v. So in this case, Star3 is given as apparent V mag of 15.5, but that's after extinction? Or is that the intrinsic? The question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" but with E(B-V)=0.6. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the problem statement says Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag..." So the apparent V magnitude given includes the extinction? Or is that the observed magnitude, and we have to correct for extinction?

Wait, I think the way it's presented is that the apparent magnitude is observed (so it's already including the extinction), but the question is about brightness. Wait, no, actually, I think the apparent magnitude is the observed magnitude, and E(B-V) is the color excess, which tells us about the amount of extinction.

So, the formula is A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 3.1 * 0.6 ≈1.86 mag. So the star's light is dimmed by 1.86 mag due to dust between us and the star. So if the star's emitted apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m0 = m_observed - A_v. Wait, no. Because the observed magnitude is higher (dimmer) than the intrinsic. So the intrinsic m0 is less than the observed m. So, to find the intrinsic m0: m0 = m_observed - A_v. Wait, no. Let me think: if there's no extinction, the apparent magnitude is m0. If extinction adds A_v, then the observed m = m0 + A_v. So if the observed m is 15.5, and A_v is 1.86, then m0 = 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So that's what we observe. But to find the star's true brightness, how does that affect the ability of the telescopes to detect it? Because the telescopes can observe the star's apparent magnitude as they see it. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The telescopes detect the apparent magnitude, which includes the extinction. So when the question says, for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6, leading to A_v=1.86. So the observed magnitude is 15.5, but the intrinsic is 13.64.

But for the purpose of detection, the telescope only sees the observed magnitude. So regardless of extinction, the apparent magnitude as observed is 15.5. So for Star3, apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16 (HIRES limit) and less than 17 (ESPRESSO limit). So both telescopes can observe it.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Because the star's actual brightness as we see it is 15.5. So both spectrographs can see it.

Star4: absolute V mag is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent V mag is same as absolute, 15.5. But E(B-V) is 0.4, so A_v = 3.1 *0.4= 1.24 mag. So the apparent V mag as observed is 15.5 +1.24=16.74? Wait, no. Wait, earlier I was confused about whether the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic or observed. Let me re-express.

Wait, no. The apparent magnitude given is the observed one, so Star4's apparent V is 15.5, and it's located at 10 pc, so its absolute mag is 15.5. But it's E(B-V) is 0.4. So the extinction is 1.24 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude is m = m0 + A_v. Wait, but in this case, m0 is the apparent magnitude without extinction. So if the star's m0 is 15.5, then the observed would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So the observed apparent magnitude is 16.74.

Oh wait, that's different. So for Star4, the question says its apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.4, so A_v=1.24. So the actual observed V magnitude is 15.5 +1.24=16.74 mag. So when considering whether the telescope can see it, we use the observed apparent magnitude. So Star4's observed V mag is 16.74.

So for HIRES, which can observe down to 16 mag: 16.74 is higher than 16, so it's too faint. So HIRES can't observe it. What about ESPRESSO? Its limit is 17. Since 16.74 <17, ESPRESSO can observe it. So Star4 can be observed by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: when the star's light passes through interstellar medium, it gets dimmed, so the apparent magnitude increases (becomes larger). So the observed magnitude is higher than the intrinsic. So if the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is 15.5, with extinction of 1.24, the observed is 16.74. So for HIRES, which requires apparent V mag <=16, 16.74 is too high. So HIRES can't see it. For ESPRESSO, 16.74 <17, so yes. So Star4 can be observed by ESPRESSO, but not HIRES.

Star5: absolute V mag is 16.5, located at 5 pc. So apparent V mag is m = M + 5 log10 (d/10) = 16.5 + 5 log(5/10) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010)= 16.5 -1.505 ≈14.995 ≈15.0 mag. So apparent V is ~15.0. Now, any extinction? The question doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star5, so E(B-V)=0. So no extinction. So apparent V is 15.0, which is less than 16 and 17. So both telescopes can observe it.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says Star5's apparent V is 16.5? Wait no. Wait, the question says Star5: absolute V magnitude of 16.5, located at 5 pc.

So, m = M +5 log (d/10) = 16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5-1.505=14.995, which rounds to 15.0. So apparent V is 15.0, no extinction. So both telescopes can see it.

Wait, but wait, the question description for Star5 says "absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us." So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but in the options, Star5 is in options A and B. Let me look at the options again.

Options:
A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

We need to find which stars can be seen by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: apparent V=15.5. So both can see it. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: apparent V=16.5. HIRES can't (needs <=16), ESPRESSO can. So only ESPRESSO.

Star3: apparent V=15.5, which is observed. So both can see it.

Star4: apparent V=16.74, so only ESPRESSO can.

Star5: apparent V=15.0, so both can see it.

Wait, so wait, which stars are detectable by both? Let me list each star's apparent V mag and whether both can see it.

Star1: 15.5 → HIRES (<=16 → yes), ESPRESSO (<=17 → yes) → yes.

Star2:16.5 → HIRES: no, ESPRESSO: yes → no.

Star3:15.5 → both → yes.

Star4:16.74 → HIRES: no, ESPRESSO: yes → no.

Star5:15.0 → both → yes.

So stars 1,3,5 can be observed by both.

Wait, but let me think about Star3 again. Because Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but did I correctly account for extinction? Wait, no. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when a star has extinction, the observed apparent magnitude is higher (dimmer) than the intrinsic. So if the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m0, then the observed m = m0 + A_v.

In Star3's case, the question says the apparent V is 15.5. But wait, that 15.5 is the observed value, which includes extinction. So the question says the apparent V is 15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6, which gives A_v=1.86. So the star without extinction would have m0 = 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. So the star's light is dimmed by 1.86 mag. Therefore, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is what the telescopes see.

So for Star3, the observed V is 15.5. Both telescopes can see it, since 15.5 is under 16 and 17.

So which stars can both observe? Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which pairs are in the options.

Looking at the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both can be seen by both telescopes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be seen by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

So the only pair where both stars can be seen by both telescopes is Star3 and Star5, which is option B.

Wait, but wait, let's check again:

Star1: 15.5 → both → yes. So if an option includes Star1 and another star, that's a possibility, but looking at the options, only option D has Star1 and Star4. But Star4 can't be seen by HIRES.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options except A and B have both stars observable by both.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option B is Star3 and Star5. Both can be seen by both telescopes, as we've determined.

So the correct answer should be option B. But wait, what about Star5? The question says Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, at 5 pc. So m = M + 5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, approximately 15.0. So apparent V is 15.0. No extinction. So both telescopes can see it.

So the stars that can be seen by both are Star3 (15.5 observed), Star1 (15.5 observed), and Star5 (15.0 observed).

But let's look at the options:

Option B is Star3 and Star5. So both can be observed by both telescopes.

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the telescopes' brightness limits and any interstellar extinction.

### Key Information:
1. **ESPRESSO (Paranal Observatory)**: Can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., V ≤ 17).
2. **HIRES (Keck Observatory)**: Can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., V ≤ 16).
3. **Interstellar Extinction**: The total absorption in the V band is given by \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) \). This extinction increases the apparent V magnitude of a star.

### Analysis of Each Star:
#### **Star1**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \), Distance: 10 pc.
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = M \) (since \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)).
- \( m = 15.5 \).
- Both ESPRESSO (\( 15.5 \leq 17 \)) and HIRES (\( 15.5 \leq 16 \)) can observe it.

#### **Star2**:
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \).
- HIRES requires \( m \leq 16 \), so it cannot observe Star2.
- ESPRESSO can observe Star2 (\( 16.5 \leq 17 \)).
- **Not observable by both telescopes**.

#### **Star3**:
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).
- Extinction: \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).
- Observed apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \) (already includes extinction).
- Both ESPRESSO (\( 15.5 \leq 17 \)) and HIRES (\( 15.5 \leq 16 \)) can observe it.

#### **Star4**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \), Distance: 10 pc.
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = M = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).
- Extinction: \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).
- Observed apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).
- HIRES requires \( m \leq 16 \), so it cannot observe Star4.
- ESPRESSO can observe Star4 (\( 16.74 \leq 17 \)).
- **Not observable by both telescopes**.

#### **Star5**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \), Distance: 5 pc.
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).
- No extinction mentioned (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).
- Both ESPRESSO (\( 15.0 \leq 17 \)) and HIRES (\( 15.0 \leq 16 \)) can observe it.

### Conclusion:
- **Star1**: Observable by both.
- **Star2**: Observable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star3**: Observable by both.
- **Star4**: Observable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star5**: Observable by both.

From the options provided, the only pair of stars that can be observed by both telescopes is **Star3 and Star5**.

**Answer: B**
