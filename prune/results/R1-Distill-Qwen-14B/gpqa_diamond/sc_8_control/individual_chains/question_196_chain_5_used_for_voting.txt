Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm. I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed, but since this is relativistic, I guess special relativity comes into play here. Let me think through this.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx. Oh right, the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But wait, in relativity, energy considerations change because of the gamma factor.

In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a classical oscillator, the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m). But that's without considering relativity. Since this is relativistic, I can't use that formula directly.

Relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². Potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA². So at the equilibrium point (x=0), all potential energy is converted into kinetic. So (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1)mc². Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right?

So setting up the equation: (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

Let me rearrange this. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So (gamma - 1) is (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) - 1.

So substituting, (1/2)k A² = [ (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ] m c².

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let's see if I can solve for v.

Let me denote gamma as γ for simplicity. So,

(1/2)k A² = (γ - 1) m c² → γ = ( (1/2)k A² )/(m c² ) + 1.

But wait, γ can't be more than 1 in the non-relativistic case, but in reality, it's bigger than 1. Hmm, maybe better to express γ in terms of the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of beta, where beta = v/c. So let me let beta = v/c, so v = beta c.

Then, the equation becomes (1/2)k A² = (γ - 1) m c².

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So substituting:

(1/2)k A² = ( (1/(sqrt(1 - beta²))) - 1 ) m c².

Let me rearrange this equation:

(1/(sqrt(1 - beta²))) = 1 + [ (k A²) / (2 m c²) ].

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, let me compute it as (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (1/2) (k A²)/(m c²) = let's just say it's called Q for now.

So 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + Q.

Wait, solving for beta would give me v_max.

So square both sides:

1/(1 - beta²) = (1 + Q)^2 → 1 - beta² = 1/(1 + Q)^2 → beta² = 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2.

So beta = sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 ).

Then, v_max = beta c = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 ), where Q is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, let me substitute Q back in. So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ).

Let me see the options. Option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ). So that's option D.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option D says sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + ... )^2), which matches what I have.

Alternatively, another approach: in the classical case, the maximum speed is sqrt(kA²/m). But in relativity, the kinetic energy equation is different. So perhaps the maximum speed is less than c, which makes sense.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any algebra mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.

We have the potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)k A². At the equilibrium position, all that is converted into relativistic kinetic energy. So:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as Q again, so 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 + Q.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - beta²) = (1 + Q)^2.

So 1 - beta² = 1/(1 + Q)^2.

Beta squared is 1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2).

Therefore, v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2).

Which is exactly option D.

Looking at the options:

Option D) v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thing: Let me check whether any of the other options might look similar but are wrong. Option A has a sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ...)^2), which seems different. Option B is sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - ...)) inside, which seems not matching. Option C is the classical formula, so it's not correct for relativistic case.

So the correct answer must be option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the conversion of potential energy into relativistic kinetic energy at the equilibrium position. 

The potential energy at maximum amplitude is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and at equilibrium, this is fully converted into relativistic kinetic energy, given by \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Setting these equal:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \) in terms of \( \beta = v/c \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( Q = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - \beta^2} = (1 + Q)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \beta^2 \):

\[
\beta^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + Q)^2}.
\]

Thus, \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + Q)^2}} \), and substituting back \( Q = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the options, it matches option D:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

The other options are incorrect because:
- Option A and B involve incorrect forms of the relativistic expression.
- Option C corresponds to the classical result, which does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
