Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I remember that the metric describes the geometry of the spacetime, and here, since it's a 2D metric, it's probably part of a higher-dimensional spacetime that's been simplified. Wait, but the question mentions a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like a saddle shape. But wait, in relativity terms, a pseudosphere might refer to a 2D surface with an imaginary radius, but perhaps that's not the case here. Or maybe it's a different context.

Wait, actually, pseudosphere in some contexts refers to a 2D surface with hyperbolic geometry. So the metric might be describing a hyperbolic plane or something similar. Let's see.

The metric is in terms of x and y, so is this a 2-dimensional spacetime? Or is it embedded in a higher dimension? Hmm, the metric is given in terms of dx² and dy², with a scaling factor 32/(4 -x² -y²). So the line element depends on the position in x and y. 

Wait, the denominator is (4 -x² - y²). That suggests that the domain of x and y is such that 4 -x² - y² is positive, so x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the metric is defined only where x² + y² <4. Interesting.

Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but the metric is given with a denominator 4 -x² -y², which is 4 - r² where r²= x²+y². So when r=2, the denominator becomes zero, which would mean that the metric blows up. So maybe the pseudosphere is at r=2, which is the boundary of the domain where the metric is defined.

Wait, but wait. The area of the pseudosphere. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (which would be a pseudosphere in 2D, I think) with radius r is 4π r². But wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) actually has an infinite area. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Hold on, let me think again. In spherical geometry, the area of a sphere is 4πr². In hyperbolic geometry, for a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature), the area would be different. But wait, a pseudosphere in 2D is like a hyperbolic plane. Wait, no, the pseudosphere is a different concept, perhaps. Or maybe the metric given here is that of a hyperbolic plane.

Wait, the metric given is similar to the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. The Poincaré disk model has the metric ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk (r <1). So our metric here is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), which can be rewritten in polar coordinates. Let me try that.

Let me convert to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the metric becomes ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ² ). 

So comparing to the Poincaré disk model, which is ds² = (4/(1 - r²))² (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, no, the Poincaré metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), but our metric has (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ² ). Let me factor out the 4: denominator 4(1 - (r²/4)), so 32/(4 (1 - (r²/4))) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)). So the metric becomes ds² = (8/(1 - (r²/4)) ) (dr² + r² dθ² ). 

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk model is for a hyperbolic plane with curvature. The curvature is related to the scale of the model. But in the standard model, the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), which is for a hyperbolic plane with curvature -1/(scale)^2. So here, the denominator is (4 - r²) =4(1 - r²/4). So the scaling here would be different. Let me see: the standard Poincaré model has the denominator (1 - r²), so in our case, it's (4 - r²) =4(1 - (r²/4)), which suggests that the curvature would be scaled with a factor of 1/2, since the denominator is 4(1 - (r²/4)), which is equivalent to scaling r by 2. So maybe the curvature is -1/(2)^2 = -1/4? Or perhaps I should think about the Gaussian curvature.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit off track. The main point is that the metric given is similar to a hyperbolic metric, which suggests that the space described is a hyperbolic plane. Now, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, in this metric, r=2 would be at the edge of the disk where the denominator becomes zero, so the metric blows up there. So perhaps the pseudosphere is the boundary of this space, but that's a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere in this context is the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Because the hyperbolic plane extends infinitely, so the area would be infinite. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a 2-sphere in this space, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. If it's a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, then its area might be infinite. Alternatively, perhaps the area is calculated using the metric given.

Wait, the area would be the integral of the area element over the surface. The area element in the metric is the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. So the metric in 2D is given as:

g = [ (32/(4 - x² - y²)) , 0 ]
      [ 0 , (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ]

So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The square root of the determinant is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is 32/(4 - r²) r dr dθ, in polar coordinates.

So the area would be the integral over all x and y where x² + y² <4.

So the area A is ∫ (from r=0 to r=2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] r dθ dr.

Let me compute this integral.

First, let's compute the inner integral over θ. The integrand doesn't depend on θ, so the inner integral is 2π.

So A = ∫ (0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] r * 2π dr.

Simplify: A = 64 π ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ r/(u) ] * (-1/2) du * r dr? Wait, wait. Let me rework that.

Wait, the integral is ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to2.

Let u=4 - r² → du= -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So substituting, r dr = (-1/2) du.

Limits: when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [ (r dr) / u ] → ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / u.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

But wait, the integral is from 4 to 0, and when we change variables, we can reverse the limits to go from 0 to 4, and remove the negative sign.

So it becomes (1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4.

The integral of 1/u is ln|u|. So evaluating from 0 to4: (1/2)[ ln u ] from 0 to4 = (1/2)(ln4 - ln0).

Wait, ln0 is negative infinity. So (ln4 - (-infty)) is positive infinity. So the integral diverges to positive infinity.

So the area A is 64 π times infinity, which is infinity.

Thus, the area is infinite.

Looking at the options:

Option D is +infty.

So the answer should be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D spacetime. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the metric is defined only in the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\).

In the context of the metric, the pseudosphere likely refers to the boundary of the spacetime, where the metric blows up as \(r \to 2\). To compute the area, the area element is derived from the metric. In polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), the metric becomes 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element is proportional to \(\sqrt{\det g}\), where \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element is 

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r dr d\theta.
\]

The total area \(A\) is then given by the integral over the region \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\):

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r dr d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta\) evaluates to \(2\pi\), leaving:

\[
A = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} dr = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} dr = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \(\ln 0 \to -\infty\), the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). Therefore, the area \(A\) is infinite.

From the options provided:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as shown by the divergent integral.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
