Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let's break down what's given.

They said Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's of the form c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is another matrix. The S matrix's first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to write down what Ay looks like.

Wait, wait. Let me write S first. So S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * S. So multiplying each element by c, Ay becomes:

[ 0    -i c ]
[ i c   0  ]

But wait, let's compute c. c is h/(4π). So when I plug that in, the elements become:

Top right: -i * (h/(4π)) = -i h/(4π)
Bottom left: i * (h/(4π)) = i h/(4π)

So Ay is:
[ 0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    0    ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Oh right, eigenvalues come from solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

So let's set up the matrix Ay - λ I:

[ -λ      (-i h)/(4π)   ]
[ (i h)/(4π)     -λ    ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ] = λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Simplify the second term. (-i)(i) is (-i^2) because i times i is i² = -1. So (-i)(i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1.

So the determinant becomes λ² - [ (1) * h²/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

So the equation is λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. Solving for λ: λ² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, wait. Because sqrt( (h/(4π))^2 ) is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. That's interesting because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Wait, wait, wait. Ay is c * S.

Wait, what's S? Let me check S again. S is the Pauli matrix sigma y, which is Hermitian because S†=S. Because S has real entries except for the imaginary unit. Let me compute S†:

The conjugate transpose of S is:

[ 0    i ]
[ -i   0 ]

Which is not the same as S, so S is not Hermitian? Wait, no. Wait, no, S is anti-Hermitian? Because S† = -S.

Wait, S has elements [0, -i; i, 0]. The conjugate transpose is [0, i; -i, 0], which is the negative of S. So S† = -S. So S is anti-Hermitian. So when you multiply by c, which is real, then Ay = c S would be anti-Hermitian. Because (Ay)† = c S† = c (-S) = - c S = -Ay. So Ay is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, but for an operator to have real eigenvalues, it must be Hermitian. So if Ay is anti-Hermitian, then its eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. But wait, earlier calculation says eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me reevaluate. Let me re-calculate the determinant correctly.

The matrix Ay is:
[ 0        (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    0      ]

So when I compute the determinant of (Ay - λ I), it's:

( -λ ) ( -λ ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

So the product is (-i)(i) (h^2)/(16 π²) ) = [ (i² is -1, so (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1)=1)].

So the determinant is λ^2 - [ (1) * (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

So λ² = (h/(4π))^2 → λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but if Ay is anti-Hermitian, then it's eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. But according to this, the eigenvalues are real. That's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up S. Let me double-check. S is given as first row 0, -i; second row i, 0. So when I write it as a matrix, it's [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute S^†.

The conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is -S because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S^† = -S. So c is real, so Ay = c S is anti-Hermitian since (Ay)† = c S^† = - c S = - Ay.

So if Ay is anti-Hermitian, then its eigenvalues should be purely imaginary. Because for a matrix M, if M is Hermitian, eigenvalues are real; if M is anti-Hermitian, eigenvalues are purely imaginary.

But according to my earlier calculation, the eigenvalues are real. So something's wrong here. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, determinant equation:

Ay is [[ -λ, (-i h)/(4π) ], [ (i h)/(4π), -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π) )*(i h/(4π) ) ]

So compute the product:

(-i) * (i) = (-i^2) = -( -1 ) = 1.

So the term is 1 * (h^2)/(16 π²).

Thus, determinant is λ² - [h²/(16 π²)] = 0 → λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ=±h/(4π).

Hmm, that suggests real eigenvalues, but anti-Hermitian matrices should have imaginary eigenvalues. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I wrote the operator incorrectly. Let me go back to the problem statement.

Problem says: Ay = c·S, where c = h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with first row 0 -i, second row i 0.

Ah wait, perhaps S is being multiplied by c as a scalar. So Ay is c * S. So S is:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

Multiply by c: Ay becomes:

[0     -i c ]
[i c    0 ]

Which with c = h/(4π), gives:

[0       -i h/(4π) ]
[i h/(4π)  0      ]

Wait, but in this form, is Ay Hermitian or anti-Hermitian?

Compute Ay's conjugate transpose (Ay)†:

The matrix elements become:

[0       i h/(4π) ]
[ -i h/(4π)  0    ]

Which is not the same as Ay, but it's negative of Ay. Because the (1,2) element is i h/(4π), while in Ay it's -i h/(4π). And (2,1) is -i h/(4π), whereas Ay has i h/(4π). So (Ay)† = -Ay. So Ay is anti-Hermitian.

So, for an anti-Hermitian matrix, eigenvalues are purely imaginary. So why did I get real eigenvalues?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in determinant equation.

Wait, let me recompute the determinant.

The matrix Ay - λ I is:

[ -λ    -i c ]
[ i c   -λ   ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i c)(i c) = λ² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c². (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So this equals 1 * c².

So determinant is λ² - c² = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ± c.

Wait, so λ is ± c. But c is h/(4π), so λ = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real.

But wait, that contradicts the fact that for an anti-Hermitian operator, eigenvalues are imaginary. So what's going on here? Did I mix up the operator?

Wait, perhaps the operator is supposed to be Hermitian, but I'm getting a different structure. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the operator is not anti-Hermitian, but Hermitian. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. Because the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Oh wait, wait, S is given in the problem as the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. Oh! Wait, no, the Pauli Y matrix is actually [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is Hermitian? Let me check.

The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz.

σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. To check if it's Hermitian, we take the conjugate transpose. The conjugate of σy is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as σy, because σy has -i in position (1,2), so the conjugate (i) is in (2,1), which matches. So σy is Hermitian. So S is Hermitian, because S is σy.

So then, Ay is c times a Hermitian matrix, so Ay is Hermitian. Because c is a real scalar, so Hermitian times real is Hermitian.

Wait wait, then earlier reasoning about the eigenvalues being real makes sense now. Because if Ay is Hermitian, the eigenvalues are real. So my initial confusion was because I thought S was anti-Hermitian, but actually it's Hermitian. Because the given S matrix is σy, which is Hermitian.

So going back, my calculation of the eigenvalues being ±h/(4π) is correct. So the eigenvalues are real.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh or ±–2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because the eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real ±1. That doesn't fit because the eigenvalues are real, so real parts are ±h/(4π), not ±1. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm, because A is the component (like L or S), the square of the magnitude (A²) commutes with all components. So if a vector is an eigenfunction of Ay, it is also an eigenfunction of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? Well, in quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum don't commute with each other. So an eigenstate of Ay is not an eigenstate of Az. So C's statement is correct.

Wait, but option C says "eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az." That seems correct because A² commutes with Ay, but Ay and Az don't commute. So eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not sure what that means. Basis functions usually refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenfunctions form a basis. So if Ay is a 2x2 matrix with two eigenfunctions, then the eigenvectors form a basis. So D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator. That sounds correct too.

Wait, but what's the question again? It says, during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct.

Wait, looking at the options, options C and D could both be correct. But let's reevaluate.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. I'm not sure. The basis functions are the eigenfunctions if the operator is diagonal in that basis. So if Ay is diagonal in its eigenbasis, which it is, then the eigenfunctions form the basis. So yes, D is correct.

Wait, but the question is whether the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis for the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statements are correct. Now, let me look at the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct because A² commutes with Ay. So any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That is true because the eigenvectors of a matrix form a basis for the vector space (assuming the matrix is diagonalizable, which it is here).

So both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, the possible correct statement is among the choices. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding option D.

Wait, option D says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The basis functions are the vectors that form the basis. So if Ay is represented in the eigenbasis, then the eigenvectors form the basis. So D is correct.

But let me think about the options again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the initial calculation: solving Ay φ = a φ. So the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the operator? Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis, but the operator's matrix representation in that basis is diagonal. So yes, the statement in D is correct.

Now, looking back at the options, which of the options is correct.

Options:

A) wrong because eigenvalues are real.

B) wrong.

C) correct.

D) correct.

Wait, but the options are four, and only one is correct. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, let's reevaluate.

Wait, the problem says that the muon's Y-component of intrinsic angular momentum is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. So assuming it's a spin-1/2 particle, so the intrinsic angular momentum is spin, and the components are given by S_x, S_y, S_z multiplied by ħ/2, but here it's represented as c S, where c = h/(4π). Wait, Planck's constant h is 2πħ, so h/(4π) = ħ/(2). So c= ħ/2. So S is the Pauli matrices.

So Ay is (ħ/2) * σy.

The eigenvalues of σy are ±i, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by i. Wait, let's compute σy's eigenvalues.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix σy has eigenvalues ±i. Because the trace is zero and determinant is -1. So the characteristic equation is λ^2 +1 =0 → λ=±i.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me compute the eigenvalues of σy.

σy is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

The characteristic equation is det(σy - λ I) = ( -λ )^2 - ( (-i)(i) ) → λ² - (i*(-i)) → λ² - (1) = 0. So λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

Wait, that's not right. Because when I compute (-i)(i) = -i² = 1. So λ^2 - 1 =0 → λ=±1.

Wait, but earlier I thought the eigenvalues were ±i. Hmm, which is correct?

Wait, let me compute the eigenvalues of σy.

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σy has eigenvalues ±1? Wait, no, wait. Because σy is Hermitian, and its eigenvalues are real. Let me compute the trace and determinant.

Trace of σy is 0. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i²) = 0 - (-(-1)) = 0 - (1) = -1. So the determinant is -1.

So the characteristic equation is λ² - trace λ + determinant = λ² - 0 λ -1 = λ² -1=0. So λ=±1. So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

Wait, that's for σy. So when we have Ay = c * σy, where c= h/(4π) = ħ/2 (since h=2πħ), the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (±1) → ± c.

So the eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2) → since ħ= h/(2π), so (h/(2π)) * (1/2) )= h/(4π). So yes, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real.

So which options are correct? Let me look at the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, because A² is the square of the angular momentum component, which in quantum mechanics commutes with all components. So any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². But since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space (since it's a 2x2 matrix, two eigenvectors which are orthogonal can form a basis). So D is correct.

So which one is the correct answer?

Looking back at the options, only one can be correct. Let me think about what each option is saying.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Which is also correct, but perhaps the statement is trivial because any operator's eigenvectors form a basis if they are diagonalizable. But the option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So it's correct.

Wait, but in the context of the question, which asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

But the options are A, B, C, D. The correct statements are C and D. But the options can't both be correct. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating whether the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis functions of the operator.

Well, the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it's acting on a two-dimensional space. Its eigenfunctions form a basis for that space. So the statement in D is correct.

But why are C and D both correct? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should read the options more carefully.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So the question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because D is a general statement, whereas the calculation would lead us to C.

Wait, but during the calculation, the main thing we find is the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So which statement is correct about that.

But let me think about the options again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is, the eigenfunctions form the basis for the matrix. But any diagonalizable matrix has eigenvectors as a basis. So D is a correct statement.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions form a basis, which is D. Or whether the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², which is C.

But the question is which statement you would consider correct during the calculation.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because D is always true for diagonalizable matrices, but the question is about the specific eigenvectors found.

Alternatively, perhaps both C and D are correct, but in the options, only one is correct. Wait, looking at the options, the correct answer is that option C is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which option is correct based on the calculation I did.

Wait, the eigenvalues are real and equal to ±c, where c = h/(4π).

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Real parts are ±h/(4π), imaginary parts ±2πh. No, because eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts are zero.

Option B: Real parts ±1, imaginary parts ±1/2. No, we have real eigenvalues of ±h/(4π).

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Correct.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Correct.

But the question only allows one correct option. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the eigenvectors as well.

Ay has eigenvalues ± c = ± h/(4π).

Let me find the eigenvectors. Let's take λ = c.

So Ay - c I is:

[ -c   (-i c) ]
[ i c    -c   ]

We can write the equations as:

- c φ1 - i c φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to ( -i, 1 ). Or, since we can factor out, the eigenvectors can be written as [ -i, 1 ]^T. Similarly, for λ = -c, the equation becomes:

c φ1 - i c φ2 =0 → φ1 = i φ2. So eigenvectors are [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

These are the eigenfunctions. So they form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct. Let's see the options again.

The problem is a multiple-choice, and only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the option D.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so yes, D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, but the eigenfunctions are the basis functions in the sense that the matrix is diagonal in this basis. So D is correct.

But now I'm getting a bit stuck because I think both C and D are correct. But perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. So I'll choose C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is represented by the matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Form of \( A_y \)
Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) into \( A_y = c \cdot S \), we get:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \):

\[
\det \begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -\lambda \end{bmatrix} = \lambda^2 - \left(-i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) \left(i \frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = \lambda^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
\]

Setting this equal to zero gives:

\[
\lambda^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

### Step 3: Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
For \( \lambda = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector satisfies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} -\frac{h}{4\pi} & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i \frac{h}{4\pi} & -\frac{h}{4\pi} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \phi_1 \\ \phi_2 \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

From the first equation, \( \phi_1 = -i \phi_2 \). Choosing \( \phi_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\phi = \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For \( \lambda = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), a similar calculation gives the eigenvector:

\[
\phi = \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Analysis of the Options

#### **Option A**
This states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) or \( \pm (-2\pi h) \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), with no imaginary components.

#### **Option B**
This states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

#### **Option C**
This states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

#### **Option D**
This states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenfunctions of a diagonalizable matrix form a basis for the vector space in which the matrix acts. Since \( A_y \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with two eigenfunctions, these eigenfunctions form a basis.

### Step 5: Final Decision
Both **Option C** and **Option D** are correct based on the analysis. However, since the question asks for the statement that is correct "during the calculation," **Option C** is the most relevant, as it directly relates to the properties of the eigenfunctions in the context of angular momentum operators.

Answer: C
