Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to break it down. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the Pz operator, ΔPz. 

Alright, the setup is that there's an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which I think means that the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz.

Wait, so I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for Pz, I need to find ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩, then compute the square root of their difference.

But wait, if the state is an eigenstate of Px, then what about Pz? Because in quantum mechanics, if two operators don't commute, their uncertainties are related. Px and Pz probably don't commute since they're different components of angular momentum or something similar. But wait, P here could be any operator, but the structure of the matrices might give a clue. For example, if these are components of angular momentum, then Lx and Lz don't commute. So the state won't be an eigenstate of Pz.

So first, I think I need to compute the expectation values ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩ for the given state.

Given the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, the matrix Pz is diagonal, right? Wait, looking at Pz's matrix:

Pz matrix has first row [ħ, 0, 0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-ħ]. So the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. That implies that the basis vectors are |+z⟩, |0⟩, |-z⟩, where each corresponds to eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the state is written as a combination of these basis vectors. The components of the state vector are the coefficients in front of each basis vector.

So, let me note the state as:

|ψ⟩ = (-1/2)|+z⟩ + (1/√2)|0⟩ + (-1/2)|-z⟩.

Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of squares should be 1 for normalization. Let me check:

(-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. Yes, it's normalized. Good.

So, since the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is just the sum of each component multiplied by their eigenvalue. Because in this basis, Pz is diagonal. So:

⟨Pz⟩ = (-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ).

Let me compute that. The first term is (-1/2)ħ, the second is 0, the third is (-1/2)*(-ħ) = (1/2)ħ. Adding them together: (-1/2 +1/2) ħ = 0. So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the average of Pz is zero. Now, what about ⟨Pz²⟩?

Since Pz is diagonal in this basis, Pz squared is the same as the square of each eigenvalue in the diagonal. So:

⟨Pz²⟩ = (-1/2)^2 * ħ² + (1/√2)^2 * 0^2 + (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ)^2.

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/4) ħ². Second term: (1/2)(0) is 0. Third term: (1/4) ħ² again. So adding them: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨Pz²⟩ = (1/2) ħ².

Wait, no. Because in the third term, (-ħ)^2 is ħ², and the coefficient squared is ( (-1/2) )^2 = 1/4. So yes, 1/4 ħ² each for first and third terms.

So ⟨Pz²⟩ is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 times ħ squared. So ½ ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt( ⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩² ). We already have ⟨Pz⟩ as 0, so:

ΔPz = sqrt( (½ ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(½ ħ²) = (ħ) * sqrt(½) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me think again. What's the formula? Oh right, it's the square root of ( ⟨Pz^2⟩ - (⟨Pz⟩)^2 ). Since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, it's just sqrt(⟨Pz^2⟩).

So, sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2). So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.

Wait a second, but let me double-check. The state is given as a vector, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the components. Let me write the state again: the vector is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So each component corresponds to |+z⟩, |0⟩, |-z⟩ respectively. So when calculating the expectation value, each component is multiplied by the eigenvalue of their respective basis vector.

So:

⟨Pz⟩ = ( -1/2 ) * ħ + (1/√2)*0 + ( -1/2 ) * ( -ħ )

Which is (-½ ħ) + (½ ħ) = 0. Correct.

⟨Pz²⟩ = (1/4) ħ² + (1/2) * 0 + (1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So sqrt(1/2 ħ²) is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait a moment, but the question is about the uncertainty in Pz. So the answer is option B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state given by the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix},
\]

and the basis vectors are the eigenstates of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the basis vectors $|+z\rangle$, $|0\rangle$, and $|-z\rangle$, respectively.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
Since $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{1}{2}\hbar + 0 + \frac{1}{2}\hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, so:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\hbar^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2(0)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2(-\hbar)^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
