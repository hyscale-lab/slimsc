Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B and water to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to figure out what reagents A and B are from the options given. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure out. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think. Butane has four carbons. The nitrile group is on carbon 1, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the position matters. Actually, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but that's actually pentanenitrile. Wait, no, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, which is four carbons in a row, with the nitrile group at the end. So it's CH2CH2CH2CN. So, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be: the nitrile is at the end (C1), then a carbon (C2) which has a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a methyl group (-CH3). So it's (CH(CH3)(OH))CH2CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2OH)(CH3)-CN? Wait, maybe it's (CH3)(OH)C-CH2CN. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait. Let me think again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the longest chain is four carbons, with the nitrile on C1, right? So structure is:

C1: CN
C2: CH(OH)(CH3)
C3: CH2
C4: CH3?

Wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons total. Oh wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, meaning the hydroxyl and methyl are on the same carbon as the nitrile? Wait, no. Wait, nitrile is on C1. Then C2 has the hydroxyl and methyl. So it's CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure a bit wrong, but the key point is that butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A gives a nitrile with a hydroxyl group and methyl on the same carbon as the nitrile.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, what's happening? I think this is a nucleophilic substitution or addition reaction. But butan-2-one is a ketone, so maybe it's a ketone reacting with a cyanide nucleophile.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. In the presence of an acid, perhaps. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl.

Wait, but wait. Normally, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, under certain conditions, the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to a cyanohydrin formation. A cyanohydrin is a compound that has both an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon, which was the carbonyl carbon in the ketone.

So, the reaction of a ketone with CN- in acidic conditions would give a cyanohydrin. So for butan-2-one, (CH3)2CO, adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. The nitrile is on the first carbon, the adjacent carbon (second) has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So the structure is CH(CH3)(OH)CH2CN. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. No, that would make it 3-hydroxy-3-methyl.... Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on the butane chain, which is four carbons. So the nitrile is on C1, the next carbon is C2, which has OH and CH3 groups. So structure is CH2CN-C(CH3)(OH)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, but butanenitrile is four carbons in total. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating that.

So the key point is, the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Therefore, the reagent A must be providing the acidic conditions. Because the formation of cyanohydrin typically occurs under acidic conditions. Because the ketone's carbonyl is protonated, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks. So the reagent A is an acid.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A and B, etc. The possible reagents are H3O+ (which is a strong acid), NaHSO3 (which is a source of H+ and sulfite), and HCl or CH3COOH as B.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A gives the cyanohydrin. So A must be an acid, perhaps H3O+ or H2SO4 or something similar. So looking at the options, option A and B have H3O+ as A. Options C and D have NaHSO3 as A.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2- ions. Could it act as an acid in this reaction? Or perhaps it's used as a source of SO3^2-? Hmm, not sure. But the cyanohydrin formation usually requires an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or HCl, or perhaps H3O+.

So, the first part of the reaction suggests that A is an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which reacts with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Looking at the product, it's a butanoic acid with substituents. Let me think: the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid group.

So the nitrile becomes a COOH group. Therefore, this is a nitrile hydrolysis reaction. The reaction conditions for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically involve strong acidic or basic conditions, often with heat.

In acidic conditions, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. This usually involves using a strong acid like HCl, H2SO4, or sometimes using a mixture with H2O and heat.

Alternatively, using a weaker acid might not be sufficient. So for the second reaction, reagent B plus water would be the conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, reagent B is likely a strong acid, perhaps HCl.

Looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl, CH3COOH, HCl again, or CH3COOH. So in the options, option A has B as HCl, option B has B as CH3COOH, option C has B as HCl, and D has B as CH3COOH.

So, for the second reaction, we need reagent B to be a strong acid like HCl to facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid.

Putting it all together: the first reaction requires an acid (H3O+ or another strong acid) as reagent A. The second requires a strong acid (HCl) as reagent B.

Looking at the options, option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. That fits both conditions.

Option C has A= NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid (HSO3- is a weaker acid than H3O+). Would that work for the first reaction? I'm not sure. I think the first reaction (cyanohydrin formation) typically uses a strong acid as catalyst. So H3O+ would be better than NaHSO3, which is a weaker acid.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since it dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^-). HSO3^- can act as an acid, but it's a weaker acid than H3O+. H3O+ is a stronger acid, so it's more likely to protonate the carbonyl.

So if the first reaction uses NaHSO3, would that be sufficient? I'm not sure. I think that NaHSO3 is a milder acid, but perhaps it's enough if the reaction is done under certain conditions. But I'm more confident that the first reaction would require a stronger acid like H3O+.

Looking at the options, only options A and C have A as H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, no. Let me recheck the options.

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, if the first reaction requires A to be an acid, and the second requires B to be HCl, then option A would be correct.

But wait, what about the second reaction? Could the nitrile hydrolysis be done with a weaker acid, like CH3COOH (which is a weaker acid than HCl)? Probably not, because nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic conditions. So B should be HCl, which is option A or C.

So in the options, only options A and C have B as HCl.

Now, for the first reaction, options A and C have A as H3O+ and NaHSO3, respectively.

So if the first reaction requires a strong acid, option A is correct. So, the correct reagents would be A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think about the first reaction again. The product is a cyanohydrin. So, in the presence of an acid, the ketone is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, which allows the CN- to attack. So H3O+ would be a suitable acid for this. Alternatively, HCl could also be used, but in the options, H3O+ is an acidic solution.

So, putting it all together, the correct reagents are A=H3O+ (from option A) and B=HCl (also from option A).

Looking at the options, option A says A=H3O+, B=HCl. That seems correct.

But wait, another thought: the second reaction is the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Another possibility is that the reaction uses H2O and an acid catalyst. So, if the reagent B is HCl, it's providing the acidic environment for the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, sometimes in such hydrolysis, especially in the presence of heat, you might use H2SO4 as a catalyst. But in the options, the only strong acid is HCl and H3O+.

So, in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it's less likely to be the right reagent for the hydrolysis. So B should be HCl, which is in options A and C.

So, if A is NaHSO3 in option C, but the first reaction requires a strong acid, then option C would be incorrect for the first reaction.

Thus, the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN, while the second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

### Reaction 1: Formation of Cyanohydrin
Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acidic environment is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (option A) and NaHSO₃ (option C) are potential candidates for reagent A. H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and is typically used for such reactions, making it the more suitable choice compared to NaHSO₃, which is a weaker acid.

### Reaction 2: Hydrolysis of Nitrile to Carboxylic Acid
The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This requires a strong acid to facilitate the conversion of the nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Among the options, HCl (a strong acid) is the most appropriate reagent for this reaction, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions for the hydrolysis. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), being a weak acid, is less effective for this transformation.

### Conclusion
For the first reaction, H₃O⁺ is the suitable reagent (A), and for the second reaction, HCl is the suitable reagent (B). This matches the conditions described in **option A**.
