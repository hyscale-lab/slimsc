--- Reasoning Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step. The question is about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like particles that exist for a very short time before they decay. 

The problem gives me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The question is asking for the mean decay distance, and there are four options provided. 

Wait, mean decay distance. I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ. So the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ, or τ = ħ / Γ. 

But wait, I should double-check that. Γ is the decay width, which is the total width of the particle's energy distribution. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is Γ, so the uncertainty in time (Δt), which is the mean lifetime τ, is ħ/(Γ). So yes, τ = ħ / Γ. 

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the decay distance. Decay distance depends on the velocity of the particle and the lifetime. The formula for mean decay length is L = v * τ. But wait, v is the velocity of the particle, which we can get from its energy and mass. 

The particle is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV. But wait, its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So it's moving relativistically. To find the velocity, I should probably use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. 

The total energy E = γ m c². The momentum p = γ m v. But maybe it's easier to use E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Since E is given, and m is given, I can find p. 

Let me write that down. E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. Let's compute p. 

E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So,

(pc)^2 = E² - (mc²)^2.

But wait, all the units here are in GeV and GeV/c². Let me make sure to handle the units correctly. Let's think about c in natural units where c=1. Because in particle physics, units are often expressed in terms where c=1. So then energy and mass have units of GeV and GeV/c² respectively. Hmm, but actually, when using the formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², both terms need to be in consistent units. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can recast the equation in terms of GeV and the appropriate factors of c. It's getting a bit confusing, but perhaps I can compute the ratio of E and m, and then find the velocity. 

Wait, another approach: beta (β) is v/c. For relativistic particles, β can be approximated as sqrt(1 - (m²c^4)/(E²)). Because E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, so (pc)^2 = E² - m² c^4. Then, p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4)/c². Hmm, but perhaps I should compute β as (pc²)/(E c). Let me think.

Alternatively, I can compute β as (p c) / E. Because, E = γ m c² and p = γ m v. So, (p c) = γ m v c = γ m c² (v/c) ) = E * β. So, β = (p c) / E.

But wait, from E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, I can write (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2. So,

(pc) = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) 

But since E is given in GeV and m in GeV/c², perhaps it's easier to compute (E in GeV) and (m c^2 in GeV), and then plug into the equation.

Wait, let's compute E and m in the same units. Let's have E in GeV, m in GeV/c², and c is approximately 3e8 m/s. But perhaps using natural units where c is 1 would be easier, but I'm not sure. Let me try to write the equation in terms of energy.

E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So,

(pc)^2 = (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV)^2 = (64 - 1.44) GeV² = 62.56 GeV².

So, pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So, p = (7.91 GeV) / (c^2) [since (pc) is GeV, p is GeV/(c^2 * c) )? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with units. Let me think in terms of units:

E is in GeV, which is energy.

m c² is 1.2 GeV, also energy.

So, (pc) must be in GeV because (pc)² is GeV².

So, pc is sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈7.91 GeV.

Therefore, p = (7.91 GeV) / (c).

Then, the velocity β is (p c)/E.

p c =7.91 GeV, so β = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875.

So β ≈ 0.98875, which is about 0.989. So the velocity is approximately 0.989c.

Hmm, that's a high beta, so the particle is moving very close to the speed of light.

Now, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me get the units right. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Hmm.

So, Γ is the decay width. The units of Γ are GeV, because it's an energy. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Wait, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm, but I think in terms of GeV, it's about 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875.

So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

But wait, that's a very short time. Now, the decay distance L is v * τ. But v is β c.

So, L = β c τ.

Compute each part:

β is 0.98875, c is 3e8 m/s, τ is approximately 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3 * 2.056875e-16 m.

3 * 2.056875 ≈ 6.170625.

So 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.98875: 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ approx 6.109e-16 m.

Wait, but none of the options are around 6e-16 m. Let's look at the options.

Options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm. My calculation gives ~6e-16 m, but the closest option is A) 5.02e-16. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the numbers. Let me redo the calculations with exact values.

First, compute (E² - (m c²)^2):

E =8 GeV, m c²=1.2 GeV.

E² = 64 GeV²

(m c²)^2= 1.44 GeV²

So, (pc)^2 =64 -1.44 =62.56 GeV² → pc= sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV.

p = pc/(c) → p =7.91 GeV / c.

So, β = (p c) / E = 7.91 GeV /8 GeV = 7.91/8 = 0.98875. So that's correct.

Now, Γ =0.32 GeV.

τ = ħ/(Γ) → ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So τ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 6.582 / 0.32 = let me compute that more accurately.

0.32 * 20 =6.4, so 6.582 is 6.4 (from 20) plus 0.182. 0.182 /0.32=0.56875, so 20.56875.

So τ=20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

β c τ = 0.98875 *3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 *2.056875e-16 =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.98875: 6.170625e-16 *0.98875.

Compute 6.170625 *0.98875.

0.98875 is approximately 0.98875.

6.170625 * 0.98875.

Let me compute that:

6 *0.98875=5.9325

0.170625 *0.98875≈ approx 0.170625 *1=0.170625, but subtract 0.170625 *0.01125= approx 0.001915.

So 0.170625 -0.001915 ≈0.1687.

So 5.9325 +0.1687=6.0912 m? Wait, no, no, the units are 1e-16 m.

Wait, wait, I think I got confused. The product 6.170625 * 0.98875 is approximately:

6.170625 *0.98875.

Let me compute this precisely:

0.98875 = 98875/100000 = 79/80 approximately (79/80 is 0.9875, which is close). Alternatively, perhaps compute it as 6.170625 * (1 - 0.01125).

6.170625 *1 =6.170625

6.170625 *0.01125 = approx 0.06931640625.

So subtract: 6.170625 - 0.06931640625 =6.10130859375.

So approximately 6.1013e-16 m.

But the options are 5e-16 or 4e-15, etc.

Wait, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing β.

Wait, another approach: beta is (p c) / E.

Wait, pc is 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So beta =7.91 /8 = 0.98875. Correct.

But perhaps I should calculate gamma (γ) for the particle.

Gamma is E/(m c²) =8 GeV /1.2 GeV =6.666...

So gamma is 6.666..., which is 20/3.

So velocity v is beta c.

But let me see if I can compute the decay length another way.

The mean lifetime tau is ħ / Gamma.

But wait, is the formula tau = ħ/(Gamma) correct?

Wait, the decay width Gamma is the total width, which is related to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The natural line width is approximated by Gamma ≈ ħ/tau. So tau ≈ ħ/Gamma.

So that part seems correct.

So, tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= approximately 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, v = beta c =0.98875 *3e8 m/s =2.96625e8 m/s.

Decay length L = v tau.

v tau=2.96625e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s= (2.96625 *2.056875 )e-16 m.

Compute 2.96625 *2.056875.

2 *2.056875=4.11375, 0.96625 *2.056875 ≈ approx 2.000.

Wait, 0.96625 *2.056875 = ?

Well, 0.96625 *2=1.9325.

0.96625 *0.056875=0.05512 (approx).

So total is 1.9325+0.05512=1.9876.

So total 2.96625 *2.056875≈4.11375 +1.9876=6.10135.

So L≈6.10135e-16 m.

Hmm, but the options are A: 5.02e-16, D:4.06e-16.

Wait, why is my result not matching any options? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternative approach: perhaps the production energy is given, but the particle is produced at rest? No, that can't be, because production energy is higher than mass. So the particle is moving.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity in a different way. Maybe using gamma.

Gamma is 8 /1.2 =6.666... So gamma =6.666...=20/3.

Beta can be found via gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So,

gamma =20/3 → gamma^2 = (400)/(9) → gamma^2=44.444...

So,

gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2)

→ 1 - beta^2 =1/(gamma^2) → 1 - beta^2=9/400 → beta^2=1-9/400 =391/400 → beta=sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.

Which matches the previous value. So beta is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, the Planck constant ħ is 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. So,

tau=6.582e-25 /0.32 → 6.582/0.32=20.56875 → 20.56875e-25 → 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should recompute the decay length.

L= v * tau = (beta c) * (tau).

Which is 0.98875 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute each part:

3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s =3 *2.056875e-16 m=6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.98875:

6.170625e-16 *0.98875.

As before, that's approximately 6.101e-16 m.

Hmm, but the closest option is A)5.02e-16. So why is there such a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor because of the actual units of ħ.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s. So:

tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV ) → 6.582e-25 /0.32 s.

6.582 /0.32 =20.56875 → 20.56875e-25 s → which is 2.056875e-24 s.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the given energy is the total energy, which includes the rest mass. Wait, E =8 GeV is the total energy, which includes rest mass. So, yes, E^2= (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So I think that part was correct.

Wait, is there another approach where perhaps the mean path is calculated using the velocity and the lifetime, but perhaps using different units?

Alternatively, perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, and I should convert it to GeV correctly.

Wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate using more precise numbers. Maybe I approximated something too much.

Let me compute 6.582 /0.32 more accurately.

6.582 divided by 0.32:

0.32 *20 =6.4 → 6.582-6.4=0.182.

So, 0.182 /0.32=0.56875.

So, 20.56875.

So, tau=20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should compute the product (beta c) * tau with more precise values.

Beta c is approximately 0.98875 *3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, (2.96625e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = ?

Multiply the coefficients: 2.96625 * 2.056875 ≈ let me compute this accurately.

2.96625 *2 =5.9325.

2.96625 *0.056875.

Let me compute 2.96625 *0.05 =0.1483125.

2.96625 *0.006875= approx 0.02034375.

So total 0.1483125 +0.02034375=0.16865625.

So total is 5.9325 +0.16865625=6.10115625.

So, 6.10115625e-16 m.

Hmm, this is about 6.1e-16 m. The closest option is A) 5.02e-16, which is about 0.8 times smaller.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in beta. Let me re-calculate beta using more precise methods.

Beta = (p c)/E.

p c is sqrt(E^2 -m^2 c^4 ) /c.

Wait, no: E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So,

p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2 ) /c².

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Which is sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)).

1.2^2=1.44, 8^2=64.

So,

1 -1.44/64=1 -0.0225=0.9775.

So beta= sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the decay length formula is not v * tau, but something else.

Wait, another thought: the mean decay length is given by L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²) =8/(1.2)=6.666...

So, L= gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, let's compute that.

Gamma = 6.666..., beta=0.98875.

So,

gamma * beta = (20/3) *0.98875 ≈6.666 *0.98875= approx 6.591666...

So,

gamma*beta*c*tau=6.591666 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.591666: 6.591666 *6.170625e-16.

Wait, 6 *6.170625e-16 =3.702375e-15.

0.591666 *6.170625e-16 ≈ approx 3.650e-16.

So total is about 3.702375e-15 +3.650e-16 ≈4.067e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.067e-15 m, which is option B)4.0655e-15 m. Close enough.

Wait, but why did this approach give a different result? Because I think I used the formula L=gamma * beta *c *tau.

Wait, let's think about the formula. The mean lifetime is tau= ħ/(Gamma). The velocity is beta c. So the proper decay length is L= v tau =beta c tau.

But perhaps in some derivations, like considering the particle's lifetime in the lab frame, we use L= gamma beta c tau. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach by not considering gamma.

Wait, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Because, from the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the proper lifetime is tau_0 = tau / gamma. Or wait, no.

Wait, the lifetime measured in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the rest frame). So tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.

Wait, but in this case, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but I think the mean lifetime is the same as tau_rest. Because the decay width is a Lorentz invariant quantity. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of particle physics conventions.

In particle physics, the width Γ is related to the mean proper lifetime (the lifetime in the rest frame) by Γ = ħ / tau_0.

But when the particle is moving, the observed lifetime is longer by gamma, so tau_lab = gamma tau_0.

So, decay length L= v tau_lab= beta c gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ/(Gamma), so L= beta c gamma ( ħ /Gamma )

Now, substituting gamma= E/(m c²)=8 GeV /1.2 GeV=6.666...

So,

L= beta c (gamma) (ħ /Gamma )

Which is:

beta c (gamma) (ħ) /Gamma.

So, let's compute each part.

beta=0.98875.

gamma=6.666...

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So,

beta * gamma =0.98875 *6.666...≈6.591666.

Then,

beta gamma c =6.591666 *3e8 =1.9775e9 m/s.

Multiply by ħ: 1.9775e9 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s.

Wait, GeV is energy, which is kg m²/s². But the units would give m * GeV s /s → m GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should keep track of units.

But let me compute numerically:

1.9775e9 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s → (1.9775e9 *6.582e-25) GeV m.

So,

1.9775e9 *6.582e-25 = (1.9775 *6.582) * 1e9 *1e-25.

1.9775*6.582 ≈13.03.

1e9 *1e-25=1e-16.

So, 13.03 *1e-16 GeV m =1.303e-15 GeV m.

Now, divide by Gamma (0.32 GeV):

1.303e-15 GeV m / 0.32 GeV = (1.303/0.32 )e-15 m.

1.303 /0.32 ≈4.071875.

So, L≈4.071875e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15.

Hmm, so approximately 4.07e-15 m. So option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close.

So, the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but why did the initial approach give a different result?

Ah, I think I see the confusion. The decay width Γ is the same in all frames, but the mean lifetime experienced in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. Therefore, the decay length should be v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma * (ħ/Gamma).

So, the correct formula is L = beta c * gamma * (ħ/Gamma).

Which gives approximately 4.07e-15 m, matching option B.

Hmm, so earlier mistake was not considering that the lifetime observed in the lab is longer by gamma. So the decay length is longer than just v * tau_0.

Therefore, the mean decay distance is option B)4.0655e-15 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by calculating the mean lifetime \( \tau \) using the uncertainty principle. The decay width \( \Gamma \) is related to the mean lifetime by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

Next, we calculate the velocity \( \beta c \) of the particle. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2,
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) (total energy) and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (rest energy), we solve for \( pc \):

\[
(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \, \text{GeV}^2,
\]

\[
pc = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is then given by:

\[
\beta = \frac{pc}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875.
\]

Thus, \( \beta c \approx 0.98875 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = \beta c \cdot \tau.
\]

Substituting \( \beta c = 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (2.96625 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.1013 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

However, this result does not match the provided options. To resolve this, we consider the relativistic time dilation factor \( \gamma \), where:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The mean lifetime in the lab frame is then:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \) and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

The mean decay distance is now:

\[
L = \beta c \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}.
\]

Substituting \( \beta c = 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = (2.96625 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

This matches option **B**. The earlier discrepancy arose because the lab frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) was not properly accounted for, and the decay length must include the time dilation factor \( \gamma \).

**Answer: B**
