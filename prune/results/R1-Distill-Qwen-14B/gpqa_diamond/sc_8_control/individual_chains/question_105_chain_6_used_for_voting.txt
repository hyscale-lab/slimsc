Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slowly because I'm just starting to learn about stars and exoplanets.

The question says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Since only one hemisphere has spots, when the star rotates, the brightness we observe changes over time, which could mimic the effect of an exoplanet passing in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness.

The question is asking: what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots? So, if the star had a planet instead of spots, what size planet would cause the same change in light?

Hmm. So I'm trying to find Rpl (planet radius) divided by Rstar (host star radius) such that the dip in brightness is the same as caused by the spots.

First, I remember that the change in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF = (Rpl / Rstar)^2

Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. So if the planet's radius is 10% of the star's, the area is 1% (0.1^2), causing a 1% drop in brightness.

But wait, this question is about spots, not a planet. So how do the spots affect the brightness?

The star's brightness is being modulated by these spots as it rotates. Since the spots are cooler, when they face us, the total brightness decreases. The filling factor comes into play here. The filling factor, I think, is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Here, it's 20%, so 0.2.

But also, the spots are 1000 K cooler than the star. The star is at 6000 K. So each spot emits less light. The flux from a spot would be proportional to the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the original flux from the star is Fstar = σ * (6000)^4. Each spot has Fspot = σ * (5000)^4 (since 6000 -1000=5000 K). So the flux per unit area of the spot is Fspot = (5000/6000)^4 times Fstar.

But wait, the total flux from the star when spots are visible depends on the area covered by spots. The filling factor is 0.2, so 20% of the star's surface is spots. So the average flux when the spots are on the side facing us is:

F_avg = Fstar * (1 - filling_factor * (Fspot / Fstar))

Wait, no. The star's total flux without spots is Fstar. When part of it is covered by spots, the flux is:

F_total = Fstar * (1 - filling_factor) + Fspot * filling_factor.

Alternatively, since Fspot is less than Fstar, the total flux would be Fstar minus the difference between Fstar and Fspot times the filling factor. Let me think that through.

The flux from the star when some spots are present is:

F_total = Fstar * (1 - filling_factor) + Fspot * filling_factor.

So F_total = Fstar [1 - filling_factor (1 - (Fspot / Fstar)) ].

So the change in flux compared to Fstar is:

ΔF = Fstar - F_total = Fstar * filling_factor * (1 - (Fspot / Fstar)).

Wait, no. Wait, F_total = Fstar * (1 - f) + Fspot * f, where f is the filling factor. So ΔF = Fstar - F_total = Fstar * (1 - [1 - f + f*(Fspot/Fstar)]) = Fstar * f*(1 - (Fspot/Fstar)).

So the fractional change in flux is:

ΔF / Fstar = f * (1 - (Fspot / Fstar)).

Wait, but Fspot is the flux per unit area of the spot. So the ratio Fspot/Fstar would be (T_spot / T_star)^4.

So putting that together:

ΔF / Fstar = f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4 )

But wait, in the case of the star with spots, when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, the flux decreases by this amount. However, since the star is rotating, only part of the spots are visible. Wait, no, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away as the star spins. So the photometric variation would be due to the spots coming into and out of view, similar to a planet.

But wait, the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is similar.

So for the planet transit, the dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2. For the spots, the dip is the change in flux when the spots are on the visible side.

But wait, in the star's case, the maximum change occurs when the spots are fully visible. Since the spots are on a hemisphere, as the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. So the maximum change in flux would be the change when the entire hemisphere is visible. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (4π Rstar^2). But since the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the spots are either visible or not. But the problem says that the star is only covered in spots on one hemisphere, so when it's facing us, we see all the spots, and when it's rotated away, we don't. So the variation in brightness would be the difference between when the spots are facing us and when they're not.

Wait, but the star is a sphere; each hemisphere is 50% of the surface. If one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of the entire surface, then each hemisphere (so when we see that hemisphere, it's 20% of the entire surface, but since the hemisphere is 50% of the surface, the spots on that hemisphere would be 20% of the entire star, which is 40% of the hemisphere.

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. So the spots cover 20% of the entire surface. Since the star is a sphere, the surface area is 4πR². So the spots take up 0.2 * 4πR². When the star rotates, we see either the spotty hemisphere or the non-spotty one. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the entire surface is spots, which is 20% of 4πR². So the fraction of the area we see that is spots is 20% when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. But when the other hemisphere is facing, we see 0% spots.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's surface area is 4πR². If the spots cover 0.2 of that, then when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, how much of the visible area is spots? The hemisphere is 2πR². The spots are 0.2 *4πR², which is 0.8πR². So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots take up 0.8πR², but the visible area is 2πR². So the fraction of spots visible in that case is 0.8πR² / 2πR² = 0.4. So 40% of the visible hemisphere is spots. So when the star is at a position where the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is Fstar * (1 - 0.4*(1 - (Fspot / Fstar)) ), and when it's the other hemisphere, it's Fstar.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's approach it differently.

The total flux when the star is in the position where the spots are visible (the spotty hemisphere is facing us) is F_spotty = Fstar * (1 - f * (1 - (T_spot / T_star)^4)), where f is the filling factor for the spots on that hemisphere.

Wait, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star. So on the hemisphere we're viewing, the spots cover f_hemisphere = (20% of entire star) / (hemisphere area) = 0.2 / 0.5 = 0.4, or 40% of the visible hemisphere.

So f_hemisphere = 0.4.

So the fractional change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:

ΔF = Fstar * (1 - f_hemisphere * (Fspot / Fstar))

But Fspot is (T_spot / T_star)^4 times Fstar's flux per unit area. So Fspot = (5000/6000)^4 Fstar.

So (Fspot / Fstar) = (5/6)^4. Let me compute that. 5/6 is approx 0.8333. (0.8333)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^2 is 0.6944, squared again is about 0.4823.

So (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotty = Fstar * (1 - 0.4 * (1 - 0.4823)).

Wait, no. Let me re-express the flux when the hemisphere is spotty.

The flux when the hemisphere is spotty would be the flux from the non-spotty part of the hemisphere plus the flux from the spots.

So the non-spotty part is (1 - f_hemisphere) of the hemisphere, each point emitting Fstar. The spots cover f_hemisphere of the hemisphere, each point emitting Fspot.

So the total flux is:

F_spotty_hemisphere = (1 - f_hemisphere) * Fstar + f_hemisphere * Fspot.

But Fspot = (T_spot / T_star)^4 * Fstar.

So F_spotty_hemisphere = Fstar [ (1 - f_hemisphere) + f_hemisphere ( (T_spot / T_star)^4 ) ]

The total flux without any spots (when the other hemisphere is facing) is Fstar.

But wait, no. The entire star's flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing is F_spotty_hemisphere, and when the other hemisphere is facing, it's (the other hemisphere's flux), which would be the same as Fstar_hemisphere_non-spotty.

Wait, no. The star's total flux is the sum of all areas. When the spotty hemisphere is facing, we see all the flux from that hemisphere (both spotty and non-spotty), and when the other hemisphere is facing, we see the non-spotty part of that hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the observed flux variation.

The maximum flux is when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, but since the entire star has some spots on one hemisphere, the maximum flux is when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, and the minimum flux is when the spotty hemisphere is visible.

Wait, no. The star's entire surface is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing, the flux is lower than when the other hemisphere is facing.

Wait, but the star is a single body. When it's viewed from Earth, the hemisphere facing us is either the spotty one or the non-spotty one. So the maximum flux occurs when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotty hemisphere is facing.

So the difference between maximum and minimum flux would be:

ΔF = F_max - F_min = F_non-spotty_hemisphere - F_spotty_hemisphere.

But what is F_non-spotty_hemisphere? It's the flux from the non-spotty hemisphere. The non-spotty hemisphere has no spots, so all its surface emits at Fstar per unit area. So F_non-spotty_hemisphere = Fstar * (2π R²)/(4π R²) ) * Fstar = (1/2) Fstar * 4π R²? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the flux when each hemisphere is visible.

The flux when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible is F_non-spotty = Fstar * (1 - f_hemisphere * (1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4 )) ?

No, wait. Let me clarify:

- The entire star's surface has 20% spots. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, the other hemisphere is entirely spot-free.

So when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is emitting at Fstar. So the flux is F_non-spotty = Fstar * (π R²) / (4π R²) ) *4? Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire star's flux.

Wait, the total flux of the star when any part is visible is the sum of the flux from the visible hemisphere.

So when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_non-spotty_hemi = Fstar * (2π R²) / (4π R²) ) * Fstar? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the flux as a fraction of the total. The star's total flux is Fstar_total = Fstar * 4π R².

When a hemisphere is visible, the flux seen is F_visible = Fstar * 2π R².

But when that visible hemisphere has some spots, the flux is less.

Wait, but the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is Fstar * 2π R². When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is Fstar * (2π R²) * ( (1 - f_hemisphere) + f_hemisphere * (Fspot / Fstar) ) ).

Because f_hemisphere is the fraction of the hemisphere that's spots. So the spotty hemisphere contributes (1 - f_hemisphere) * Fstar per unit area, plus f_hemisphere * Fspot.

So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F_spotty_hemi = (1 - f_hemisphere) * Fstar + f_hemisphere * Fspot.

Which can be written as Fstar * [ (1 - f_hemisphere) + f_hemisphere * (T_spot / T_star)^4 ].

So the change in flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible compared to when the non-spotty hemisphere is visible is:

ΔF = F_non-spotty_hemi - F_spotty_hemi.

Which is:

ΔF = Fstar * 2π R² [ 1 - ( (1 - f_hemi) + f_hemi * (T_spot/T_star)^4 ) ].

Because F_non-spotty_hemi is Fstar * 2π R², and F_spotty_hemi is Fstar * 2π R² multiplied by that bracketed term.

So the fractional change is:

(ΔF) / Fstar_total = [ F_non-spotty_hemi - F_spotty_hemi ] / Fstar_total.

But Fstar_total is Fstar * 4π R². So substituting:

= [ Fstar * 2π R² - Fstar * 2π R² ( (1 - f_hemi) + f_hemi * (T_spot/T_star)^4 ) ) ] / (Fstar *4π R² )

Simplify numerator:

= Fstar * 2π R² [ 1 - ( (1 - f_hemi) + f_hemi * (T_spot/T_star)^4 ) ] 

= Fstar * 2π R² [ f_hemi (1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4 ) ]

Denominator is Fstar *4π R².

So overall:

(ΔF)/Fstar_total = [ 2π R² * f_hemi (1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4 ) ] / (4π R² )

Simplify:

= (2π /4π ) * ( f_hemi (1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4 ) )

= (1/2) * f_hemi (1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4 )

So the fractional brightness change is (1/2) * f_hemi * (1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4 )

Wait, but f_hemi is the fraction of the hemisphere that's spots. Since the entire star's filling factor is 20% (0.2), and the hemisphere has 50% of the surface area (2π R²), so the fraction of the hemisphere covered is 0.2 / (4π R²) * (4π R² / 2π R²) ) = 0.2 / 0.5 = 0.4. So f_hemi = 0.4.

Wait, let me compute that correctly. The filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. The entire star's surface area is 4π R². The hemisphere's area is 2π R².

So the fraction of the entire star covered by spots is 0.2, so the number of spots is 0.2 *4π R².

The fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots is (0.2 *4π R²) / (2π R² ) ) = 0.4. So f_hemi = 0.4.

So substituting the numbers:

f_hemi = 0.4.

T_spot = 5000 K.

T_star = 6000 K.

So (T_spot / T_star)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1 - (5/6)^4 ≈ 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So the fractional change is:

(1/2) * 0.4 * 0.5177 = 0.5 * 0.4 * 0.5177.

0.5 *0.4 is 0.2. 0.2 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.1035.

So the fractional change is about 0.1035, or 10.35% of the star's flux.

Wait, but wait. When the star is seen with the spotty hemisphere, the flux is lower than when the non-spotty is seen. So the maximum flux is when the non-spotty hemisphere is facing, and the minimum when the spotty is. So the amplitude is this ΔF.

Now, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet, the amplitude would be (Rpl/Rstar)^2. So we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ sqrt(0.1) ≈ 0.316. Hmm, but wait, 0.1035 is a bit more than 0.1, so the square root would be a bit more than 0.316. Let's compute it accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.1035).

Let me think: 0.32^2 = 0.1024. 0.32^2 is 0.1024, which is just under 0.1035. 0.32^2 = 0.1024 → 0.32 is about 0.1024.

0.324^2 = (0.32 +0.004)^2 = 0.32² + 2*(0.32)(0.004) + 0.004² = 0.1024 + 0.00256 + 0.000016 = 0.104976.

Which is higher than 0.1035. So the square root of 0.1035 is between 0.32 and 0.324.

Let me approximate.

We have:

x = 0.32 → x² = 0.1024

x = 0.322 → x² = (0.32 +0.002)^2 = 0.32² + 2*0.32*0.002 + 0.002² = 0.1024 + 0.00128 + 0.000004 = 0.103684.

Which is just over 0.1035.

So x is about 0.322.

So Rpl/Rstar ≈ 0.322, or about 0.32.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39 is higher than 0.322.

B) ~0.07 → way too small.

C) ~0.11 → 0.11^2 is 0.0121, which is much smaller than 0.1035.

D) ~0.32 → which is close to our calculation of 0.322.

So the answer should be option D, 0.32.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check my calculation of the fractional change.

Earlier, I had:

(ΔF)/Fstar_total = (1/2) * f_hemi * (1 - (T_spot/T_star)^4 )

Which with numbers:

(1/2)*0.4*(1 - (5/6)^4) = 0.5 *0.4 *0.5177 ≈ 0.1035.

So the fractional dip is 0.1035, which is approximately 10.35% of the star's flux.

Which would correspond to (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rpl/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322.

So the correct option is D, 0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and compare it to the transit depth caused by a planet.

### Key Parameters:
- **Filling factor** of the spots: \( f = 0.2 \) (20% of the star's surface is covered by spots).
- **Temperature of the star**: \( T_{\text{star}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
- **Temperature of the spots**: \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) (1000 K cooler than the star).
- **Fraction of the star's surface visible during transit**: For a planet, the transit depth is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 \).

### Step 1: Fractional Change in Brightness Due to Spots
The flux from a star is proportional to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:  
\[
F \propto T^4
\]
The flux from the star without spots is \( F_{\text{star}} \propto (6000)^4 \), and the flux from the spots is \( F_{\text{spot}} \propto (5000)^4 \). The ratio of the flux from the spots to the star is:  
\[
\frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{star}}} = \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{star}}}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \approx 0.4823
\]

The fractional change in brightness when the spotty hemisphere is visible is given by:  
\[
\Delta F = \frac{1}{2} \cdot f_{\text{hemi}} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_{\text{star}}}\right)
\]
Here, \( f_{\text{hemi}} \) is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, and the hemisphere represents half the star's surface, \( f_{\text{hemi}} = \frac{0.2}{0.5} = 0.4 \). Substituting the values:  
\[
\Delta F = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.4 \cdot \left(1 - 0.4823\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.4 \cdot 0.5177 \approx 0.1035
\]
Thus, the fractional change in brightness is approximately \( 0.1035 \) (or 10.35%).

### Step 2: Radius of the Exoplanet
For a planet transiting the star, the fractional change in brightness is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 \). Setting this equal to the fractional change caused by the spots:  
\[
\left(\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.1035
\]
Taking the square root:  
\[
\frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.322
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
Among the given options:
- **A) ~0.39**: Too large.
- **B) ~0.07**: Too small.
- **C) ~0.11**: Too small.
- **D) ~0.32**: Closest to the calculated value of \( 0.322 \).

Thus, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \).

**Answer: D**
