Okay, so I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the given theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about Lagrangians and renormalizability.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the commutators of the gamma matrices. But wait, for the purpose of finding the mass dimension, maybe I don't need to get too deep into the structure of σ_{μν}.

I think the first step is to determine the mass dimensions of each field and coupling in the Lagrangian. Because in four dimensions, the mass dimension of the action (and hence the Lagrangian density) must be four, since the action is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension four.

Wait, so the Lagrangian density has dimension [L] = 4. Each term in the Lagrangian must also have dimension four because the integral over spacetime (which has dimension 4) must be dimensionless when multiplied by the Lagrangian.

So let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of each field:

- Fermion fields ψ have mass dimension 3/2 each because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation requires ψ to have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is also 3/2 because it's the adjoint.

- The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from electromagnetism or Yang-Mills theory. For electromagnetism, F is antisymmetric and has components like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each F has dimension [mass]^1. Wait, because Aμ has dimension 1 (since the covariant derivative is ∂μ - i e Aμ, and ∂ has dimension 1, so A must have dimension 1).

- Now, F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative brings a mass dimension of 1, and A has dimension 1. So F has dimension 2, right? Because ∂ (dim 1) acts on A (dim 1), so each term is 1+1=2.

Wait, let me confirm that. In four dimensions, yes. The gauge field A has dimension 1. So F^{μν} = ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ has each term as [∂][A] = 1 +1=2. So F has dimension 2.

So putting it together: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ multiplied by F.

Let me compute each part's dimensions:

ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ: Since σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (they are matrices, not fields), the product ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) + 0 = 3. Because each ψ is 3/2, and σ is dimensionless.

Then F^{μν} is dimension 2.

So the entire term is κ multiplied by (3) * (2) = 6. Wait, no. Wait, the term is product of ψ̄ σ ψ and F.

Wait, no, let me think again. The term is κ * (ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ) * F^{μν}.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2, and σ is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension [3/2 + 3/2] = 3.

Multiply by F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ F) has dimension 3+2 =5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. So the entire term κ times that product must have dimension 4. So [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, what about renormalizability? A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have positive mass dimensions. Wait, no, wait. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its mass dimension is less than or equal to 4 in four dimensions. Wait, no, that's about the term's dimension. Wait, to clarify: in four dimensions, the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. Each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 as well because otherwise, integrating over four dimensions would give a term with the wrong dimension.

But for the theory to be renormalizable, each coupling constant must have a mass dimension ≤ 4? Or perhaps each coupling's dimension must be ≥ 0? Hmm, I think I get a bit confused here.

Wait, renormalizability depends on the superficial degree of divergence, which in turn depends on the interactions. But I also remember that for a term in the Lagrangian, the dimension of the coupling (i.e., the coefficient) must be ≥ 0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because, in general, a coupling with negative mass dimension would imply that the interaction is nonrenormalizable, as higher-order terms (loop corrections) would require higher powers of the coupling, leading to divergences that can't be canceled.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The superficial degree of divergence D for a Feynman diagram is given by D = 4 - (L × [κ]_M), where L is the number of loops. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Alternatively, the superficial degree of divergence formula is D = 4 - N_coupling × [coupling's dimension]. Wait, no, I think it's D = d - (n_vertices) × (coupling's dimension). Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, the general rule is that a term is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling (the coefficient) is greater than or equal to zero. Because couplings with negative mass dimension would require the interaction to be more relevant, but in the opposite way. Or wait, actually, in four dimensions, a coupling with positive mass dimension would mean that the term is of higher dimension, making the interaction 'weaker' at higher energies, but perhaps I'm getting this inverse.

Wait, the statement is that a term is renormalizable if the dimension of the coupling is ≥ 0. Because, in four dimensions, if the coupling has dimension [κ] = d, then the term has dimension 4 = (fields) + d. So for a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have d ≥ 0. Because if d is negative, the term would have dimension (fields) + d. Since fields have positive dimensions, but if the coupling is negative, the term's dimension could be lower than 4, which makes it nonrenormalizable.

Wait, but in our case, κ has [κ]_M = -1, which is negative. So the term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4 because [κ] +5 = 4 → so that's correct. But for renormalizability, the coupling's dimension must be ≥ 0. Since our coupling is -1, which is <0, so the term is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The term in the Lagrangian is L = κ (something) that has dimension 4. So each term must have dimension 4. So when you have a term like κ ψ̄ ... ψ F, the product of the fields has dimension [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = (3) + (2) =5. So the Lagrangian term is κ * [5], which must equal 4. So [κ]=-1.

So the coupling κ has mass dimension -1. Now, for the theory to be renormalizable, the coupling's dimension must be ≥ 0. Because if the coupling has a negative dimension, each time you have a vertex with this coupling, it contributes a negative power of the energy, leading to divergent terms that can't be canceled by counterterms of the same type. So a negative dimension coupling implies the theory is nonrenormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ] is -1, making the theory nonrenormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable → No, because theory isn't ren.

Option B: [κ]=1, ren → No, because [κ] isn't 1.

Option C: [κ]=-1, theory not ren → Yes.

Option D: [κ]=1, not ren → No.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
In four spacetime dimensions:
- The fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$, as it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$ (which has $[A_\mu] = 1$) and its derivatives.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi] = [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 = 3.
\]
The term $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$. Thus, the product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$ in four spacetime dimensions. Therefore, the coupling $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = 4 \implies [\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the mass dimension of the coupling constant satisfies $[\kappa] \geq 0$. In this case, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the theory is **not renormalizable**, as couplings with negative mass dimension lead to divergences that cannot be canceled by counterterms of the same type.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]$ is not $1$.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa] = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as $[\kappa] = -1$ and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa] = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]$ is not $1$.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
