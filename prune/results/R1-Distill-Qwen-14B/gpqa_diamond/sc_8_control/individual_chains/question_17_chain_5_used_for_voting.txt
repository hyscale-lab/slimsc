Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking. Okay, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration is 0.02 M for the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means other factors like hydrolysis aren't a big deal here. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (Kf) tells us about the stability of the complex. The Kf is given, which is a very large number, indicating a very stable complex. So, the complex doesn't dissociate much.

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Since the complex is stable, I expect the free Ca²+ concentration to be really low. 

I think the approach here is to use the formation constant expression. The formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: 

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2− 

The Kf is equal to [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). 

But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because the complex doesn't dissociate much, the concentrations of the ions Ca²+ and EDTA^4− will be very small.

Wait, actually, when the complex dissociates, it's:

CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4− 

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x (where x is the amount dissociated), and [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x. But since Kf is so large (5e10), x should be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate [CaEDTA^2−] ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into the Kf expression:

Kf ≈ (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x² 

We can rearrange this to solve for x. 

So, x² = 0.02 / Kf 

Wait, Kf is 5e10, so let me plug that in:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Calculating that, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. 

So x is the square root of 4e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-12 is 1e-6. So 2e-6? Wait, no, wait: 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13. Square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5? Wait, because 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Hmm, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, so sqrt(1e-12)=1e-6. So sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let's think: 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because 6.5 *2=13. So sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5=approximately 3.16e-7.

So, x = sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Wait, that seems really low. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. That would be the concentration of Ca²+.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. That matches. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I arrange the equation correctly?

Yes, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. So [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x. [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02. So 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2). So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5=6.32e-7.

So the correct answer should be C. That's one of the options. The options given are:

A) 2.0x10^-2 
B)5.0x10^-3 
C)6.3x10^-7 
D)1.0x10^-2 

So, yes, option C is correct.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since dissociation is minimal due to the large \( K_f \)), and the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) are equal, denoted as \( x \). The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]}{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
