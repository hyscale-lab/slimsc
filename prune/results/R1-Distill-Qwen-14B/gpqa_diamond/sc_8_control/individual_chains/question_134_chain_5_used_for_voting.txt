Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that we mix three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. We need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when they're mixed.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. So the reaction is acid + base → salt + water, and the enthalpy change is typically exothermic, hence negative.

But first, I think I should figure out how much acid and base we have in terms of moles. Because the neutralization depends on the mole ratio.

Let me list the acids and bases:

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too. But wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic. So each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. But I need to check if it's fully dissociated. Since it's a strong acid, I think it does donate both H+ in solution, but wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete, the second might be in two steps. Hmm, but for neutralization, especially with a strong base, I think maybe it's treated as fully dissociated. Or maybe considering that it's a diprotic acid, but in the presence of a strong base like Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, it'll react completely.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions because of the formula Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-. So each mole gives two moles of OH-.

Wait, but when you mix all these together, you're creating a solution where all the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. But I need to find out which one is in excess.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess, and find how much neutralization happens.

Let's compute the moles.

First, HCl:
Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but when H+ and OH- react, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ and OH- reacts in 1:1 ratio.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant here. All 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and H+ will have 0.08 moles left (0.28 -0.2 = 0.08).

But wait, because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids, the reaction should go to completion. So all the OH- is consumed, and some H+ remains.

Wait, but the neutralization is between acid and base. So the amount of H+ that actually neutralizes the OH- is 0.2 moles. So the total moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2, and the moles of OH- is 0.2.

The total moles of H+ available is 0.28, so 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles H+ left. But for the neutralization, the main reaction is 0.2 moles each of H+ and OH-.

But wait, the neutralization reaction between the acid and the base will produce water. So the heat released will depend on the moles of H+ and OH- that react. Because each mole of H+ and OH- that reacts releases a certain amount of energy.

I think the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) per mole of H+ is about -57 kJ/mol. Wait, but sometimes it's given as -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed. Let me think. Oh, right, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting, because each mole of H+ and OH- reacting forms one mole of H2O.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed, which is equivalent to per mole of H+ reacting. So if I have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, then the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11.42 kJ when rounded.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, no, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Ah, option D is -16.0 kJ, and option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, the units in the options are mixed: some are kcal, others kJ. Oh, right, that's a key point. The question says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, but the units in the options vary.

So, I need to consider whether the answer is in kJ or kcal.

Wait, but usually, enthalpy of neutralization is reported in kJ/mol. However, the options have both. Let me think about this.

Wait, the question says to calculate the enthalpy, so perhaps the answer is in kJ. But let me see. So, the calculation would be 0.2 moles reacting, each releasing 57 kJ (so 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's negative).

So that's 11.4 kJ exothermic, so ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ; option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but -11.4 kJ is not among the options. Wait, unless I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

Wait, HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M =0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M =0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ and OH- neutralize in 1:1 ratio. 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2.

Each mole releases about 57 kJ. So 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ.

But wait, the question is about enthalpy of neutralization when all three are mixed. So perhaps the total heat released is 11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11420 J, which is 11.42 kJ, but the option is in kcal. Oh, right, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ.

Wait, so 11.4 kJ is equal to 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726 kcal. But since it's exothermic, it's -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, that's conflicting. So which way is correct? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the calculation in terms of the total heat released, which would be in kJ, but the options have a mix. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reagent. The limiting reagent is OH- in this case, as I found earlier.

So the moles of H+ that react is 0.2 moles. Each mole releases 57 kJ, so 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy of neutralization is -11.4 kJ. But none of the options exactly match that. Wait, looking again:

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.42 kcal would be 11.42 * 4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me recalculate.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 L *0.2 mol/L= 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 *0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.2 *0.5=0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the OH- is 0.2 mol. So H+ and OH- react in 1:1. So 0.2 mol of H+ will react, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

So the moles of H+ that react is 0.2, which gives 0.2 *57 kJ=11.4 kJ, which is exothermic, so ΔH = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than 11.4, so that’s not. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same magnitude as 11.4 kJ, but in kcal.

Wait, but 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726 kcal. So that would be about -2.73 kcal, which matches option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, so wait, why the discrepancy? Because the question says "enthalpy of neutralization when ... are mixed."

Ah, maybe I'm supposed to find the total enthalpy change, but considering all the reactions.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the neutralization is the reaction between the acid and the base. But in this case, since three solutions are mixed, perhaps we have to consider all the reactions.

Wait, another approach: the total acid (H+ from HCl and H2SO4) and the total base (OH- from Ba(OH)2) react. The neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy per mole is about -57 kJ per mole.

So the amount of H+ that actually reacts is the minimum of (total H+, total OH-). So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the moles that react is 0.2.

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

So that's -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, none of them have -11.4 kJ. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is diprotic, so each H2SO4 gives two H+. But in solution, does the second H+ fully dissociate? Well, in strong acid, the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second may not be, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps it's assumed to be fully dissociated as well. So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is between the acid and the base, but the stoichiometry of the acid and base may differ, but in this case, the total H+ and OH- is correct.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction, but considering that H2SO4 contributes two H+. So maybe each mole of H2SO4 reacting with two moles of OH-.

Wait, but in this case, the neutralization is in terms of H+ and OH- combining.

Alternatively, perhaps the total moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4 are 0.28, and the OH- is 0.2. So the limiting reagent is OH-, and 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So, but none of the options have that. Oh wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Wait, H2SO4 is 0.3 M *0.3 L=0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

HCl is 0.2 M *0.5 L=0.1 mol H+.

Total H+ is 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the enthalpy per mole is not 57 kJ but something else. Wait, wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of H2O), but sometimes it's given as -57.3 kJ/mol. So 0.2 *57.3 is about 11.46 kJ, which is about 11.46 kJ; so -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So perhaps I'm missing another reaction here.

Wait, another thought: Could the H2SO4 contribute more H+? No, because each mole gives two H+, which I accounted for. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Wait, is Ba(OH)2 a diprotic base? Yes, it gives two OH- per formula unit. So the OH- calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but only the first H+ is strong, and the second is weak. Wait, but in the solution, for strong acids, both H+ would dissociate. Wait, no, actually, sulfuric acid is a strong acid for the first dissociation: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or is it H+ + HSO4^-?

Wait, no, wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first H+. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, that can't be right. Let me think. For sulfuric acid, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-? No, wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the first step is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or perhaps only the first H+ is fully dissociated.

No, wait. Wait, actually, the first dissociation of H2SO4 is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- in aq. Because sulfuric acid is a strong acid, especially in the first dissociation. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me look it up in my mind. Actually, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or is it H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-? Because HSO4^- is a weaker acid (pKa around 1.99), so the second dissociation is not complete.

Wait, so in the solution, H2SO4 will dissociate completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-? Or only one H+?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: when H2SO4 is a strong acid, does it fully dissociate both H+?

Wait, no. The first H+ is fully dissociated, but the second H+ comes from HSO4^- which is a weak acid. So H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is correct? No, I think that's incorrect. Because HSO4^- is a weak acid, so the second H+ doesn't fully dissociate.

Wait, but if the solution is in water, then H2SO4 is a strong acid, and the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-?

No, wait, I think that H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second H+ comes from HSO4^- which is a weaker acid. So in solution, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is not correct. It's H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (first step, complete), and then HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- (second step, which is not complete, with a pKa around 1.99).

So for the second H+, it doesn't fully dissociate. So in a 0.3 M H2SO4 solution, the [H+] would be approximately 0.3 M from the first dissociation, and some more from the second, but not all.

Wait, but wait, the question is about enthalpy of neutralization, which is the heat released when acid and base neutralize. So if the acid is H2SO4 and it's a strong acid, perhaps in solution it's considered to fully dissociate both H+.

But in reality, the second H+ is not fully released. So when H2SO4 is in solution, the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second is only partially.

But wait, the problem gives H2SO4 as 0.3 M. So the first H+ would contribute 0.3 M, and the second would contribute less. So the total H+ concentration would be more than 0.3 M but perhaps close to 0.3 M, depending on the strength of the second dissociation.

Wait, but for the sake of this problem, perhaps it's assumed that H2SO4 fully dissociates both H+ ions. Because the problem says H2SO4 is 0.3 M, and if it's a strong acid, perhaps all H+ are available.

Wait, but in reality, sulfuric acid is a strong acid for the first H+ but not the second. So when H2SO4 is in solution, the first H+ is fully released, giving one mole of H+ per mole of H2SO4. The second H+ is only partially released, but perhaps in this problem, we are told to consider it as a strong acid, so both H+ are available. Or maybe the solution expects us to consider each H2SO4 as providing two H+.

Hmm, I think the problem is expecting us to treat H2SO4 as a fully dissociated diprotic acid. So each mole gives two H+.

So the earlier calculation stands: 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

So, perhaps the initial approach is correct. So the moles of H+ reacting is 0.2, leading to ΔH of -11.4 kJ.

But looking back at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is in the same magnitude but in different units. So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726 kcal, so -2.72 kcal would be option A.

Wait, so perhaps I confused kcal and kJ in the units.

Wait, let's compute 11.4 kJ into kcal.

1 kJ = 0.239 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which matches option A.

But wait, why is the answer option A and not the other options?

Because the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So the correct calculation is 0.2 moles reacting → 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → which is about 2.72 kcal. So the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy per mole is 57 kcal/mol.

Wait, 57 kJ is about 13.5 kcal. Because 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ ≈ 57 *0.239 ≈ 13.563 kcal.

So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 *13.563 = 2.7126 kcal, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So that matches option A.

But wait, why would the enthalpy per mole be 57 kcal? Because I thought it's 57 kJ per mole. Oh, wait, perhaps in some contexts, it's given in kcal. Because sometimes, in nutrition, they use kcal (kilocalories), which is the same as Cal with a capital C.

So, if the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57.3 kcal/mol, then 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kcal, so -11.46 kcal, which is close to option B.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier calculation. So which is correct?

I think I'm getting confused because the value of enthalpy can be expressed in different units. So I need to clarify.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ/mol. So 57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of H2O formed).

But in some textbooks, especially older ones, it's sometimes given in kcal. 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is about 13.68 kcal.

So 57.3 kJ → 57.3 /4.184 ≈ 13.68 kcal.

So each mole of H+ that reacts releases 13.68 kcal.

Wait, but that would mean 0.2 moles would release 0.2 *13.68 = 2.736 kcal. So about -2.74 kcal, which matches option A.

So the conclusion is that the correct answer is option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but why is option B there? Because 11.42 kcal would be 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ, which is about 47.7 kJ. So that's way larger than our calculated 11.4 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different enthalpy value. Maybe it's using -57 kJ per mole of H2SO4?

Wait, no, because the problem involves HCl and H2SO4, so the H+ from each contributes.

Wait, maybe the mistake is that I considered all the H+ from H2SO4, but perhaps the second H+ isn't fully dissociated.

Wait, let's think again. If H2SO4 is 0.3 M. The first H+ is fully dissociated, giving 0.3 M H+. The second H+ is from HSO4^- and has a pKa of around 1.99. So in a 0.3 M solution, the degree of dissociation of HSO4^- can be calculated.

The HSO4^- dissociates as HSO4^- ⇌ H+ + SO4^2-.

The Ka for this is 1.2 × 10^-2 (pKa ≈ 1.92).

So for a 0.3 M solution of HSO4^-:

Ka = [H+][SO4^2-]/[HSO4^-] = 0.012.

Assuming x is the concentration of H+ from the second dissociation.

So, [H+] = 0.3 + x ≈ 0.3 (since x is small compared to 0.3).

Wait, no, wait. The first H+ is already 0.3 M. The second H+ from HSO4^- would add to that. But let me proceed.

Let me set up the equation:

Ka = x^2 / (0.3 -x) ≈ 0.012.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.3, so 0.3 -x ≈ 0.3.

So x^2 ≈ 0.012 * 0.3 = 0.0036 → x ≈ sqrt(0.0036) = 0.06.

So the second H+ contributes about 0.06 M.

So total [H+] from H2SO4 is 0.3 + 0.06 = 0.36 M.

Wait, but wait, that's for a 0.3 M H2SO4 solution. So in 0.3 L, the moles of H+ would be 0.36 M * 0.3 L = 0.108 moles.

Hmm, that's a different scenario. So in this case, the H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.108 moles, and the HCl is 0.1 moles H+.

So total H+ is 0.208 moles.

And Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles OH-.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent, 0.2 moles.

So the H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, which comes from 0.2 moles of H+.

So the enthalpy released is 0.2 moles *57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ.

But wait, considering only the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second is only partially, maybe the moles are different.

Wait, but this complicates things, and the problem may expect us to treat H2SO4 as a fully dissociated diprotic acid, giving 2 H+ per mole.

So in that case, the initial calculation holds, and the answer is 0.2 moles reacting → 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal, so option A.

Alternatively, if the problem expects the answer in kJ, then 11.4 kJ would be the answer, but that's not any of the options. The options have D as -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation. Let me recheck.

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 M =0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M =0.09 mol H2SO4. If each gives 2 H+, then 0.18 mol H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M =0.1 mol → 0.2 mol OH-. Correct.

So H+ total:0.28. OH-:0.2. So 0.2 reacts.

So if the enthalpy per mole is 57 kJ, the total is 11.4 kJ. In kcal, that's 11.4 /4.184≈2.726 kcal. So -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 as -57 kJ. But that doesn't make sense because the neutralization is per mole of H+.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid separately, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base with two OH- per formula unit, so the neutralization would involve 2 moles of H+ per mole of Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but that's the same as the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess, but perhaps I should think in terms of equivalents.

The equivalent for HCl is 1 (since it donates one H+ per formula unit).

The equivalent for H2SO4 is 2 (since it donates two H+ per formula unit).

The equivalent for Ba(OH)2 is 2 (since it provides two OH- per formula unit).

So the equivalents of H+:

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 M *1 =0.1 eq.

H2SO4:0.3 L *0.3 M *2 =0.18 eq.

Total H+ equivalents:0.28 eq.

Equivalents of OH-: Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M *2=0.2 eq.

So again, OH- is the limiting reagent with 0.2 eq.

So the neutralization is 0.2 eq, which is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

So the same result as before.

Therefore, the enthalpy change is 0.2 *57 kJ =11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options have that, except option D is -16.0 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to include the enthalpy of all the reactions, not just the H+ and OH- neutralization.

Wait, another possibility: when mixing these solutions, perhaps the dissolution of the salts formed also contributes to the enthalpy.

Wait, when HCl and H2SO4 neutralize Ba(OH)2, what are the products?

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But considering the stoichiometry.

Wait, but since we have excess H+, some of the H+ may not be neutralized.

Wait, perhaps the neutralization is as follows:

H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) + OH- (from Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

So the moles of H+ that react is 0.2, as before.

But perhaps the enthalpy of solution of BaCl2 and BaSO4 also contributes.

Wait, this complicates things beyond the initial problem. Because the problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization, which typically refers to the reaction of acid and base to form water and the corresponding salt.

But perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the formation of the specific salts, which have their own enthalpies.

But that's getting more complicated, and I think the question expects a simpler approach.

So I think the correct approach is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH-, find the limiting reagent, and multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 *57 kJ → 11.4 kJ.

In kcal, that's approximately 2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer is option A: -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   - Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.2 M  
   - Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ = 0.1 mol.

2. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   - Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity = 0.3 M  
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Total moles of H⁺**:  
   - Total H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   - Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L, Molarity = 0.5 M  
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

5. **Determine the limiting reagent**:  
   - The reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), which occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   - Total H⁺ available = 0.28 mol, and total OH⁻ available = 0.2 mol.  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it will be completely consumed, leaving \( 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ unreacted.

6. **Calculate the enthalpy change**:  
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ or OH⁻ reacting.  
   - Moles of H⁺ reacting = 0.2 mol, so the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

7. **Convert to kcal if necessary**:  
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so:  
     \[
     -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

8. **Match with the options**:  
   - The calculated enthalpy change is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **option A**.
