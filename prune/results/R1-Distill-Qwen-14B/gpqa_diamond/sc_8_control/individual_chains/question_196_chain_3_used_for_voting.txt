Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is like a mass on a spring, right? But wait, this is relativistic, so we have to consider special relativity effects. Oh right, because at high speeds, Newtonian mechanics don't apply anymore.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. The options are given with various formulas involving c, the speed of light. So I need to figure out how relativistic effects change the maximum speed compared to the classical case.

In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so option C might not be the right answer.

Relativity comes into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The key here is the total energy. In relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times m c squared, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved. At the maximum displacement (amplitude A), the oscillator has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativistic terms, when the mass is at A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. But in relativity, kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². But wait, when the mass is at rest, v=0, so gamma is 1, so kinetic energy is zero, which matches.

Wait, but when the mass is at the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and all the energy is kinetic. So at that point, the kinetic energy is E = (1/2)kA². So in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So setting (gamma -1) mc² equal to (1/2)kA².

So the equation would be:

(gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

Solving for gamma: gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, maybe beta, but let's just call it term for now.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + term.

Taking reciprocal on both sides: sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + term).

Square both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + term)^2.

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2.

So v = c * sqrt[1 - 1/(1 + term)^2 ].

But term is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute that back.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt[ 1 - 1/( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ].

Hmm, looking at the options, option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ), which matches what I derived.

Wait, but let's check the other options. Option B is v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) )). That doesn't look right. Option A has a similar structure but with a different denominator.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-derive.

Wait, in the Newtonian case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But in relativity, the potential energy is the same, but the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So total energy is (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)k x². At maximum displacement A, it's (1/2)k A². So in the classical case, that's all the energy, because KE is zero there. But in the relativistic case, the energy is the sum of rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Oh wait, no, wait. The total mechanical energy is conserved, so at maximum displacement, the oscillator's energy is (1/2)k A², which is equal to gamma m c², because E = gamma m c² is the total energy. Wait, no, that's not right. Because at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, but the total energy is the rest mass energy plus the potential energy. Wait, but in relativity, the rest mass energy is mc², but the potential energy is (1/2)k A². So the total energy E is mc² + (1/2)k A². But when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is (gamma m c²) = E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me model it that way.

So, total energy E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At x=0 (maximum speed), E = gamma m c².

So, gamma m c² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which brings me back to the same equation as before. So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which gives the same expression for v.

So v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))² ] )

Looking back at the options, that's option D.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Wait, no, the denominator in the fraction is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ), right? Because (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) is the term we're adding to 1.

Option D is written as:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I derived.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe considering energy in terms of relativistic momentum and kinetic energy.

In terms of velocity, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So, the total energy E is:

E = (gamma) mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

So gamma = 1 + (1/2)k A²/(mc²).

Which again leads to the same equation.

I think I'm confident that option D is correct.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is conserved. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the oscillator has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic energy. The potential energy is given by \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the total energy \( E \) is the sum of the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the potential energy:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is expressed as:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in option D. The other options are incorrect because they either use incorrect denominators or fail to account for relativistic effects properly.
