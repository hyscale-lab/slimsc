Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. They represent Ay as a 2x2 matrix, and we're supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Then, based on that, determine which statement is correct among the options A to D.

Hmm. The given operator is Ay = c · S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum components are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Let me jot down what S looks like.

So S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait, that's familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i, or something like that? Because the Pauli matrices are usually written as σx, σy, σz. Let me think. The Pauli Y matrix is (i times) the standard Y matrix. Wait, actually, I think the standard Pauli Y matrix is:

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

Wait, that's exactly the S matrix given here. So S is σy. Oh wait, no. Wait, let me see. The standard Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So yeah, S is σy. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

Then, Ay is c multiplied by S. c is h/(4π). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Because the spin angular momentum S is (ħ/2) σ. So for the Y-component, Sy is (ħ/2) σy.

Wait, but in our case, Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π). Let me compute what c is in terms of ħ. Since ħ = h/(2π), so h = 2π ħ. Let's substitute:

c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= (2π)/(4π) ) * ħ = (1/2) ħ.

So c is ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * σy.

So Ay is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. Now, the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So when multiplied by a scalar, their eigenvalues are scaled by that.

So the eigenvalues of σy are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay would be (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but none of the options mention that. Let me look at the options.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Wait, but the eigenvalues are real, because spin matrices have real eigenvalues for their components. So that can't be. Unless I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, maybe I messed up. Let me think again. The eigenvalues of the spin angular momentum components are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be ± ħ/2.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B: Im part ±1/2, real part ±1. No, that's not matching. Because the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are real numbers. So the imaginary part would be zero.

So looking at the options, which one matches this.

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh or –2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Because our eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is (h/(2π))/2 = h/(4π). Wait, wait. Let me double-check. ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So the real parts would be h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero.

So looking at the options, which statements are correct.

Option A: imaginary parts +2πh or -2πh, real parts h/(4π) or -h/(4π). The real parts are correct, but the imaginary parts are wrong because eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because the eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π). So this is not correct.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A^2, but not Az. Hmm. Let's think about angular momentum algebra. For spin systems, the eigenfunctions of a component (like Ay) are not eigenfunctions of another component (like Az) because the components don't commute. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az unless the state is a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't the case for different components. However, the state could be an eigenstate of A², since A² commutes with all components.

Because spin angular momentum components don't commute, a state can't be an eigenstate of two different components. But since A² is the square of the total angular momentum, which commutes with each component, any eigenstate of Ay would indeed be an eigenstate of A². So option C's statement is correct: the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That sounds plausible.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, not sure. The basis functions for the matrix would be the eigenvectors. So yes, in a way, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space that the matrix operates on. So D could be correct as well.

Wait, but what do the options say? Option D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the matrix operator is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) would form a basis for the matrix operator. So that sounds correct.

Hmm. So options C and D might both be correct. Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me read each option again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions, but Az doesn't commute with Ay, so they don't share eigenfunctions.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form the basis. So yes, that's correct. So both C and D could be correct? Or maybe only one is correct.

Wait, let me think. Let's think about option D. The operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. Its eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors. So the eigenfunctions (which are the eigenvectors) form a basis for the vector space, which is the same as the basis of the matrix operator. So yes, D is correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalue and eigenvectors. So which of these statements would be considered correct in that context.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct when you calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So during that calculation, which of these statements would apply.

Let me evaluate each option again.

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts of ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But from earlier, the eigenvalues are purely real, ±h/(4π). So the imaginary parts are zero. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which is about 0.0866 (since h is about 6.626e-34, but let's compute h/(4π) numerically. 6.626e-34 / (4 * 3.1416) approx 6.626e-34 / 12.566 ~ 5.27e-35. So the eigenvalues are about ±5.27e-35, which are real. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions, but Az doesn’t commute, so no. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct. But wait, the matrix operator's basis is its eigenvectors — so that's true. So D is correct.

Hmm, so both C and D are correct? But since it's a multiple-choice question, only one option can be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's think again. The spin matrices are 2x2, so their eigenvectors form a basis. So option D is correct. But does the statement in D imply that the eigenfunctions are the same as the basis vectors of the matrix? Well, the matrix has a standard basis, say e1 and e2. But the eigenvectors might not align with that. However, any set of two eigenvectors (since it's 2x2) will form a basis. So the statement in D is correct: the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is D because it's a general property of 2x2 matrices and their eigenvectors.

Alternatively, option C's statement is also correct. Hmm, but the problem is whether the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is the square of the angular momentum operator, which in this case is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * (1 +1 )= (ħ^2)(2*(1/2)^2) )? Wait, no. Wait, the spin quantum number for a muon is 1/2, so the total spin squared is s(s+1)ħ². So s=1/2, so A² would have eigenvalues (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So the eigenfunctions of any component (like Ay) are eigenfunctions of A² because they share the same eigenvectors.

So yes, C is correct.

Wait, but the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay to confirm.

Let's do that.

Ay is (ħ/2) * σy.

Which is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So, let's write it as:

Ay = [[0, -i*(ħ/2)],
       [i*(ħ/2), 0]]

To find eigenvalues, we solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a      -iħ/2
   iħ/2    -a ]

The determinant is (a^2) - ( (iħ/2)(-iħ/2) ) = a² - [ (i)(-i)(ħ^2/4) ) ].

i*(-i) is (i^2)(-1) = (-1)(-1)= 1. Wait, no, i*(-i)= -i^2= -(-1)= 1. So:

det = a² - ( (iħ/2)(-iħ/2) ) = a² - ( (-i²)(ħ²/4) )= a² - ( (1) * ħ²/4 )

So det = a² - (ħ²/4) = 0 → a² = ħ²/4 → a = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So their real parts are ± ħ/2, and the imaginary parts are zero.

Looking back at the options, none of the options A or B fit this. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is way off, and the real parts are ±h/(4π), which is ħ/2 — wait, h/(4π) is ħ/2, right? Because ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the real parts of the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are ± h/(4π). And the imaginary parts are zero.

Looking at option A again: the imaginary parts are ±2πh. That's way larger than anything. So option A is incorrect.

So the only possible correct options are C and D.

Which brings me back to evaluating options C and D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A². So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So probably both C and D are correct? But the options are given as A, B, C, D, with only one correct.

Alternatively, perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, option D's statement might be a bit ambiguous. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Because the matrix is 2x2, any set of two eigenvectors (which are orthogonal) would form a basis. So D is correct.

But let me think about the statements again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Because A² commutes with Ay, they share eigenfunctions. So yes, correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, yes, the eigenvectors form the basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but given the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering option D. The matrix operator's basis functions are just the standard basis vectors, like [1;0] and [0;1]. But the eigenvectors might not align with that. So option D's statement is not necessarily correct. Because the basis functions of the matrix operator are the standard basis, while the eigenvectors might form a different basis.

But wait, no. The matrix operates on a two-dimensional space, and any two eigenvectors (from different eigenvalues) will form a basis for that space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) themselves form a basis for the space. So option D is correct.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck between C and D.

Let me think about the other options again. Because in the given options, only option C and D are possibly correct.

Which one is the correct answer?

Let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. 

Yes, because A^2 commutes with Ay, so any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A^2. But Az does not commute with Ay, so they cannot share eigenvectors.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. 

Since the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) are two in number (for a 2x2 matrix), they form a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But wait, the options are given as separate; each option is a statement, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the statements during the calculation. So which statement would you consider correct during the process.

But the question says, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I should check which option is correct based on the given matrix and process.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the matrix S is not the Pauli matrix, but something else. Let me re-examine that.

The matrix S is given as:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Which is exactly the Pauli Y matrix. Since I've used that correctly in the earlier steps.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4π), because ħ = h/(2π). So h/(4π) is indeed ħ/2.

So looking at the options again, none of the options A or B mention this. So the correct eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

So looking again at option A: the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), which matches. But the imaginary parts are ±2πh. Which is way off because in reality, the imaginary parts are zero.

So option A is incorrect.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the question is about the matrix S, not Ay. Because Ay = c * S, and c is h/(4π).

So the matrix Ay would be (h/(4π)) * S. So the entries of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * [0, -i; i, 0].

So when we compute the eigenvalues, which are ± ħ/2, as I did before.

So, the eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)).

So the real parts are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. But none of the options directly say that.

Wait, looking at option B: the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's not correct because the real parts are h/(4π) (approx 5e-35) and the imaginary parts are zero.

Wait, perhaps the question is using units where ħ=1, but I don't think so. So perhaps the given options are incorrect, but I need to see which option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the eigenvalues. Let me compute the eigenvalues again.

The matrix Ay is:

[0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

So the matrix is [[0, a], [a*, 0]] where a = -i h/(4π).

The eigenvalues for this kind of matrix (anti-diagonal) are ± |a|. Because for a 2x2 matrix [[0, a], [a*, 0]], the eigenvalues are sqrt(|a|^2) and -sqrt(|a|^2). So |a| is the magnitude.

|a| = | -i h/(4π) | = h/(4π).

So eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). Which is the same as ± ħ/2, since ħ is h/(2π). So yes, that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), real numbers. So the imaginary parts are zero.

So looking back, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh. That's incorrect. The real parts are correct but the imaginary parts are wrong. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Doesn't fit. The real parts are h/(4π) ≈ 5.27e-35, which is way less than 1, so B is incorrect.

So the only possible correct options are C and D.

But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation.

I think both C and D are correct, but only one can be the right answer.

Option C says eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Which is correct because A² commutes with Ay but Az doesn't.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator. Which is correct because eigenvectors form a basis.

So perhaps the correct answer is C and D. But since the options are mutually exclusive, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, looking at the options again, perhaps the answer is C.

Because the calculation is about eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So during the calculation, you would find that the eigenvectors of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's a statement that holds, so C is correct.

Alternatively, D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Hmm. Maybe thinking about the nature of the question: which statement is correct during the calculation, which likely refers to the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Since calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors involves finding the basis, perhaps D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is C. Because, in the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you realize that the eigenvectors are linked to other operators like A² and Az.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another angle.

The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Wait, the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, so any two eigenvectors (from different eigenvalues) will form a basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) indeed form a basis. So D is correct.

Therefore, I think both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is intended to be correct.

But in the provided options, option C and D are separate.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Because the problem is about the Y-component, and the eigenvectors of Ay are not the same as those of Az. So C is correct.

I think I'm getting too stuck. Let me try to think of each option's validity.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Yes, correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis of the matrix operator.

Yes, correct.

So both are correct, but since we have to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But wait, the question is about the Y-component operator's eigenvectors. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space. So D is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the question is about the properties of the eigenfunctions beyond just being a basis.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C and D, but since it's multiple-choice, I'll have to choose.

But I'm supposed to pick one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the statement in D is a bit ambiguous. The basis functions of the matrix operator are the standard basis vectors, but the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a different basis. So perhaps D is incorrect. Because the standard basis vectors might not be the same as the eigenvectors.

Wait, the matrix operator's basis functions would be the standard basis vectors, like e1 and e2. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form another basis. So D's statement might be incorrect because it's not the standard basis; it's another basis.

Ah, that's a good point. The question says, "the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator." The matrix operator's basis is typically the standard basis, not the eigenvectors unless the eigenvectors are chosen as the basis.

So perhaps D is incorrect because the statement suggests that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (standard) of the matrix operator, which is not necessarily true. The standard basis is different.

Therefore, the correct statement is C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

So, the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), which is represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of the Pauli Y matrix \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). When scaled by \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) become \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers. The imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero.

2. **Option A:**
   - This option states that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). The real parts are correct, but the imaginary parts are incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real. Hence, this option is **incorrect**.

3. **Option B:**
   - This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). Neither the real nor the imaginary parts match the actual eigenvalues, which are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). Thus, this option is **incorrect**.

4. **Option C:**
   - This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so they share eigenfunctions. However, \( A_z \) does not commute with \( A_y \), so they cannot share eigenfunctions. Hence, this option is **correct**.

5. **Option D:**
   - This option claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space, the term "basis functions of the matrix operator" could be interpreted as referring to the standard basis vectors (e.g., \( [1, 0]^T \) and \( [0, 1]^T \)), which are not the same as the eigenvectors of \( A_y \). Therefore, this option is **incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This aligns with the properties of angular momentum operators and their commutation relations.

**Answer: C**
