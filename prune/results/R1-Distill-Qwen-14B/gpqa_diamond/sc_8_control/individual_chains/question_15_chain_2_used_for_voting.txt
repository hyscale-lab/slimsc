Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, which causes a dip in brightness. The probability of this transit happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being observed. Both have been detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is 3P1.

Both have circular orbits, which is good because eccentricity can affect the transit probability, but since they're circular, maybe that's not a factor here. The host stars have different masses but same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but their radii are the same. Wait, same radii—so both stars are the same size, despite different masses. That might affect the transit probability.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers will choose the one with higher probability. The options are A to D, with different probabilities.

I think the transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the star's size. The formula for the transit probability (P) is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / a, but more accurately, it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Wait, no, the probability is actually the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk, but that's when the orbits are coplanar. But the actual probability also considers the orbital inclination. The chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is approximately (R_star / a) * something else? Or perhaps P ≈ (R_* / a) * (something else). Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability (P) can be approximated as (R_p / R_*)^2 * (R_* / a), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to the square of (R_p + R_*) / a. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Oh wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_p + R_*) / a * (something about the inclination). Wait, maybe more accurately, the probability is (R_*) / (a) multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is edge-on. Oh, right! The transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit multiplied by the probability that the inclination is such that the transit occurs. But the planet's orbital inclination has to be close to 90 degrees for a transit. So the probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by the solid angle factor, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is (R_*)/(a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p/R_*)), but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, that term is negligible. So approximately P ≈ R_* / a.

Wait, no. Another thought: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability of that is sin(i), where i is the inclination. But the actual probability is the fraction of possible orbits where the planet's orbital plane is aligned. The distribution of inclinations is random, so the probability is the integral over sin(i) di from 0 to 90 degrees. That integral is 1/2. But that's just the geometric probability due to inclination. Then, the transit probability also depends on whether the planet's orbit is such that it actually transits, which depends on the relative size of the star and the planet's orbital distance.

So the overall transit probability P is the product of the geometric probability and the probability that the planet's orbit is such that it can transit. The geometric probability is about 1/(1 + (a/R_*)^0.5), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for transit probability more carefully. The probability that a planet transits its star, from a randomly oriented orbit, is given by (R_* + R_p) / a * (R_* / a). No, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

I found this formula before: the transit probability P is approximately (R_* / a) * (1 + R_p/R_*). But since R_p << R_*, this simplifies to R_* / a. So P ≈ R_* / a.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a is large, the probability decreases. So for a given star, a planet with a smaller semi-major axis (closer in) has a higher probability of transiting because R_* is fixed and a is smaller. So yes, that makes sense. So P is proportional to R_* / a.

But wait, the formula I've found online is a bit more precise. Let me recall: the transit probability is P = (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p/R_*)), but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_*/a. So for a given star, a smaller a (closer planet) gives a higher P.

So in our case, what matters is R_* and a.

But in the problem, both host stars have the same radii. So R_*1 = R_*2 = R.

So P is proportional to 1/a.

Therefore, the planet with a smaller semi-major axis (smaller a) has a higher transit probability.

But wait, the planets' orbital periods are given. Planet_1 has P1, Planet_2 has P2=3P1.

Using Kepler's third law, the period P is related to the semi-major axis a. For a star of mass M, P^2 = (4π²/GM) * a^3. So a^3 = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M P²)^1/3.

So a = k * (M * P²)^(1/3), where k is a constant.

So for each planet, a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1²)^(1/3), and a2 is proportional to (M2 * P2²)^(1/3).

Given that M1 = 2 M2, because Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. And P1 = (1/3) P2. Let me write M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 / 3.

So a1 = k * (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3 ) = k * (2 M2 * P2² /9 )^(1/3 ) = k * ( (2/9) M2 P2² )^(1/3 )

a2 = k * ( M2 * ( (3 P1) )^2 )^(1/3 )

Wait, wait. Let me correct that. Planet_2 has period P2, which is 3 times Planet_1's period. So P2 = 3 P1.

So a1 is for Planet_1: a1 ∝ (M1 * P1² )^(1/3 ) = (2 M2 * (P1)^2 )^(1/3 )

a2 is for Planet_2: a2 ∝ (M2 * P2² )^(1/3 ) = (M2 * (3 P1 )² )^(1/3 ) = (M2 * 9 P1² )^(1/3 )

So a1 = (2 M2 P1² )^(1/3 ) = (2)^(1/3) * (M2 P1² )^(1/3 )

a2 = (9 M2 P1² )^(1/3 ) = (9)^(1/3 ) * (M2 P1² )^(1/3 )

So a2 is (9)^(1/3) times (M2 P1² )^(1/3 ), and a1 is 2^(1/3) times the same.

So the ratio a2/a1 = (9^(1/3)) / (2^(1/3)) ) = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(0.333) ≈ around 1.65.

Wait, let me calculate 9/2 =4.5, cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65.

So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

Because a is proportional to (M P² )^(1/3 ), and M1 is 2 M2, P1 is (1/3) P2.

So since a2 is 1.65 times a1, and transit probability is approximately R_* / a, and R_* is same for both, then P1's transit probability is (R / a1) and P2's is (R / a2) = (R / (1.65 a1)).

So P1 has a transit probability of R/(a1), P2 has R/(1.65 a1) = (1/1.65) * (R/a1) ≈ 0.606 times P1's probability.

Wait no, wait. Wait transit probability for planet_1 is P1 = R/a1.

For planet_2, it's P2 = R/a2 = R/(1.65 a1) = (1/1.65) * (R/a1) = (1/1.65) * P1.

Wait, but that would mean P2's probability is lower than P1's. But the options suggest that either planet_2 is preferred or planet_1 is preferred.

Wait, let me think again. If a2 is larger than a1, then R/a2 is smaller than R/a1. So P2 has a lower transit probability than P1. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

Wait, but the question says the researchers want to observe the one with higher probability. So if Planet_1 has higher probability, they should choose it. Looking at the options, options C and D say Planet_1 is preferred with higher probabilities.

But wait, let me double-check. Because I might have miscalculated the a ratio.

Let me compute a1 and a2 again.

a1 ∝ (M1 * P1² )^(1/3 )

a2 ∝ (M2 * P2² )^(1/3 )

Given M1=2 M2, P2=3 P1.

So a1 = (2 M2 * (P1)^2 )^{1/3} = (2)^{1/3} * (M2 P1² )^{1/3 }

a2 = (M2 * (3 P1 )^2 )^{1/3} } = (9 M2 P1² )^{1/3 } = (9)^{1/3} * (M2 P1² )^{1/3 }

So the ratio a2/a1 = (9)^{1/3} / (2)^{1/3} ) = (9/2 )^{1/3} ≈ (4.5)^{1/3} ≈ 1.65.

So a2 is approximately 1.65 times a1.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So R/a1 is bigger than R/a2.

So transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the probability for Planet_1 is approximately (1) / a1, and for Planet_2 it's (1) / (1.65 a1), so P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, no, because P1's a is smaller, so 1/a1 is bigger. So P1's transit probability is higher.

So if P1 has a higher probability, Planet_1 is preferred. So the correct answer would be either C or D.

Looking back at the options:

C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

D: ~2.7 times.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher by a factor of approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So option C says that Planet_1 has 1.65 times higher probability.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the transit probability formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider the duration or the frequency, but no, the question is about the probability of a transit occurring at all. So when observing, the probability that the planet transits is higher for Planet_1 because a1 is smaller.

So researchers should pick Planet_1 since it's more likely to transit.

But let me think about the transit probability formula more accurately. The exact formula is P = (R_* + R_p) / a * ( some factor based on the orbit's geometry ).

But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_* / a.

So yes, P1 is R/a1, P2 is R/a2. a2 is 1.65 a1, so P2 is (1/1.65) P1 ≈ 0.606 P1. So P1's probability is about 1.65 times that of P2.

So if the question is about which has a higher probability, Planet_1 is better, so the researchers should observe Planet_1. So the options C and D are about that.

Option C says 1.65 times, which is correct. Option D says 2.7 times, which would probably be if I had another factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio. Let me recalculate a2/a1.

a1 ∝ (M1 P1² )^{1/3 } = (2 M2 (P1)^2 )^{1/3 } = 2^{1/3} (M2 P1² )^{1/3 }

a2 ∝ (M2 (3 P1 )^2 )^{1/3 } = (9 M2 P1^2 )^{1/3 } = 9^{1/3} (M2 P1² )^{1/3 }

So a2/a1 = 9^{1/3}/2^{1/3} = (9/2)^{1/3} = (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So a2 is 1.65 times a1.

So the transit probabilities are inversely proportional to a. So P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/a2 = R/(1.65 a1) = (1/1.65) P1.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by a factor of approximately 1.65.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, which is option C.

Wait, but let me recheck the options. Option C says "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_* \)), so the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( (M P^2)^{1/3} \), where \( M \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- Planet_1: \( a_1 \propto (M_1 P_1^2)^{1/3} \)
- Planet_2: \( a_2 \propto (M_2 P_2^2)^{1/3} \)

Given:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star),
- \( P_2 = 3P_1 \) (Planet_2's orbital period is three times that of Planet_1),

we calculate the ratio of \( a_2 \) to \( a_1 \):
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{(M_2 (3P_1)^2)^{1/3}}{(2M_2 P_1^2)^{1/3}} = \frac{(9M_2 P_1^2)^{1/3}}{(2M_2 P_1^2)^{1/3}} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3} \approx 1.65
\]
Thus, \( a_2 \approx 1.65a_1 \), meaning Planet_2's semi-major axis is 1.65 times larger than Planet_1's.

### Step 2: Transit Probability
Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), and \( a_2 \approx 1.65a_1 \), the transit probability of Planet_1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2:
\[
P_1 \propto \frac{1}{a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{1}{a_2} \implies \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability than Planet_2 by a factor of approximately 1.65. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
