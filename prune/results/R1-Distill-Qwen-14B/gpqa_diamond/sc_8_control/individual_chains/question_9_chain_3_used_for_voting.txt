Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry, but let's think through this.

First, I remember that C3h symmetry implies a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Oh wait, or is it C3v? No, C3h is a symmetry group that includes a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Looking at the options:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I think I need to analyze each molecule's structure.

Starting with C) triisopropyl borate. Its structure is a central boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group has two methyl branches. So the molecule is symmetric with a boron in the center and three identical substituents. Wait, but waitâ€”each isopropyl group is the same, so the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. Does it have a mirror plane? If the molecule is non-planar, then maybe. Alternatively, if it's symmetric in a way that a horizontal plane reflects it. I'm a bit confused here. Triisopropyl borate is known to have C3v symmetry, I think. Because it's trigonal pyramidal, right? So the symmetry group would have a three-fold axis and some mirror planes. But C3h is different, isn't it? Wait, C3v has a vertical mirror plane, while C3h has a horizontal mirror plane. Hmm, perhaps I should reconsider.

Now, D) quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, a norbornane derivative. Its structure is a seven-membered ring with two bridgeheads. Wait, no, quinuclidine is actually a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure, right? So it has a bridged structure, with three bridges. Let me think about its symmetry. It has a high degree of symmetry because all the bridges are the same. So it should have multiple planes of symmetry and rotation axes. For example, a three-fold rotation axis would pass through the center, rotating each of the three bridges into each other. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it has higher symmetry like D3h or something else. Wait, quinuclidine's structure is symmetric along multiple axes. It has a main three-fold rotation axis, and there are mirror planes that bisect the rings. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Maybe. Alternatively, perhaps it belongs to the Td point group, but I'm not sure.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. I'm a bit confused about the structure here. It's a benzo-fused trifuran system. Benzo rings are fused to the furans. Let me try to draw it mentally. The numbering is a bit complicated, but perhaps the molecule is a tricyclic structure with three furan rings connected in a particular way, with benzene rings attached. I'm not immediately sure about its symmetry. But I think this might be a structure that's symmetric in a way that allows for a three-fold rotation. Alternatively, perhaps it's more of a D3h symmetry.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So it's a triphenylene fused with a trifuran. Triphenylene is a tricyclic system with three benzene rings connected in a way that the molecule has a three-fold symmetry. The trifuran part might add more rings. So if the molecule is arranged symmetrically, maybe it has a three-fold axis. But whether it has the horizontal mirror plane as well.

Wait, the question is about C3h symmetry. Which requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal pyramid. Its symmetry group is C3v, which has a vertical mirror plane. So it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, so it wouldn't fit C3h.

Quinuclidine: If it's D3h symmetry, then yes, it has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. Because D3h includes a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So maybe quinuclidine has D3h symmetry. But I need to be certain.

What about the other options. Let's think about the benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. The molecule has benzene rings attached to a trifuran. The way the substituents are arranged could lead to a three-fold symmetry. For example, if each benzene is attached in a symmetric way, the molecule might have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, triphenyleno[...]trifuran: triphenylene itself has a three-fold axis. If the trifuran is attached in a way that preserves this symmetry, then the whole molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, I think triphenylene is a [n] system. It's a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three benzene rings connected in a way that the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. So if the trifuran is attached in a symmetrical fashion, the whole molecule would have a three-fold axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would require reflection symmetry across a plane. Suppose the molecule is flat, then a horizontal mirror would bisect it. So if it's symmetric, it could have a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, if the molecule is non-planar, like in a boat conformation, then maybe not. But in the case of triphenylene, it's a planar molecule, so perhaps the trifuran is also planar, making the overall molecule planar. Thus, having a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane would make it C3h.

Alternatively, triphenyleno compound might have higher symmetry.

Wait, let's think about the specific examples. Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal pyramid. So its symmetry is C3v, which includes a vertical mirror plane and a three-fold axis. So it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, so it's not C3h.

Quinuclidine is a chair-like structure, and it's been a while since I studied its symmetry. But I believe quinuclidine has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it have C3h symmetry. Because when looking at it, the molecule is symmetric top to bottom. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a bridge. Its structure is such that it has a three-fold rotation axis, and perhaps a horizontal mirror plane that reflects it. So maybe it does have C3h symmetry.

Wait, another approach: The point group C3h has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So any molecule with such symmetry would have both. Let's think about the options.

Option D is quinuclidine. If it has a three-fold axis (which it does, because the bridges can be rotated 120 degrees) and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's C3h. Alternatively, if the mirror plane is vertical, it's C3v.

Wait, I think quinuclidine's symmetry is higher. It's actually D3h symmetry. D3h has a three-fold rotation axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and some vertical mirror planes as well. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it also has C3h symmetry, because the C3h is a subgroup of D3h. Wait, no, because the presence of additional symmetry elements would make it a different group. So quinuclidine might have D3h symmetry, which includes C3h, but the question is about having C3h, which is a proper subset.

Alternatively, maybe one of the other compounds has exactly C3h and nothing more.

So let's look at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

The structure is a trifuran (three fused furan rings) with benzene rings attached. The way it's attached is through the 1,2-c, 3,4-c', and 5,6-c'' positions. So each benzene is attached to each of the three furan rings.

Wait, perhaps this structure is symmetric. If each benzene is attached to each of the three furan rings in a symmetric way, then the molecule could have a three-fold rotation axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, the molecule might be planar, so a horizontal mirror plane would bisect it. If all three substituents (benzene rings) are identical and arranged symmetrically, then a horizontal mirror would work.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe looking for examples I know.

Wait, triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry, doesn't it? Because the three rings can be rotated, and there are mirror planes. So if the triphenylene part is attached to a trifuran in a symmetric way, the whole molecule might retain the C3h symmetry.

But wait, the question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry.

Another approach: Which of the options have three similar substituents attached symmetrically around a central structure?

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Three isopropyl groups on B. So it's symmetric with three identical groups. So yes, it has a three-fold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, the structure is trigonal pyramidal. So in a trigonal pyramid, the base is a triangle, and the apex is the B. The mirror planes would pass through the apex and each base atom. So in this case, the mirrors are vertical (C3v). So no horizontal mirror plane, so not C3h.

Option D: quinuclidine. If it's D3h, then it has C3h. So if the question is about C3h, then D's symmetry includes that. So D is a possibility.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. So it has three phenylene groups attached to a trifuran. The arrangement would be symmetric. So if the molecule is flat, then a horizontal mirror could be present. So the three phenyl groups are attached in a symmetric way, and the trifuran is planar. So the whole molecule could have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the other options.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. So each of the three furans is attached to a benzene. If the benzene is attached in a symmetric way, then this would have a three-fold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps option A is the correct answer because the triphenylene part has a three-fold axis and the trifuran is attached symmetrically. So the overall structure would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of which of these are known to have C3h symmetry.

I recall that triphenylene has D3h symmetry, which includes a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror. But when it's fused with other rings, like the trifuran in option A, it might complicate the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzo-fused compound (option B) isn't symmetric enough. Because each benzene is attached to each furan, but if the substituents are in a way that disrupts the mirror plane, then it might not have C3h.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecule in option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. The triphenylene is a three-ring system, and each ring is connected to a furan ring. So if each furan ring is attached in a symmetric position, the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis. Now, the molecule is planar, so a horizontal mirror plane would bisect it. So yes, it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but does the trifuran add any asymmetry? No, because each is attached in a symmetric way, so the overall molecule remains symmetric. So option A would have C3h symmetry.

But earlier, I thought that quinuclidine has D3h, which includes C3h, but the question is which molecule has C3h. So if quinuclidine has D3h, which is a higher symmetry, it would also have C3h.

Wait, the question is about which of the molecules has C3h symmetry. So if any of these have exactly C3h and not higher symmetry, that's the answer. But symmetry groups are such that if a molecule has higher symmetry, it inherently includes the lower ones.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine, which has D3h symmetry and thus includes C3h.

But wait, the actual question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. So it's possible that one of them has exactly C3h without any additional symmetry elements, which would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option A, because it's a planar molecule with a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about each option's possible symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate: C3v.

Quinuclidine: D3h.

Option B: benzo[...]trifuran. Let's see. Each benzene is attached to a furan ring. If the molecule has a three-fold axis, and a horizontal mirror, then it's C3h. But if the substituents are in a way that disrupts the mirror plane, then it might not.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]. The triphenylene part has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. When it's attached to the trifuran, if each is attached at equivalent positions, the overall molecule would still have the same symmetry.

Alternatively, if the attachment disrupts the mirror plane, then maybe not.

Wait, the way the substituents are attached in option A is in a way that each position is symmetric. So the molecule would still have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, among the options, perhaps option A (trphenyleno) is the one with C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, maybe the benzo-fused compound is not symmetric enough. Let's think: in benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran, each benzene is attached to each of the three furans. So if each benzene is in a position that's equivalent under rotation, the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not sure if the substituents' positions allow for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzo substituents are placed in positions that create a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, making it C3h.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the other options again.

Wait, another approach: the molecule with C3h symmetry must have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So, any molecule that's symmetric when rotated 120 degrees and has a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Quinuclidine: I think it has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror, so it has C3h.

Triisopropyl borate: No horizontal mirror, so not C3h.

Option A and B: If they have the necessary symmetry elements.

If I can't decide between A and D, perhaps I should think of known examples.

Wait, I recall that triphenylene has D3h symmetry. So when attached to a trifuran in a symmetric way, as in option A, it would retain the symmetry. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, so it's C3h.

Alternatively, quinuclidine's symmetry is D3h, which includes C3h.

So both options A and D would have C3h symmetry.

But the question is which of the four options has it. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So if any of them have that, that's the answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D: quinuclidine. Because I think quinuclidine is known to have a high degree of symmetry, including C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll have to make an educated guess. I think quinuclidine has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So option D would have C3h. On the other hand, triphenyleno in option A would also have C3h.

Wait, I'm not certain, but the question gives options A and D, so perhaps I should choose between them.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another approach: think of the number of mirror planes and axes.

C3h has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. It's a point group with certain characteristics.

If quinuclidine has D3h symmetry, it would have a three-fold axis, a horizontal mirror, and two vertical mirrors. So it definitely includes C3h.

But the question is which has C3h. So any molecule with exactly C3h would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because it's a symmetrically substituted structure, which might have C3h.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran, which has C3h symmetry.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D) quinuclidine.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another way. Perhaps looking for the number of symmetry elements.

The point group C3h has:

- A three-fold rotation axis (C3)
- A horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh)
- No other symmetry elements.

So the molecule should have these, but nothing else.

Quinuclidine, with D3h symmetry, has more symmetry elements, including vertical mirror planes. So if the question is about exactly C3h, then quinuclidine would not be the answer. Because it has more symmetry than C3h.

So that would point towards option A being the correct answer.

Hmm, so if quinuclidine has D3h, which includes C3h, but perhaps option A has exactly C3h.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe option B has C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about each option.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. No, as discussed earlier, it's C3v.

Option D: quinuclidine. It has D3h, so it has C3h but more.

Option A and B: which has C3h.

Between A and B.

Option A: triphenyleno[...]trifuran. Triphenylene is D3h, but when fused with another ring, perhaps the symmetry is reduced.

Alternatively, if the trifuran is symmetrically attached, the molecule would have C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps option B has C3h.

Wait, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran. Each benzene is attached to each of the three furans. If each benzene is in a position that's symmetric, then upon rotating 120 degrees, the molecule would look the same. Also, if a horizontal mirror plane exists, reflecting the molecule would leave it unchanged.

So perhaps option B has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

But I'm really not sure. Maybe I should think of the number of rings. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, which might have a three-fold axis. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: when looking at the mirror plane. If a molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, when you look at it from above, the top and bottom would be mirror images.

If the structure is such that the top and bottom are identical, then a horizontal mirror plane exists.

Triphenyleno in option A is a planar molecule, so perhaps a horizontal mirror plane exists. Also, the three-fold rotation would make it have C3h.

Alternatively, Benzo in option B is attached to three furans, but maybe not in a way that allows a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

In conclusion, based on the structures, I think option A, triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... has C3h symmetry.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C3h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry properties. **C3h symmetry** requires a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). Below is the analysis of each option:

---

### **Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule consists of a triphenylene core fused with a trifuran system. Triphenylene itself is a planar, symmetric structure with **D3h symmetry**, which includes a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.
- The trifuran system is attached symmetrically to the triphenylene core. Since the attachment preserves the symmetry of the triphenylene, the overall molecule retains **C3h symmetry** (as it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane).

---

### **Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. Each benzene ring is attached to one of the three furan rings in a symmetric manner.
- While the molecule has a three-fold rotational axis due to the symmetric arrangement of the benzene rings, it lacks a horizontal mirror plane. The asymmetry introduced by the fused benzene rings disrupts the presence of a horizontal mirror plane.
- Therefore, this molecule does **not** have **C3h symmetry**.

---

### **Option C: triisopropyl borate**
- This molecule has a trigonal pyramidal structure with a boron atom at the center and three identical isopropyl groups as substituents.
- It has a three-fold rotational axis (C3) but no horizontal mirror plane. Instead, it has vertical mirror planes, giving it **C3v symmetry**.
- Since it lacks a horizontal mirror plane, it does **not** have **C3h symmetry**.

---

### **Option D: quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure with a three-fold rotation axis and multiple planes of symmetry.
- It has **D3h symmetry**, which includes a three-fold rotation axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and additional vertical mirror planes.
- While quinuclidine does have **C3h symmetry** as a subset of its overall symmetry, the question asks for a molecule with **exactly C3h symmetry**. Quinuclidine has higher symmetry (D3h), so it is not the best answer.

---

### **Conclusion**
Option A, **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**, is the molecule with **exactly C3h symmetry**. It retains the symmetry of the triphenylene core and has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane due to its symmetric structure.

**Answer: A**
