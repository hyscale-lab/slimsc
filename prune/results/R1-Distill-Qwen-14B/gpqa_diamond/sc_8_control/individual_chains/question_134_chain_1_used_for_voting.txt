Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, I should think carefully about the steps here.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. They're all being mixed together. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait, I think the reactants are the acids and the base. So HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is the base. So when they mix, they should react.

But wait, how do they react? Let's think. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll donate H+ ions. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, wait. I think H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so it can donate two H+ ions. But wait, in solution, does it dissociate completely? HCl is a strong acid, so yes. H2SO4 first dissociation is strong, but the second is weaker. Oh wait, but in aqueous solution, especially when diluted, perhaps the second H+ doesn't fully dissociate. Hmm, but for the purpose of neutralization, maybe we only consider the first dissociation. Or wait, the problem might be designed such that all H+ from the acids and all OH- from the base are considered.

But wait, the problem is about neutralization, so it's an acid-base reaction producing water and possibly a salt. So I should figure out all the H+ ions from the acids and the OH- ions from the base, then see which is in excess.

Wait, let's list each solution and the amount of H+ or OH- they produce.

So first, the HCl solution: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely into H+ and Cl-. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So the moles of HCl are 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M solution. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first H+ is strong, the second is weak. But in neutralization reactions, sometimes only the first H+ is considered because it's the one that's fully ionized. Alternatively, maybe in this problem, maybe both are considered. Hmm. Wait, but when H2SO4 reacts with a base, like Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, perhaps both H+ from H2SO4 are neutralized. Hmm, but wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll dissociate into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-.

So let's see. I think the correct approach is to write all the possible H+ from the acids and OH- from the base.

So HCl contributes H+ as 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: each mole gives 2 H+? Wait, but in solution, does the second H+ dissociate? For the purposes of neutralization, maybe it's considered as contributing 2 H+ per mole. Or maybe just the first one, because the second is a weak acid. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think. When H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) is weaker. So in solution, the first H+ is fully ionized, the second not so much.

But for neutralization, perhaps we can assume that all H+ are available. Wait, but in reality, for the neutralization reaction, the strong H+ will react first. So maybe only the first H+ is considered for H2SO4. But wait, the problem is probably designed such that the H2SO4 is considered as a strong acid, providing two H+ per molecule.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the solution is to think about each acid's contribution to the H+ ions. HCl gives 1 H+ per molecule, H2SO4 gives 2 H+ per, and Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per molecule.

So let's calculate all the H+ from the acids and the OH- from the base.

Wait, but wait, the Ba(OH)2 is a base, so it's going to contribute OH- ions. So let me compute moles of each.

First, HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol H+. So that's 0.1 moles of H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. If each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

The OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- is: H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. The total moles of H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ remaining: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

So the neutralization reaction will produce 0.2 moles of H2O, and there will be excess H+ of 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait. How do I calculate the enthalpy here? I think the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is usually given per mole of H+ neutralized, assuming it's a strong acid and strong base. But in this case, we have a mixture, so we need to find out how much H+ is actually neutralized.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, the enthalpy change is about -57.3 kJ (since 1 cal = 4.184 J, but wait, the options have kcal and kJ.)

Wait, wait, no: wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (since 1 mole of H+ gives 57.3 kJ released, which is exothermic, so negative ΔH). Alternatively, sometimes it's given in calories: 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 57.3 kJ is 57,300 J, which is approximately 57,300 / 4.184 ≈ 13,650 cal, which is about 13.65 kcal.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 kJ = 1000 J, 1 cal = 4.184 J. So 57.3 kJ is 57,300 J. In cal, that's 57,300 /4.184 ≈ 13650 cal, which is 13.65 kcal. So each mole of H+ gives about -13.65 kcal.

Wait, so the reaction is exothermic, so the enthalpy change is negative.

So in our case, the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2 moles (since OH- is 0.2 moles). So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles × (-13.65 kcal/mol) = -2.73 kcal.

But wait, the options are given in kcal and kJ. Let me look at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So option A is -2.72, which is close to -2.73. So that would be the answer. Hmm, but wait, wait a second.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the assumption about H2SO4. Since H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, the second H+ might not dissociate completely. So perhaps in the neutralization, the first H+ is neutralized, and the second is considered weak, so maybe it doesn't contribute. Or maybe the problem assumes that only the first H+ is considered. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all H+ from both HCl and H2SO4 (i.e., 1 per HCl and 2 per H2SO4) are available.

Wait, but in that case, the H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.09 × 2 = 0.18, as I calculated before. So total H+ is 0.28, which reacts with 0.2 OH-.

So the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2, so 0.2 × (-13.65) is about -2.73 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. The problem states that HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So when they mix, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, so the first H+ is fully ionized. The second H+ (from HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) is a weak acid. So in dilute solutions, the second H+ might not dissociate much, especially if the solution is not too concentrated. So perhaps, in this problem, only the first H+ from H2SO4 is considered, contributing 0.09 mol H+.

Wait, let me recalculate if that's the case.

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4. If only the first H+ is considered, then 0.09 mol H+.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19 mol.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.19, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is in excess. All 0.19 H+ will react, leaving 0.2 - 0.19 = 0.01 mol OH-.

So the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.19. So the enthalpy change is 0.19 × (-13.65) kcal ≈ -2.60 kcal. Hmm, so that's about -2.6 kcal, which isn't exactly an option. But the options have A) -2.72, which is close to the initial calculation when considering both H+ from H2SO4.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that both H+ from H2SO4 are available. Because, in reality, when H2SO4 is in excess and a strong base is present, the second H+ may dissociate because the solution is strongly basic, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should ignore that and proceed with the initial calculation, because that's what the problem expects.

So going back, the initial calculation when considering both H+ from H2SO4 gives n(H+) = 0.28 mol, which reacts with 0.2 mol OH-, so 0.2 mol H+ neutralized. So 0.2 × (-13.65) ≈ -2.73 kcal. Which is about -2.72 kcal as in option A.

But wait another thing. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ (or OH-), so for each mole of H+ consumed, it's about -57.3 kJ, which is about -13.65 kcal.

But wait, let me check the units of the options. Option D is in kJ, others are in kcal. So if the correct calculation leads to 0.2 moles × (-57.3 kJ/mol), that would be -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. That's close to option B (-11.42 kcal) but wait option B is in kcal. Hmm, no, because 57.3 kJ is per mole, so 0.2 ×57.3=11.46 kJ, which is about 11.46 kJ, but the enthalpy change is negative: -11.46 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is 0.2 × 80 kJ, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it using kJ.

Wait, earlier when I considered all H+ from H2SO4, I had 0.28 moles of H+ neutralized, but only 0.2 moles of OH- available. So the neutralization is 0.2 moles.

So 0.2 × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. But since it's exothermic, the ΔH is -11.46 kJ. So that's approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.5 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't close to this. Hmm, the other option is option B: -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.46 kJ is about 2.73 kcal (since 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ). So 11.46 kJ is about 2.73 kcal. So if the calculation is done in kJ, the ΔH would be -11.46 kJ, but that's the same as -2.73 kcal. But wait, no: let me convert 11.46 kJ into kcal. 11.46 kJ /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So the ΔH is -2.736 kcal, which is about -2.74 kcal. Which matches option A (-2.72 kcal).

So, the question is, which units do the options use? Let's see the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the correct answer is approximately -2.74 kcal, then option A is correct. Alternatively, if the calculation is done in kJ, the answer would be around -11.46 kJ, which is close to option D (-16.0 kJ), but that's not matching. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. The enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H+ is -57.3 kJ. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 × (-57.3) kJ = -11.46 kJ. So that's about -11.5 kJ, but the only option in kJ is D (-16.0 kJ), which is not close. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to consider the stoichiometry of each acid and base, considering their respective H+ and OH- contributions, but perhaps the neutralization is not just H+ and OH- reacting, but the specific salts formed.

Wait, perhaps I should write the reactions.

HCl (strong acid) will dissociate completely: HCl → H+ + Cl^-.

H2SO4 (strong acid in first dissociation) → 2 H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, no, that's not right. H2SO4 first dissociates into H+ and HSO4^-:

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, wait. Wait, no, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2- only if it's a strong diprotic acid, but H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation step: H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2- is incorrect because the first H+ comes off completely, but the second doesn't. So first dissociation is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-. The HSO4^- then can dissociate further, but not completely: HSO4^- ⇌ H+ + SO4^2-.

So in solution, the concentration of H+ from H2SO4 is 2 times the concentration of H2SO4 only if the second dissociation is complete, which it's not. So perhaps in this problem, only the first H+ is considered, giving 0.09 mol H+ from H2SO4.

So let's recalculate:

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 1 H+ (from first dissociation), so 0.09 mol H+.

Total H+: 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.19, OH- is 0.2. So H+ is limiting. All 0.19 H+ will react, producing 0.19 mol H2O, and 0.2 -0.19 =0.01 mol OH- remains.

So the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.19.

So the enthalpy change is 0.19 mol × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -10.887 kJ ≈ -10.89 kJ.

Which is about -10.89 kJ, but looking at the options, not matching any. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is -13.65 kcal (as calculated earlier). So 0.19 × (-13.65) ≈ -2.6 kcal, which again, not matching any options except perhaps option A is -2.72, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the neutralization in terms of the reactions and calculate the heat based on the limiting reagent.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

OH- is 0.2 mol. So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat. The limiting reagent is OH-, so all 0.2 mol OH- will react. So 0.2 × 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ exothermic, so ΔH is -11.46 kJ. But that's in kJ, and the options have option D as -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Wait, but perhaps the reaction is per mole of H+ neutralized, regardless of the source. So 0.2 moles H+ neutralized × (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. But none of the options match that exactly. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as -11.46 kJ converted to kcal?

Wait, no. Let me convert 11.46 kJ to kcal. 11.46 kJ /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So 11.46 kJ is 2.736 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -2.736 kcal. Which is approximately -2.74 kcal, matching option A (-2.72 kcal).

So I think the correct approach is that the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting, releasing 0.2 ×57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, which is about 2.736 kcal. So the answer is -2.736 kcal, which is option A (-2.72 kcal). So I think the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions contributed by each solution:

1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (diprotic acid):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Assuming both H⁺ ions are neutralized (as the problem likely assumes complete dissociation for simplicity), H₂SO₄ contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

Next, the neutralization reaction \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \) occurs. The limiting reagent is OH⁻, as there are only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) available to react with \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \). Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) will be neutralized.

The enthalpy of neutralization for one mole of \( \text{H}^+ \) is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.65 \, \text{kcal/mol} \). For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), the enthalpy change is:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
\]  
Converting to kcal:  
\[
\Delta H = \frac{-11.46 \, \text{kJ}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal}} \approx -2.736 \, \text{kcal}.
\]  

This value is closest to option A (\(-2.72 \, \text{kcal}\)).

**Critical analysis of options:**  
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value of \(-2.736 \, \text{kcal}\).  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as this value corresponds to the enthalpy in kJ, not kcal.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Too low and inconsistent with the calculation.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as the enthalpy in kJ is \(-11.46 \, \text{kJ}\), not \(-16.0 \, \text{kJ}\).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
