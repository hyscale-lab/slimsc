Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be treated as a rigid rotor when vibrations are ignored, but this is the non-rigid case, so vibrations are considered. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. Now, the question is about what momentum a photon should have so that when it's absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the photon is causing a transition from the current state to the next higher state.

The given data includes the masses of the two atoms, X and Y. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

The options are A to D, each with different momentum values. I need to calculate the correct momentum.

First, I should probably recall the energy levels for a quantum rotor and a harmonic oscillator. Wait, the molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, which I think incorporates both rotational and vibrational energy. Or maybe it's a separate model where both rotational and vibrational states are considered. Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor model primarily deals with rotational states with some consideration of bond vibrations, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the problem might involve both vibrational and rotational transitions, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps it's a change in the vibrational state, or maybe the rotational state.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the state with the lowest vibrational energy (v=0) and the lowest rotational energy (like the ground rotational state, so J=0 maybe, but for diatomic molecules, the ground state is J=0, but I'm not entirely sure).

When the photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the next higher energy state. But what's the order of energy levels? Vibrational energy levels are quantized as (v + ½) h w, and rotational as (J (J+1)) ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the energy levels for a diatomic molecule are a combination of both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), so E = (0 + ½) h w + [0 (0+1) ħ²/(2I)].

The next state with the lowest possible energy could be the next vibrational state (v=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). But which transition requires less energy? Let me calculate the energies.

First, let's compute the vibrational energy difference. The energy of vibrational levels is given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. So the difference between v=1 and v=0 is ΔE_v = [1 + 1/2 - (0 +1/2)] h w = h w.

For rotational energy, the rotational energy levels are E_J = [ J (J+1) ] (ħ²)/(2 I). The moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Calculating the rotational energy difference between J=1 and J=0. E_J=1 - E_J=0 = [1*(2) - 0*(1)] (ħ²)/(2I) = 2 (ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I).

So the energy difference for rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_r = (ħ²)/(I).

We need to compare ΔE_v and ΔE_r. The photon's energy should match the energy difference of the transition. So the question is whether the next state is a vibrational (v=1) or a rotational (J=1) state.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, for a diatomic molecule, the order of energy levels could be such that the first overtone (v=2) is higher than a rotational transition (J=1). But perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are treated differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying, considering only the lowest energy transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the fundamental state (v=0 and J=0), and the next state is the next possible state with the lowest energy, which could be either J=1 or v=1. But which transition requires a smaller photon energy? Because a lower energy photon is easier to absorb, but I need to find the right one.

Wait, I need to calculate ΔE_v and ΔE_r and see which is smaller. Let's compute both.

First, compute μ, the reduced mass. μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 *2)/(20 +2) =40/22= 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, I need to convert this into kg to compute I. 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ =1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that. 1.818 *1.66 is about 3.01, so 3.01e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute 20/11 * 20 amu? Wait, no, wait, Mx is 20, My is 2. So μ = (20 * 2)/(20+2) =40/22 =20/11 amu. So 20/11 amu is approximately 1.818 amu.

So μ in kg is 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg. Let's calculate that: 1.818 *1.66 is about 3.01. So 3.01e-27 kg.

Wait, exact calculation: 20/11 = 1.8181818... amu. Multiply by 1.66e-27 kg/amu: 1.818 *1.66 = approx 3.01. So μ≈3.01e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculate (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². So I =3.01e-27 *4e-20 =1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, compute the rotational energy difference ΔE_r = ħ²/(2I) ?

Wait, wait. The rotational energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) ) (ħ²)/(2I). So the difference between J=1 and J=0 is E_1 - E_0 = [2 - 0] * (ħ²)/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2 I) )= ħ²/(I).

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is h/(2π). So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ΔE_r = ħ² / I.

Compute ħ²: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Divide by I =1.204e-46 kg m²:

ΔE_r = 1.112e-68 / 1.204e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.204) * 1e-22 J. 1.112/1.204 is about 0.924, so approximately 9.24e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference ΔE_v is h w. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J s. w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So ΔE_v =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two, ΔE_r ≈9.24e-23 J is much smaller than ΔE_v ≈2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 requires less energy than the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1. Therefore, the molecule would first undergo a rotational transition when absorbing a photon with momentum corresponding to ΔE_r.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next higher state in the energy sequence could be either a vibrational or rotational transition. Since ΔE_r is much smaller, the next state would be the rotational state, not the vibrational. So the photon energy should match ΔE_r.

But wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE_r. Let me double-check.

I think the rotational energy difference is between J=0 and J=1. So E_J=1 - E_J=0 = [1*(2) - 0*(1)] * (ħ²/(2I)) = 2*(ħ²/(2I)) )= ħ²/I.

So yes, that part is correct.

So the energy of the photon should be equal to ΔE_r. Now, the momentum of the photon is p = h/(λ), but I need to relate it to the energy. The energy of a photon is E = p c, where c is the speed of light. Wait, actually, E = h f = p c, since for photons, f = c / λ, so E = h c / λ, and p = h / (2π λ) = h f / c. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to relate the energy of the photon to its momentum.

Wait, for a photon, E = pc, since for photons, E = hf, and p = h f / c. So E = pc.

So if the energy of the photon is E_photon = ΔE_r, then p_photon = E_photon / c.

So let's compute p_photon = ΔE_r / c.

Given ΔE_r ≈9.24e-23 J, and c = 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.24e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.08e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are on the order of 1e-31. The options are A: 1.9e-28, B:2.3e-27, C:1.1e-27, D:1.4e-28. So 3e-31 is way smaller than any of these. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating I. Let me recalculate I.

I = μ R². μ is 20/11 amu. Wait, 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 +2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

So μ in kg is 1.81818 * 1.66e-27 kg. Let me compute that accurately.

1.81818 * 1.66 = let's compute:

1.81818 * 1.6 = 2.909088

1.81818 *0.06 = 0.1090908

So total is 3.0181788e-27 kg.

So μ =3.0181788e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.0181788e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.0181788e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2072715e-46 kg m².

So I=1.207e-46 kg m².

Then, ΔE_r = ħ²/(I).

Compute ħ: 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ΔE_r = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = (1.112 / 1.207) * 1e-22 J.

1.112 /1.207 is approximately 0.921.

So ΔE_r ≈9.21e-23 J.

So E_photon =9.21e-23 J.

Then, since E = pc, p = E/c =9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Still, that's 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N s, since 1 N s is kg m/s.

But looking at the options, the smallest option is D)1.4e-28 N s, which is much larger than my calculation. So why the discrepancy?

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. The question refers to the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor. Alternatively, perhaps the model implies that the molecule is treated as a harmonic oscillator plus a rigid rotor, but in the non-rigid case, the bond is allowed to stretch slightly, so the vibrational energy is considered.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the vibrational transition and not the rotational. Maybe the question is about the fundamental vibrational state, and the next state is the first overtone.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental vibrational state is v=0. The next state would be v=1, so a vibrational transition. But earlier, I thought the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational. But according to calculations, that's the case, but the calculated momentum is way smaller than any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be either a single quantum rotation (J=1) or a vibrational (v=1). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon energy would correspond to that, but the calculated momentum doesn't match any options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the energy levels in the non-rigid rotor model, which I'm not entirely clear on. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator, and the question is about the vibrational transition.

Wait, let me re-read the question. It says, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor model). So perhaps it's a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies, but the energy levels are treated as a product of the two. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational and rotational state, so v=0, J=0.

The next state with the lowest possible energy would be either J=1 or v=1, whichever requires less energy. But in my earlier calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy, but the photon momentum needed is much smaller than the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy difference instead. Let's recalculate that.

ΔE_v = h w =6.626e-34 J s *4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, E_photon =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = approximately 8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.83e-28 is between A and D, but closer to A.

Wait, but why would the photon momentum be 8.83e-28 N s? But according to my earlier analysis, the rotational transition is lower energy, but the photon energy there is so small that it's not among the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rotational energy. Let me recompute ΔE_r.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for rotational energy. The formula is E_J = (J (J + 1)) (ħ^2)/(2I). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is:

ΔE_r = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = [ (2) * (ħ²/(2I)) ] - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

Wait, that's what I did before. So perhaps I did the calculation correctly.

Wait, but let me compute the numerical value again.

I = μ R² = (20/11 amu ) * (2e-10 m)^2.

But wait, am I using the right formula for I? No, wait, I think I did this correctly earlier. I is μ R², with μ in kg, R in meters.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate I more accurately.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) *1.66e-27 kg.

20 *2 =40, 20+2=22; 40/22=20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1.81818 *1.66e-27 kg = let me compute that:

1.81818 *1.66 = ?

1.81818 *1 =1.81818

1.81818 *0.6 =1.090908

1.81818 *0.0 =0

Wait, 1.81818*(1.66)=1.81818*(1 +0.6 +0.06 )=1.81818 + 1.090908 + 0.1090908 = 3.0181788.

So μ=3.0181788e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² =3.0181788e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So I=3.0181788e-27 *4e-20 =12.072715e-47 kg m² =1.2072715e-46 kg m².

So I=1.2072715e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J² s².

ΔE_r = ħ² / I =1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = (1.112 /1.207) * 1e-22 J.

1.112 /1.207 ≈0.921, so ΔE_r≈9.21e-23 J.

So E_photon =9.21e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all much larger.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the vibrational energy instead.

ΔE_v = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 N s.

Looking back at the options:

A)1.9e-28

B)2.3e-27

C)1.1e-27

D)1.4e-28

So 8.83e-28 is between A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). Hmm, but none match.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm miscalculating ΔE_v. Let me recalculate h*w.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, that's correct. So E_photon=2.65e-19 J.

So p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.833e-28 kg m/s.

So approximately 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28, but it's about half of what I'm getting. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, and the question is about the vibrational transition. So the photon must provide the energy to move from v=0 to v=1, which is a ΔE of h w. So the momentum is E/c.

But why is my calculated momentum not matching any option? Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not in the model but in the computation. Let me compute E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 J s *4e14 s^-1 =2.6504e-19 J.

Then, p = E/c =2.6504e-19 / 3e8 =8.834666e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns. So looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28, but that's much smaller. None of the options match this. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the rotational energy. But earlier, the rotational transition's momentum is way smaller than the options. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the model considers the molecule as a rigid rotor, and the next state is the rotational transition. But earlier calculation shows p_photon=~3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition but I'm getting the wrong answer. Wait, but none of the options are close to 8.8e-28. Let me check the options again.

Option A:1.9e-28, D:1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is not in the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can change both vibrational and rotational states. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the transition that requires the least energy. Which would be the rotational, but the momentum is too small. So why are the options so much bigger?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Oh! Wait, perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized differently. Or perhaps the question is about a diatomic molecule's vibrational and rotational energy, but the transition is to a state where both v and J increase.

Wait, but the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, so v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be either J=1 or v=1. Since J=1 requires less energy, that's the transition. But the photon's momentum is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the simultaneous excitation of both vibrational and rotational states, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps the model is different.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy difference in terms of the vibrational frequency. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy levels are much closer, but according to my calculation, it's much smaller than the vibrational.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state, which is the first excited state overall, which could be a combination of vibrational and rotational. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Raman transition, which involves rotational changes, but Raman involves two photon processes. I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, let me think again. The options are all on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. My vibrational transition gives 8.8e-28 Ns, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but much larger than D. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me recheck.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) e ( -34 +14 ) =26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J.

That's correct.

p_photon = 2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.834666e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 N s.

But the options are A:1.9e-28, D:1.4e-28. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the moment of inertia incorrectly. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for I as the product of the two masses and R² divided by the sum, but no, that's what μ is. So I think I did it correctly.

Hmm, perhaps the question is in error, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is about the energy of the vibrational transition, but instead of h w, the energy is 3/2 h w? No, the vibrational energy difference from v=0 to v=1 is h w.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reduced mass. Wait, no, the reduced mass is correct.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is treating the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, and the energy difference is 3/2 h w? No, that's the ground state energy, the transition is h w.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the rotational-vibrational coupling, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the rotational state transition, but my calculation is wrong. Let me compute the rotational energy difference again.

Wait, let me calculate ħ²/(I) again.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

ħ²= (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

I=1.2072715e-46 kg m².

So ħ²/I = 1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 = approximately 9.21e-23 J.

So E_photon=9.21e-23 J.

p_photon=9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s=3.07e-31 Ns.

Which is way smaller than any option. So perhaps the correct transition is the vibrational one, but the answer is not among the options. That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Correct.

μ is (20 *2) / (20+2) amu. So 40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.66e-27 kg. So 1.818 *1.66e-27 kg= approx 3.018e-27 kg.

So I=3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2=4e-20 m².

So I=3.018e-27 *4e-20=1.207e-46 kg m². Correct.

So I think the calculation is correct. Thus, the photon's momentum for the rotational transition is 3.07e-31 Ns, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, but the calculation gives 8.83e-28 Ns, which is not an option either. So perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the energy difference. Let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (J (J+1)) (ħ²/(2I)).

So ΔE_r between J=0 and J=1 is [ (2) -0 ] * ħ²/(2I) )= 2 * ħ²/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula is E_J = [ J (J+1) ] * (ħ²/(2I)).

So the energy difference is (2)(ħ²/(2I)) - 0 = (ħ²)/(I). Correct.

So I think I did that correctly.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state (v=0, J=1), which is a rotational transition. But the required momentum is 3.07e-31, which is not an option. But perhaps the question is considering a different approach, such as the photon causing both a rotational and vibrational transition, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition to a higher vibrational state with a lower energy, but that doesn't make sense because vibrational states have higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground vibrational state to the first rotational state, but in my calculation, the energy required is about 9.2e-23 J, which leads to a momentum of 3e-31 Ns. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the calculation for the vibrational transition, and the options have a typo. But among the options, the largest is option B (2.3e-27), which is much larger than our 8.8e-28. So perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the angular momentum. The rotational transition involves a change in angular momentum. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the energy of a photon is related to its momentum by E = pc. So p = E/c.

In the vibrational case, E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of this. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of h*w.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses w in a different way. Wait, w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So h*w is correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The calculations don't align with any of the options. But perhaps I should choose the option closest to the vibrational transition's momentum, which would be option A, but it's about half the calculated value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the rotational energy, but the calculation gives an even smaller momentum, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me recheck.

ΔE_r = ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.207e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator:1.207e-46.

So 1.112e-68 /1.207e-46 = (1.112/1.207) *1e-22.

1.112/1.207≈0.921. So 9.21e-23 J.

So p_photon =9.21e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns. Still not matching any options.

Wait, maybe the question is about the photon's energy causing a transition that includes both rotational and vibrational changes. But the question says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the smallest energy change.

But if the rotational transition requires less energy, then the photon should have that energy. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, but the momentum is larger than any option. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation expects the use of the reduced mass but in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the harmonic oscillator's zero-point energy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the energy in terms of the bond length and angular frequency, but I don't see a direct formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when it causes the molecule to switch to the next state, which could be a transition that requires the least energy, which is the rotational transition. But the calculated momentum is 3e-31, which isn't an option.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possible formulas.

Wait, the momentum of a photon is p = h/(λ), and energy E = hc/λ. So p = E/(c).

So for the vibrational transition, E= h w, so p= h w /c.

Let me compute that:

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

So E=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match this. The closest is option A:1.9e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E. Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J. That's correct.

Hmm. Well, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm getting 8.8e-28, which is not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the rotational transition, but the momentum is too small.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the model. I think I've spent a lot of time on this, but perhaps I should proceed to choose the option that aligns with the vibrational transition, even though the numbers don't match.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the formula for the rotational energy in terms of the bond length and the angular frequency. But I don't think that's applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the moment of inertia as (Mx + My) R², instead of the reduced mass. Let me try that.

If I use I = (Mx + My) R², then:

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

Mx+My=22 amu.

22 amu =22 *1.66e-27 kg=3.652e-26 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

I =3.652e-26 kg * (2e-10)^2 =3.652e-26 *4e-20 =1.4608e-45 kg m².

Then, ΔE_r = ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 /1.4608e-45.

Compute numerator: 1.112e-68.

Denominator:1.4608e-45.

So 1.112e-68 / 1.4608e-45 ≈7.618e-24 J.

p_photon=7.618e-24 /3e8=2.539e-32 Ns. Still way smaller than the options.

So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mixing up rotational and vibrational transitions, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the photon's momentum as p = h/(λ), but λ is related to the energy.

Wait, but I think I've done that correctly.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the vibrational transition gives a photon momentum of approximately 8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't among the options. The rotational transition gives 3.07e-31 Ns, which is also not an option.

Looking back at the options, the only one close to 1e-28 is option A and D. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h*w.

Wait, another check:

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626*4) *1e-34+14 =26.504e-20 J.

Which is 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

p_photon=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.834666e-28 Ns.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but why is it only about half of what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition but uses a different value for h. For example, using h=6.62e-34 instead of 6.626.

Let me recalculate with h=6.62e-34.

h*w=6.62e-34 *4e14=2.648e-19 J.

p_photon=2.648e-19 /3e8=8.827e-28 Ns.

Still the same.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since none of the options match the calculated values, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the rotational transition and I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the rotational partition function or other factors, but I don't see how that applies.

Another possibility: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which could involve both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would require combining energies, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as the selection rules for rotational and vibrational transitions. For example, in vibrational transitions, the change in J is ±1, but that affects the selection rules, not the energy calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that's a higher energy and would require more energy, which isn't the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from v=0 to v=1, but in a way that includes a change in J, but that would require more energy.

I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I think the intended answer is the vibrational transition, which gives a momentum close to 8.8e-28 Ns, but since that's not an option, perhaps I should look for an error in the problem.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state of a diatomic is the state with the lowest vibrational and rotational energy. So v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy is either J=1 or v=1, whichever has lower energy.

In my calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy, but the photon momentum is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, and the options have a typo. But among the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the rotational energy is different. Wait, sometimes rotational energy is expressed in terms of the bond length and the moment of inertia, but I think I did it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the rotational constant B = ħ²/(2I c), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2I c), but I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

But I think I did the energy calculation correctly.

Another approach: perhaps the question expects the use of the harmonic oscillator's energy levels, where the energy levels are (n + 1/2) h w, and the transition is from n=0 to n=1, which is a change of h w. So the photon's energy is h w, which gives the momentum p = h w /c.

But that's what I did earlier, and it leads to 8.83e-28, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes, but that's beyond the scope of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different value for the angular frequency, but the given w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition to a higher vibrational state, but I don't think that's the case.

Given that, I think the correct approach is to choose the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition, even though the numbers don't match. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the rotational energy difference again, using exact numbers.

μ=20/11 amu = 1.81818 amu.

In kg, μ=1.81818 *1.660539e-27 kg = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

I=μ R²=3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m²=1.207e-46 kg m².

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

ΔE_r= (1.0545718e-34)^2 /1.207e-46.

(1.0545718e-34)^2 =1.112e-68.

1.112e-68 /1.207e-46 =9.21e-23 J.

p_photon=9.21e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, but the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the photon causing the molecule to go from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be (v=1, J=0), which would require a vibrational transition. Then, the photon's momentum is 8.83e-28 Ns, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition to (v=0, J=2), which would require more energy than J=1, but that's not the next state.

I think I've tried everything. The only thing left is to make an educated guess. Since the vibrational transition gives a momentum close to option A, but it's about half, perhaps the intended answer is A. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the rotational transition, but the calculation doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula p = h / (2π c) instead of p = E/c. Let me see.

E_photon = h w.

p = h w / (2π c) = (6.626e-34 *4e14) / (2 *3.1416 *3e8).

Compute numerator: 2.65e-19 J.

Denominator: 1.885e9.

p=2.65e-19 /1.885e9 ≈1.406e-27 Ns.

That's approximately 1.4e-27 Ns, which is option B.

Wait, but why would I use p = h w/(2π c) ?

Wait, no, that's not a standard formula. The standard formula is E = h f = pc, so p = E/c.

But perhaps the question is mistakenly using p = ħ w /c, since ħ = h/(2π).

So p = (h/(2π)) * w /c = h w / (2π c) = (6.626e-34 *4e14) / (2π *3e8).

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19.

2π *3e8 =6e8 *3.1416≈1.885e9.

So p=2.6504e-19 /1.885e9 ≈1.406e-27 Ns.

That's approximately 1.4e-27 Ns, which matches option B.

But why would the question use ħ instead of h? Because p = ħ k, where k is the wavevector. But E=ħ ω, so p = E/c = ħ ω/c.

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.

The momentum of a photon is given by p = E/c. For a photon, E = h f = ħ ω.

So p = ħ ω / c.

So if I compute p = ( ħ * w ) / c.

Let me compute that.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p = (1.0545718e-34 *4e14) /3e8.

Compute numerator: 4.218e-20.

Divide by 3e8: 4.218e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg m/s =1.406e-28 Ns.

That's approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

Ah, so perhaps the confusion was between using h and ħ. That's where the mistake was. So the correct calculation uses ħ instead of h.

So p_photon = ( ħ * w ) / c.

With ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So p_photon = (1.0545718e-34 *4e14) /3e8.

Compute numerator: 4.218e-20.

Divide by 3e8: 1.406e-28 Ns.

Which is option D:1.4e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- **Bond length**: \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- **Angular frequency**: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)
- **Reduced mass**: \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} \)
- \( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), so \( \mu = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)
- **Moment of inertia**: \( I = \mu R^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m}^2 \)
- **Reduced Planck's constant**: \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s} \)
- **Speed of light**: \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)

### Analysis:
1. **Rotational Energy Transition**:
   - The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_J = \frac{J(J+1) \hbar^2}{2I} \).
   - The energy difference between \( J=0 \) and \( J=1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_r = E_{J=1} - E_{J=0} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \Delta E_r = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The corresponding photon momentum is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_r}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \, \text{s}
     \]
   - This value is much smaller than any of the provided options.

2. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:
   - The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_v = (v + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega \).
   - The energy difference between \( v=0 \) and \( v=1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_v = h \omega
     \]
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     \Delta E_v = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The corresponding photon momentum is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_v}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \, \text{s}
     \]
   - This value is also not directly listed among the options.

3. **Revisiting the Formula**:
   - The momentum of a photon can also be expressed as \( p = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c} \).
   - Substituting values:
     \[
     p = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14})}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \, \text{s}
     \]
   - This matches **option D**.

### Conclusion:
The correct momentum of the photon required to transition the molecule is \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \, \text{s} \), corresponding to **option D**.

Answer: D
