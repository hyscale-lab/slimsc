Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to break it down.

Alright, the question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options give different relative speeds and energies, so I need to calculate both.

First, relative speed. Wait, in relativity, speeds don't just add up normally. Right, you can't just subtract them because that would give a speed greater than c, which isn't possible. So I remember there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity.

The formula for relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no wait, wait. Wait, wait, more accurately, if object A is moving at u relative to the rest frame, and object B is moving at v relative to the same rest frame, then from A's perspective, the speed of B is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, maybe I have that backwards. Or wait, perhaps I should think about it as adding velocities, but in this case, since both are in the same direction, maybe it's like u = 0.6c and v=0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut (mass 2m), how fast is the second moving?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the perspective of someone on Earth, A is faster than B. But what's the relative speed of B from A's frame? Or wait, the problem says "relative speed"—does it mean the speed of one as seen from the other? I think so.

So the correct formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the second object in the first's frame, or vice versa. Wait, let me get it right. Let me think: the speed of B as seen from A's frame.

In the Earth frame, A is moving at u = 0.6c, and B is moving at v = 0.5c. So in A's frame, what's B's speed? The formula is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, because for A, the Earth is moving at -0.6c. So in A's frame, the Earth is moving at speed -0.6c, and B's speed is v' = (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, let me recheck that. The formula for velocity addition in special relativity is:

If Earth sees A moving at u, and Earth sees B moving at v, then in A's frame, B's velocity is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think: if I'm in Earth's frame, and I see A moving at u (0.6c), and B moving at v (0.5c). So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Hmm. Alternatively, the formula for the relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, perhaps I should think that in the Earth frame, A is moving at u, and B is moving at v. So from A's perspective, Earth is moving at -u, so to find B's velocity from A's frame, I apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is: if you have two frames, S and S', where S' is moving at speed u relative to S. If an object has velocity v in S, then in S' it's v' = (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)).

So in this case, the Earth is S, and A's frame is S', moving at u = 0.6c relative to Earth. B is moving at v = 0.5c in Earth's frame. So in A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating that. Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Wait, negative, which makes sense because from A's perspective, B is moving slower in the same direction, so it's behind.

Denominator: 1 - (0.5 * 0.6) c² / c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction, but since the question asks for speed magnitude, it's approximately 0.143c, which is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, some have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Wait the options for v_rel are A)1.1c, B)0.1c, C)0.14c, D)0.14c. So either C or D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. So each astronaut has their own relativistic energy. So the total energy would be the sum of their energies.

The energy of each is gamma multiplied by m c squared. So for each, calculate gamma (Lorentz factor) and multiply by their mass, then sum.

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Energy2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². That's approximately 5.96 m c². So looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So option C has E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c. So option C is one of the choices.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy calculations.

Gamma1 for 0.6c: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/0.8=1.25. So 2m *1.25=2.5 m. Correct.

Gamma2 for 0.5c: sqrt(1-0.25) is sqrt(0.75)=approx 0.8660. So 1/0.8660≈1.1547. So 3m *1.1547≈3.464 m. So 2.5 +3.464=5.964. So about 5.96 mc². So option C is E=5.96 mc², v_rel=0.14c.

Looking back at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc², which matches our calculations.

Alternatively, looking at option D, which says E=5 mc². That would be if we added 2.5 and 2.5, but the second astronaut contributes more. So option D is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut),
- \( v = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut).

Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### First astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \),
- The total energy is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options:
- **Option A**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c \), \( E = mc^2 \) (incorrect).
- **Option B**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c \), \( E = 4.96m c^2 \) (incorrect).
- **Option C**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \) (correct).
- **Option D**: \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5m c^2 \) (incorrect).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
