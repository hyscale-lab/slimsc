Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I think this has something to do with blackbody radiation and the peak wavelength.

Wait, the peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's Law, right? Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

But wait, I should make sure. The problem says they found the same wavelength where they appear brightest, so yeah, that implies same T. So T1 = T2.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. The luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both are blackbodies, that applies. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

We know R1 is 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2. So let's compute the ratio L1/L2.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = ( (1.5 R2)² * T²⁴ ) / ( R2² T²⁴ ) because T1=T2.

Simplify that. The T terms cancel out because T1 and T2 are the same. So R1/R2 is 1.5, so R1 squared is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1/L2 = 2.25. But wait, that's only if the temperatures are the same. So the luminosity ratio would be 2.25.

But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So A is 2.25, which matches. But wait, the question says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star 1 and 2 respectively. How does that come into play?

Wait, radial velocity is about their motion. Oh, right! Because velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. But the problem states that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. But their intrinsic temperatures might be different because of Doppler shifting.

Wait, hold on! I think I made a mistake earlier. Because if the stars are moving towards or away from us, their emitted wavelengths are shifted. So the measured λ_max is the observed one. So the intrinsic (rest) wavelength would be different, but the observed is the same.

So, Wien's law for each star would be their intrinsic emission, and the observed λ_max is shifted due to their velocity.

Wait, but in the problem, the measured λ_max is the same. So perhaps each star's emission peak is at a different intrinsic wavelength, but due to their velocities, they appear at the same observed wavelength. So we can't assume T1 = T2. Instead, we have to consider the Doppler shift.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let me think again.

The peak wavelength emitted by each star is λ0 = b / T. The observed wavelength λ_obs is λ0 multiplied by the Doppler shift factor. The Doppler shift formula depends on the radial velocity. For a star moving away, λ_obs = λ0 * (1 + v/c), where v is the radial velocity (if v is positive away, negative towards). But wait, the velocity given for Star_2 is 700 km/s. Wait, who's moving? Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its λ_obs is λ0,1. Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s. But wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its λ_obs would be shorter, blueshifted. If moving away, longer, redshifted.

Wait, in the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

But Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ_obs,1 = λ0,1.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (so positive velocity). Then λ_obs,2 = λ0,2 * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is 700 km/s.

Wait, but wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. But it doesn't say which direction. Hmm. Oh, wait, I think the radial velocity is the component along the line of sight, but the sign depends on direction. But for Doppler shift, the formula is:

λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) if v is the recessional velocity (away from us), right? Or wait, the exact formula depends on whether it's moving towards or away. Let me think. The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs / λ_em = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), when the source is moving away. Wait, no, more accurately, if the source is moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength is longer, so λ_obs = λ_em * sqrt( (1 + v/(c)) / (1 - v/(c)) ). But maybe for non-relativistic speeds, which 700 km/s is (since c is about 3e5 km/s), so 700 is 0.00233c, so non-relativistic. So approximating, λ_obs ≈ λ_em (1 + v/c).

Wait, but if the star is moving towards us, the observed λ is shorter. So for Star_2, if its radial velocity is +700 km/s (assuming positive is away), then its λ_obs would be λ0,2 * (1 + 700/(3e5)). Let me compute 700/(3e5) = 700/(300000) ≈ 0.002333. So approximately 0.2333% increase.

Wait, but the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

But λ_obs,1 is λ0,1 (since v1=0). So λ0,1 = λ_obs,2.

And λ_obs,2 = λ0,2 * (1 + v2/c). So:

λ0,1 = λ0,2 * (1 + v2/c).

But λ0 is given by Wien's law: λ0 = b / T.

So (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c).

Simplify. The b's cancel, so 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that's because 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, because (1/T1) = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) / (1 + v2/c)^2? No. Let me rearrange.

Wait, 1/T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2 → T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the star is moving away, its emitted wavelength is stretched, but the observed wavelength is the same as another star's emitted wavelength. So the moving star must have a higher temperature, but because of the Doppler shift, the observed λ is the same.

But wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its emitted λ0 is shorter (higher T), but due to the movement, the observed λ0 is longer, matching that of Star_1 which isn't moving. Hmm. Let me think with numbers.

Suppose Star_1 is at rest, so its λ0 is λ1 = b / T1.

Star_2 is moving away, so it emits λ02 = b / T2. But due to its velocity, we observe λ02_obs = λ02 * (1 + v/c).

And this equals Star_1's λ01.

So λ01 = λ02 * (1 + v/c) → (b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c).

So 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v/c) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

Wait, so T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Since v is 700 km/s, and c is 3e5 km/s, v/c ≈ 0.002333.

So 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

Hmm, that's a small difference, but let's note it.

Now, the luminosity of each star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, so L is proportional to R² T^4.

So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

We need to find L1/L2.

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

And as per above, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So let's plug in.

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4) = ( (1.5 R2)^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 (T1 * (1 + v/c))^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= ( (2.25 R2²) T1^4 ) / ( R2² T1^4 (1 + v/c)^4 )

The R2² and T1^4 terms cancel out.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / (1 + v/c)^4.

Compute (1 + v/c)^4.

v = 700 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.002333... So 1 + v/c = 1.002333.

(1.002333)^4 ≈ ?

Hmm, calculating this. Let's see. Let me approximate.

Let me compute (1 + x)^4 where x is 0.002333.

Using the binomial expansion:

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4.

But x is small, so higher terms are negligible.

x = 0.002333 → x² ≈ 0.00000544, x³ ≈ 0.0000000125, x^4 ≈ 3e-11.

So 4x = 4 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.009333.

6x² ≈ 6*0.00000544 ≈ 0.00003264.

4x³ ≈ 4 * 0.0000000125 ≈ 5e-8.

x^4 is negligible.

So adding up: 0.009333 + 0.00003264 + 5e-8 ≈ approx 0.00936564.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 0.00936564 = 1.00936564.

So 1.00936564 ≈ 1.00937.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 divided by approximately 1.00937.

2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ ?

Well, 1.00937 is approx 1.00937 → let's compute 2.25 / 1.00937.

Let me think: 1.00937 * 2.23 = ?

Wait, 2.23 * 1.00937 ≈ 2.23 + (2.23 * 0.00937) → 2.23 + 0.0208 ≈ 2.2508.

Oh, wait, that's interesting. So 2.23 * 1.00937 ≈ 2.2508, which is just a bit over 2.25. So 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ 2.23.

Wait, that's because 1.00937 * 2.23 = 2.25.

Wait, let me check:

1.00937 * 2.23 ≈ 2.23 * (1 + 0.00937) → 2.23 + 2.23 * 0.00937.

2.23 * 0.00937 is approximately 0.02087.

So 2.23 + 0.02087 ≈ 2.25087.

Which is just a bit over 2.25.

So 2.23 * 1.00937 ≈ 2.25087.

So 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ approximately 2.23.

Wait, because 1.00937 *2.23 ≈ 2.25087 → which is almost 2.25. So 2.25 /1.00937 ≈ 2.23.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So the correct answer is D) ~2.23.

Wait, but that's considering the Doppler shift. If I had ignored the Doppler shift, I would have gotten 2.25 (option A). But because Star_2 is moving away, its temperature is a bit higher, which would make its luminosity higher than expected, but since it's moving away and we have the same observed wavelength, perhaps that affects the ratio.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not getting this reversed. If Star_2 is moving away, its emitted peak λ is shorter (higher T) than observed. But due to moving away, the observed λ is longer, same as Star_1's emitted λ. So Star_2's T is higher.

So T2 = T1 (1 + v/c).

So T2 is higher than T1. So when calculating L2, since L is proportional to R² T^4, and R2 is (2/3) R1, but T2 is higher.

Wait, let me recompute L1/L2 with R1=1.5 R2, T2= T1*(1 + v/c).

So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4 = 4π (R1/1.5)^2 σ (T1 * (1 + v/c))^4.

So L1/L2 = [ R1² T1^4 ] / [ (R1²/2.25) (T1^4 (1 + v/c)^4 ) ].

Wait, no, wait. Let's write L1 and L2 again.

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R2 = R1 / 1.5.

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

So,

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π (R1/1.5)^2 σ (T1 (1 + v/c))^4.

So L1/L2 = [ R1² T1^4 ] / [ (R1²/(1.5)^2) (T1^4 (1 + v/c)^4) ) ]

= [ R1² T1^4 * 1.5² ] / [ R1² T1^4 (1 + v/c)^4 ) ]

= ( (1.5)^2 ) / (1 + v/c)^4 )

Which is (2.25) / (1.00937) ≈ 2.23.

Yes, that's the same as before. So the ratio is approximately 2.23.

So the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) of the two stars, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity of a blackbody is proportional to \( R^2 T^4 \). The problem provides the following information:

1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
   - Mass: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \) (not directly relevant to luminosity)
   - Observed peak wavelengths: \( \lambda_{\text{obs},1} = \lambda_{\text{obs},2} \)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_{\text{rad},1} = 0 \), \( v_{\text{rad},2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The observed peak wavelength is the same for both stars, so their intrinsic temperatures are related by the Doppler shift. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)) and the relativistic Doppler shift formula, the intrinsic temperature of Star 2 is slightly higher:
     \[
     T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2 / c)
     \]
     where \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \). This gives:
     \[
     T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
     \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333 \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1.002333)^4}
   \]
   - \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \)
   - \( (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.00937 \) (using binomial expansion for small \( v/c \))
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx \frac{2.25}{1.00937} \approx 2.23
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   The luminosity of Star 1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star 2. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
