Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, they're looking at the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is.

Hmm. So, first, I need to figure out what determines the ratio of atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So, the ratio n1/n2 is higher when Teff is higher (6000 K) than when it's 5500 K. Because the ratio is decreasing when spots are present, which lowers the temperature.

Wait, let me think. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So if ΔE is E2 - E1, and if E2 > E1, then the exponent becomes negative when T increases. So when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 increases because the denominator (n2) decreases. Because n2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, making the denominator smaller. So for higher T, n1/n2 is larger.

So when the star has no spots, T_eff is 6000 K, so the ratio is higher. When it has spots, T_eff is lower (5500 K), so the ratio is lower. The question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes? So without spots, n1/n2 is higher than when it has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted divided by (n1/n2)_spotted.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the factor is the ratio when unspotted over spotted. So if the ratio is higher without spots, then the factor is greater than 1.

So, the formula is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

But since the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength, I can relate that to the energy difference. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms. So the energy ΔE is hc/λ.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, it's the energy difference over (k*T). So perhaps I can compute the ratio of the exponential terms for the two temperatures, 6000 K and 5500 K.

Because the g1/g2 term would be the same in both cases, as it's a ratio of the statistical weights, which are constants. So when taking the ratio of the ratios (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted, that would just be the ratio of the exponential terms, because the (g1/g2) terms cancel out.

So the ratio factor is [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ].

Which is exp( [ΔE/(k) ] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, more accurately:

(n1/n2)_unspotted = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_unspotted) )

(n1/n2)_spotted = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotted) )

So the ratio (unspotted / spotted) is [exp( -ΔE/(k T_unspotted) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotted) ) ]

Which is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_unspotted) + ΔE/(k T_spotted) ] )

Factor out ΔE/(k), so it's exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_unspotted) ) )

Alternatively, that's exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) )

Wait, I think I messed up a sign. Let me redo the algebra.

The ratio is [exp(a)] / [exp(b)] = exp( a - b ).

Here, a is (-ΔE/(k T_unspotted)), and b is (-ΔE/(k T_spotted)).

So a - b = (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_unspotted)).

Wait, no: a - b = (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Wait, T_unspotted is T1 = 6000 K, T_spotted is T2 =5500 K.

So 1/(T2) is larger than 1/(T1) because T2 < T1.

So 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) is positive.

So the exponent is positive. So the ratio is exp( positive ), which is >1, which makes sense because the ratio is higher when T is higher (unspotted case).

So I need to compute this exponent.

But first, compute ΔE. Since the transition is at λ=1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters. The energy is E = hc/λ.

Constants: h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J s

c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = approx 1.9878e-25 J m.

Wait, so hc is about 12400 eV * Å (since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, etc.), but perhaps using eV would be easier here.

Wait, alternatively, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So hc is 12400 eV * Å. So for λ = 1448 Å, E = (12400 eV Å) / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. Because visible light is around 1.5-3 eV. Wait, wait, 1448 Å is in the near UV perhaps? Because 1000 Å is 100 nm, which is UV. So 1448 is about 145 nm, which is in the vacuum UV range.

But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think: the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ.

But in terms of eV, 1 eV corresponds to about 1240 nm (12400 Å). So 1448 Å is about 1448 / 12400 ≈ 0.116 nm. So E = 12400 eV * Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV. Hmm, that seems high, but perhaps for UV it's correct.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can calculate the energy in terms of k*T.

Wait, because the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is (ΔE)/(k*T), which is dimensionless. So perhaps I can compute (ΔE)/(k*T) for both temperatures, then compute the ratio.

But I think it's easier to compute (ΔE)/(k*T) for each temperature and then plug into the exponent.

Alternatively, compute the ratio using the wavelength and the two temperatures.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, compute ΔE. Since λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

E = hc / λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J s,

c = 3e8 m/s,

so hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

E = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) J.

Calculate that:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Now, convert J to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.57 eV.

Hmm, so ΔE is approximately 8.57 eV.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the energy levels are such that the transition between them is at that wavelength. So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

So, ΔE = hc/(λ) = (12400 eV·Å)/1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV. So that's correct.

Now, the Boltzmann factor is (E2 - E1)/(k T) = (8.57 eV) / (k T), where k is Boltzmann's constant in eV/K.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So for each temperature, compute (ΔE)/(k T):

At T1 =6000 K:

(ΔE)/(k T1) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) ) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 6000 )

Calculate denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6000 = 0.517 eV.

So numerator is 8.57 eV.

So 8.57 / 0.517 ≈ 16.58.

Similarly, at T2=5500 K:

(ΔE)/(k T2) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5500 )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *5500 = approx 0.474 eV.

So 8.57/0.474 ≈ 18.09.

So the exponent in the ratio is (18.09 - 16.58) = 1.51.

Wait, wait. Let me go back to the ratio formula.

The ratio factor is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) )

Wait, substituting the values:

(ΔE)/(k) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 100,000 K * eV / eV? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, ΔE is in eV, k is in eV/K. So (ΔE/k) is in K.

Yes, because (eV) / (eV/K) ) = K.

So (ΔE/k) is 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 100,000 K.

Wait, 8.57 / 8.617e-5 is approximately 100,000? Let's compute it: 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 100,000. Let me compute that accurately: 8.57 / 0.00008617 = 8.57 * (1/0.00008617) ) ≈ 8.57 * 11603 ≈ around 99,700 ≈ 1e5 K.

So (ΔE/(k)) = approx 1e5 K.

Then, (1/T_spotted - 1/T_unspotted) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500 *6000) ) = 500/(33e6) ) = 5/(33e4) )= approx 1.515e-5.

Multiply these together: 1e5 K * 1.515e-5 1/K = 1.515.

So the exponent is 1.515.

So the ratio factor is exp(1.515) ≈ ?

Hmm, e^1.5 is about 4.48, e^1.6 is about 4.95, but 1.515 is about 1.515.

Wait, e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817. Let me compute:

e^1.5 = 4.4817.

e^0.015 is approx 1.0151.

So e^1.515 = e^1.5 * e^0.015 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0151 ≈ 4.55.

So the ratio factor is approximately 4.55.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which is very close. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the steps.

First, ΔE = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J s,

c=3e8 m/s.

λ=1448e-10 m.

So hc/λ = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Convert J to eV: divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 = approx 8.57 eV. That looks correct.

Then, (ΔE)/(k) where k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

8.57 / 8.617e-5 = let's compute 8.57 / 0.00008617.

Compute 8.57 / 0.00008617 = approximately 100,000 K.

Wait, 0.00008617 is 8.617e-5, and 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = approx 100,000. So (ΔE/k) is 1e5 K.

Then, 1/T_spotted (5500 K) is 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818 K^-1.

1/T_unspotted (6000 K) is 0.00016667 K^-1.

Difference: 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515 K^-1.

Multiply by (ΔE/k) = 1e5 K:

1e5 * 0.00001515 = 1.515.

So the exponent is 1.515.

e^1.515 is approximately, as I calculated earlier, around 4.55.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the ratios \((n_1/n_2)_{\text{unspotted}} / (n_1/n_2)_{\text{spotted}}\) simplifies to the ratio of the exponential terms, as \( g_1/g_2 \) cancels out:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{unspotted}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \(\lambda = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), we find:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \((\Delta E)/(k)\)
Boltzmann's constant is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 100,000 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the temperature term
The temperatures are \( T_{\text{unspotted}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spotted}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The term \((1/T_{\text{spotted}} - 1/T_{\text{unspotted}})\) is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the exponent
The exponent is:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{unspotted}}}\right) = (100,000)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.515.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\exp(1.515) \approx 4.55.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
