Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. So, R_star is the same as R_sun. But one hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. The question is about photometric observations—brightness variations over time because the star rotates, making the spots come into and out of view. These variations could mimic those caused by an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star.

So, the question is asking: what's the ratio R_planet/R_star that would cause the same signal in the light curve?

Hmm. I remember that the transit method for detecting exoplanets works by measuring the dip in brightness when a planet passes in front of the star. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. So, if the star has spots, the observed brightness variations are due to the spots rotating into and out of view. But how does that compare to a planet transit?

Wait, the key here is that when the star is unspotted, the same amplitude would be caused by a planet. So, the problem is about modeling the effect of those spots as causing a brightness variation similar to a planet, and then finding the planet size that would do the same.

So, I think the first step is to compute the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then compare that to the maximum effect a planet transit would have, which is when the planet blocks some of the star's light.

Let me break it down.

First, the star's total luminosity without spots: L0 = 4πR_star² σ Teff^4.

But when there are spots, the star's observed brightness changes. The spots are cooler, so when they're on the visible side, the star appears dimmer.

The spots cover a filling factor of 20% on one hemisphere. Wait, so the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So each hemisphere has 20% coverage. But because only one hemisphere is spotty, the total coverage is 20% of the hemisphere's area. But a sphere's surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². So 20% of a hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So, the entire spotted area is 0.4πR² (since the hemisphere is 2πR², 20% is 0.4πR²). Now, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. When the star is viewed face-on (like we see it), the brightness variation depends on how much of the spotted area is visible. 

Wait, but wait, the star is rotating, so the spots on the front hemisphere would rotate into view. If it's only one hemisphere that's spotty, then when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible, and when it's rotated away, we don't see them. So the maximum brightness variation would occur as the spots move into the line of sight.

But wait, the star is a sphere, and when you have a spot on the hemisphere, when it's facing us, the spot reduces the brightness. The brightness variation amplitude would be the difference between the maximum (unspotted hemisphere) and the minimum (when the spots are covering as much area as possible on the visible side).

So, the brightness variation due to the spots would be the difference between the normal flux and the flux when spots are covering a certain area.

Wait, but the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So when the star's rotation brings that hemisphere into view, the spots contribute less flux. Let's model the flux from the star when the spots are visible.

The flux from the star without any spots is L0/(4πD²), where D is the distance. But when spots are present, the flux is reduced by the area of the spots multiplied by their reduced flux.

Each spot has a temperature of Teff - 1000 K, which is 5000 K. The flux from a spot is sigma * T^4, so each spot's flux is sigma*(5000)^4, and the unspotted area's flux is sigma*(6000)^4.

The total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

Flux = (Area_unspotted * F_unspotted) + (Area_spotted * F_spotted)

So, the unspotted area is 80% of the hemisphere: 0.8 * 2πR² = 1.6 π R².

Wait, no. The hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So, the unspotted area is 2πR² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So, the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be:

F_visible = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000)^4.

Divide by 4π R² (the total surface area) to get the average flux per unit area? Wait, no. Wait, the total flux is the sum of the flux from all parts of the star's surface.

Wait, no, the star's total flux without spots is L0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are present on a part of the hemisphere, the total flux would be L0 * (1 - (F_spots / F_total)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the spots lower the total flux by a certain amount.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the fractional change in flux when the spots are present on the visible hemisphere.

The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = (0.4 /4) = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

But wait, each spot is cooler, so the flux from the spots is less than the average. The average flux from the star is F_avg = σ Teff^4.

Each spot's flux is σ (5000)^4, which is less than F_avg.

So the total flux when the spots are in view is:

F_total = (1 - 0.1) * F_avg + 0.1 * (F_avg * (5000/6000)^4 )

Wait, because 10% of the surface is spots, which have a lower flux.

So F_total = F_avg [ (0.9) + 0.1 * (5000/6000)^4 ]

Let me compute (5000/6000)^4. 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. Let's compute 0.8333^4.

0.8333^2 is about 0.6944. Then squared again, 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So F_total = F_avg [ 0.9 + 0.1 * 0.4823 ] = F_avg [0.9 + 0.04823] = F_avg * 0.94823.

So the flux when the spots are visible is 0.94823 times the normal flux.

Wait, but the star is only showing the spotted hemisphere when it's rotating. So when the star is such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 0.94823 F_avg.

When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_avg.

So the maximum variation in flux is from 0.94823 F_avg to F_avg.

Wait, no. Wait, when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view. So when the star is viewed such that the spots are on the near side (facing us), the flux is lower than when the spots are on the far side. So the flux goes down, then back up as the spots rotate away.

The amplitude of the brightness variation would be the difference between the maximum and minimum flux divided by the average.

Wait, but wait, when the spotted hemisphere is entirely visible, the flux is F_low = 0.94823 F_avg. When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_high = F_avg.

So the variation is (F_high - F_low) / F_avg.

Wait, no, because when the star is rotating, the flux changes as the spots come into and out of view. The maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

So the difference in flux is F_high - F_low = F_avg - 0.94823 F_avg = 0.05177 F_avg.

So the amplitude (delta F) is 0.05177 F_avg.

Wait, but wait, when the star is rotating, the spots only become visible when the spotted hemisphere is in our line of sight. So the maximum change would be when the entire spotted area is visible. So the flux drops to F_low, then when the star rotates and the unspotted hemisphere comes into view, it goes back to F_high.

So the amplitude is (F_high - F_low)/F_avg = (1 - 0.94823) = 0.05177, about 5.177% variation.

Now, the problem says that this situation (brightness variation due to spots) can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. We need to find the radius of the exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Wait, the planet would cause a dip in brightness when it transits the star. The amplitude of this dip is (Area_planet / Area_star) * (F_planet / F_star). But wait, the planet doesn't emit any light, so the dip is just the area blocked times the star's flux per unit area.

Wait, the planet blocks a part of the star's light, so the dip in flux is (Area_planet / Area_star) * F_star.

But F_star is the star's flux per unit area. So the dip is (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * F_star. But the amplitude is (dip) / F_star = (R_planet^2 / R_star^2).

Because F_star is the flux per unit area from the star. So the fractional dip is (R_p / R_*)^2.

Wait, but that's only when the entire planet is covering part of the star. So the dip is proportional to (R_p/R_*)^2.

So, the amplitude of the dip (delta F / F_avg) is (R_p / R_*)^2.

We want this to be equal to the amplitude caused by the spots, which we found to be approximately 0.05177 or 5.177%.

So,

(R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.05177

So R_p^2 = 0.05177 * R_*^2

Taking square roots,

R_p = sqrt(0.05177) * R_*

What's sqrt(0.05177)?

Well, sqrt(0.04) is 0.2, and sqrt(0.05177) is a bit higher.

Calculating sqrt(0.05177):

Let's see: 0.05177 ≈ 5.177e-2.

The square root is approximately 0.2275, because 0.2275^2 ≈ 0.05176.

So R_p ≈ 0.2275 R_*, which is about 0.23 R_*. But wait, looking at the options, the closest is option A: ~0.39, option D: ~0.32, etc. Wait, 0.23 isn't one of the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the earlier steps.

Wait, the problem says that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the flux when the spots are visible.

Wait, let me re-express the calculation.

Each spot's flux is σ T_spot^4, and the rest of the star is σ T_eff^4.

But when the star is viewed from Earth, only the front hemisphere is seen (since it's a sphere). When the front hemisphere has spots, the flux is:

Front hemisphere: area is 2 π R^2.

Spots: 20% of hemisphere is 0.2 * 2 π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

So, when the front hemisphere is spotted, the flux is:

Flux = (unspotted area of front) * σ T_eff^4 + (spotted area) * σ T_spot^4.

So unspotted area is 2 π R^2 * (1 - 0.2) = 1.6 π R^2.

So, flux from front is:

(1.6 π R^2) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R^2) * σ (5000)^4.

The back hemisphere is unspotted, so it contributes:

(2 π R^2) * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, no. Because when the front hemisphere is viewed, the back hemisphere is not visible. So when the front has spots, the flux is:

front_flux = (1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4) + (0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4 )

back_flux = (2 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 )

Total flux = front_flux + back_flux.

Wait, but that's for when the front is spotted. Alternatively, when the front is unspotted, the total flux is higher.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's total flux when the front is spotted:

front_flux = (1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4) + (0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4 )

back_flux = 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So total flux = front_flux + back_flux = [1.6 + 2] π R² σ (6000)^4 + [0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

= 3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

But the total flux when the front is unspotted is:

front_flux_unspotted = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

back_flux = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Total flux = front_flux_unspotted + back_flux = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Ah, so when the front is spotted, the total flux is:

3.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

The average flux without any spots is 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the flux when the front is spotted is:

Flux_spotted = σ [3.6 (6000)^4 + 0.4 (5000)^4 ] R².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio between the spotted and unspotted fluxes.

So, the unspotted flux is F_unspotted = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

The spotted flux is F_spotted = [ (1.6 * 6000^4) + (0.4 *5000^4) ) ] π R² σ + [2 π R² σ (6000^4)].

Wait, no, because the front is spotted, but the back is not. So when the front is spotted, the front's flux is 1.6 *6000^4 +0.4 *5000^4, and the back is 2 *6000^4. So total is 1.6 +2 =3.6 times 6000^4 plus 0.4 *5000^4.

Wait, but the unspotted flux is 4 *6000^4.

So, F_spotted = (3.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * (5000)^4 ) * π R² σ.

F_unspotted = 4 * (6000)^4 * π R² σ.

So the ratio is F_spotted / F_unspotted = [3.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)] / [4*(6000^4)].

Let me compute this. Let's factor out 6000^4 from numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 3.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4) = 6000^4 [ 3.6 + 0.4*(5000/6000)^4 ].

Denominator: 4 *6000^4.

So ratio = [3.6 + 0.4*(0.8333)^4 ] /4.

Compute (0.8333)^4: as before, approximately 0.4823.

So,

ratio = [3.6 + 0.4 * 0.4823 ] /4.

0.4 * 0.4823 = 0.1929.

So 3.6 + 0.1929 = 3.7929.

Divide by 4: 3.7929 /4 ≈ 0.9482.

So the ratio is approximately 0.9482. So when the front is spotted, the flux is about 94.82% of the unspotted flux.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_high - F_low)/F_avg, where F_high is F_unspotted (1.0) and F_low is F_spotted (0.9482).

So the amplitude is (1.0 - 0.9482) = 0.0518, or about 5.18% of the flux.

So this is the amplitude that the spots cause.

Now, the planet transit would cause an amplitude equal to (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Because the dip is (R_p^2 / R_*)^2 times the star's flux, so the fractional dip is (R_p^2 / R_*^2).

So, setting them equal:

(R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.0518.

So R_p = sqrt(0.0518) * R_*

Compute sqrt(0.0518): as before, it's approximately 0.2276.

So R_p ≈ 0.2276 R_*, which is about 0.23 R_*, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.23.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Hmm, none of these match 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculations. Let me think again.

When the spots are on the front hemisphere (which is 2 π R² area), 20% of that is covered. So spots cover 0.4 π R² area.

The rest of the front hemisphere (1.6 π R²) is unspotted.

The back hemisphere is all unspotted, so 2 π R².

So total flux when front is spotted: (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000^4) + (0.4 π R²) * σ (5000^4) + (2 π R²) * σ (6000^4).

Which adds up to (1.6 + 2) π R² * σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) = 3.6 π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4).

The total flux when front is unspotted would be 4 π R² σ (6000^4).

So, the ratio is:

[3.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(5000^4)] / [4*(6000^4)].

Which is [3.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4 ] /4.

Which again gives the same ~0.9482.

Hmm, so the flux variation amplitude is 5.18%.

So the planet would need to have (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.0518, so R_p ≈ 0.2276 R_*.

Which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made an error elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that when the star is only spotty on one hemisphere, the observed flux depends on the rotation. So when the star rotates, the fraction of the star's surface that is spotted in the observed hemisphere changes.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is different. Let's think about the brightness variation as the star rotates. When we see the entire unspotted hemisphere, flux is maximum. When the spotted hemisphere is turned so that we see it fully, flux is minimum.

But wait, the star is a sphere. So the visible area when a certain longitude is facing us is a circle. Hmm, no, I think I'm complicating this. Let me think another approach.

The star's brightness variation due to the spots would be periodic, varying as the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation is the same as the planet transit dip.

Wait, but perhaps the way I calculated the flux when the front is spotted is incorrect because when the star is rotating, the portion of the front hemisphere covered by spots that is visible to us changes. So perhaps I need to model the brightness as a function of the rotation angle.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the star's brightness variation when the spotted hemisphere is rotating into view. Let's imagine the star is rotating such that the spotted area is moving into the field of view. The brightness will vary sinusoidally as the spots come into view.

The maximum change in brightness would occur when the entire spotted area is visible (i.e., when the center of the spot is at the center of the star's disk). Wait, no, because the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star's rotation brings that hemisphere into view, the spots are on the limb, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the maximum area of spots is visible from Earth. Let me think about it more carefully.

Wait, when the star is viewed edge-on (as it would be for a planet transit), the maximum area of the star's surface that can be covered by a planet is when the planet is at the center of the star's disk. The same would apply to the spots: when the center of the spotted hemisphere is in our line of sight, the maximum area of spots is visible.

But in our case, the spots are only on one hemisphere. So, when the star is viewed face-on, the maximum area of spots visible is when the spot-covered hemisphere is facing us. Wait, but for a face-on view, the entire hemisphere is visible, so the spots would cover 20% of that hemisphere, which is 20% of 2 π R², so 0.4 π R².

Wait, but when the star is viewed edge-on, perhaps the amount of spots visible changes as the star rotates.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the maximum and minimum flux.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should instead think about the brightness variation when the star is observed from Earth. The star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, and the flux is lower. When the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, flux is higher.

Wait, but that would mean the flux varies between F_low and F_high, as per earlier calculations.

So the amplitude is (F_high - F_low)/F_high = (1 - 0.9482) = 0.0518, as before.

So the planet transit dip is (R_p^2 / R_*)^2.

Wait, no, the dip is (R_p^2 / R_*^2) because the dip is proportional to the area blocked.

So, dip is (R_p^2 / R_*^2).

So, setting this equal to 0.0518:

R_p^2 / R_*^2 = 0.0518 → R_p = sqrt(0.0518) R_* ≈ 0.2276 R_*.

Which is about 0.23 R_*, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me consider that only one hemisphere is spotty. So the total area of spots is 20% of one hemisphere.

Wait, but when the star is viewed from Earth, the area of the star's surface that is visible is a circle. The spots on the hemisphere would only be visible when the star's rotation brings them into view. So perhaps the maximum area of spots visible is when the center of the spot is at the center of the star's disk.

Wait, but the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into view, and the amount of flux blocked is when the maximum area of spots is visible.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should consider that the spots are on a single hemisphere, so the maximum area of the star's surface covered by spots that is visible is 20% of a hemisphere.

Wait, but a hemisphere's area is 2 π R². 20% of that is 0.4 π R².

But the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth is π R_*^2.

Wait, so the area of the star's disk is π R_*^2, and the area of the spots is 0.4 π R_*^2.

Wait, no, because R is the same as R_*, so 0.4 π R^2.

Wait, but the maximum area of spots that can be visible from Earth is 0.4 π R^2, but the total area of the star is 4 π R^2. So the fraction of the star's area covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1 or 10%.

Wait, but when the spots are on the hemisphere that's facing us, the area of the spots visible is 0.4 π R².

So the dip in flux would be (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) * (F_spot - F_unspotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, but that's a different approach. Let's think of the variation as the fraction of the star's surface that is covered by spots times the difference in flux per unit area.

So, when the spots are visible, the flux from those areas is lower. So the total flux is:

Flux = (1 - f) * F_unspotted + f * F_spotted,

where f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

In this case, when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing Earth, f = 0.1 (10% of the star's surface is covered by spots).

So,

Flux_spotted = (1 - 0.1) * F_unspotted + 0.1 * F_spotted.

F_spotted = F_unspotted * (T_spot / T_eff)^4 = F_unspotted * (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.4823 F_unspotted.

So,

Flux_spotted = 0.9 * F_unspotted + 0.1 * 0.4823 F_unspotted = F_unspotted * (0.9 + 0.04823) = 0.94823 F_unspotted.

So, the amplitude is (F_unspotted - F_spotted)/F_unspotted = 1 - 0.94823 = 0.05177, same as before.

So, the dip is 5.177%, which is the same as the planet's dip.

So, the planet's dip is (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p = sqrt(0.05177) R_* ≈ 0.2276 R_*.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots to be on both hemispheres, or perhaps I miscalculated the area.

Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So only one hemisphere has spots, and each spot is 20% coverage.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the total area of spots being 20% of the star's surface. Because a hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface area. So 20% of a hemisphere is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the star's total surface.

Wait, but earlier I considered it as 10% of the star's surface. So, when the spots are on the front, the f is 0.1.

Wait, but in that case, the amplitude is (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_*, which is about 0.23, but not matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39^2=0.152 → 15% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.0049 → 0.49% dip.

C) ~0.11 → 0.0121 → 1.21% dip.

D) ~0.32 → 0.1024 → 10.24% dip.

Wait, but our calculation for the spot's dip is about 5.18% → 0.0518 dip. None of the options match that.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the spots' contribution. Because when the spots are on the limb of the star, their area as seen from Earth is smaller because of the limb effect.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the maximum area of the spots that can be seen when the star is viewed edge-on or face-on.

Wait, another approach: the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to a planet transit, but the planet would cause a dip of (R_p / R_*)^2.

The spots, on the other hand, cause a brightness change of (F_unspotted - F_spotted) when the spots are on the visible hemisphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation in brightness is due to the difference between the unspotted and spotted surface areas.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as the product of the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

The change in flux when the spots are visible is:

delta_F = area_spots * (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Because when the spots are visible, the flux is less by delta_F.

So,

delta_F = (area_spots / area_star) * (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

area_spots = 0.2 * (area_hemisphere) = 0.2 * 2 π R^2 = 0.4 π R^2.

area_star = 4 π R^2.

So,

delta_F = (0.4 π R^2 / 4 π R^2) * ( (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) / 6000^4 )

Simplify:

= (0.1) * ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 )

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4 ) = 6000^4 (1 - (5/6)^4 )

= 6000^4 * (1 - 0.482253) ≈ 6000^4 * 0.517747.

So,

delta_F = 0.1 * (0.517747 * 6000^4 ) / 6000^4.

The 6000^4 terms cancel.

delta_F = 0.1 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.05177.

So delta_F is 5.177% of F_unspotted.

So this matches the earlier calculation.

So, the planet's dip would need to produce the same delta_F, which is (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_*.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the star's spots are not causing a dip but a rise in brightness elsewhere. Or perhaps I should consider that when the spots rotate into view, the observed brightness decreases, and when they rotate away, it increases.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude is twice the dip, like the peak-to-peak variation.

No, the amplitude is usually the peak-to-peak divided by two, but in our case, it's the maximum variation from the average.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as the difference between when the spots are on the far side and when they're on the near side.

Wait, when the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_low = 0.9482 F_high.

The average flux would be (F_high + F_low)/2 = (1 + 0.9482)/2 * F_high ≈ 0.9741 F_high.

The amplitude is (F_high - F_low)/2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The amplitude is (F_high - F_low)/ (F_high + F_low). Or perhaps it's (F_high - F_low) divided by the average flux.

Wait, let's think in terms of relative brightness.

The average brightness without any spots would be F_high. When the spots are visible, brightness is F_low. So the change is F_high - F_low. The amplitude is (F_high - F_low)/F_high = 5.18%.

So, that part is correct.

So, the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_*)^2, which is 0.0518.

So, R_p = R_* * sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.227 R_*, which is ~0.23 R_*, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area calculation. Let me re-examine.

The problem says one hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%. So each hemisphere (front and back) is either spotty or not.

Wait, no, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So only one hemisphere is spotty, and the other is unspotted.

So, when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view. The area of the star's surface covered by spots is 20% of that hemisphere.

But when the star is viewed from Earth, the spotty hemisphere is partially visible depending on the rotational phase.

Wait, perhaps I should model the situation as the star has a single spot group covering 20% of a single hemisphere. So the maximum area of spots visible is when the spot is at the center of the disk.

Wait, but the star's radius is R, so the area of the star's disk is π R^2. The spotty hemisphere's area is 2 π R^2. So 20% of that is 0.4 π R^2.

Wait, but the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth is π R^2. So the maximum area of spots that can be seen is 0.4 π R^2 when the spot is centered. But when the spot is on the limb, only a fraction is visible.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum area of spots that can be observed is the same as the area when the spot is centered, which is 0.4 π R^2.

Wait, but the area of the star's disk is π R^2, so the maximum fraction of the star's area covered by spots is (0.4 π R^2) / (π R^2) ) = 0.4 or 40%.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the spot is only on one hemisphere, and when the star is viewed face-on, the area of the spot that's visible from Earth is 0.4 π R^2, but the star's disk is π R^2. So the maximum fraction is 0.4 π R² / π R² = 0.4, i.e., 40% of the star's area is covered by spots when viewed face-on.

But that seems too high, which would imply a larger dip.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Let me think of the star as having a single spot covering 20% of one hemisphere. The hemisphere's area is 2 π R², so the spot area is 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

When the star is viewed face-on (so the entire hemisphere is visible), the spot area is 0.4 π R², which is 0.4 π R² / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1 or 10% of the star's total surface area.

So, when the star is viewed face-on, the flux is F_low = F_unspotted * (1 - 0.1) + F_spotted * 0.1.

Which is F_low = F_unspotted * (0.9 + 0.1 * (5000/6000)^4 ).

Which, as before, is F_low = 0.94823 F_unspotted.

So the amplitude is 5.177%.

So, the planet's dip is (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_*, but this is not one of the options. So perhaps the question is looking for something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the star's flux calculation. Because when the star is viewed from Earth, the area of the spotted hemisphere that is visible depends on the rotational phase. So the brightness variation is a function of the rotational phase.

But perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the maximum area of spots is visible, which would be when the center of the spot is at the center of the star's disk.

Wait, but the maximum area would be 0.4 π R², but the area of the star's disk is π R². So the maximum fraction is 0.4, which would imply a dip of (0.4) * (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, no, because the dip is the area of the spots (0.4 π R²) times the difference in flux per unit area, divided by the total flux.

So,

dip = (0.4 π R²) * (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

But F_unspotted is σ (6000)^4, and F_spotted is σ (5000)^4.

So,

dip = (0.4 π R²) * ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) σ ) / (4 π R² σ (6000)^4 )

Simplify:

dip = (0.4 /4) * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4.

Which is 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.1 * (1 - 0.48225) ≈ 0.1 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.051775.

So dip is 5.1775% of F_unspotted.

So again, the same result.

So, the planet's dip would be (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p ≈ sqrt(0.051775) R_* ≈ 0.2276 R_*, which is ~0.23 R_*, but no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the exoplanet's signal is the same as the spot-induced variation, but when the star is not spotted. So perhaps the question is considering a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the star's entire surface when the spots are on the far side, leading to a different calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total flux change when the spots rotate into view.

Wait, when the star is viewed face-on, the flux is F_high = F_unspotted.

When the star is viewed edge-on, the flux is F_low = F_unspotted * (1 - 0.1) + F_spotted * 0.1.

Wait, but in reality, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star is viewed edge-on, you don't see any spots because the hemisphere is on the far side.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again.

When the star is viewed edge-on, you can only see the equator. The two hemispheres are each 50% of the star's surface. So, when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, the visible hemisphere is unspotted. So the flux is F_unspotted.

When the star rotates 90 degrees, the spotty hemisphere is on the near side. So the flux is F_low.

So the brightness variation is between F_high (unspotted) and F_low (spotted), so the amplitude is (F_high - F_low)/F_high = 5.177%.

So again, same result.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the planet's transit would cause a dip when it moves in front, but the star's brightness variation is a continuous change as the spots come into view. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the same as the planet's dip.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the maximum dip as (R_p/R_*)^2, not the average.

So, the maximum dip would be (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p = 0.2276 R_*, which is ~0.23 R_*, but no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the radius of the planet expressed as a percentage of the star's radius, but the options are not in percentages. Let me see the options again.

Options:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

So, 0.23 is not listed. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, but the planet would produce a larger variation because it blocks more light. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the relative change in brightness as the product of the spot's area and the temperature difference.

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation caused by the spots is the same as the planet's effect. So the planet's effect is (R_p / R_*)^2.

The spots' effect is (f) * ( (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) / T_eff^4 ), where f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

Wait, but f would be 0.2 (20%) of one hemisphere, which is 0.1 of the star's surface.

So,

delta_F = f * (T_spot^4 - T_eff^4 ) / T_eff^4.

Which is 0.1 * (5000^4 -6000^4)/6000^4.

= 0.1 * ( (5/6)^4 - 1 )

= 0.1 * (0.48225 -1) = 0.1 * (-0.51775) = -0.051775.

But the magnitude is 0.051775, so the dip is 5.1775%.

So again, same result.

So the planet's dip would be (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p ≈ 0.2276 R_*, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's radius is not R_sun, but perhaps R_sun is given as the star's radius, but the planet's radius is a fraction of that. So, perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the spots are cooler, so when they are not visible (e.g., on the far side), the star appears brighter, and when they are visible, it's dimmer. So the maximum and minimum brightness would cause a variation of 2 * delta_F.

Wait, no, because delta_F is the difference between max and min. The amplitude is (max - min)/(max + min) or similar.

Wait, perhaps the amplitude is the peak-to-peak variation divided by twice the average.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total variation in brightness.

Wait, when the star is viewed such that the spots are on the near side, the flux is F_low = F_unspotted * 0.94823.

When the spots are on the far side, the flux is F_high = F_unspotted.

So the variation is F_high - F_low = F_unspotted * (1 - 0.94823) = F_unspotted * 0.05177.

So the amplitude is 5.177% of F_unspotted.

The planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_*)^2, which is 5.177% → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_*.

But no option matches. So perhaps the problem is looking for the planet's radius in terms of the star's radius, but in the opposite way.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the radius of the planet that would produce the same amplitude as the spot-induced variation. So, the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_*, but this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the planet's radius relative to the star's radius, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the spot's area.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when the star is viewed edge-on, the spot's area is not fully visible, thus the dip is less than the maximum.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip occurs when the spot is centered, and the area of the spot that is visible is the entire area of the spot. So, the area of the spot is 0.4 π R^2.

The area of the star's disk is π R^2. So the maximum fraction of the star's area covered by the spot is (0.4 π R^2) / (π R^2) ) = 0.4.

Wait, that can't be right because the spot is on one hemisphere. So when the spot is centered, the entire spot is visible. So, the area is 0.4 π R^2, which is 40% of the star's disk.

Wait, that would make the dip (0.4) * (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Which would be 0.4 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.4 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.2071.

So dip would be ~20.7%, which would require the planet to have (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.2071 → R_p ≈ 0.455 R_*, which is close to option A) ~0.39.

But that seems contradictory because when the spot is on one hemisphere, the maximum area visible would be 0.4 π R^2, which is 40% of the star's disk.

Wait, no, wait. Because the star's disk area is π R^2. So 0.4 π R² is 40% of the star's area. So when the spot is centered, the entire spot is visible, leading to a dip of 0.4 * (1 - (5/6)^4) ≈ 0.4 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.2071, which is ~20.7% dip.

So then the planet's dip would be (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.2071 → R_p ≈ 0.455 R_*.

Which is close to option A) 0.39.

But that would be a much larger dip than I calculated earlier.

Wait, but that would mean the problem is considering that the maximum dip is when the entire spot is visible, which only happens when the star is viewed edge-on.

Wait, but the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun. So, R_star = R_sun.

Hmm, perhaps the initial calculation was incorrect because I considered the spots to cover 10% of the star's surface, but in reality, the spot covers 20% of one hemisphere, which is 10% of the star's total surface. But when the star is viewed such that the spot is centered, the entire 10% is visible, leading to a dip of 10% * 0.51775 ≈ 5.1775%, same as before.

I think I'm going in circles here. Given that none of the options match my calculation, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the planet's radius relative to the star's radius in a way that the total brightness variation is the same as the spot's variation. So, the amplitude of the planet's transit is (R_p^2 / R_*)^2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation due to the spots as the same as a planet's transit, but the planet's size would be the square root of the amplitude.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation due to spots is being compared to the planet's transit, but the star's spots have a temperature difference, so the flux from the spots is less than the surrounding.

But perhaps I should model the brightness change as the difference between the unspotted star and the spotted star. The spotted star has a lower flux because part of its surface is cooler.

The change in flux would be the area of the spots times (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) over the total flux.

So,

delta_F = (area_spots / area_star) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) / T_star^4.

Which is,

delta_F = (0.1) * (5000^4 -6000^4)/6000^4.

= 0.1 * ( (5000/6000)^4 - 1 )

= 0.1 * (0.48225 -1) ≈ 0.1 * (-0.51775) = -0.051775.

So the dip is 5.1775% of the star's flux.

So, the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_*, which isn't an option.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but given the options, the closest is not present. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the math.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the star's radius to be the same as Jupiter, but no, the star's radius is given as equal to the Sun.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio correctly.

Wait, (0.2276) is approximately 0.23, but none of the options are close. The options are 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, 0.39.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the radius of the planet relative to the host star's radius, but perhaps I should compute it as a percentage. 0.23 is 23% of the star's radius. But options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake, but I can't do anything about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the spot's area. Let me think: each hemisphere has 20% coverage, so each spot is 20% of that hemisphere's area. But perhaps the problem is considering that the entire star's surface has a 20% coverage of spots, not just one hemisphere.

If that's the case, then the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * 4 π R² = 0.8 π R².

So,

delta_F = (0.8 π R² /4 π R² ) * ( (5000^4 -6000^4)/6000^4 )

= 0.2 * (0.48225 -1) = 0.2 * (-0.51775) = -0.10355.

So dip is 10.355%, which would require planet's radius to be sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322 R_*, which is approximately option D) ~0.32.

Ah, that makes sense. So perhaps the problem is stating that the entire star has a 20% spot coverage, not just one hemisphere. But the question says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%."

So the correct calculation would be 10% coverage, leading to a dip of 5.177%, requiring planet R_p ≈0.227 R_*. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, but when the star rotates, the spots on that hemisphere can cover up to 20% of the star's disk when viewed from Earth. So the area of the spots as seen from Earth is 20% of the star's disk. So,

delta_F = 0.2 * ( (5000/6000)^4 -1 ) → 0.2 * (0.48225 -1 )= 0.2*(-0.51775)= -0.10355 → 10.355% dip.

Which would require R_p = sqrt(0.10355) R_* ≈ 0.322 R_*, which is option D) ~0.32.

So perhaps the problem intended that the spots cover 20% of the star's disk, not just one hemisphere. In that case, the correct answer would be option D.

But the problem explicitly states that only one hemisphere is spotty, with a filling factor of 20%. So the correct approach would be the first one, leading to no matching option. But since the options don't have 0.23, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate the fractional area covered by the planet as (R_p / R_*)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p = sqrt(0.05177) R_* ≈ 0.227 R_*, but perhaps the problem expects the planet's radius in Jupiter radii, but the star's radius is solar, which is much larger than Jupiter. But that doesn't help because the options are in fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption, and the correct answer is option C) ~0.11.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the planet's radius relative to the star's radius, but the calculation gives 0.227, which is closest to option A) 0.39 or D) 0.32. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation caused by the spots as the same as the planet's transit, but the planet's radius is such that when it transits, it blocks the same amount of flux as the spots.

But in that case, the calculation leads to R_p ≈ 0.227 R_*, which isn't an option.

Given the options, the closest to 0.23 is not present, but perhaps option C) 0.11 is the intended answer, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem as:

The amplitude of the brightness variation due to spots is the same as that caused by a planet. So, the planet's radius would need to be such that (R_p/R_*)^2 = (fraction of flux change due to spots).

As calculated, the flux change is 5.177%, so (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_*, but this is not an option.

Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the star's radius to be the same as Jupiter, but that's not stated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the spot's area is 10% of the star's surface. Let me recalculate.

If the problem states that one hemisphere is covered by spots with a filling factor of 20%, the area of the star's surface covered by spots is 20% of a hemisphere.

Hemisphere area = 2 π R².

Spot area = 0.2 * 2 π R² = 0.4 π R².

Total star area = 4 π R².

So, spot coverage = 0.4 π R² /4 π R² = 0.1 or 10%.

So, the flux change is 0.1 * (5000^4 -6000^4 ) /6000^4 → 0.1 * (0.48225 -1 )= 0.1 * (-0.51775) = -0.051775.

So, the dip is 5.1775%.

So, planet's dip: (R_p/R_*)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p ≈ 0.227 R_*, but no option matches.

Thus, perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I can't see how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats the spots as covering 20% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 0.2*( (5000/6000)^4 -1 )= 0.2*(-0.51775)= -0.10355 → 10.355% dip. So R_p = sqrt(0.10355)= ~0.322 R_*, which is option D) ~0.32.

But the problem clearly states one hemisphere, so I think this is incorrect.

In conclusion, despite the confusion, the correct calculation leads to R_p ≈0.227 R_*, but this isn't an option. Perhaps the intended answer is option C) ~0.11, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude in a star's light curve as the star's dark spots. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler by 1000 K (5000 K). The goal is to find the exoplanet's radius relative to the star's radius, \( R_p / R_* \), that would mimic the observed brightness variation caused by the spots.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Star's Luminosity Without Spots**:  
   The star's total luminosity without spots is given by \( L_0 = 4 \pi R_*^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).

2. **Flux Variation Due to Spots**:  
   The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, which corresponds to 10% of the star's total surface area. The flux from the spots is reduced because their temperature is 5000 K. The total flux when the spots are visible is calculated as:
   \[
   F_{\text{spotted}} = F_{\text{unspotted}} \cdot \left( 0.9 + 0.1 \cdot \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right).
   \]
   The term \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \) is approximately 0.4823, so:
   \[
   F_{\text{spotted}} \approx F_{\text{unspotted}} \cdot 0.94823.
   \]
   The amplitude of the brightness variation is:
   \[
   \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}} = F_{\text{unspotted}} \cdot (1 - 0.94823) = F_{\text{unspotted}} \cdot 0.05177.
   \]

3. **Exoplanet's Brightness Variation**:  
   The brightness dip caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
   \[
   \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_p}{R_*} \right)^2 \cdot F_{\text{unspotted}}.
   \]
   Setting \( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \Delta F \), we solve for \( R_p / R_* \):
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_p}{R_*} \right)^2 = 0.05177 \implies \frac{R_p}{R_*} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.2276.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated value \( R_p / R_* \approx 0.2276 \) does not match any of the provided options:
   - A) ~0.39  
   - B) ~0.07  
   - C) ~0.11  
   - D) ~0.32  

   However, if the problem assumes the spots cover 20% of the star's total surface area (instead of one hemisphere), the flux variation would double, leading to a dip of approximately 10.355%. This would require:
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_p}{R_*} \right)^2 = 0.10355 \implies \frac{R_p}{R_*} \approx \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322,
   \]
   which is close to option D (~0.32). This interpretation aligns with the given options, suggesting the problem may implicitly assume the spots cover the entire star.

### Conclusion:
Given the ambiguity in the problem's interpretation and the mismatch between the calculated value and the options, the most reasonable choice based on the provided options is **D) ~0.32**, assuming the spots cover the entire star rather than just one hemisphere.

Answer: D
