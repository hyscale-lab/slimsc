Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let's try to think this through.

The question says we have 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to form water and a salt. But wait, I need to find the enthalpy change, right? Enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. I think the standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this might be a bit different because there are multiple acids here.

Wait, but maybe I should find the moles of H+ and OH- ions first. Because the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole of that releases about 57 kJ. But wait, actually, each mole might release a specific amount, but maybe I'm supposed to find the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reagent.

Let me list out the steps I should take:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from each acid solution.
2. Calculate moles of OH- from the base solution.
3. Find the total moles of H+ and OH- available.
4. Determine which is the limiting reactant (since H+ and OH- will neutralize each other).
5. Calculate the enthalpy change based on the moles of H2O formed, using the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? So it dissociates completely. HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid as well.

Let's break it down.

First, HCl is a monoprotic acid. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

H2SO4 is diprotic. So each mole gives 2 H+ ions. But wait, does it fully dissociate? Yes, because it's a strong acid. So 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 mol.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH- because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so total OH- is 0.2 mol.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each H+ needs one OH-.

Total H+ is 0.28 mol, total OH- is 0.2 mol. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. Because 0.2 mol of OH- can neutralize 0.2 mol of H+. The remaining H+ would be 0.08 mol. But wait, wait. No, wait: H+ is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So OH- is less, so all OH- will react, and H+ will have 0.08 left.

But wait, wait. Wait, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of OH- uses one mole of H+. So, total OH- is 0.2 mol. So H+ consumed is 0.2 mol, leaving 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

But wait, does that matter for the enthalpy? Because only the amount that reacts contributes to the heat released.

So the moles of H2O formed is 0.2 mol. Because each OH- reacts with one H+.

Wait, but wait another thing. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So in a neutralization reaction with a base, each H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. But when reacting with a base, it would neutralize two OH- ions? Or does it just need one per H+?

Wait, no. Each H+ from H2SO4 (whether first or second) will react with one OH-.

So in our case, the total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28. The OH- is 0.2.

So all 0.2 OH- will react, using up 0.2 H+.

So the moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization per mole is typically about -57 kJ/mol, but wait, wait. I think the standard enthalpy for strong acid and strong base is around -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed.

Wait, but let me double-check. For example, when 1 mole of H+ reacts with 1 mole of OH- to form 1 mole of H2O, the enthalpy change is approximately -57 kJ. So in this case, 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, wait: the options are in kcal and kJ. Oh, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.73 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726). Hmm.

But wait, the options have A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, so if I calculate 0.2 moles * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ, which is about -11.4 kJ. But in the options, B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, no, option B is in kcal? Or is it D?

Wait, no, option D is -16.0 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is close to option D, but it's 16.0. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I should calculate moles of H+ and OH- correctly.

Wait, HCl is 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So, H+ is 0.28 vs OH- 0.2. So OH- is limiting, so 0.2 moles H2O formed.

At 57 kJ/mol, 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ (exothermic).

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, and option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but wait, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.726 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which would be about 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have both kcal and kJ. So perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ, but the options have B in kcal and D in kJ.

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization. The standard value is in kJ, but the options have B as -11.42 kcal. Let me compute 11.4 kJ in kcal.

1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ /4.184 ≈ 2.726 kcal. So the enthalpy change is approximately -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. But wait, why is the answer 0.2 moles times 57 kJ? Because each mole of H2O gives off 57 kJ.

Wait, but wait another thing: when you have multiple acids, do you have to consider the stoichiometry correctly? For example, is the overall reaction something else?

Wait, perhaps I should write the overall reaction.

HCl is H+ Cl-.

H2SO4 is 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So when mixed, the reaction would be H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) + OH- → H2O.

But another way to write it is: H+ (aq) + OH^- (aq) → H2O(l), ΔH = -57 kJ/mol.

So each mole of H+ and OH- reacting gives off 57 kJ.

So, when you have 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but in the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is more than 11.4.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^- → 0.2 moles OH^-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH^- is 0.2.

So moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

Thus, 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the delta H is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options:

Option D is -16.0 kJ → no, higher.

Option B is -11.42 kcal → which is about -11.42 kcal → but that's way larger than 11.4 kJ.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.726 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches 11.4 kJ.

But wait, why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be about 48 kJ (11.42 *4.184 ≈ 48 kJ) which is way more than our calculation.

So the correct answer should be option A if the answer is in kcal, or option D if it's in kJ, but wait, none of the options match exactly.

Wait, maybe I should think about the units again. The question doesn't specify units, but the options have both. Hmm.

Wait, but the standard enthalpy is given in kJ in many textbooks. So 11.4 kJ is the change, but looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Hmm.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the moles?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is diprotic but in the reaction, each mole of H2SO4 can donate two H+.

Wait, but in this case, I think I calculated that correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction isn't just per mole of H+ but per mole of acid or base. Or perhaps I should compute the total H+ and OH- and see.

Wait, maybe I should think about the neutralization in terms of equivalents.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 equivalents H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M = 0.09 mol → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 equivalents.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M = 0.1 mol → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 equivalents.

So, equivalents of H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Equivalents of OH- = 0.2.

So, the limiting is OH- → 0.2 equivalents.

So, moles of H2O formed is 0.2.

Thus, 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy is different. Maybe it's -57 kJ per mole of reaction as written, which is per mole of H+.

Wait, so 0.2 moles would be 11.4 kJ. So the change is -11.4 kJ.

So, looking at the options, which one is closest?

Option D is -16.0 kJ → no.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the dilution effect, but no, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is just the heat from the reaction, not the solution's heat capacity changes.

Hmm. I think I must have made a mistake, but I can't see where. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, maybe only the first H+ ionizes completely, and the second is a weak acid. No, wait, sulfuric acid is a strong acid, so both protons dissociate completely in aqueous solution.

So, no, the H+ count is correct.

Wait, another thought: when you mix H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, perhaps a precipitate forms. BaSO4 is a precipitate. So maybe some of the H+ isn't available because it's tied up in forming the salt.

Oh, wait, I think that's a crucial point I missed. Because when you mix H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, they can form BaSO4, which precipitates. So the neutralization reaction would be between the remaining H+ and OH-.

Wait, but how?

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would produce BaSO4 and water. The reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

Wait, but considering the stoichiometry, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O. So in that case, each mole of H2SO4 would require two moles of Ba(OH)2? Or wait, no.

Wait, let's write the balanced equation.

H2SO4 (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O (l)

The reaction shows that one mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

But in terms of H+ and OH-:

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

When they react, the H+ and OH^- combine to form water, and Ba^2+ and SO4^2- form BaSO4.

So, the reaction can be viewed as:

H+ (from H2SO4) + OH^- → H2O.

But how much H+ and OH^- are involved in this?

Wait, let's think in terms of moles.

We have 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH^-.

So, when they react, the H+ and OH^- will neutralize each other. But wait, each mole of H2SO4 requires two H+ ?

Wait, no. Wait, each Ba(OH)2 provides two OH^-, so when 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 reacts with 1 mole of H2SO4, all the H+ from H2SO4 (2 moles) and 2 moles of OH^- from Ba(OH)2 would react to form 2 moles of H2O.

But in our problem, we have 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2.

So, H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here because 0.09 < 0.1.

So, 0.09 moles H2SO4 would require 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

Each mole of H2SO4 produces 2 H+; each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 OH^-.

So, the moles of H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18, and OH^- is 0.2. So, in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, all the H2SO4 would react, consuming 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which would produce 0.18 moles OH^-.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, the reaction equation is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

So, 1 mole H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole Ba(OH)2.

So, for 0.09 moles H2SO4, it needs 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

So, Ba(OH)2 available is 0.1 moles. After reaction, Ba(OH)2 remaining is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles.

So, Ba(OH)2: 0.01 moles → 0.02 moles OH^-.

Wait, but H2SO4 is 0.09 moles; it provides 0.18 moles H+.

So, when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, all 0.18 H+ would react with 0.18 moles OH^-.

But Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 moles → 0.2 moles OH^-.

So, in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H+ (0.18) + OH^- (0.18) → 0.18 H2O. So, that's 0.18 moles of H2O.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 after reaction has 0.01 moles left → 0.02 moles OH^-.

Now, after that, there's HCl which is 0.1 moles H+.

So, the neutralization reaction would proceed as:

H+ (from HCl) + OH^- (from remaining Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

HCl provides 0.1 H+.

Ba(OH)2 remaining provides 0.02 OH^-.

So, 0.02 moles H+ and OH- will neutralize, producing 0.02 moles H2O.

So total H2O from both reactions is 0.18 + 0.02 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So, the total H2O is 0.2 moles. So, same as previous calculation.

Wait, so the overall moles of H2O are 0.2, so the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So, the answer should be -11.4 kJ, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, options are:

A) -2.72 kcal ≈ -11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → ≈-48 kJ.

C) -3.80 kcal → ≈-15.8 kJ.

D) -16.0 kJ.

So, the correct value is approximately -11.4 kJ, which is option A when converted to kcal (since 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is correct.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization' when these are mixed. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of acid or base, but in this case, the total moles of H+ and OH- neutralized are 0.2 and 0.2; so 0.2 moles of H2O formed.

So the answer would be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.726). So the correct option is A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the neutralization of both the strong acids with the base. But I'm not missing anything in the calculation, I think.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid and dissociates completely.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid and dissociates completely in two steps.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

   Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base and dissociates completely.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Limiting reactant**:  
   The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
   Since \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻, OH⁻ is the limiting reactant.  
   Therefore, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H₂O is formed.

5. **Enthalpy change**:  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H₂O formed:  
   \[
   \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]

6. **Conversion to kcal**:  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \),  
   \[
   -11.4 \, \text{kJ} = -11.4 \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

7. **Matching the options**:  
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
   - Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) is incorrect as it corresponds to \( -48 \, \text{kJ} \), which is far higher than the calculated value.  
   - Option C (\( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \)) is incorrect as it corresponds to \( -15.8 \, \text{kJ} \), which is also incorrect.  
   - Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) is incorrect as it does not match the calculated value.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**. 

Answer: A
