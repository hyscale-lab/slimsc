Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So Li-6 maybe? Because Li typically has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, but the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So the isotope would be Li-6, because Li normally has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, the nucleus is Li-6.

So, I need to find the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. Since RHIC accelerates heavy ions, the energy probably refers to the total relativistic energy of the nucleus.

Right, so relativistic energy is given by the equation E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, m0 is the rest mass, and c is the speed of light.

But wait, what's the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus? I think I need the atomic mass or something. Oh, wait, the mass of the nucleus can be calculated using the mass number and the molar mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the rest energy by using the mass of the nucleus. Let me think. The rest energy E0 is m0 c². So I need m0, the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

But how do I find m0? Well, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately... I remember that the atomic mass of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's the average for Li, which is mostly Li-7. Oh, but in this case, it's Li-6, so I think the exact mass is a bit less. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of its nucleons. Or maybe it's given by the formula where I can calculate the rest mass from the number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can approximate it. The rest mass energy of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for a nucleus with A nucleons, the rest mass should be roughly A * 938 MeV/c².

Wait, but that's an approximation. Because the actual rest mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. Hmm. But in this case, maybe the problem expects me to use the simple approach where m0 = A * (mass of a nucleon). Or maybe I'm supposed to look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think for problems like this, the exact mass isn't required because the gamma factor is so large that it's more about the relativistic energy formula than the precise rest mass. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is given by the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each neutron has a rest mass of about 939.565 MeV/c², and protons are about 938.272 MeV/c².

So, calculating the total rest mass m0:

3 * (938.272 MeV) + 3 * (939.565 MeV) = ?

Let me compute that.

3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

Wait, but that's the sum of the individual nucleon masses. But in reality, when you form a nucleus, some mass is lost due to binding energy, so the actual rest mass is less. For example, the mass defect for Li-6 can be found from the standard tables. But if the problem doesn't provide the exact mass, I might have to proceed with the assumption that the rest mass is the sum of the masses of the nucleons. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the average mass number in a way that I can proceed without knowing the exact rest mass.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the ion in terms of its charge and atomic number. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let's try to proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more about the calculation of gamma. Because the speed is given as 0.96c, so beta is 0.96, so beta = v/c = 0.96.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me compute beta squared: 0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let's compute that more accurately. Because 0.96^2 is 0.9216, yes. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest energy. So if I can find the rest energy of the Li-6 nucleus, I can multiply it by gamma to get E.

But wait, what's the rest energy in GeV? So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 MeV is 1e6 eV. So if I have the rest mass in MeV/c², then the rest energy is in MeV.

Wait, earlier I calculated the sum of the nucleon masses as 5633.511 MeV. But that's the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. But the actual rest mass of the nucleus is less because of the binding energy. Wait, but I don't have the exact mass. So is there a way to proceed without knowing the exact m0?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to consider m0 as the mass of the Li-6 atom, not the nucleus. Because sometimes in these problems, when you talk about a nucleus, maybe they're referring to the atom itself. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the fact that the nucleus's mass is approximately A times the mass of a nucleon. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I can look up the exact mass of Li-6. Let me think. I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0105 amu. Oh wait, but wait, amu (atomic mass units) are in terms of carbon-12. 1 amu is about 931.5 MeV/c².

So, if Li-6 has an atomic mass of 6.0105 amu, then the rest mass is 6.0105 * 931.5 MeV/c².

Calculating that: 6.0105 * 931.5 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589. Then 0.0105 * 931.5 ≈ 9.78075. So total is approximately 5589 + 9.78075 ≈ 5598.78 MeV. So m0 c² is about 5598.78 MeV, which is 5.59878 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's the rest energy of the Li-6 atom. But the nucleus is the atom without the electrons. Hmm, so perhaps I need to subtract the binding energy of the electrons. But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary for this problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the nucleus as a single particle with the mass of the atom. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the nucleus, so the mass is approximately the sum of the nucleons, which would be about 6 * 938 MeV, so 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but if I use the exact atomic mass, it's about 5.598 GeV. Hmm. So perhaps I should proceed with that.

Wait, but in the problem, it's stated as nucleus X, which is Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6. So the nucleus is the Li-6 nucleus, which has a mass number A=6. So the rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. So 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, let's get the exact masses of protons and neutrons. The proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So:

3 protons: 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV

3 neutrons: 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV

Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. So m0 c² is 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

But wait, the actual rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is less than this because of the binding energy. The exact rest mass can be found from the atomic mass, but I don't remember the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to proceed with m0 as the sum of the nucleon masses, so 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but perhaps that's a wrong approach. Because when you form a nucleus, the binding energy is an amount of energy that's subtracted from the sum of the individual nucleons. So the actual rest mass is less. So, for example, for a helium nucleus (alpha particle), the rest mass is less than the sum of two protons and two neutrons.

So I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the problem expects me to use the rest mass as m0 = (mass number) * (mass of a nucleon) / c². So for Li-6, A=6, so m0 = 6 * 938 MeV/c². Wait, but that's an approximation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the rest mass as the molar mass in atomic mass units multiplied by 931.5 MeV/amu. So if the molar mass of Li-6 is about 6.0105 amu, then m0 c² is 6.0105 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, 0.0105 * 931.5 ≈ 9.78 MeV. So total is 5598.78 MeV, or 5.59878 GeV.

So then, the total energy E = gamma * m0 c².

Gamma is approximately 3.5714 as calculated earlier.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.59878 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.59878 ≈ ?

Calculating:

3 * 5.59878 = 16.79634

0.5714 * 5.59878 ≈ 3.207 (since 0.5 * 5.59878 is 2.799, and 0.0714 * 5.59878 is about 0.401. So 2.799 + 0.401 = 3.20.

So total is approximately 16.79634 + 3.20 ≈ 20 GeV.

Wait, but the options are more precise, so perhaps I need to compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3.5714 * 5.59878 GeV exactly.

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.59878.

Compute 3 * 5.59878 = 16.79634.

0.5714 * 5.59878:

Let me compute that as 0.5 *5.59878=2.79939, and 0.0714 *5.59878≈0.401.

So 2.79939 + 0.401 ≈ 3.20039.

So total E ≈ 16.79634 + 3.20039 ≈ 20. (Wait, 16.79634 +3.20039 is 19.99673 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV.)

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, D is 21.419, which is higher, B is 23, and A is 18.

Hmm, so 20 GeV is near option C (20.132) but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation is needed. Let me do the exact multiplication.

Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Let me compute 0.96^2: 0.9216.

So, 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28, which is exactly 3.57142857...

Now, m0 c² is 5.59878 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.59878 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately:

3.57142857 * 5.59878.

Let me compute 3 *5.59878 = 16.79634.

0.57142857 *5.59878:

0.57142857 is approximately 4/7, which is 0.57142857.

So, 4/7 * 5.59878 = ?

Compute 5.59878 *4 = 22.39512.

Divide by 7: 22.39512 /7 ≈ 3.199302857.

So the total E is 16.79634 +3.199302857 ≈ 19.995642857 GeV.

Which is approximately 20 GeV, but the options have C) 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in the calculation of m0 c²?

Wait, earlier I used 6.0105 amu for Li-6. Let me double-check that. Wait, I'm not certain about the exact value.

Wait, an alternative approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as A * (mass of a proton) because the binding energy is negligible compared to the rest mass. But that's an approximation.

If A=6, and each nucleon is about 938 MeV/c², then m0 c² is 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3 *5.628 = 16.884

0.57142857 *5.628 = ?

0.5 *5.628=2.814

0.07142857 *5.628 ≈ approx 0.403.

So 2.814 +0.403=3.217.

Total E=16.884 +3.217=20.101 GeV.

Hmm, so that's approximately 20.101 GeV. Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the sum of the nucleon masses, which gives a result around 20.10, close to option C.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using the exact atomic mass (6.0105 amu) and converted to GeV, I got about 19.996 GeV, which is about 20 GeV.

So now I'm a bit confused. Which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, without considering binding energy. So in that case, the rest mass is 6 * 938 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.628.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as:

3.57142857 × 5.628 =

Break it down:

3 ×5.628=16.884

0.57142857 ×5.628 = ?

Let me compute 5.628 × 0.57142857.

=5.628 × (4/7) = (5.628 ×4)/7 = 22.512 /7 ≈3.216.

So total is 16.884 +3.216=20.100 GeV.

So that's 20.100 GeV, which is option C) 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but why is there a slight discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I can compute 3.57142857 ×5.628 more accurately.

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.628:

= (3 + 0.57142857) ×5.628

=3×5.628 +0.57142857×5.628

3×5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 ×5.628:

Compute 0.57142857 ×5 =2.85714285

0.57142857 ×0.628= ?

Well, 0.57142857 ×0.6=0.342857142

0.57142857 ×0.028=0.01599999996≈0.016

So total for 0.628 is 0.342857142 +0.016=0.358857142.

So 0.57142857 ×5.628=2.85714285 +0.358857142≈3.216.

So total E=16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

So approximately 20.1 GeV, which is close to option C's 20.132.

But perhaps I need to compute it more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 ×5.628 more accurately.

Let me compute it as 3.57142857 ×5.628.

Let me write it out:

3.57142857 ×5.628

= 3.57142857 ×5 + 3.57142857 ×0.628.

3 ×5=15, 0.57142857 ×5=2.85714285.

So 15 + 2.85714285 =17.85714285.

Now, 3.57142857 ×0.628.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.028=0.100000000 (approx 0.1).

Sum: 2.142857142 +0.100000000=2.242857142.

So total E is 17.85714285 + 2.242857142 =20.1 GeV.

Hmm, so that's 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. So perhaps the exact calculation would give 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the masses.

Wait, let me think again about the rest mass.

The exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.0093 amu. Wait, because the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0105 amu, but the nucleus mass would be 6.0105 minus the electrons. Wait, but in reality, the nucleus mass is not that straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the molar mass in terms of the nucleons, and we can proceed using the mass number. Wait, perhaps the problem is more about the calculation of gamma, and the rest mass is considered to be m0 = A * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to calculate gamma and multiply it by the rest energy, which requires knowing the exact rest mass of the nucleus.

But without exact data, it's hard to proceed. Wait, perhaps I can find the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Upon checking, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus (as per standard tables) is about 6.00930 amu. Because the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0105 amu, but the nucleus is 6.00930 amu. Because the atom has electrons, which contribute to the mass.

So, m0 = 6.00930 amu.

Each amu is 931.5 MeV/c².

So m0 c² =6.00930 *931.5 MeV.

Compute that:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0093 *931.5 = approx 8.68 MeV.

So total is 5589 +8.68 =5597.68 MeV, which is 5.59768 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.57142857 *5.59768 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.59768:

= (3 + 0.57142857) ×5.59768

=3×5.59768 +0.57142857×5.59768.

3 ×5.59768=16.79304.

0.57142857 ×5.59768:

Let me compute 5.59768 ×0.57142857.

I can compute this as:

5.59768 ×0.5 =2.79884

5.59768 ×0.07142857 ≈5.59768 × (1/14) ≈5.59768 /14≈0.400.

So sum is 2.79884 +0.400 ≈3.19884.

So total E=16.79304 +3.19884 ≈19.99188 GeV.

Which is approximately 20 GeV. But the options have option C as 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, wait, perhaps the initial gamma calculation is more precise.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

Given v =0.96c, beta =0.96.

Gamma=1/sqrt(1 -beta^2).

Compute beta^2=0.96²=0.9216.

So 1 - beta^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28 =3.57142857.

But perhaps sqrt(0.0784) is not exactly 0.28, let me compute it more precisely.

Let me compute 0.28^2=0.0784 exactly. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the m0 c² calculation. Let me recalculate that with the exact mass of Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 nucleus mass is 6.00930 amu.

Each amu is 931.494064 MeV/c².

So m0 c² =6.00930 *931.494064 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.494064=5588.964384 MeV.

0.0093 *931.494064= 8.688 MeV.

So total is 5588.964384 +8.688=5597.652384 MeV, which is 5.597652384 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.597652384 GeV.

Let me compute that:

3.57142857 ×5.597652384.

= (3 + 0.57142857) ×5.597652384.

3×5.597652384=16.79295715 GeV.

0.57142857 ×5.597652384.

Compute 5.597652384 ×0.57142857.

5.597652384 ×0.5=2.798826192

5.597652384 ×0.07142857 ≈5.597652384 ×(1/14)= approx 0.400.

But more accurately, 1/14 is approximately 0.07142857.

So 5.597652384 ÷14.

Calculating 5.597652384 ÷14.

14 ×0.4=5.6 → 5.6 is greater than 5.597652, so 0.399829.

Wait, let me compute 5.597652384 ÷14.

14 ×0.399829=5.597606 → which is very close to 5.597652, so 0.399829.

So 5.597652384 ×0.07142857 ≈0.399829.

So 0.5 part is 2.798826, and 0.07142857 part is 0.399829.

Total for 0.57142857 is 2.798826 +0.399829=3.198655 GeV.

So E=16.79295715 +3.198655=19.991612 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.9916 GeV, which is approximately 20 GeV. But the option is 20.132 GeV, which is higher. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should use the relativistic kinetic energy instead of the total energy? No, the question asks for the energy, which I assume is the total energy, including rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the kinetic energy and then add the rest energy. But the problem says the energy of the RHIC, which is the total energy, so I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the rest mass. Let me think again.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the rest mass is the sum of the rest masses of these nucleons.

Proton mass: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron mass: 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3p: 3×938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3n: 3×939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total m0 c² =2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV →5.633511 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 ×5.633511 GeV.

Compute that:

3 ×5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 ×5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 ×0.57142857.

=5.633511 × (4/7) = (5.633511 ×4)/7 =22.534044 /7≈3.219149.

So E=16.900533 +3.219149≈20.119682 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.12 GeV, which matches option C) 20.132 GeV.

Ah, so this calculation gives 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C. So perhaps the correct approach is to sum the individual nucleon masses.

Wait, but the actual rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. Why are we using the sum then? Oh, maybe the problem expects us to neglect the binding energy, perhaps treating the nucleus as a free particle composed of individual nucleons, which is an approximation.

So, in this case, the rest mass is 5.6335 GeV, and gamma is 3.5714, giving E=20.1197 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV, matching option C's 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the Li-6 atom, which would be different.

Wait, the mass of the Li-6 atom is approximately 6.0105 amu. So the rest mass energy would be 6.0105 ×931.5 MeV=5598.78 MeV=5.59878 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 ×5.59878= ?

3.57142857 ×5.59878.

Compute:

3 ×5.59878=16.79634.

0.57142857 ×5.59878=?

5.59878 ×0.5=2.79939.

5.59878 ×0.07142857≈0.400.

So 2.79939 +0.400=3.19939.

Total E=16.79634 +3.19939=19.99573 GeV≈20.00 GeV, which is close to option C but not as close as the other approach.

Hmm, so this suggests that depending on whether we use the sum of nucleon masses (5.6335 GeV) or the atomic mass (5.59878 GeV), we get different results. But the problem is about the nucleus, so perhaps using the sum of nucleon masses is more appropriate.

Wait, but no, the actual nucleus's rest mass is less than the sum of its constituent nucleons. So using the sum would overestimate the rest mass, which would overestimate the total energy. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the actual rest mass of the nucleus, which is 5.5976 GeV as calculated from the 6.00930 amu.

Wait, but in that case, the energy comes out to about 20 GeV, but the options have 20.132 GeV as option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus, which is 6.00930 amu.

So, m0 c² =6.00930 ×931.494 MeV.

Compute 6 ×931.494=5588.964 MeV.

0.00930 ×931.494= 8.688 MeV.

So total m0 c²=5588.964 +8.688=5597.652 MeV=5.597652 GeV.

Then, E=3.57142857 ×5.597652=?

3 ×5.597652=16.792956.

0.57142857 ×5.597652= let me compute 5.597652 ×0.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps using a calculator approach.

5.597652 ×0.57142857 = ?

Let me compute:

5.597652 ×0.5 =2.798826.

5.597652 ×0.07142857 = ?

Compute 5.597652 ×7142857e-7.

Wait, 0.07142857 is 1/14.

5.597652 ÷14 =0.3998322857.

So adding 2.798826 and 0.3998322857:

2.798826 +0.3998322857=3.1986582857.

So E=16.792956 +3.1986582857=19.991614 GeV.

Which is approximately 19.9916 GeV, which is close to 20 GeV, but the option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, so this suggests that using the actual nucleus mass leads to E≈20 GeV, but using the sum of nucleon masses leads to E≈20.12 GeV.

So perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of nucleon masses, leading to option C.

But why would the problem ask for the total energy of the nucleus, which should include the rest mass? Because the nucleus is a composite particle, but perhaps in the absence of exact data, the problem expects the sum approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to calculate the kinetic energy plus rest energy, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons. That would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what's intended.

Wait, for example, if the nucleus is treated as having a mass of 6 * 938 MeV, then m0 c² is 5.628 GeV.

E =3.57142857 ×5.628 GeV= ?

3 ×5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 ×5.628=3.216.

Total E=20.1 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as 6 *938 MeV, leading to E≈20.1 GeV.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option C) 20.132 GeV.

So, after all this thinking, I think the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total relativistic energy using the formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \), \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \), and \( m_0 c^2 \) is the rest energy of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( \beta = 0.96 \), we compute:
\[
\beta^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - \beta^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The rest energy of a proton is approximately \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV} \), and the rest energy of a neutron is approximately \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV} \). Thus:
\[
m_0 c^2 = 3 \times 938.272 + 3 \times 939.565 = 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \):
\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Breaking this into components:
\[
3 \times 5.633511 = 16.900533 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
0.5714 \times 5.633511 \approx 3.219149 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E = 16.900533 + 3.219149 = 20.119682 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.12 \, \text{GeV} \), which is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**.

### Final Answer
The energy of the RHIC for the Li-6 nucleus moving at \( 0.96c \) is **20.132 GeV**.
