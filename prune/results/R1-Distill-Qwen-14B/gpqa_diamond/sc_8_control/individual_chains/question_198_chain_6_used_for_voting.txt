Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given for four different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, maybe the [Co(SCN)_2] complex. Wait, no, wait. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, so probably the Co(SCN)_2^2+ ion. But I'm not entirely sure if the color refers to a specific complex, but let's proceed.

Stability constants (β) tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The general formula for the formation of a complex is:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^2−n.

Each β value corresponds to a different n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached. Here, the β's are for n=1,2,3,4.

Wait, but the problem says the stability constants are β1, β2, β3, β4. So for n=1, β1=9, n=2 β2=40, n=3 β3=63, n=4 β4=16. Wait, that's strange because β3 is higher than β2, but β4 is lower than β3. So the most stable complex is with 3 SCN- ligands.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanate would be two SCN-, so the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Wait, wait, no. Let me think about the charge. Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for a neutral complex, (n=2) would be Co(SCN)_2: 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So the complex is neutral. But sometimes, depending on the counterions, but I'll proceed.

So to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^0), we need to calculate the fraction of all Co species that are in this form.

The approach would be to consider the formation of all possible complexes (n=0,1,2,3,4), but actually, n=0 is just the free Co^2+ ion. Wait, but the solution contains Co^2+ and SCN-; the complexes form by combining Co^2+ with SCN- in varying amounts.

The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations, then sum them up and find the fraction that is the dithiocyanato complex.

But with four possible complexes, this might get a bit involved. Alternatively, we can use the stability constants to find the distribution of Co species.

I think the method involves using the formation constants (β) to find the fraction of each complex, then sum them.

Another approach is to use the concept of the formation of complexes in solution, where the concentration of each complex is determined by the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

But wait, the initial concentrations might affect the distribution. Let me think: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all Co species. The SCN- is 0.1 M.

The formula for each complex would be:

[Co(SCN)_n]^2-2n+ = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

Wait, no, the general formula for the nth complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

So for each n, the concentration of the complex is βn multiplied by [Co^2+] and [SCN^-]^n.

But the total Co is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} plus any other species, but in this case, Co^2+ is the only other species. Wait, no, n can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, n=0 would just be Co^2+.

Wait, no, the [Co^2+] is part of the solution, but the other species are the complexes. So the total Co is [Co^2+] + sum of [Co(SCN)_n] for n=1,2,3,4.

But wait, the question says "the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M". So that includes all Co species, including the free Co^2+ and all the complexes.

So, the total Co is [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]+ (n=1) + [Co(SCN)_2] (n=2) + [Co(SCN)_3]^− (n=3) + [Co(SCN)_4]^2− (n=4) = 1e-2 M.

But considering that the Co is in various complexes, the sum is 1e-2.

So, each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-]^n multiplied by βn.

But the problem is that [Co^2+] is not known. So we need to find [Co^2+] such that the sum of all species equals 1e-2 M.

Wait, but maybe we can assume that [Co^2+] is much smaller than the complexes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion, then find the ratios.

Let me think. Let's denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentration of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} = βn * x * (0.1)^n

Because [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So, the concentration of each complex is:

n=1: β1 x (0.1) = 9x *0.1 = 0.9x
n=2: β2 x (0.1)^2 =40x *0.01= 0.4x
n=3: β3 x (0.1)^3=63x *0.001=0.063x
n=4: β4 x (0.1)^4=16x *0.0001=0.0016x

And the free Co^2+ is x.

The total Co is x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = ?

Adding them up: x (1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) = x*(2.3646) = 1e-2.

So, 2.3646 x = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2)/2.3646 ≈ 4.223e-3 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the math:

1 (n=0) + 0.9 (n=1) +0.4 (n=2) +0.063 (n=3) +0.0016 (n=4) = 1 +0.9=1.9; 1.9+0.4=2.3; 2.3+0.063=2.363; 2.363+0.0016=2.3646.

So x is 1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

So, [Co^2+] is 0.004223 M.

Now, the concentration of each complex is:

n=1: 0.9x = 0.9 *0.004223 ≈0.003799 M
n=2: 0.4x ≈0.4 *0.004223≈0.001689 M
n=3: 0.063x ≈0.063 *0.004223≈0.000266 M
n=4: 0.0016x ≈0.0016 *0.004223≈6.757e-6 M

And the free Co^2+ is x ≈0.004223 M.

Wait, but the total is x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x +0.0016x = 1e-2, as earlier.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]. So the concentration is 0.001689 M.

To find the percentage, we calculate (concentration of n=2 complex) / (total Co concentration) ×100%.

Total Co is 1e-2 M.

So (0.001689 / 0.01) *100% = (0.1689)*100% ≈16.89%.

Wait, but wait. Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, and option C is 38.1%. Hmm, but wait, I thought that the [Co(SCN)_2] complex would be the dithiocyanato. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for each complex's concentration.

Wait, [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.004223 * 0.01.

Wait, 40 * 0.004223 is 0.16892. Multiply by 0.01 → 0.0016892 M. So yes, that's correct.

So the percentage is (0.0016892 / 0.01) *100% = 16.892%, which is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the β values for n=1 to 4. So for each n, the formula is [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

But wait, wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake in the exponents. Because [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, so for n=2, it's (0.1)^2 =0.01, correct.

Wait, but another thought: in the formation of the complex, the [Co(SCN)_n] is formed from Co^2+ and n SCN^- ions. So each complex has a different charge.

But perhaps the approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the formation of all possible complexes and find the distribution based on the stability constants.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each complex can be calculated using the formula:

fn = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN^-]^k )

But wait, for each n, the fraction is [Co(SCN)_n] / ([Co^2+] + sum [Co(SCN)_k])

But perhaps it's better to compute the fraction as (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN^-]^k + 1 )

Wait, because the denominator is sum of (βk [SCN^-]^k) for k from 0 to 4, where for k=0, β0 is 1 (since β is defined for the formation from Co^2+ and SCN-).

Wait, but in our initial approach, we considered β0 =1, but in the earlier calculation, we included n=0 (free Co^2+), which is x.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the fraction is:

f_n = (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 βk [SCN^-]^k )

Wait, because the denominator would be [Co^2+] (which is x) plus the sum of all complexes.

But earlier, I found x = [Co^2+] = (total Co) / (sum of (βk [SCN^-]^k ) +1 ), but perhaps I should model it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the fraction for each n as (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 βk [SCN^-]^k ), where β0 =1.

Wait, but for n=0, the term would be β0 [SCN^-]^0 =1*1=1, which represents the free Co^2+.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the fraction of each complex as:

fn = (βn [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 βm [SCN^-]^m )

Because each term in the denominator is βm [SCN^-]^m, which is the concentration of the complex with m SCN- ligands, except for m=0, which is [Co^2+].

Wait, but no, [Co^2+] is x, which is β0 [SCN^-]^0 = x = β0 *1 *x.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The formation of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

So, the concentration of each complex is βn times the concentration of Co^2+ times [SCN^-]^n.

The total Co concentration is [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 [Co(SCN)_n] = [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1}^4 (βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

Which equals [Co^2+ ] (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 βn [SCN^-]^n )

So, [Co^2+] = c_Co / (1 + sum_{n=1}^4 βn [SCN^-]^n )

Once [Co^2+] is known, each complex's concentration is βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So, to find the fraction of each complex, it's [Co(SCN)_n] / c_Co = (βn [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / c_Co

Which can be rewritten as (βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 βk [SCN^-]^k )

Because [Co^2+] = c_Co / (denominator), and c_Co is the total cobalt concentration.

So, the fraction of the complex with n SCN- is (βn [SCN-]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^4 βk [SCN-]^k )

Therefore, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is:

(β2 [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN-]^1 + β2 [SCN-]^2 + β3 [SCN-]^3 + β4 [SCN-]^4 ) ) * 100%

Plugging in the values:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16

[SCN-] =0.1 M

Compute each term:

β1 [SCN]^1 =9*(0.1)=0.9

β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.01)=0.4

β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

So denominator = 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = 1 +0.9 is 1.9, +0.4 is 2.3, +0.063 is 2.363, +0.0016 is 2.3646.

Numerator for n=2 is 0.4.

So fraction is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈0.169.

Multiply by 100% to get 16.9%, which is option D.

That makes sense. So the correct answer should be D) 16.9%.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]) in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻. The stability constants are β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, and β₄=16, and the concentrations are [Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

\[
\text{Total Co} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)₂}] + [\text{Co(SCN)₃}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)₄}^{2-}]
\]

The concentration of each complex is proportional to the stability constant and the product of [Co²⁺] and [SCN⁻] raised to the power of the number of ligands (n). The fraction of each complex is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \sum_{k=1}^4 \beta_k [\text{SCN}^-]^k}
\]

For the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂], n=2), the fraction is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-]^1 + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
\]

Substituting the values:

- β₁[SCN⁻]¹ = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9  
- β₂[SCN⁻]² = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4  
- β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063  
- β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016  

The denominator is:

\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

The numerator for n=2 is:

\[
\beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 0.4
\]

Thus, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:

\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is:

\[
f_2 \times 100\% = 0.169 \times 100\% \approx 16.9\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.
