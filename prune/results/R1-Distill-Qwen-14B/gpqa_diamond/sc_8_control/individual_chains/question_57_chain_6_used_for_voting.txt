Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that we have measured phase shifts for an elastic scattering experiment of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts given are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. We're supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. The goal is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The formula involves a sum over the Legendre polynomials multiplied by these phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(s,θ) = (1/(2i)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ) ].

But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, along the beam direction, that's θ=0°, right? Because the beam is coming in along, say, the z-axis, so θ=0 would be the direction of the beam.

So, at θ=0, cosθ is 1. So each Legendre polynomial P_l(1) would evaluate to 1, because P_l(1) = 1 for all l. Because Legendre polynomials are defined such that P_l(1) = 1. So each term becomes (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * 1.

But wait, the formula I remember is f(θ) = (1/(2i)) * sum [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ) ]. So when θ=0, each Legendre polynomial is 1, so the sum is over (e^{2iδ_l} -1) for each l.

But since we're only summing up to l=4 (since δ₀ to δ₄ are given), the sum becomes (e^{2iδ₀} - 1) + (e^{2iδ₁} -1) + ... + (e^{2iδ₄} - 1), all multiplied by 1/(2i).

But wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part of f along the beam direction. So first, let's compute f at θ=0.

f(0) = (1/(2i)) * sum_{l=0}^4 [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ]

Let me compute each term (e^{2iδ_l} -1) for each l.

But I should remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So each term e^{2iδ_l} is cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). Then subtracting 1 gives (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l).

So the term (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) is a complex number. Summing these for l=0 to 4 gives a sum of complex numbers. Then f(0) is (1/(2i)) multiplied by this sum.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, let's compute each (e^{2iδ_l} -1):

For l=0, δ₀=90°. So 2δ₀=180°. cos(180°)= -1, sin(180°)=0. So e^{i180} -1 = (-1 + 0i) -1 = -2. So term is -2.

l=1: δ₁=67°. 2δ₁=134°. cos(134) is about cos(180-46)= -cos46 ≈ -0.6947. sin(134)= sin(46)≈ 0.7193. So e^{i134} ≈ (-0.6947) + i 0.7193. Subtract 1: (-0.6947-1) + i 0.7193 → (-1.6947) + 0.7193i.

l=2: δ₂=55°. 2δ₂=110°. cos(110) is cos(180-70) = -cos70≈-0.3420. sin(110)= sin70≈0.9397. So e^{i110} ≈ -0.3420 + i 0.9397. Subtract 1 → (-0.3420 -1) + i 0.9397 → (-1.3420) + 0.9397i.

l=3: δ₃=30°. 2δ₃=60°. cos60=0.5, sin60≈0.8660. So e^{i60}=0.5 + i 0.8660. Subtract 1 → (0.5 -1) + i 0.8660 → (-0.5) + 0.8660i.

l=4: δ₄=13°. 2δ₄=26°. cos26≈0.8988, sin26≈0.4384. e^{i26}=0.8988 + i 0.4384. Subtract 1 → (0.8988 -1) + i 0.4384 → (-0.1012) + 0.4384i.

Now, sum all these terms (each term is a complex number):

Term 0: -2 + 0i
Term 1: (-1.6947) + 0.7193i
Term 2: (-1.3420) + 0.9397i
Term 3: (-0.5) + 0.8660i
Term4: (-0.1012) + 0.4384i

Summing real parts: (-2) + (-1.6947) + (-1.3420) + (-0.5) + (-0.1012) = let's compute:

-2 -1.6947 = -3.6947
-3.6947 -1.3420 = -5.0367
-5.0367 -0.5 = -5.5367
-5.5367 -0.1012 ≈ -5.6379.

Summing imaginary parts: 0 + 0.7193 + 0.9397 + 0.8660 + 0.4384.

Let's add them:

0.7193 +0.9397 = 1.659
1.659 +0.8660 = 2.525
2.525 +0.4384 ≈ 2.9634.

So the sum is (-5.6379) + i(2.9634).

Then, f(0) = (1/(2i)) * [ (-5.6379) + i(2.9634) ].

Wait, 1/(2i) is equal to -i/(2), because 1/i = -i. So 1/(2i) = -i/(2).

So f(0) = [ (-5.6379 + i 2.9634) ] * (-i/2).

Let me compute that. Multiply each term:

Multiply numerator: (-5.6379)(-i/2) + (i 2.9634)(-i/2).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it step by step.

Let me compute (a + ib) * (c + id) = [ac - bd] + i[ad + bc].

But in our case, (a + ib) is (-5.6379 + i 2.9634) and (c + id) is (-i/2) = 0 -i*(1/2).

So a = -5.6379, b=2.9634; c=0, d= -1/2.

So:

Real part: a*c - b*d = (-5.6379 * 0) - (2.9634 * (-1/2)) )= 0 + (2.9634 * 0.5 )= 1.4817.

Imaginary part: a*d + b*c = (-5.6379 * (-1/2)) + (2.9634 * 0 )= (5.6379/2) + 0 = 2.81895.

So f(0) = 1.4817 + i 2.81895.

Wait, but wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction. So Im(f(0)) is 2.81895.

Wait, but wait a minute, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.

The sum of the (e^{2iδ_l} -1) terms was:

Sum_real = -5.6379.

Sum_imag = 2.9634.

So f(0) = (1/(2i)) * [ Sum_real + i Sum_imag ]

Which is (1/(2i)) * [ (-5.6379) + i 2.9634 ]

Multiplying numerator and denominator:

= [ (-5.6379) + i 2.9634 ] / (2i )

To compute this, perhaps it's better to multiply numerator and denominator by i to eliminate the imaginary unit in denominator.

Wait, 1/(2i) = -i/(2), as earlier.

So:

[ (-5.6379) + i 2.9634 ] * (-i/2 )

Multiply each term:

First term: (-5.6379) * (-i/2 ) = (5.6379 i ) / 2 = 2.81895 i.

Second term: i 2.9634 * (-i/2 ) = (2.9634) * (-i² ) / 2. Since i² = -1, so this becomes 2.9634 * (1) / 2 = 1.4817.

So f(0) = 1.4817 + 2.81895 i.

So the imaginary part is 2.81895. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So Im(f) = 2.81895.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the options are in units of fm (femtometers). So 2.81895 is a unitless number? Because the scattering amplitude f has units of length (in natural units where ħ=1, c=1, etc.), but wait, in reality, for electrons, perhaps we need to apply some conversion factors.

Wait, wait, I think I missed something. The phase shifts are given, but the formula for f includes an energy factor. Because the actual scattering amplitude f has units of length, and the expression from partial waves includes the square root of the energy or something like that.

Wait, I think I might have missed that. The formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts is:

f(θ) = (1/(2i)) sum_{l} (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) * (something with energy).

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is f(s,θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ), where k is the wave number.

Wait, I think that's right. So k is sqrt(s)/2, but in the case of electrons, s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Alternatively, k is (E/(ħ²))^(1/2), but perhaps I need to be careful about the actual expression.

Wait, the general formula is:

f(s,θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ)

So without considering the energy, the amplitude f would be unitless. But when multiplied by k, which has units of 1/length, it would give f in units of length.

Wait, no, let me think again. Let me recall the Born approximation or scattering theory. The scattering amplitude is given by f = (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * P_l(cosθ).

So the factor (1/(2ik)) is crucial. Because without it, the amplitude would not have the correct units.

So, in our case, we have to compute (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum we calculated.

So our sum S = sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (-5.6379) + i 2.9634.

So f(0) = [ S ] / (2ik )

So the imaginary part of f is Im( S/(2ik) ) .

Wait, but let's compute it correctly.

Let me think: S is a complex number: S = (-5.6379) + i (2.9634).

So f(0) = S / (2ik)

I can write this as (S) * ( -i/(2k) ), because 1/(ik) = -i/(k).

So f(0) = [ (-5.6379) + i 2.9634 ] * (-i/(2k)).

Let me compute this. Multiply each term:

= [ (-5.6379) * (-i) ) / (2k) ) ] + [ i 2.9634 * (-i) )/(2k) )

Simplify each part:

First term: (5.6379 i ) / (2k )

Second term: [ i*(-i) ) * 2.9634 ] / (2k )

i*(-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So second term becomes (1 * 2.9634 ) / (2k ) = 2.9634/(2k) = 1.4817 /k.

So f(0) = [ (5.6379 i )/(2k) ) ] + [ 1.4817 /k ]

So f(0) = (1.4817 /k ) + (5.6379 i )/(2k )

Thus, the imaginary part is (5.6379 )/(2k ).

Wait, but wait, no. Because the second term is the real part here. So the real part of f(0) is 1.4817/(k), and the imaginary part is (5.6379)/(2k ).

Wait, no, let me clarify. Because when you have a complex number a + ib, the real part is a, the imaginary part is b.

In this case:

f(0) = [1.4817/k ] + i [ (5.6379) / (2k) ]

So Im(f(0)) = (5.6379)/(2k )

So I need to calculate k, which is the wave number.

The wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/ħ, where m is the mass of the electron, E is the energy. But wait, in the center-of-mass frame, perhaps it's different. Alternatively, for elastic scattering, the expression might be different.

Wait, the energy given is 50 MeV for the electrons. But electrons are much lighter than the target nucleus (assuming the target is a nucleus, like a heavy nucleus), so the reduced mass might be approximately the electron mass. So m would be the electron mass.

So, E is the kinetic energy of the electron. But in scattering, the energy used is usually the center-of-mass energy squared, s= (E_cm)^2 = (2 m_e E )/(ħ²) ), but perhaps I'm mixing up the expressions.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ, where E is the kinetic energy. Because the relation E = ħ² k²/(2m).

So, let's compute k.

Given E is 50 MeV. Let's convert E into Joules to compute k.

But wait, perhaps using natural units would be easier. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 1 MeV = 1.602e-13 J, but that's a lot of computation. Alternatively, I can use the value of ħ in eV·s and m_e in eV/c².

Hmm.

Wait, the wave number k is given by:

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ

But E here is the kinetic energy in Joules, and m_e is the electron mass in kg, ħ is Planck's constant in J·s.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use E in MeV and get k in units of 1/fm, because the options are in fm.

Wait, another approach: using the reduced Compton wavelength.

The Compton wavelength of the electron is λ_c = h/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426e-12 m, but perhaps in terms of energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units here. Let me think again: the formula for k is sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

But E is 50 MeV. Let me compute k in terms of 1/fm.

Wait, I'll need to compute k (in 1/fm), then compute 1/k in fm.

Wait, but perhaps I can find an expression that directly relates E in MeV to k in 1/fm.

Let me recall that for an electron, the relation between energy and wavenumber.

E (in eV) = (ħ c k )^2 / (2 m_e c^2 )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the relation is E = ħ^2 k^2 / (2m_e).

But I need to compute k in units that cancel out the energy. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute k using the following expression:

k (in 1/fm) = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ (in units of eV s) )

Wait, perhaps using E in eV.

Let me compute each component:

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

E =50 MeV = 50e6 eV.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

But I need to convert E into Joules.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-13 J.

Now, compute k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

Compute numerator:

2 * m_e * E = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J.

Compute 2 *9.109e-31 ≈ 1.8218e-30 kg.

Multiply by 8.01e-13 → 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13 = approx 1.459e-42 kg·J.

But J is kg·m²/s², so the units are kg² m²/s².

Wait, but when we take sqrt(2mE), it's sqrt( kg * (kg m²/s²) ) ) → sqrt( kg² m²/s² ) = kg m/s.

So the numerator is sqrt(2mE) ≈ sqrt(1.459e-42 kg^2 m^2/s^2 ) → sqrt(1.459e-42) = approx 3.822e-21 kg m/s.

Now, divide by ħ, which is 1.0545718e-34 J s = 1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s.

So k = (3.822e-21 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s )

Dividing kg m/s by kg m²/s:

(kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) → (1/(m)).

So units are 1/m.

Compute the value: 3.822e-21 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ 3.622e13 m^{-1}.

Wait, that's the k in 1/m. To convert to 1/fm (femtometers, which are 1e-15 m):

1 m = 1e15 fm → 1/m = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 3.622e13 m^{-1} = 3.622e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} = 3.622e-2 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 3.6e13 m^{-1} is 3.6e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} = 3.6e-2 fm^{-1}.

Wait that would make k=0.03622 fm^{-1}.

Hmm, but that seems very small. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, let me recompute the numerator and division.

Compute 2 m_e E:

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

E =50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

So 2 m_e E = 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13.

Compute 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13 = (1.8218 *8.01) * 1e-43 → approx 14.59 * 1e-43 = 1.459e-42 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg m²/s². So 2 m E = 1.459e-42 kg^2 m²/s².

Wait, no, let me think again: 2 m_e E has units kg * (kg m²/s²) ) = kg² m²/s².

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the square root of (2 m_e E) in appropriate units.

Wait, maybe I should compute the numerator as sqrt(2 m_e E) = sqrt( kg * (kg m²/s²) ) ) = sqrt( kg² m²/s² ) = kg m/s.

So sqrt(2 m_e E ) = sqrt(1.459e-42 kg² m²/s^2 ) = sqrt(1.459e-42) * kg m/s.

sqrt(1.459e-42) = approx 3.822e-21.

So sqrt(2 m_e E ) ≈ 3.822e-21 kg m/s.

Now, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J s = 1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s.

So k = (3.822e-21 kg m/s) / (1.05457e-34 kg m²/s )

The kg cancels, m/s divided by m²/s → 1/m.

So 3.822e-21 / 1.05457e-34 = (3.822 / 1.05457) ) * 1e13 → approx 3.623 * 1e13 m^{-1}.

So 3.623e13 m^{-1} = 3.623e13 (1/m).

But 1 m = 1e15 fm → 1/m = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 3.623e13 m^{-1} = 3.623e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} = 3.623e-2 fm^{-1} → 0.03623 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.03623 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but this seems really small. Let me check the calculation again.

Alternative approach: perhaps using natural units where ħ= c=1.

In natural units, the electron mass m_e is about 0.511 MeV/c². But we have E =50 MeV, so k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) ?

Wait, wait, in natural units (ħ= c=1), the expression for k would be sqrt(2 m_e E ), but m_e is in energy units (e.g., MeV), and E is in MeV.

So m_e ≈ 0.511 MeV.

So k = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 MeV * 50 MeV ) = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 *50 ) MeV^{1/2}.

Wait, wait, but the units would be MeV^{1/2}.

But in natural units, 1 fm^{-1} ≈ 197.3 MeV (since 1/lambda_c = m_e c^2 / ħ c → but perhaps I'm getting this wrong).

Wait, the Compton wavelength λ_c = h/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426e-12 m. In natural units (ħ = c =1), 1 fm = 1e-15 m, so lambda_c is about 2.426e3 fm.

Wait, the Compton wavelength λ_c is approximately 2.426e-12 m = 2.426e3 fm. So 1/lambda_c ≈ 4.118e-4 fm^{-1}.

But m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

In natural units, since ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm, so 1 fm^{-1} = 197.3 MeV.

So, let's compute k in natural units.

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) → m_e=0.511 MeV, E=50 MeV.

So k = sqrt(2 * 0.511 *50 ) MeV^{1/2} → sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15 MeV^{1/2}.

Now, convert MeV^{1/2} to fm^{-1}.

Since 1 fm^{-1} = 197.3 MeV, so 1 MeV^{1/2} = (197.3 MeV)^{1/2} fm^{-1/2}.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to relate k as:

k (fm^{-1}) = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ c.

Wait, using units:

E (MeV) = (ħ c k )^2 / (2 m_e c^2 )

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for k in terms of E.

But this is getting a bit messy. Another approach: the wave number k is given by:

k = sqrt( 2 m_e E ) / ħ.

In natural units (ħ=1, c=1), this becomes k = sqrt(2 m_e E ).

But in our case, E is 50 MeV, and m_e is 0.511 MeV/c².

Wait, but natural units have c=1, so m_e is 0.511 MeV.

So k = sqrt(2 * m_e * E ) = sqrt(2 * 0.511 *50 ) ≈ sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15 MeV^{1/2}.

But we need to convert this to inverse femtometers.

Since 1 fm^{-1} ≈ 197.3 MeV (from ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm), so 1 MeV^{1/2} = sqrt(1/(197.3 MeV)) ) fm^{-1/2}.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach.

I think I can use an approximate formula for the wave number in terms of the energy.

In natural units (ħ=1, c=1), the electron's momentum p is given by p = sqrt(2 m_e E ), where E is the kinetic energy.

Then, since p = k (because for a free particle, p = ħ k, so k = p/ħ. But in natural units, ħ=1 → k = p.)

So, p = sqrt(2 m_e E ) → in natural units, p is in MeV.

Thus, k = p (in MeV) ) / (ħ c ) (since k has units of 1/m, and ħ c has units MeV fm).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

In natural units, 1 fm^{-1} = 197.3 MeV. So, 1 MeV = 1/(197.3 fm^{-1}) ) → 1/MeV = 197.3 fm.

So, k in fm^{-1} is equal to (p in MeV) * (1 fm / (197.3 MeV)) )

Because 1 MeV^{-1} = 197.3 fm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up here.

Wait, another approach: the relation between k (in fm^{-1}) and E (in MeV) for an electron.

The formula is k ≈ sqrt( (2 m_e E ) ) / ħ c.

Wait, but with units:

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c².

E is in MeV.

ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm.

So, let's compute k:

k = sqrt(2 * m_e * E ) / (ħ c )

Plugging in the numbers:

m_e = 0.511 MeV/c².

E =50 MeV.

So,

k = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 *50 ) / (197.3 )

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 * 0.511 *50 ) = sqrt(51.1) ≈ 7.15.

So,

k ≈ 7.15 / 197.3 ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So, k ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Ah, that's the same as before, so k ≈ 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So, back to the imaginary part of f(0): Im(f) = (5.6379)/(2k ) → which is (5.6379) / (2 * 0.0362 fm^{-1} ) → let me compute this.

Wait, so 5.6379/(2 * 0.0362 ) → 5.6379 / 0.0724 ≈ 77.86 fm.

Wait, wait, but wait: the denominator is 2k, and k is in fm^{-1}, so 1/(k) is in fm.

So, 5.6379/(2k ) → (5.6379) / (2 * 0.0362 ) → 5.6379 / 0.0724 ≈ 77.86 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option C) 177.675 fm, option B) 355.351 fm, etc. So 77.86 is not an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of Im(f(0)).

Wait, earlier I wrote:

Im(f(0)) = (5.6379)/(2k )

But let me recheck that.

Wait, when I calculated f(0) = [1.4817/k ] + i [5.6379/(2k) ].

So the imaginary part is 5.6379/(2k ) → which is 5.6379/(2 * 0.0362 ) → 5.6379 / 0.0724 ≈ 77.86 fm.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the sum of (e^{2iδ_l} -1) terms.

Let me recheck the calculations for each term.

Wait, let me compute each (e^{2iδ_l} -1) again.

l=0: δ=90° → 2δ=180° → e^{i180} = -1 → e^{i2δ} -1 = -2 → correct.

l=1: δ=67° → 2δ=134°.

cos134° = cos(180−46) = -cos46 ≈ -0.6947.

sin134= sin(46)≈0.7193.

So e^{i134} = cos134 + i sin134 = (-0.6947) + i 0.7193.

e^{i134} -1 = (-0.6947 -1) + i 0.7193 → -1.6947 + i 0.7193.

Correct.

l=2: δ=55 → 2δ=110.

cos110 = cos(180-70) = -cos70 ≈ -0.3420.

sin110= sin70≈0.9397.

e^{i110}= -0.3420 + i 0.9397.

e^{i110} -1 = (-0.3420 -1) + i 0.9397 → -1.3420 + i 0.9397.

Correct.

l=3: δ=30 → 2δ=60.

cos60=0.5, sin60=0.8660.

e^{i60}=0.5 + i 0.8660.

e^{i60} -1 = (0.5-1) + i 0.8660 → -0.5 + i 0.8660. Correct.

l=4: δ=13 → 2δ=26.

cos26≈0.8988, sin26≈0.4384.

e^{i26}= 0.8988 + i 0.4384.

e^{i26} -1 = (0.8988 -1) + i 0.4384 → -0.1012 + i 0.4384. Correct.

Summing real parts: -2 + (-1.6947) + (-1.3420) + (-0.5) + (-0.1012) → let's compute step by step.

-2 -1.6947 = -3.6947.

-3.6947 -1.3420 = -5.0367.

-5.0367 -0.5 = -5.5367.

-5.5367 -0.1012 = -5.6379.

Imaginary parts: 0 + 0.7193 + 0.9397 + 0.8660 + 0.4384.

Adding:

0.7193 +0.9397 = 1.659.

1.659 +0.8660 = 2.525.

2.525 +0.4384 = 2.9634.

So the sum is correct.

So f(0) = (sum) / (2ik) → sum is (-5.6379 + i 2.9634 )

So f(0) = (-5.6379 + i 2.9634 )/(2ik )

Which can also be written as [ (-5.6379 + i 2.9634 ) ] * ( -i/(2k) )

Which gives:

= [ (-5.6379)(-i) + i 2.9634 (-i) ] / (2k )

Simplify each term:

(-5.6379)(-i) = 5.6379 i.

i * 2.9634 * (-i) = (-i^2) * 2.9634 = (1) * 2.9634 = 2.9634.

So sum is [5.6379 i + 2.9634 ] / (2k )

So f(0) = (2.9634 + 5.6379 i ) / (2k )

So the real part is 2.9634/(2k ), and the imaginary part is 5.6379/(2k ).

Wait a second! Earlier, I thought the imaginary part was 5.6379/(2k ), but now I see that the sum inside gives a real part of 2.9634 and an imaginary part of 5.6379, so when divided by 2k, the imaginary part is 5.6379/(2k ).

Wait, but in my initial calculation, after computing f(0) I got the imaginary part as 2.81895, but that was before considering k. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier division.

Wait, wait. Wait, this is the correct f(0) after including k.

So, f(0) = (2.9634 + 5.6379 i ) / (2k )

So the imaginary part is 5.6379/(2k ), and the real part is 2.9634/(2k ).

So, with k = 0.03623 fm^{-1}, the imaginary part is:

5.6379/(2 * 0.03623 ) → 5.6379 / 0.07246 → let's compute.

5.6379 ÷ 0.07246 ≈ 77.83 fm.

Hmm, but the options are:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

So, none of these match 77.83 fm.

But wait, I must have made a miscalculation in k. Let me recheck the calculation of k.

Wait, earlier I computed k as approximately 0.03623 fm^{-1}.

But perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute k using natural units.

In natural units, where ħ= c=1, the momentum p is given by sqrt(2 m_e E ), where m_e is in MeV and E is in MeV.

m_e = 0.511 MeV.

E =50 MeV.

So p = sqrt(2 * 0.511 *50 ) = sqrt(51.1 ) ≈ 7.15 MeV.

But in natural units, p is in MeV, and since ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm, the wave number k = p/(ħ c ) → 7.15 MeV / (197.3 MeV fm ) → 7.15 / 197.3 ≈ 0.03623 fm^{-1}, same as before.

Wait, but that leads to Im(f)≈77.83 fm, which isn't an option.

But the options are way larger than this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me reevaluate the formula for the scattering amplitude.

The general formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ)

But in this case, we're considering the imaginary part at θ=0.

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

Which is (1/(2ik)) * (sum_real + i sum_imag )

= [ sum_real/(2ik) ) + i sum_imag/(2ik) ]

= [ sum_real/(2ik) ) - sum_imag/(2k) ]

Because i/(ik) = 1/k → wait, no: i/(ik) = 1/(k) because i² =-1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute f(0) as:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * (sum_real + i sum_imag )

= (sum_real + i sum_imag ) * (1/(2ik) )

= sum_real/(2ik) + i sum_imag/(2ik )

= [ sum_real/(2ik) ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k) ]

Because i/(ik) = 1/(k) → because i / (i k) )= 1/k.

Wait, let me separate the real and imaginary parts.

sum_real/(2ik) → [ sum_real/(2i) ) ] * (1/k )

sum_imag/(2k ) → sum_imag/(2k )

So, f(0) = [ sum_real/(2i) + sum_imag/(2k) ) ] ?

Wait, maybe a better approach is to write sum as S = S_real + i S_imag.

So f(0) = (S)/(2ik) = (S_real + i S_imag)/(2ik).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

= (S_real i + i^2 S_imag )/(2 k )

= [ S_real i - S_imag ]/(2k )

So, f(0) = [ (- S_imag ) + i S_real ] / (2k )

So, the real part is (-S_imag )/(2k ), and the imaginary part is S_real/(2k ).

Wait, but earlier I thought the imaginary part was S_imag/(2k ), but now according to this, the imaginary part is S_real/(2k ).

Wait, that changes everything.

Because S_real is -5.6379, S_imag is 2.9634.

So, the imaginary part is S_real/(2k ) → (-5.6379)/(2k )

Wait, that would be negative, but the imaginary part can't be negative? Hmm, perhaps not. The question asks for the imaginary part, which can be positive or negative.

Wait, but in any case, let me reevaluate.

So, f(0) = [ (- S_imag ) + i S_real ] / (2k )

So, real part: (- S_imag )/(2k )

Imaginary part: (S_real )/(2k )

So, with S_real = -5.6379, and S_imag = 2.9634.

So,

Im(f(0)) = ( -5.6379 )/( 2k )

Because S_real is -5.6379.

So, Im(f(0)) = (-5.6379 )/(2 * 0.03623 ) → (-5.6379) / 0.07246 ≈ -77.83 fm.

But the options are all positive, so perhaps the absolute value is taken.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the sign, just the magnitude.

But even so, 77.83 fm is not among the options. So perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the phase shifts are given for the partial waves l=0 to 4, but the formula for the scattering amplitude uses l=0 to some maximum l, perhaps including higher l's. But the question says to ignore the rest beyond l=4, so that's correct.

Another possibility: Perhaps the imaginary part is calculated as Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) * sin(2δ_l ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ} -1 ) P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

Each term (e^{2iδ} -1 ) = e^{i(2δ)} - 1 = [ cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ) ] -1.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is the imaginary part of (sum (e^{2iδ} -1 )) multiplied by (1/(2ik)).

Wait, but perhaps I should compute Im(f(0)) = Im( (sum (e^{2iδ} -1 )) * (1/(2ik)) )

Since 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k ), as earlier.

So,

Im(f(0)) = Im( (sum (e^{2iδ} -1 )) * (-i/(2k )) )

= Im( [ (sum_real + i sum_imag ) * (-i) ] / (2k) )

= Im( [ (-i sum_real) - i^2 sum_imag ] / (2k) )

= Im( [ (-i sum_real) + sum_imag ] / (2k) )

Because i^2 = -1.

So, the expression becomes [ sum_imag - i sum_real ] / (2k )

The imaginary part of this is (sum_imag )/(2k )

Because the term is (sum_imag )/(2k ) plus (- sum_real )/(2k ) multiplied by i.

So, Im(f(0)) = sum_imag/(2k )

Wait, sum_imag is 2.9634.

So,

Im(f(0)) = 2.9634/(2 * 0.03623 ) → 2.9634/(0.07246 ) ≈ 40.93 fm.

But that's also not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the initial formula for the scattering amplitude is different.

Wait, another possibility: The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(s,θ) = sum_{l} ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) ) P_l(cosθ )

So, in this case, with θ=0, f(0) = sum ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) )

So, the imaginary part is sum [ Im( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) ) ]

Which is sum [ Im( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) * ( -i/(2k) ) ) ]

Each term:

(e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) -1 = [ cos(2δ_l) -1 ] + i sin(2δ_l )

Multiply by (-i/(2k)):

= [ (cos(2δ) -1 ) (-i) ) + i sin(2δ) (-i) ] / (2k )

= [ i(1 - cos(2δ) ) - i^2 sin(2δ) ] / (2k )

= [ i(1 - cos(2δ) ) + sin(2δ) ] / (2k )

So the imaginary part of each term is [ (1 - cos(2δ) ) ] / (2k )

Because the term [i(1-cos) + sin ] has an imaginary part of (1 - cos(2δ_l )) / (2k )

So, the total imaginary part is sum_{l} (1 - cos(2δ_l )) / (2k )

So,

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k )) sum_{l} [ 1 - cos(2δ_l) ]

Ah, this is a different approach, perhaps the correct one.

So, let's compute each term [1 - cos(2δ_l ) ] and sum them.

Compute for each l:

l=0: δ=90° → 2δ=180°. cos180= -1.

1 - cos(180) = 1 - (-1 )=2.

l=1: δ=67° → 2δ=134°. cos134 ≈ -0.6947.

1 - (-0.6947 )=1.6947.

l=2: δ=55 → 2δ=110°. cos110≈-0.3420.

1 - (-0.3420 )=1.3420.

l=3: δ=30 → 2δ=60°. cos60=0.5.

1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

l=4: δ=13 → 2δ=26°. cos26≈0.8988.

1 - 0.8988 =0.1012.

Now sum all these:

2 + 1.6947 = 3.6947.

3.6947 +1.3420=5.0367.

5.0367 +0.5=5.5367.

5.5367 +0.1012=5.6379.

So sum is 5.6379.

Thus, Im(f(0))= (5.6379 )/(2k ) → 5.6379/(2 * 0.03623 ) → 5.6379 / 0.07246 ≈77.83 fm.

But again, this doesn't match any options. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is (1/(2k )) times the sum of sin(2δ_l ).

Because, the term (e^{2iδ} -1 ) = 2i e^{iδ} sin δ.

Wait, let me compute e^{iθ} -1 = e^{iθ/2} (e^{iθ/2} - e^{-iθ/2} ) = e^{iθ/2} * 2i sin(θ/2 )

So, e^{iθ} -1 = 2i e^{iθ/2} sin(θ/2 )

But in our case, θ=2δ_l, so e^{i2δ_l} -1 = 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

So, (e^{i2δ_l} -1 ) = 2i e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l → so the imaginary part of this term is 2 e^{δ_l} sin δ_l * sin δ_l ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let's compute Im( e^{i2δ} -1 ) = Im( (cos(2δ) -1 ) + i sin(2δ) ) = sin(2δ).

So, sum over l of Im( e^{i2δ_l} -1 ) = sum sin(2δ_l )

Thus, Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k )) * sum sin(2δ_l )

So, let's compute sum sin(2δ_l ):

Compute for each l:

l=0: sin(180)=0.

l=1: sin(134)≈0.7193.

l=2: sin(110)=sin70≈0.9397.

l=3: sin60≈0.8660.

l=4: sin26≈0.4384.

Sum: 0 +0.7193 +0.9397 +0.8660 +0.4384 → summing:

0.7193 +0.9397=1.659.

1.659+0.866=2.525.

2.525+0.4384=2.9634.

So sum sin(2δ_l )=2.9634.

Thus, Im(f(0)) = (2.9634 ) / (2k ) → 2.9634/(2*0.03623) →2.9634/0.07246 ≈40.92 fm.

Again, not matching any options.

Wait, but all of my approaches are leading me to either ~77 fm or ~40 fm, but the options are much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should consider the reduced mass of the electron-target system. But since the target is a nucleus, which is much heavier than the electron, the reduced mass μ is approximately m_e.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

The reduced mass μ = (m_e * M )/(m_e + M ), where M is the target's mass. If M is much larger than m_e, μ ≈ m_e.

So, perhaps using m_e is correct.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the energy used in the calculation is the center-of-mass energy, not the kinetic energy of the electron. Because in scattering, the energy is often the CoM energy.

So, perhaps I should compute using the CoM energy, which is sqrt(2 m_e M ) for a fixed target, but if M is very heavy, the CoM energy is approximately sqrt(2 m_e E ), where E is the kinetic energy of the electron.

Wait, perhaps that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy should be taken as E =50 MeV in the CoM frame, which would be different from the lab frame.

But this complicates the calculation further.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the wave number k is given by sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ, but E is the total energy, not the kinetic energy. For an electron, the total energy E_total = K + m_e c², but if K is much smaller than m_e c², E ≈ m_e c² + K. But 50 MeV is much larger than m_e c² (which is 0.511 MeV), so E ≈50 MeV.

But perhaps in the calculation, I should use the total energy, not the kinetic energy.

Wait, but in the formula for k, it's the kinetic energy, or the total energy?

Wait, the formula I used earlier was k = sqrt(2mE)/ ħ, where E is the kinetic energy.

But perhaps for higher energies, it's better to use the relativistic relation.

Wait, relativistic energy: E_total² = (pc )² + (m c² )².

In the lab frame, the target is at rest, so the initial momentum is that of the electron. So the total energy is E_e + M c², but for a heavy target, M c² is much larger than E_e, so E_total ≈ M c² + E_e.

But perhaps this isn't necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for k is sqrt( (E )^2 - (m_e c² )^2 ) / ħ c.

Because E is the total energy, so the momentum p = sqrt(E^2 - (m_e c² )^2 ) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

Wait, let me compute this.

E =50 MeV.

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So,

p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV / c → approximately sqrt(2500 - 0.261 ) → sqrt(2499.739 ) ≈49.9974 MeV/c.

So p ≈50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p / ħ c → [50 MeV/c ] / [197.3 MeV fm ] → 50 /197.3 → approximately 0.2536 fm^{-1}.

So, k ≈0.2536 fm^{-1}.

Now, using this k, let's compute Im(f(0)).

Earlier approach where Im(f) = sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l )) ] / (2k )

Sum is 5.6379.

So,

Im(f) =5.6379/(2 *0.2536 ) →5.6379 /0.5072≈11.11 fm.

Still doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, if I use the sum of sin(2δ_l ), which is 2.9634.

Im(f) =2.9634/(2 *0.2536 ) →2.9634 /0.5072≈5.838 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(k)) sum ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2i) ) P_l(cosθ )

Which would change the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ) = sum ( (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) ) P_l(cosθ )

Which is what I used earlier.

But regardless of the approach, I'm not getting the options given.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the real part instead of the imaginary part. Let me check what the real part would be.

Earlier, with k=0.03623 fm^{-1}, the real part was 2.9634/(2k )=2.9634/(0.07246 )=40.93 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the scattering amplitude without considering k, but using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = sum ( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ ), without the 1/(2ik) factor. But that would make the units incorrect, as f would be unitless.

Wait, but in the options, the units are in fm, which suggests that the correct approach must include the 1/k factor to get f in length units.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude f is related to the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of f to the total cross-section.

But perhaps that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k, and the correct k is much larger, leading to a smaller Im(f).

Wait, let me recompute k using the relativistic approach.

E =50 MeV.

m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m_e c^2 )^2 ) / c → sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV/c → sqrt(2500 -0.261 )=49.9974 MeV/c.

k = p / ħ c → (49.9974 MeV/c ) / (197.3 MeV fm ) → 49.9974 /197.3 →≈0.2536 fm^{-1}.

So, k≈0.2536 fm^{-1}.

If I use this k, then Im(f) = sum [ (1 - cos(2δ_l )) ]/(2k )

Sum is 5.6379.

So, Im(f) =5.6379/(2 *0.2536 ) →5.6379/(0.5072 )≈11.11 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for f. Let me check reliable sources.

Upon checking, the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts is given by:

f(s,θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ )

So, yes, the formula is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation of k is incorrect. Let me try to compute k in a different way.

The wave number k is given by:

k = sqrt( (2 m_e E ) ) / ħ

But in this case, E is the kinetic energy of the electron, not the total energy.

So, E_kinetic =50 MeV.

But, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, E_kinetic =50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV =8.01e-13 J.

m_e=9.109e-31 kg.

So,

k = sqrt( 2 * m_e * E_kinetic ) / ħ

Compute numerator: sqrt( 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J )

J=kg m²/s².

So,

2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 kg m²/s² = 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 = approx 1.459e-42 kg² m²/s².

Wait, but for sqrt, it's kg m/s.

So sqrt(1.459e-42 ) =3.822e-21 kg m/s.

Divide by ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s =1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s.

So k =3.822e-21 /1.0545718e-34 → ~3.623e13 m^{-1}.

Converting to fm^{-1}: 1 m =1e15 fm → 1 m^{-1} =1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So,3.623e13 m^{-1} =3.623e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1} =3.623e-2 fm^{-1} →0.03623 fm^{-1}.

So, k=0.03623 fm^{-1}.

So, Im(f(0))=5.6379/(2 *0.03623 )=5.6379/0.07246≈77.83 fm.

Hmm, but the options are way off.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees? No, the question states the phase shifts are in degrees.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is given without the 1/(2ik) factor. But that would make the units incorrect. So, I'm confident the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude of the imaginary part, which would be the same as the value I obtained, but again, it's not an option.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm. That's exactly twice 88.8375 fm, which is close to my earlier result of 77.83, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the sum should include all terms up to l=4, but I might have missed a phase shift. Let me recheck the given phase shifts.

The given phase shifts are δ_0=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13. So I included all five terms. So that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum [ sin(2δ_l) ]/(2k )

Which with sum sin(2δ)=2.9634, and k=0.03623 fm^{-1}, gives Im(f)= 2.9634/(2*0.03623 )=40.93 fm.

But again, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum [ sin(2δ_l) ]/(k )

Which would give 2.9634/0.03623≈81.77 fm.

Closer to 87163 fm, but not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum [ (1-cos(2δ_l )) ]/k.

Which would be 5.6379 /0.03623≈155.58 fm.

Which is close to option C (177.675) but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the calculation without considering the division by 2k, but just k. So 5.6379 /0.03623≈155.58 fm.

But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Wait, rechecking the sum of (1 - cos(2δ)).

l=0: 2δ=180°, 1 - (-1)=2.

l=1:134°, cos≈-0.6947, 1 - (-0.6947)=1.6947.

l=2:110°, cos≈-0.3420, 1 - (-0.3420)=1.3420.

l=3:60°, cos=0.5, 1-0.5=0.5.

l=4:26°, cos≈0.8988, 1 -0.8988=0.1012.

Sum: 2 +1.6947=3.6947 +1.3420=5.0367 +0.5=5.5367 +0.1012=5.6379.

So that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the formula for f includes a factor of 2 in front of the sum.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum ( e^{2iδ} -1 ), but perhaps I missed a factor of 2, making it (1/(ik)) sum ( e^{2iδ} -1 ), leading to a larger amplitude.

Wait, that would change k to 2k, which would make Im(f) smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not have divided by 2k, but just k.

Let me try that.

If f(0) = sum (e^{2iδ} -1 )/(ik )

Then, Im(f(0)) = sum [ (1 - cos(2δ) ) ] / (k )

So,

Im(f)=5.6379/(0.03623 )≈155.58 fm.

Still not an option, but perhaps the options are off by a factor of 2.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is roughly 155 * 1.14.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the question says degrees.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (e^{i2δ} -1 ), treating δ as radians.

But the question states the phase shifts are in degrees, so that's unlikely.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately twice the value I calculated when using the sum of sin(2δ_l ) / (2k ), which would be 40.93 *4=163.7, but not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the magnitude of the entire sum.

Earlier, the sum was (-5.6379 +i2.9634 ), which has a magnitude sqrt( (-5.6379)^2 + (2.9634)^2 )= sqrt(31.78 +8.78 )=sqrt(40.56 )≈6.37.

Then, |f(0)|= (6.37 )/(2k ) →6.37/(0.07246 )≈88.06 fm.

Which is close to option C, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the absolute value of the imaginary part, which would be 77.83 fm, but again, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(0) = sum (e^{2iδ} -1 )/(k ), without the 1/(2i) factor.

In that case, Im(f) would be sum [ (1 - cos(2δ) ) ] /k →5.6379/0.03623≈155.58 fm.

Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift indices. The phase shifts are given as δ_0, δ_1, etc., up to δ_4. So l ranges from 0 to 4, which I accounted for.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the differential cross-section, which is |f|^2, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of f.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the wave number k is taken as the reciprocal of the wavelength.

But that's not helpful, as the earlier approach is correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are being used in a different manner, such as δ_0 being the 0th order, but I think I handled that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum using the formula for the scattering amplitude without the 1/(2ik) factor, but then the units would be in inverse energy, which doesn't match the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total cross-section, which involves the imaginary part of f.

The total cross-section σ_total = (4π/ k² ) Im(f(0) ).

But then, σ_total would have units of area.

But the question is about Im(f), not σ_total.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave number k is expressed in terms of the wavelength λ, so k=2π/λ.

But that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the scattering amplitude includes the reduced mass, which I approximated as m_e.

But let me compute μ more accurately.

μ = (m_e * M )/(m_e + M ), where M is the target mass.

Assuming the target is a nucleus, say a carbon-12 nucleus, M =12 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass (~1.67e-27 kg).

But even so, M is much larger than m_e, so μ ≈ m_e.

But let's compute it.

Suppose the target is a carbon nucleus, M=12 * 1.67e-27 kg=2.004e-26 kg.

m_e=9.11e-31 kg.

μ = (9.11e-31 *2.004e-26 )/(9.11e-31 +2.004e-26 ) → denominator ≈2.004e-26 kg.

Numerator≈9.11e-31 *2.004e-26 ≈1.825e-56 kg².

So μ≈1.825e-56 /2.004e-26 ≈9.11e-31 kg, which is m_e, as expected.

So, the reduced mass doesn't change the result significantly.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is approximately 77.83 fm. But none of the given options match this.

But looking back at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is roughly twice 88.8375, but I'm not sure why that would be.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of the phase shifts' sines and then multiply by a factor.

Wait, sum of sin(2δ_l )=2.9634.

If I compute 2.9634 * (1/k ), where k=0.03623 fm^{-1}, gives 2.9634 / 0.03623≈81.77 fm.

Which is close to option C's 177.675, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should include a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is sum [ sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/k )

Which gives 2.9634/0.03623 ≈81.77 fm.

But that's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the total of all phase shifts, but I think I've correctly accounted for l=0 to 4.

Hmm.

Well, given the time I've spent and the calculations I've done, I think the correct approach leads to an imaginary part of approximately 77.83 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k or in the formula.

Another approach: perhaps the energy used in the formula is the total energy, not the kinetic energy.

So, E_total =50 MeV + m_e c² ≈50.511 MeV.

Then, p = sqrt( E_total^2 - (m_e c² )^2 ) /c → sqrt(50.511^2 -0.511^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2551.26 -0.261 )=50.511 MeV/c.

k =50.511 MeV/c / (197.3 MeV fm ) →50.511 /197.3≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

Then, Im(f)=5.6379/(2 *0.256 )=5.6379/0.512≈10.99 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula f(0) is sum (e^{i2δ} -1 )/(2ik ), leading to Im(f)= sum [ (1 - cos(2δ) ) ]/(2k ), which with k=0.2536 fm^{-1}, gives Im(f)=5.6379/(2*0.2536 )=5.6379/0.507≈11.12 fm.

No match.

I'm out of ideas. Based on my calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made an error in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f = sum ( e^{i2δ} -1 )/(k ), leading to Im(f)= sum [ (1 - cos(2δ) ) ] /k →5.6379/0.03623≈155.58 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is roughly 5.6379/(0.0162 ), which would imply a much smaller k. So perhaps I made a mistake in k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using the relativistic formula with E as the total energy.

E_total =50 MeV +0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV.

p = sqrt( E_total^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50.511 MeV/c.

k= p/(ħ c ) →50.511 MeV/c / (197.3 MeV fm ) →50.511 /197.3≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

If I use this k in the formula Im(f)= sum [ (1 - cos(2δ) ) ]/(2k )

→5.6379/(2*0.256 )=5.6379/0.512≈10.99 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for k is different, using the reduced mass μ instead of m_e.

μ = m_e * M / (m_e + M ) ≈ m_e.

So,

k = sqrt(2 μ E ) / ħ.

But again, same result as before.

I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 77.8 fm, but it's not an option. However, looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about twice my calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2 somewhere. For example, if the formula includes a factor of 2 in the denominator, making it 2k instead of k.

In that case, Im(f)=5.6379/(2k )=5.6379/(2*0.03623 )=5.6379/0.07246≈77.83 fm.

No, that's what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is f(0) = (1/(ik)) sum (e^{2iδ} -1 ), leading to Im(f)= sum [ (1 - cos(2δ) ) ] /k →5.6379/0.03623≈155.58 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Maybe the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, which is 5.6379/(2 *0.0324 ) →5.6379/0.0648≈87 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in k.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

But perhaps the correct formula is E = (ħ c k )^2/(2 m_e c^2 ).

Wait, let me compute k in fm^{-1}.

E=50 MeV.

E = (ħ c k )^2/(2 m_e c^2 )

Rearranging,

k = sqrt( 2 m_e E c^2 )/( ħ c )

But since ħ c ≈197.3 MeV fm,

k = sqrt(2 m_e E c^2 )/(197.3 MeV fm )

But m_e c^2=0.511 MeV.

So,

k = sqrt( 2 *0.511 MeV *50 MeV ) /197.3 MeV fm

= sqrt(51.1 (MeV)^2 ) /197.3 MeV fm

= sqrt(51.1 ) MeV /197.3 MeV fm

=7.15 MeV /197.3 MeV fm →7.15 /197.3 ≈0.03623 fm^{-1}.

Same result as before.

So, I think I've double-checked the calculation of k correctly.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but since the closest I have is approximately 77.8 fm, and the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is roughly twice my calculated value, perhaps due to a mistake in the formula or calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is sum [ sin(2δ_l ) ]/(2k ), which would give 2.9634/(2 *0.03623 )≈40.93 fm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the question says degrees.

Wait, let me compute the sum again with δ in radians.

Wait, for example, δ_0=90 degrees = π/2 radians.

Compute e^{i2δ} for each l in radians.

But I think this would change the sums significantly.

But the question states the phase shifts are in degrees, so I think this is incorrect.

Well, I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, I think the correct answer is approximately 77.8 fm, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is twice that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( f(0) \), for elastic electron scattering at the incident beam direction (\( \theta = 0^\circ \)) using the given phase shifts: \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The scattering amplitude is expressed as:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^4 \left( e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \right),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, given by:

\[
k = \frac{\sqrt{2m_eE}}{\hbar},
\]

with \( m_e \) as the electron mass, \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) as the kinetic energy, and \( \hbar \) as the reduced Planck constant. The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is extracted as:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^4 (1 - \cos(2\delta_l))}{2k}.
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shift Contributions**: The terms \( e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \) are computed for each \( l \), yielding real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) depends on the sum of \( (1 - \cos(2\delta_l)) \), which is calculated as:
   \[
   \sum_{l=0}^4 (1 - \cos(2\delta_l)) = 5.6379.
   \]

2. **Wave Number \( k \)**: Using \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), \( m_e = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), and \( \hbar c \approx 197.3 \, \text{MeV}\cdot\text{fm} \), the wave number is computed as:
   \[
   k \approx 0.03623 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

3. **Imaginary Part of \( f(0) \)**: Substituting the sum and \( k \) into the formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \):
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{5.6379}{2 \cdot 0.03623} \approx 77.83 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**: The calculated value of \( 77.83 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is \( 177.675 \, \text{fm} \) (Option C), which is approximately twice the calculated value. This discrepancy may arise from an unaccounted factor in the problem setup or a misinterpretation of the phase shifts.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is approximately \( 77.83 \, \text{fm} \). However, since this value is not among the options, the most reasonable choice is **Option C: 177.675 fm**, assuming a possible oversight in the problem setup or interpretation.
