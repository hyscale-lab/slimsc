Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked here.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The answer options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me first jot down the given data:

- Star_1 has a mass 1.5 times the Sun's mass.
- Star_2 has a mass 1.2 times the Sun's mass.
- Abundances determined using EW method under LTE.

Abundance values:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_Sun.

So for Star 1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. So nFe/nH in Star 1 is the same as in the Sun. Similarly, for Star 2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg/nH is the same as the Sun.

Wait, but also, for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So Si relative to Fe is higher by 10^0.3. Because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_Sun. So for Star1, [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_Sun + 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_Sun + 0.3.

Wait, but I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Hmm.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, express the abundances in terms of the Sun.

For Star 1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe_1 / nH_1) = log(nFe_Sun / nH_Sun). So nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_Sun / nH_Sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = log(nSi_Sun / nFe_Sun) + 0.3.

Since nFe_1/nH_1 is same as Sun, then nFe_1 = (nFe_Sun / nH_Sun) * nH_1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the hydrogen is the same. Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) relative to the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H] =0 → (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_Sun / nH_Sun). Let me compute nFe_Sun / nH_Sun from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's data is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, Sun's nMg/nH is 10^(-5) ≈ 1e-5.

So for Star_1:

nFe_1 /nH_1 = 3.16e-5 (same as Sun).

And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) = log(nSi_Sun / nFe_Sun) +0.3.

What's nSi_Sun / nFe_Sun?

Wait, the sun's nSi and nFe are given, but I think we can calculate it. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the ratio from other given data.

Wait, no, the question only gives [Si/Fe] for Star 1 and [Mg/Si] for Star 2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of nSi in each star relative to the Sun, then take the ratio.

Let me first compute for Star_1.

nFe_1 = (nFe_Sun / nH_Sun) * nH_1.

But without knowing nH_1, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of solar values.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express all abundances in terms of [X/H], since [Fe/H] is given for Star 1 and [Mg/H] for Star_2.

Wait, for Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe abundance same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which means [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 → 0 +0.3 = 0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → which is log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_Sun/nH_Sun) )=0.3.

So log(nSi_1/nH_1) = log(nSi_Sun/nH_Sun) + 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → [Mg/Si] =0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(nMg_Sun/nSi_Sun) + 0.3.

But also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg_2/nH_2) = log(nMg_Sun/nH_Sun) → so nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_Sun /nH_Sun.

So let me compute the ratios.

First, for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_Sun/nH_Sun).

Wait, wait, [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_Sun/nH_Sun) → so nX/nH = 10^([X/H]) * (nX_Sun/nH_Sun).

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1=0.3 → nSi_1 /nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_Sun /nH_Sun).

Wait, but I don't know nSi_Sun. But perhaps I can express it in terms of other elements.

Wait, nSi_Sun is given by the Sun's composition. Wait, the question didn't give [Si/H] for the Sun. It gives [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for the Sun. So Sun's [Fe/H]=7.5-12= -4.5, which makes sense because nFe/nH is 1e-4.5.

Wait, but let me think. The Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH=3.16e-5.

Similarly, Sun's [Mg/H] is 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi? The Sun's [Si/Fe] is not given. Wait, the Sun's composition isn't provided for Si. Hmm, that's a problem because without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], I can't compute nSi_1 and nSi_2 directly.

Wait, but perhaps I can relate nSi using other elements.

Wait, let's see. For Star_1, since [Si/Fe] is 0.3, and [Fe/H] is 0, maybe I can find [Si/H] for Star_1.

Yes, I think that's the way. Because [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H] → 0.3 = [Si/H]_1 - 0 → [Si/H]_1=0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that would mean Star_2 has [Si/H] of -0.3, which is 0.3 dex lower than the Sun. So nSi_2/nH_2 = 10^(-0.3) * (nSi_Sun/nH_Sun).

But wait, I don't know nSi_Sun. So without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], I can't proceed. Oh wait, the Sun's [Si/H] isn't given. Hmm, this is a problem.

Wait, maybe I can find the Sun's [Si/H] using another approach. Because the Sun's [Fe/H] is known, and perhaps [Mg/Si] can be found from the Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's data: nFe_Sun = 3.16e-5 * nH_Sun, and nMg_Sun =1e-5 *nH_Sun.

But what about nSi_Sun? It's not given. Hmm, perhaps it's not needed. Wait, maybe I can express the ratio of Si in each star in terms of the Sun's [Si/H], but then the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2 would involve the Sun's [Si/H] terms, but perhaps they'll cancel out.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2: nSi_1 /nSi_2.

Each of these can be expressed in terms of their [Si/H] and the Sun's [Si/H].

nSi_1 = (nSi_Sun / nH_Sun) * 10^{[Si/H]_1} * nH_1.

Similarly, nSi_2 = (nSi_Sun /nH_Sun) * 10^{[Si/H]_2} * nH_2.

So the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [10^{0.3} * nH_1 ] / [10^{-0.3} * nH_2 ] = 10^{0.6} * (nH_1 / nH_2).

But wait, nH_1 and nH_2 are the hydrogen densities in each star. How can I relate them?

Wait, the stars' masses are given, but I don't think that's directly related to the hydrogen density. Unless we assume that the total number of protons (hydrogen) is proportional to the star's mass, but that's a stretch. Also, the problem doesn't provide any information about the stars' sizes, temperatures, or other factors that would affect the number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because without knowing how nH relates between the two stars, I can't determine the ratio of nSi_1 to nSi_2. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars? That doesn't make much sense because stars have different masses, so their total hydrogen would vary. But maybe the problem expects us to consider the same nH, or perhaps the ratio of nH is related to the ratio of Fe or Mg.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the nH terms cancel out. Let me think.

Wait, let's try to express nH_1 and nH_2 in terms of Fe and Mg.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_Sun /nH_Sun.

So nH_1 = (nFe_1 * nH_Sun) / nFe_Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2 /nH_2 =nMg_Sun /nH_Sun → nH_2 = (nMg_2 *nH_Sun)/nMg_Sun.

Wait, but I don't know nFe_1 or nMg_2.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that nFe_1 = (nFe_Sun /nH_Sun) *nH_1 → but without knowing nH_1, not helpful.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the variations in nH and assume it's the same for both stars. But that's a big assumption and probably incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the fact that for each star, the ratio of elements is expressed in terms of [X/H], so when calculating the ratio of nSi in the two stars, the nH terms would cancel.

Wait, let me go back.

nSi_1 = (nSi_Sun /nH_Sun) * 10^{0.3} * nH_1.

nSi_2 = (nSi_Sun /nH_Sun) * 10^{-0.3} *nH_2.

So the ratio is (10^{0.3} *nH_1) / (10^{-0.3} *nH_2) ) * (nSi_Sun /nH_Sun) / (nSi_Sun /nH_Sun) ).

The (nSi_Sun /nH_Sun) terms cancel out.

So ratio = 10^{0.6} * (nH_1/nH_2).

What's the value of 10^{0.6}? Let me compute:

10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, approximately 4. So approximately 4 times (nH_1/nH_2).

But without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, I can't proceed. Unless there's another way to relate nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same metallicity in terms of other elements. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the hydrogen is the same in both stars, which would make the ratio 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is option A (~3.9). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.

The ratio of silicon is nSi_1 /nSi_2.

From the [Si/H] values:

nSi_1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_Sun /nH_Sun) * nH_1.

nSi_2 = 10^{-0.3} * (nSi_Sun /nH_Sun) *nH_2.

So ratio = (10^{0.3} /10^{-0.3}) ) * (nH_1 /nH_2) ) = 10^{0.6} * (nH_1/nH_2).

So 10^{0.6} is ~3.98.

Now, if I can find nH_1/nH_2, I can compute the ratio.

How can I find nH_1/nH_2?

Wait, maybe through the Fe and Mg abundances.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = [Fe/H]_1 =0 → so nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_Sun/nH_Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_Sun/nH_Sun.

But unless there's a link between Fe and Mg in the stars, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the stars' masses are relevant. Because the mass affects the number of particles, perhaps the number of Hydrogen atoms is proportional to the mass? But that's a stretch because a star's composition varies, and the photosphere is a thin layer.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that nH_1 and nH_2 are the same, but that doesn't make sense given the stars' different masses.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] is not needed, and the problem is designed so that the H cancels out.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of mass fractions instead of number densities. But the question is about number of atoms, so nSi.

Hmm, I'm stuck because without knowing how nH varies between the stars, I can't find the ratio.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't require knowing nH and assumes that the ratio of H is the same as the ratio of Fe or Mg, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of the Sun's [Si/H], but given that the Sun's [Si/H] is not provided, I'm at a loss.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but no, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0 and Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider that the ratio of nH is the same as the ratio of Fe or Mg.

Wait, from Star_1: nFe_1 = (nFe_Sun /nH_Sun) *nH_1.

Star_2: nMg_2 = (nMg_Sun /nH_Sun) *nH_2.

But I don't know nFe_1 or nMg_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore variations in nH and proceed with the ratio.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is about the photospheric composition, and perhaps in the photosphere, the H is a major component, but since each star's photosphere could have different H, but without information, maybe the problem expects me to assume that the H density is the same in both stars. But that's not realistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio of H cancels out when taking the ratio of silicon.

Wait, in the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2, the H terms are in the numerator and denominator, so perhaps the nH_1 and nH_2 are the same? If that's the case, then the ratio would be 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is option A.

But why would the H densities be the same in two stars of different masses? That doesn't make sense. So that's a big assumption, but perhaps that's what the problem expects.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the given data again.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is required in terms of the Sun's composition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: express nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of the Sun's nSi and then take the ratio.

nSi_1 = 10^{[Si/H]_1} * nSi_Sun.

nSi_2 = 10^{[Si/H]_2} * nSi_Sun.

So the ratio would be 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}.

Wait, [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3. So 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6.

So 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

Ah! That makes sense. Because the Sun's nH_Sun is the same in both expressions, so when taking the ratio, nSi_Sun cancels out.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about this.

nSi_1 = (nSi_Sun / nH_Sun) * 10^{[Si/H]_1} *nH_1

nSi_2 = (nSi_Sun /nH_Sun) * 10^{[Si/H]_2} *nH_2.

So when I take the ratio:

nSi_1/nSi_2 = (10^{[Si/H]_1}/10^{[Si/H]_2}) ) * (nH_1 / nH_2 )

But without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, I can't compute it.

Wait, but in this alternative approach, I'm assuming that nH_1 = nH_2.

But the problem doesn't state that, so that's a big assumption. However, perhaps the problem is designed so that the ratio is simply based on the [Si/H] values, and the H terms cancel out.

Wait, but that's only possible if nH_1 =nH_2, which isn't stated.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have the same metallicity overall, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says that the stars are each 1.5 and 1.2 times the mass of the Sun. But mass isn't directly related to elemental abundance unless we're considering processes like galactic chemical evolution, but that's not mentioned here.

Perhaps the mass is a red herring, and the problem is solely about the given abundance ratios.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the H density is the same for both stars. So nH_1 =nH_2.

In that case, the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not confident because the stars have different masses, implying different total number of H atoms, but the photosphere is a thin layer, so perhaps the number densities are similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the nH terms, considering only the relative abundances.

In that case, the ratio would be 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6}=3.98.

So the answer would be option A, ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided data.

### Key Information:
1. **Abundance Ratios**:
   - For Star_1:  
     \([Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3\) dex, and \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\) dex.  
     This implies \([Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3\) dex.
   - For Star_2:  
     \([Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3\) dex, and \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\) dex.  
     Using \([Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H]\), we find \([Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = -0.3\) dex.

2. **Expression for Silicon Abundance**:
   The number density of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star can be expressed as:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si},1} / n_{\text{H},1} = 10^{[Si/H]_1} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,Sun}} / n_{\text{H,Sun}})
   \]
   \[
   n_{\text{Si},2} / n_{\text{H},2} = 10^{[Si/H]_2} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,Sun}} / n_{\text{H,Sun}})
   \]
   The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = \frac{10^{[Si/H]_1} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,Sun}} / n_{\text{H,Sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{H},1}}{10^{[Si/H]_2} \cdot (n_{\text{Si,Sun}} / n_{\text{H,Sun}}) \cdot n_{\text{H},2}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H},1}}{n_{\text{H},2}}
   \]

3. **Assumption About Hydrogen Density**:
   The problem does not provide information about the hydrogen density (\(n_{\text{H},1}\) and \(n_{\text{H},2}\)) in the two stars. To proceed, we assume that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars (\(n_{\text{H},1} = n_{\text{H},2}\)). This simplifies the ratio to:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}
   \]

4. **Substitute Values**:
   - \([Si/H]_1 = 0.3\), \([Si/H]_2 = -0.3\).  
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}
     \]
   - \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**. This corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
