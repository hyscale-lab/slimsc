Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A to D.

Hmm, first, I should probably sketch the structure of the target molecule to visualize where each substituent is. So benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me count: position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 has tert-butyl, and position 3 has nitro. Wait no, wait. Oh wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me see: the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So substituents at 1, 2, and 3 positions.

Now, the goal is to get all three groups attached to benzene in the correct positions. So I need to plan the synthesis steps, considering the directing effects of each group and the order in which they're added.

Benzene is the starting material. The substituents we're adding are tert-butyl, nitro, and ethoxy groups.

I remember that the nitro group is a strong meta-directing group, and the ethoxy is an ortho/para-directing group. The tert-butyl group is a bulky substituent and is an activating group? Wait, no. Wait, tert-butyl is an alkyl group, which is activating (since it's an electron-donating group via induction and hyperconjugation), so it's ortho/para directing.

Wait, but depending on when it's added, the directing can change. So the order in which we add substituents will influence where the next groups attach.

Let me think about the positions. The target has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, that's a bit confusing because numbers 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So let me imagine the benzene ring. Positions 1, 2, 3 are consecutive, which would make them adjacent. 

Wait, that might not be possible. Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, but each substituent is in a different position. But wait, if substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, their relative positions are adjacent. Hmm, but how are they arranged? Let me think: in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent, each next to each other. So the substituents would be at adjacent positions.

But wait, that's not possible because substituents are each in their own positions. Actually, it's a meta arrangement for some, but perhaps the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, which are adjacent. So their relative positions are 1-2 (ortho), 2-3 (ortho), and 1-3 (meta). So, the target molecule has substituents in adjacent positions.

Hmm, but that's a bit tricky because when adding substituents, each new group is directed by the existing groups. So the order of addition is critical.

Let me think about which substituents are best added first. The nitro group is a strong meta-directing, deactivating group. So if we add nitro first, then the next substituents would be directed accordingly. Alternatively, if we add the ethoxy group first, which is activating and ortho/para-directing, that might influence where the next groups go.

Wait, but the target has the ethoxy group at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So the substituent at position 2 is next to substituents at 1 and 3. So when adding the second substituent, it would be influenced by the existing substituents.

But wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group, so perhaps it's better added after ethoxy and tert-butyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe adding tert-butyl first would be better because it's a bulky group, which might affect where other substituents go.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's outline possible steps:

One approach is to plan the order of substituent addition, considering the directing effects.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro (NO2).

Let me consider each possible order.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But wait, once tert-butyl is attached, it directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions. But if ethoxy is added next, where would it go? Let's say we have a t-Bu group at a certain position. The next substitution (ethoxy) would enter ortho or para to t-Bu. Then, the third substituent (nitro) would be added, but where?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added earlier.

Option 2: Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Ethoxy is activating, so next substitution would be ortho, para. Then tert-butyl is added. Let's say the first substituent is ethoxy at position 1. Then, the next substituent (tert-butyl) would enter at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), or position 4 (para to ethoxy). Wait, but the target has t-Bu at position 2, adjacent to ethoxy at 1. So if ethoxy is first, adding tert-butyl ortho to it (position 2) would make sense. Then, the third substituent is nitro, which is at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (position 1) and t-Bu (position 2). Hmm, but nitro is a meta director. So after adding nitro, would it go in position 3?

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents, the directing can be complicated. So perhaps the order is: ethoxy, t-Bu, then nitro.

Wait, let me think step by step.

Step 1: Benzene → add ethoxy group. Since ethoxy is activating and ortho/para-directing, the benzene becomes ethoxybenzene.

Step 2: Add tert-butyl group. Where would it go? It depends on the existing substituents. Ethoxy is at position 1. So tert-butyl could be added at position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). Let's say it's added at position 2, ortho to ethoxy. Now the ring has ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2.

Step 3: Now add nitro group. Where would it go? The existing substituents are ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). The nitro is a meta director. So the available ortho and para positions relative to each substituent may influence where it goes.

But the target has nitro at 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). Wait, but that's a problem because nitro is meta directing. How can it be at position 3? Let me think about the possible positions.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider adding nitro next after ethoxy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps add nitro first. But nitro is a strong deactivating group, which would make the ring less reactive. Let's see:

Step 1: Add nitro to benzene. Nitration would give nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Next, add ethoxy. But nitro is meta-directing, so ethoxy would go in the meta position relative to nitro. That would be position 3 if nitro is at position 1.

Then, adding t-Bu. Ethoxy is ortho/para directing. So t-Bu could go into position 2 (ortho to ethoxy) or position 4 (para). But the target has t-Bu at position 2.

But then, in that scenario, the substituents would be nitro at 1, ethoxy at 3, t-Bu at 2, which would give the target structure. But wait, that would require adding t-Bu after ethoxy. Let's see:

So nitro at 1, ethoxy at 3 (meta to nitro?), but wait, no. Nitro is at 1, so ethoxy would go to 3 (meta) or 5 (para). Wait, but the ethoxy is at position 1 in the target. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me clarify.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro). So nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu at 2 and ethoxy at 1.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's number the ring so that substituent at 1 is ethoxy, 2 is t-Bu, and 3 is nitro. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, forming a sort of 1-2-3 trio.

So, the substituents are in a row. Now, how to get them there.

Another approach: perhaps the nitro group is added last because it's a strong deactivating group, making further substitution difficult.

Alternatively, maybe the order is ethoxy, then t-Bu, then nitro.

Wait, let's think about that. If ethoxy is added first, then t-Bu in the ortho position, then nitro. But where would the nitro go? Let's think about the directing effects.

After adding ethoxy (position 1) and t-Bu (position 2), the ring has two substituents. Now, when adding nitro, the existing substituents are ethoxy and t-Bu. Ethoxy is activating and directs ortho/para, while t-Bu is also activating (since it's an alkyl group) and directs ortho/para.

So, the available positions for nitration would be influenced by both groups. But nitro is a meta director, but in this case, when adding nitro as the third group, perhaps its position is determined by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added before the ethoxy. But then ethoxy would be added in the meta position to nitro, which might not align with the target structure.

Wait, maybe the correct order is adding t-Bu first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

Wait, but let me think about activating and deactivating groups. If I add nitro first, the ring becomes deactivating, making further substitution harder. So, perhaps better to add activating groups first.

So, ethoxy and t-Bu are activating groups, while nitro is deactivating. So the order could be: activate first with ethoxy and t-Bu, then add nitro as the last step.

So, step 1: add ethoxy to benzene → ethoxybenzene.

Step 2: add t-Bu to ethoxybenzene. Since ethoxy is ortho/para directing, t-Bu could go into ortho or para. Let's say it goes into ortho (position 2), making 2-t-Bu-ethoxybenzene.

Now, the substituents are ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). Now, adding nitro next. Where would nitro go? The ring is activated because ethoxy and t-Bu are activating. But nitro is a deactivating group. Wait, but the ring is already activated, so perhaps nitration is easier.

But the problem is, where would nitro attach? The existing groups are ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). Both are ortho/para directors. So, the possible positions for nitro would be positions 3, 4, or 5, but the target has nitro at 3.

Wait, let's see. If the positions are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), then position 3 is adjacent to both. So, the nitro could go into position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy. But since nitro is a meta director, perhaps that's the position.

Wait, but when adding nitro after ethoxy and t-Bu, the ring is activated by the two substituents. So nitration would occur in the most activated position.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the reaction options provided in the question and see which sequence makes sense.

The options provide a series of steps. Let's examine each option.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction step, but I'm not certain.

Wait, no. Fe/HCl is probably for a Sandmeyer reaction, but with what? Or maybe for some displacement.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step in the options.

Option D:

i) Nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe converting a nitro group to amine? No, Fe/HCl with nitrobenzene would typically lead to a reduction, but maybe in another context.

Wait, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Fe/HCl is used in some substitution reactions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option's steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the steps required to attach each substituent.

Wait, the target molecule has ethoxy, nitro, and t-Bu groups.

How are these groups introduced? Let's think.

t-Bu group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Ethoxy is introduced via nucleophilic substitution or perhaps via a nitration followed by something else.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, but Friedel-Crafts would be for alkylation, not for introducing an ether group. Alternatively, maybe via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires activating groups. Alternatively, perhaps via a substitution after making a nitro group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. Wait, benzene's ethoxy can be introduced via ethoxylation. Wait, maybe via a diethyl sulfate or something similar. Or perhaps via a SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), but that requires a good leaving group, which is usually achieved by making the ring strongly activated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis approach. Wait, but that's typically for making ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, but I'm a bit stuck on that. Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a diazonium salt coupling. No, that's for substituting with -Cl or other groups.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making a nitro group. For example, after nitration, perhaps reduce the nitro group to an amine, then perform some reaction to substitute the amine with an ethoxy group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, let me think again. The ethoxy group is OEt attached to benzene. So, to introduce an OEt group, maybe the benzene is first converted to a nitro group, then reduced to an amine, then undergoes some reaction to form an ether. Alternatively, perhaps it's introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using an ethoxy group, but that's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps via an alkyne intermediate or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again. Each option lists a series of steps, numbered i to ix.

Looking for which option correctly adds the substituents in the right order, considering directing effects and reaction conditions.

Let me consider the steps in each option.

Option D:

i) Nitration → benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: Fe in HCl is often used in the Sandmeyer reaction, which converts a nitro group to an amine or in some other substitution. Alternatively, Fe/HCl can reduce a nitro group to an amine. So step ii is nitro → amine.

Then, step iii: tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, benzene with amine substituent? Wait, the ring after step ii would have an amine group (NH2) where the nitro was. But AlCl3 is a Lewis acid catalyst for Friedel-Crafts, which requires activating groups. But an amine is strongly activating, so the ring should be reactive. So adding t-Bu would go into positions ortho or para to NH2.

Wait, but after that, step iv is another nitration. So after having t-Bu and NH2 groups, adding nitro again? But the target has only one nitro group. Hmm, maybe it's not the right path.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the target has three substituents: OEt, t-Bu, and NO2.

Looking for which option's steps lead to that.

Option D's steps are:

i) Nitration (NO2 added).

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iii) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation, adding t-Bu to benzene with NH2.

iv) Nitration again → adding another NO2.

But target has only one nitro group. So this can't be right. So option D seems to add two nitro groups, which isn't desired.

So perhaps D is incorrect.

Option B:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O, heat → hydrolysis, maybe to a nitro group.

Wait, but after several nitrations and reductions, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps this option adds nitro groups multiple times, which is not desired.

Option C:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Hmm, again, perhaps adding multiple nitro groups.

Option A:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+/H2O, heat → maybe another reaction.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps a substitution, like an SN2.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Hmm, this seems to involve multiple nitration steps, which might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the nitro group is introduced after other substituents. Let me think about the correct order of adding substituents.

The target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro groups. Ethoxy is OEt, which is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would give an acyloxy group, which would need to be transformed into OEt. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride, but AlCl3 is a Lewis acid for FC alkylation. But ethoxy is an ether, not an alkyl group. So perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be activated towards substitution. So perhaps the ring has strong activating groups, such as amino groups, which can make the ring activated enough for substitution.

But then, the steps would involve introducing a nitro group, then reducing it to amine, and then substituting the amine with ethoxy.

Wait, but how to substitute amine with ethoxy. Maybe via a diazonium salt. Let me think.

For example:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Treat aniline with ethylating agent, like ethyl chloride, in presence of NaOH → but wait, aniline is a strong base and may not undergo nucleophilic substitution easily. Alternatively, perhaps via diazonium salt formation.

Wait, another method: diazonium salt coupling. But that typically introduces azo groups, not ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring. For instance, using a good leaving group. So, if the ring has a nitro group, perhaps after nitration, we can substitute it with another group.

Alternatively, perhaps using a leaving group like a tosylate or similar.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the steps needed to add each substituent.

The target has three substituents: OEt (ethoxy), t-Bu (tert-butyl), and NO2 (nitro). The positions are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The plan is to add substituents in an order that allows each new group to direct the next substitution correctly.

Optionally, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy group first. Since ethoxy is activating and directs ortho/para.

2. Add t-Bu group in an ortho position to ethoxy (position 2), then add nitro in position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

But how would the nitro group be added after that? Let's see:

After adding ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2), the ring has two substituents. Now, adding nitro, which is a deactivating group.

The nitro group would prefer to go into the most activated position, which would be influenced by both ethoxy and t-Bu. Both are activating, so the ring is highly activated. Nitration would occur where the activating effects are strongest.

But the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2). So how does that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added before t-Bu. Let me think.

If I add nitro (3) first, then add ethoxy (1), which is ortho to nitro? Wait, nitro is meta directing, so if nitro is at position 3, ethoxy would go into position 1 (meta to nitro). Then, adding t-Bu in position 2 (ortho to ethoxy) would be possible.

Wait, let me outline this:

Step 1: Nitration → benzene → nitrobenzene (nitro at position 1).

Wait, but then step 2: adding ethoxy. Nitro is meta-directing, so ethoxy would go to position 3 (meta to nitro). But in the target, ethoxy is at position 1. Hmm, conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

Step 1: Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

Step 2: Add nitro → where? Ethoxy is ortho/para directing, so nitro could go into position 3 (meta to ethoxy). Wait, no. Wait, if ethoxy is at position 1, nitro would be added in either position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But target has nitro at 3, which is meta to ethoxy.

Wait, so that's a problem. So if ethoxy is first, nitro can't go into position 3 because that's meta, and ethoxy is ortho/para directing, so nitro would go into ortho or para.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the nitro group is added before ethoxy.

Wait, step 1: nitration → nitro at position 1.

Step 2: adding ethoxy. Nitro is meta directing, so ethoxy would go to position 3 (meta to nitro) or position 5 (also meta). Let's say it goes to position 3.

Step 3: add t-Bu. Now, the ring has nitro (1) and ethoxy (3). Nitro is meta, ethoxy is ortho/para.

So t-Bu would be directed by both. Nitro (1) is meta directing, so substituents would go to positions that are meta to it, but ethoxy (3) is ortho/para directing.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's imagine positions 1 (nitro), 3 (ethoxy). The positions available for t-Bu would be 2, 4, 5, or 6.

But in the target, t-Bu is at position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy (3) and adjacent to nitro (1). But that's a tricky position because nitro is a deactivating group, making the ring less reactive in the vicinity.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is ethoxy, then nitro, then t-Bu.

Wait, ethoxy first (position 1). Then nitro (position 3), which is meta to ethoxy. That makes sense because ethoxy is ortho/para, but nitro is being added as a meta director. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, no. Wait, when adding nitro after ethoxy, the ring is activated, so nitro would go where ethoxy directs. Ethoxy directs ortho/para, so nitro would go to position 2 or 4. But in the target, nitro is at 3, which is meta to ethoxy. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is added before ethoxy, but that leads to ethoxy being meta to nitro. Let's see:

Step 1: Nitro at position 1.

Step 2: Ethoxy at position 3 (meta to nitro).

Step 3: Now, add t-Bu. Where? The ring has nitro (1) and ethoxy (3).

t-Bu is an activating group, so we need to add it where?

The available positions are 2,4,5,6.

But the target has t-Bu at 2, which is ortho to ethoxy (3) and adjacent to nitro (1). But nitro is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive near position 1. But since t-Bu is a bulky group, perhaps it's added in the most activated position.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-Bu in ortho (position 2).

3. Add nitro in position 3, but how?

Wait, perhaps after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the ring is highly activated, so nitro can be added in position 3, which is adjacent to both.

But wait, position 3 is adjacent to t-Bu (position 2) and ethoxy (position 1), which are both activating groups. So the ring would be highly activated in that area, making nitration feasible.

So steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy → position 1.

2. Add t-Bu → position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Then nitration → position 3.

But wait, nitro is a deactivating group. After adding nitro, the ring becomes less reactive, but perhaps the steps are arranged so that nitro is added last.

So, the order would be ethoxy, t-Bu, then nitro.

Now, looking for an option that reflects this.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitration → adds nitro first.

Which would not fit the desired order.

Option C:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2 → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitration again.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Option B:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again.

Hmm, but again, multiple nitrations.

Option A:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitration.

iii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2 → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+ → H+ and heat.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitration.

This seems to involve multiple steps, including substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the steps needed to introduce ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activating group. So perhaps after adding nitro and t-Bu, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, and the ring must not have strong deactivating groups.

Wait, but if the ring has a nitro group, Friedel-Crafts won't work because nitro is deactivating. So perhaps the ethoxy is introduced before nitro.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about each option's steps and see which one could possibly form the target.

Looking at option D:

i) Nitration → add NO2.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

iii) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu via FC alkylation.

iv) Nitration → another NO2.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis, maybe to form a nitro group.

vii) H3O+/H2O, heat → perhaps hydrolysis of a diazonium salt to a carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitration.

This seems to involve multiple nitration steps, which might not align with the target.

Option C:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonation, adding a sulfonic acid group.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

v) NaNO2 → diazotization.

vi) HNO3 → nitration.

Hmm, again, multiple nitrations.

Option B:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to NH2.

iv) HNO3 → nitration.

v) NaNO2 → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitration.

This seems to have multiple steps, possibly adding multiple nitro groups, which isn't desired.

Option A:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitration.

iii) SO3 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2 → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+/H2O, heat → another reaction, perhaps hydrolysis to form a nitro group.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution, perhaps replacing a leaving group with OEt.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitration.

This sequence adds multiple nitro groups, which may not fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the step where the ethoxy group is introduced. So far, I haven't seen an introduction of an ethoxy group in any of the options. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the options incorrectly.

Wait, reviewing the options, perhaps there's a step involving ethoxy introduction.

Looking again at option A: steps i) to ix). Let me check each step.

Option A:

i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → maybe hydrolysis of a diazonium salt to produce a phenol, but then how to get ethoxy.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an ethoxy group is introduced via SN2 substitution, but in what context? Maybe replacing a -OSO3H group with OEt.

Wait, sulfonation (step iii) introduces a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H). Then, perhaps step iv) is diazotization, but that requires an amine.

Wait, perhaps in step iv), the nitro group is being converted to a diazonium salt. Then, in step v), it's hydrolyzed. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

i) Add t-Bu.

ii) Nitrate → add NO2.

iii) Sulfonate → add SO3H.

iv) Diazotize → convert NO2 to N2+.

v) Hydrolyze → maybe replace N2+ with OH (phenol).

vi) Treat with H3O+ and heat → perhaps acid hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps perform an SN2 substitution, replacing a leaving group (like a phenol) with OEt.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the steps are more about introducing the ethoxy group via a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an Williamson ether synthesis, but that's typically for making ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides.

Wait, perhaps step vii in option A is NaOH and EtBr, which is a classic condition for an SN2 substitution. So if there's a good leaving group, like a bromide, in the aromatic ring, EtBr would substitute it with ethoxy.

But where would the bromide come from?

Hmm, perhaps earlier steps introduce a bromine. But I don't see any step involving Br2 or a brominating agent. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are added in a way that allows the ethoxy to be introduced via substitution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with strong activating groups.

Wait, for example, if the ring has a nitro group, which is deactivating, but perhaps if the ring has multiple activating groups, substitution is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding t-Bu and nitro, the ring is activated enough for substitution, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the target structure again. The substituents are OEt (ethoxy), t-Bu, and NO2.

In the target, the order of substituents is OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, and NO2 at 3.

Which would mean that ethoxy is in position 1, t-Bu in 2, and nitro in 3. So, substituents are adjacent.

Now, looking for the correct sequence of steps to add these groups.

Assuming the correct order is ethoxy first, then t-Bu, then nitro.

So, the steps would involve:

1. Benzene → add OEt.

2. OEt benzene → add t-Bu (ortho to OEt).

3. t-Bu-OEt benzene → add NO2 in position 3.

So, how to do each step.

Adding OEt: perhaps via a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps via a Friedel-Crafts, but OEt isn't an alkyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the OEt group is added via a nucleophilic substitution. For that, the ring must have a good leaving group. But how to get that.

Wait, perhaps the OEt group is introduced via a coupling reaction after making a nitro group into an amine. For example:

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Nitrobenzene → reduction → aniline.

3. Aniline → treatment with ethyl chloride and NaOH → substitution of NH2 with OEt? But I'm not sure. Aniline is a strong base and may not undergo SN2 easily.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by hydrolysis, but that would yield a carboxylic acid, not OEt.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making a nitro group into a tosylate. Hmm, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

i) Add ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride and AlCl3 → but wait, Friedel-Crafts typically requires activating groups, and benzene can undergo FC alkylation, but I think FC alkylation tends to produce carbocation rearrangements, so maybe not the best for adding ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution where benzene is converted into a good leaving group, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to add the ethoxy group first.

So:

Step 1: Benzene → introduce ethoxy group → ethoxybenzene.

How? Perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution using an activating group. Wait, but benzene is not reactive enough for that. Alternatively, perhaps using a directing group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reaction, but that doesn't seem applicable.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a diazonium salt. For example, treating a nitrobenzene with something to convert it into an ethoxy group. But I don't recall a direct method for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, such as a Suzuki coupling, but that requires palladium catalysts and aryl halides, which aren't part of the given options.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me try to match the steps in the options to the necessary reactions.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iii) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → add t-Bu via FC.

iv) HNO3 → nitration again.

But target only has one nitro group.

Hmm, maybe option D adds the nitro group first, then reduces it, but that seems to be adding multiple nitro groups, which isn't desired.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not seeing why. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the steps in option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at position A.

ii) Reduction → amine at A.

iii) FC alkylation → t-Bu added in position ortho or para to amine.

iv) Nitration → nitro added in position.

Wait, but target has only one nitro group, so perhaps this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in option D are as follows:

i) Nitration adds nitro at position 3.

ii) Reduction converts nitro (3) to amine (3).

iii) FC alkylation adds t-Bu to ring. Since amine is activating, t-Bu would add ortho or para to amine (3). Let's say it adds at position 1.

iv) Nitration adds nitro at position 5 (meta to amine at 3) or position 1 (ortho to t-Bu). But target only has one nitro group.

Hmm, not aligning.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the correct order of substituents.

The target has substituents at 1,2,3. So, perhaps the substituents are added in the order of nitro, t-Bu, ethoxy.

Wait, no. Because nitro is meta-directing, which would complicate adding the other groups.

Alternatively, perhaps it's added as ethoxy, t-Bu, nitro.

So, step 1: add ethoxy → position 1.

Step 2: add t-Bu → position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

Step 3: add nitro → position 3 (adjacent to both).

But how is the nitro group added? After adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the ring is activated, so nitration can occur.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add t-Bu → meta to ethoxy? No, because ethoxy directs ortho/para.

Wait, ethoxy at 1, t-Bu would go to 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

In the target, t-Bu is at 2, so that's correct.

Then, nitro group is added at position 3.

But how? Because both ethoxy (1) and t-Bu (2) are activating and ortho/para directors.

So, when adding nitro, where would it go?

The available positions are 3,4,5,6.

But position 3 is adjacent to t-Bu (2) and ethoxy (1), which are both activating. So, position 3 would be highly activated, making it a favored position for nitration.

So, the steps would be:

1. Ethoxy → position 1.

2. t-Bu → position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Nitration → position 3.

Now, which option's steps match this order?

Looking at the options, the steps in option D are:

i) Nitration → adds nitro first.

Which doesn't fit.

Option B:

i) t-Bu Cl → adds t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitration.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro.

iv) HNO3 → another nitration.

Hmm, not matching.

Option C:

i) t-Bu Cl → adds t-Bu.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

Hmm.

Option A:

i) t-Bu Cl → adds t-Bu.

ii) HNO3 → nitration.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2 → diazotize.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+/H2O, heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitration.

Hmm, perhaps not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, but through a different pathway.

Let me think of each step in D:

i) Nitration → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to NH2.

iii) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 → FC alkylation adds t-Bu.

iv) HNO3 → nitration.

v) NaNO2 → diazotization.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix) HNO3 → nitration.

Hmm, perhaps too many steps with nitration.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D's steps result in the correct substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option D.

But wait, I'm not seeing the ethoxy group being introduced in any of the steps. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using NaOH and EtBr, as in step vii of option A and option B.

Yes, looking at option A:

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps this is where the ethoxy group is introduced.

If earlier steps have introduced a bromine atom, then NaOH and EtBr would substitute Br with OEt.

But where would the bromine come from?

Wait, perhaps in option D:

After nitration and reduction, the ring has NH2.

Then, adding t-Bu via FC alkylation.

But FC alkylation requires activating groups, which the ring has after reduction to amine.

So, adding t-Bu in ortho or para to NH2.

Then, perhaps another nitration, but target has only one nitro.

Hmm, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after making a nitro group into a leaving group.

Wait, but making nitro into a leaving group would require converting it into a diazonium salt, then perhaps a substitution.

But I'm not certain.

In conclusion, after a lot of thinking, I believe the correct option is D. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps option D is not correct, and the correct answer is option D. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

The target has substituents at 1, 2, 3. So, perhaps the order is:

1. Nitro added first → position 3.

2. Then ethoxy added in position 1 (meta to nitro).

3. Then t-Bu added in position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

But how to add ethoxy after nitro.

Wait, nitro is deactivating, so after nitration, the ring is less reactive. So adding ethoxy would be difficult unless there's a strong activating group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after nitro is added.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene → nitration → nitro at 3.

2. Reduction → NH2 at 3.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution → OEt at 1 (meta to NH2).

4. Add t-Bu via FC alkylation → t-Bu at 2 (ortho to OEt).

But how to reduce nitro to amine and then substitute amine with OEt.

Wait, but in the steps, perhaps:

i) Nitrate.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Add ethoxy via substitution.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a coupling reaction after the ring is activated.

But this is getting too complicated.

In the absence of a clear path, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option D. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not confident. I'm probably missing something.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, tert-butyl (t-Bu) at position 2, and nitro (NO₂) at position 3. The order of addition of these groups is critical due to the directing effects of the substituents. Ethoxy and tert-butyl are ortho/para-directing activating groups, while nitro is a meta-directing deactivating group. The substituents are arranged in adjacent positions (1, 2, and 3), which complicates the synthesis because the directing effects of the substituents must align to achieve the desired structure.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A:**
1. **t-Bu Cl/AlCl₃**: Adds tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring.
3. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonates the ring.
4. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotizes a nitro group.
5. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Additional hydrolysis or reaction.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes a leaving group with ethoxy.
8. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces a nitro group.
9. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring again.

This sequence involves multiple nitrations and reductions, which does not align with the target molecule, as it contains only one nitro group. Additionally, the ethoxy group is introduced late in the sequence, which may not align with the desired directing effects.

#### **Option B:**
1. **t-Bu Cl/AlCl₃**: Adds tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces a nitro group to an amine.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring again.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotizes a nitro group.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes a leaving group with ethoxy.
8. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces a nitro group.
9. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring again.

This sequence also involves multiple nitrations and reductions, which is inconsistent with the target molecule. The ethoxy group is introduced late in the sequence, and the steps do not clearly lead to the desired structure.

#### **Option C:**
1. **t-Bu Cl/AlCl₃**: Adds tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
2. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonates the ring.
3. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces a nitro group to an amine.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotizes a nitro group.
6. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring again.
7. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt.
8. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Additional hydrolysis or reaction.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes a leaving group with ethoxy.

This sequence also involves multiple nitrations and reductions, which is inconsistent with the target molecule. The ethoxy group is introduced late in the sequence, and the steps do not clearly lead to the desired structure.

#### **Option D:**
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces a nitro group to an amine.
3. **t-Bu Cl/AlCl₃**: Adds tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrates the ring again.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotizes a nitro group.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt.
7. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Additional hydrolysis or reaction.
8. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Additional hydrolysis or reaction.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes a leaving group with ethoxy.

This sequence also involves multiple nitrations and reductions, which is inconsistent with the target molecule. The ethoxy group is introduced late in the sequence, and the steps do not clearly lead to the desired structure.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all the options, none of the sequences clearly and correctly synthesize the target molecule 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** appears to be the closest match, as it involves steps that could potentially align with the desired substituent positions, despite the ambiguity in the exact sequence of reactions.
