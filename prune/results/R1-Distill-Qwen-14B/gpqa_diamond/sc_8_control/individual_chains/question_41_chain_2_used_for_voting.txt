Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let me think. The question is: A light beam propagates through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, I should consider relativity, maybe the velocity addition formulas from special relativity. But wait, this is about the speed of light. Oh right, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So regardless of the motion of the medium or the source, the observed speed of light should be c. But wait, wait—no, that's when the medium is at rest in the lab frame, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c over v. So normally, when glass is stationary, the light's speed is c/n. But in this case, the glass is moving. So does the velocity of the glass affect the speed of light as observed in the lab?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v = c/n. But the glass is moving at v = velocity of the glass. So from the lab frame, how does that add up?

Wait, can I use the velocity addition formula from relativity? The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is u = c/n. Then, from the lab frame, which is moving at v relative to the glass, what's the observed speed?

Wait, no. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass. Or wait, no. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, right? Oh wait, no, the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, but wait, the light is moving towards the observer, which is the lab frame. So the glass is moving towards the lab at velocity v. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the frame of the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. But wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. So the lab would see the light's velocity as u' = (v_light + v_glass) / (1 + (v_light * v_glass)/c² )

Wait, but wait, v_light in the glass's frame is (c/n). So substituting, u' = (c/(n) + v) / (1 + ( (c/(n)) * v ) / c² )

Simplify that denominator: 1 + (v c) / (n c² ) ) = 1 + v/(n c)

Wait, but c is 1 in the given problem. So that's 1 + v/(n * 1) = 1 + v/n.

So the numerator is (c/(n) + v ) which with c=1 is (1/n + v).

So u' = ( (1/n + v) ) / (1 + v/n )

Factor out 1/n from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (1 + n v ) / n
Denominator: (n + v ) / n

So u' becomes [ (1+nv)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1+nv)/(n + v )

Wait, but the options are for the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So the speed would be (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which matches this.

But wait, wait, but the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but when the glass is moving, does that affect the speed? Or is the speed of light in the medium always c/n regardless of the medium's motion, but in that case, the observer would see the light's speed as c, not c/n.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the frame here. Because in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed v = c/n. When the glass is moving at speed v_glass relative to the lab, the lab would see the light's speed as u = (v + v_glass) / (1 + (v v_glass)/c² )

Wait, but in that case, since light speed is always c in any frame, that formula would make u = c.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. So which is it?

Wait, I must be making a mistake. Let me think again. If in a medium, the light is moving at speed v = c/n, then in the rest frame of the medium, the light's speed is c/n. But from the lab frame, which is moving with speed u relative to the medium, what is the speed of the light?

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So regardless of the medium's motion, the observed speed of light should be c.

Wait, but that's in a vacuum. What about in a medium? Oh, wait, that's where I might be getting confused.

Wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass. So in the glass, the light propagates at v = c/n. But the glass itself is moving. So, from the lab frame, does that change the speed of light in the glass?

Wait, maybe I should think about it as: the medium (glass) is moving, but the speed of light in the medium is still c/n. Because the medium's motion shouldn't affect the light's speed within it, only its direction and other properties.

Wait, but that can't be right because when the medium is moving, the light's velocity relative to the lab would change. Oh wait, but the speed of light is always c in the lab frame, regardless of the medium. So the velocity of the medium doesn't change the speed of light in the lab frame. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, no, because the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So when the medium is moving, the lab frame would see the light's speed as different. Wait, no, because in the lab frame, the light speed must be c. So perhaps the medium's movement affects the direction, but not the speed.

Wait, but if the glass is moving, then the light's speed relative to the lab could change, but according to relativity, the speed of light in any frame must still be c. So the previous calculation, which gave (1+ nv)/(n + v), which with c=1, is (1 +n v)/(n + v ). But if the actual speed must be c, then that expression must be equal to 1.

Wait, let's check: (1 +n v)/(n +v ) = 1 ?

(1 +n v) = n +v → 1 +n v = n +v → 1 = n +v -n v → 1 = n (1 -v) + v → Not generally true. So that would imply that the speed in the lab frame is not c, which contradicts relativity. So I'm making a mistake here.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is that regardless of the medium's motion, the speed of light in the lab frame is always c. So the answer should be 1, which is option B.

Wait, but that doesn't take into account the medium's motion. Because in the medium's rest frame, light is moving at c/n. So when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed in the lab?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the approach. Let me recall: the speed of light in a medium is c/n. But according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame must be c. So when the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame must still be c. So the answer is 1, option B.

But wait, that seems conflicting with the earlier approach. Hmm. So maybe the velocity addition formula isn't the right approach here because the speed of light can't exceed c. So perhaps the correct answer is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be classical, not relativistic. Because the options don't all equal 1, so maybe the question is assuming Galilean addition.

Wait, if we use the Galilean velocity addition, which is u = u' + v, where u' is the velocity in the medium's frame. In this case, u' is c/n, and the medium is moving at v towards the observer. Then u = (c/n) + v.

Wait, but that would be option A, but without the denominator. Wait, no, the options are A) (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which for Galilean addition with c=1 and u' =1/n, then u = v +1/n. So that's different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it more carefully. Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. Inside the glass, the light's speed is c/n. So from the lab's perspective, the light would be moving at (c/n + v) if using Galilean addition. But this would be incorrect in relativity because it would exceed c for certain velocities.

Wait, but according to relativity, the correct formula would involve the Lorentz transformation, not Galilean. So the Lorentz velocity addition formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

In this case, u' is the speed of light in the medium's frame, which is c/n. So substituting, u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c ) → since c=1, it's 1 + v/n.

So u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + v/n )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

But wait, according to relativity, the speed of light observed in the lab must be c. But according to this calculation, u is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is only equal to 1 if 1+nv = n +v → 1 = n (1) +v (1) - nv → 1 = n +v (1 -n )

Hmm, which isn't generally true. So that suggests a problem. Because according to relativity, the lab should measure the speed as c, but according to the formula, it's (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is only c if that equals 1.

Wait, but that can't be right. So perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption. Because in the medium's frame, the speed of light is c/n, but when applying the Lorentz transformation, the speed of light must still come out as c in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it another way. Let's take the case where the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light.

In the medium's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n.

Using the Lorentz transformation, what is the speed in the lab frame?

So the Lorentz transformation for velocity is:

u = [u' + v ] / [1 + (u' v) / c² ]

Here, u' is the speed in the medium's frame, which is c/n.

So substituting:

u = [ c/n + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v)/(n c )

Since c=1, denominator becomes 1 + v/(n)

So,

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/(n) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

But according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab must be c. So when I plug in u = c, let's see if that's the case.

Set (1 +n v)/(n +v )=c=1.

Which gives 1 +n v = n +v → 1 = n +v (1 -n )

Which is only true if v = (1 -n)/(1-n) ) → which isn't generally true.

Wait, so this suggests a contradiction. So perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in the lab is always c, so regardless of the medium's motion, the speed is c.

But how does that reconcile with the velocity addition formula giving u = (1 +n v)/(n +v )? It must be that this formula is incorrect because the initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the application of the velocity addition formula. Because in reality, the velocity of light in the medium's frame might not be c/n when the medium is moving. Hmm, but that can't be right because in the medium's rest frame, the speed is c/n.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the frames wrong. The lab is the rest frame, and the medium is moving at velocity v. So the medium's frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the lab.

Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v in the lab. So the lab is the rest frame, and the glass is moving at v towards the observer. So the medium's frame (glass) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab.

So in the medium's frame, the light's speed is c/n towards the observer. So when transformed to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity -v (since the medium is moving at v towards the lab), the light's speed is u.

Wait, using the Lorentz transformation, the velocity in the lab frame is:

u = [u_medium + v_medium] / [1 + (u_medium * v_medium)/c² ]

Wait, no, the correct formula is u = [u_medium + v ] / [1 + (u_medium * v)/c² ]

But wait, that's when the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab.

In this case, u_medium is the speed of light in the medium's frame, which is c/n.

So substituting:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + v/(n c )

Since c=1,

Denominator is 1 + v/(n )

So,

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + v/(n) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

But according to relativity, the speed observed in the lab should be c. So why is this conflicting?

Ah, wait, perhaps the confusion is that the speed of light in the medium's frame is c/n, but when the medium is moving, the lab frame sees the light moving at c in the same direction. So the calculation must give u = c, which would require (1 +n v)/(n +v )=1.

But that only holds when 1 +n v = n +v → 1 = n +v (1 -n ). Which is only possible for specific v and n. So this suggests that our approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in the lab frame is always c, regardless of the medium's motion. So the answer is option B, speed is 1.

But that doesn't seem to fit with the velocity addition formula, which suggests that the speed would be (1 +n v)/(n +v ). So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the problem is about the speed of light in the glass, not the speed of the light as observed in the lab. Wait, no, the question says 'speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory'. So that should be the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, but according to relativity, that speed must be c. So regardless of n, the observed speed is always c. So the correct answer would be 1, option B.

But why did the velocity addition formula give a different result?

Ah, perhaps because the velocity addition formula applies to the velocity of objects in the medium, not the speed of light. Because the speed of light is a universal constant and doesn't conform to the velocity addition formula.

Wait, that can't be right because the velocity addition formula is specifically derived to ensure that the speed of light remains c in any frame. So if you plug in u' =c, then u would be c, regardless of the medium's velocity.

So perhaps in our calculation, when u' is c, then u would be c. But in the problem, u' is c/n, which is less than c. So that's why the formula gives a different value.

But that implies that our initial assumption is incorrect because in reality, even when the medium is moving, the observed speed of light is c. So perhaps the correct answer is 1, and the velocity addition formula is not applicable because the medium's own motion affects the light's speed in a way that's not captured by a simple addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes a non-relativistic approach, where the speed is simply additive.

Wait, but the options are given, and option B is 1, which is c.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the speed of light within the glass, not as observed in the lab.

Wait, no, the question is about the speed relative to the observer in the lab. So the lab is the rest frame, and the glass is moving at v towards the observer, while the light is also moving towards the observer in the same direction.

Hmm, another approach: consider that in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v. The light inside the glass has velocity u. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. But the glass is moving at v, so by Galilean addition, the lab frame would see the speed as u = (c/n) + v.

But if n is greater than 1, and v is positive, then u could be greater than c, which is impossible. So that approach must be wrong.

So the correct approach must involve relativistic velocity addition. So the speed observed in the lab is (1 +n v)/(n +v ).

But according to relativity, the speed of light must be c, so perhaps the only way this makes sense is if (1 +n v)/(n +v )=1 → which is only possible when n v (n +v -1 -nv )=0 → which doesn't hold generally.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about a specific example. Let's say n=1 (vacuum), v=0. Then the speed is 1, which is correct.

If the glass is stationary, then the speed in lab is 1/n. But if n=1, then speed is 1, which is correct.

Wait, but wait, when n=1, the glass is vacuum, moving at v. So according to the formula, the speed is (1 +1*v)/(1 +v )= (1 +v)/(1 +v )=1, which is correct.

Another case: n=2, v=0. Then the speed is (1 +0)/(2 +0 )=1/2=0.5, which is correct, since speed in glass is c/2.

Now, if the glass is moving at v=0.5 (so v=0.5), then the speed according to formula is (1 +2 *0.5)/(2 +0.5 )= (1 +1)/(2.5 )= 2/2.5= 0.8. Which is less than c=1, which is okay.

But according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab should be c, but according to this formula, it's 0.8. So this is a contradiction.

Ah, so perhaps the formula is correct, but the confusion is about what is being measured.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the phase velocity of light in the medium, which can be greater than c in certain conditions, but the group velocity is what's physically transmitted, and that's always ≤c.

Wait, but in this case, the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion, so perhaps it's the group velocity that's being considered.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is B) 1, because according to relativity, the observed speed is always c. So regardless of the medium's motion, the observer measures light speed as c.

But I'm not entirely sure. Because the problem is about the speed of light in the glass. Wait, the glass is moving, but the light is moving through the glass. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be c, not the speed within the medium.

Wait, no. Because the speed of light in the medium is c/n, but the medium's motion could affect the observed speed. But according to relativity, the observed speed of light is always c, regardless of the medium's motion.

Wait, but that must be the case because the speed of light is a fundamental constant. So if the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is still c.

Therefore, the correct answer is B) 1.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the light is in the glass, which is moving. How does that affect the speed? Oh, wait, perhaps the speed is c, regardless of the medium's motion. So the answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \), and it is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. The speed of light in a medium is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum. However, the motion of the medium affects the observed speed of light in the laboratory frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativity of Light Speed**: According to the theory of relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is always \( c \), regardless of the motion of the medium or the observer. This is a fundamental principle of special relativity.

2. **Velocity Addition Formula**: While the relativistic velocity addition formula is used to transform velocities between frames, it ensures that the speed of light remains \( c \) in all inertial frames. Applying the velocity addition formula to the speed of light in the glass's frame (\( \frac{c}{n} \)) would not change the observed speed of light in the laboratory frame.

3. **Contradiction with Options**: The given options suggest different expressions for the speed of light, including \( \frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \) (Option A) and \( 1 \) (Option B). However, according to relativity, the observed speed of light in the laboratory frame must always be \( c \), which corresponds to \( 1 \) when \( c = 1 \).

4. **Conclusion**: Despite the motion of the glass, the speed of light in the laboratory frame remains \( c \). This aligns with the principles of special relativity and rules out the other options, which do not account for the universal constancy of the speed of light.

### Final Answer:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( 1 \), as the speed of light is always \( c \) in any inertial frame.

**Answer: B**
