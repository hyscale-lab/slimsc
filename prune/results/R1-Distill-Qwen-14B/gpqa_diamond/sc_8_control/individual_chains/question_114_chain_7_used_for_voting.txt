Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and see if I can figure it out.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents from the given options. Let's break it down.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, what's happening here? I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of the cyanide ion, CN⁻. So the CN⁻ would attack the carbonyl carbon. 

But what's the next step? In the product, we have a hydroxy group and a nitrile. Oh, wait! I think this is a case of the cyanide acting as a nucleophile in a nucleophilic addition, forming a cyanohydrin. So the mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen becomes an alkoxide, then the CN⁻ adds to the carbonyl carbon, pushing the electrons to form an oxide which then picks up a proton from the surrounding solution.

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. So the structure would have a nitrile group (CN) and a hydroxyl group (OH) on the same carbon, which is the former carbonyl carbon. So the reaction must be forming a cyanohydrin.

So the reagent A is probably an acid because after the addition of CN⁻, the alkoxide needs to get protonated. Usually, you'd add an acid to protonate the oxygen. So A could be H3O+ (which is H+ in water, so that's an acid).

Wait, but another possibility is that the reaction uses a sulfonic acid as a catalyst, but in the options given, the possible As are H3O+ and NaHSO3. Hmm.

Wait, but I think the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the reagents would be NaCN and an acid like H3O+ (so option A or B). So for the first part, A is H3O+.

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, and C and D have NaHSO3 as A. So probably, A is H3O+.

So the first part is handled with A as H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile (butanenitrile) with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. Then it's being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids. But what conditions are those? Oh, right, typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed in acidic or basic conditions. But wait, in this case, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile.

Wait, the starting structure is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the molecule is (CH2CH2CH2)CN with a hydroxyl group on C2. Wait, no, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is:

O
|
O-C(CN)(OH)(CH3)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the molecule has a hydroxyl and a cyano group on the same carbon.

Now, in the second reaction, this molecule is treated with reagent B in H2O to form the corresponding carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but nitriles can be hydrolyzed to form amides or carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical conditions for converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid are strong acidic or basic conditions with heat. For example, in the presence of H2SO4 and H2O with heat (like the Stephen reduction? No, wait, that's for ketones to aldehydes. Alternatively, the hydrolysis of nitriles using H2O and HCl or H2SO4 as catalysts.)

Wait, but in this case, the hydroxyl group is on the same carbon as the nitrile. So perhaps the nitrile group is being oxidized to a carboxylic acid. But wait, oxidation of a nitrile usually requires specific conditions. Alternatively, hydrolysis of the nitrile group in the presence of a strong acid could convert it to a carboxylic acid.

So what reagent B would cause this transformation? The options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, HCl again, or CH3COOH again.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option A: B is HCl.

Option B: B is CH3COOH.

Option C: B is HCl.

Option D: B is CH3COOH.

Wait, but the second reaction uses B (H2O) as a reagent. So perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis in acidic conditions.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So perhaps the nitrile is undergoing hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, but the hydroxyl group is already present, so maybe the two are on the same carbon, making it a geminal diol? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the reaction converts the nitrile (CN) group into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group. So that's nitrile → carboxylic acid. How is that done?

One common way is hydrolysis of the nitrile under strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, in aqueous HCl with heat, or in aqueous NaOH with heat. The acidic hydrolysis of nitriles typically uses a strong acid like H2SO4 as a catalyst, along with water and heat. Once hydrolyzed, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid.

But in the given reaction, the reagent B is in H2O. So perhaps B is an acid catalyst. So in this case, if B is HCl, it would provide the acidic conditions.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile must have undergone hydrolysis. So the conditions would be either HCl and H2O (acidic) or perhaps another strong acid.

Looking at the options, the possible B reagents are either HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). Which one would facilitate the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

I think that for acidic hydrolysis of nitriles, you typically use a strong acid like H2SO4, but in the absence of H2SO4, perhaps a solution of HCl can act as the acid catalyst. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a buffered condition, but more likely, HCl would be the acid needed.

So, for the second reaction, B is HCl, which is option A or C.

Wait, but looking back, in the first reaction, the reagent A was H3O+ (like HCl or another acid). So which option fits that?

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl.

Wait, but in the first reaction, we had to use H3O+ as the acid for the cyanohydrin formation. So in that case, option A would have A as H3O+ and B as HCl. So that would be the case where the first reaction uses H3O+ and the second uses HCl.

But wait, let me think again. The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN in presence of A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So this is a cyanohydrin formation. The reaction conditions for making cyanohydrins are usually an acid catalyst because the CN⁻ acts as a nucleophile, and the carbonyl oxygen is deprotonated, so adding H+ (acid) would protonate the intermediate.

So, in the first step, A must be an acid. So when the options have A as H3O+ (like options A and B), or NaHSO3 (options C and D). Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate. It's a source of H+ (since it's a strong acid's salt). So NaHSO3 in water would provide H+ ions. So either H3O+ or NaHSO3 would act as an acid catalyst for the first reaction.

Wait, but the question's first reaction's product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So in the formation of the cyanohydrin, the conditions are usually an acid (like H2SO4, H3O+). So both H3O+ and NaHSO3 (which provides H+ when dissolved) would be possible for A.

Hmm, so then for the second reaction, which reagent B is needed to convert the nitrile into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction uses a mild acid. Let me think: when a nitrile is treated with dilute acid and water, perhaps under reflux, it can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Stronger acids might be needed for more stubborn nitriles.

Alternatively, maybe the second reaction uses a different approach. Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a molecule where the nitrile is attached to a carbon that already has a hydroxyl group. So the structure is something like:

Ph-CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, or perhaps it's more like:

Ph-CH2-C(OH)(CN)(CH2CH2? Not sure, but the main point is that the nitrile is on a carbon adjacent to a hydroxyl group.

Wait, maybe the second reaction is not a hydrolysis of the nitrile but another type of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is being oxidized. But oxidation of nitriles typically requires strong oxidizing agents, like KMnO4 under acidic conditions, and would form a carboxylic acid.

But the reagent B is H2O. Wait, but then what's the role of B? Oh, the question says B is H2O, but perhaps it's a typo, and B is another reagent, like an acid? Wait, no. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

Wait, maybe B is the reagent, and H2O is present. Alternatively, perhaps the reagent is B in H2O. Hmm, perhaps the description is that the reaction uses B, which is H2O, but that might not make sense. Or perhaps B is the catalyst, and the solvent is H2O.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking back, the options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, HCl, or CH3COOH. So which one of these would be the acid for hydrolyzing the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

If the reaction conditions for the second step are acidic, then using HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid) as the acid would make sense.

In the first step, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. If A is H3O+, then option A or B would have that. If A is NaHSO3, then options C or D.

But I think for the cyanohydrin formation, H3O+ (option A or B) is the correct A. So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

So looking at the options, A is either in options A or B.

Now, for the second reaction, which uses B. Let's consider what reagent B is.

If B is HCl, the conditions are strongly acidic. If B is CH3COOH, it's a weaker acid. So which one is better for the nitrile hydrolysis?

I think that hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acid conditions. For example, using HCl in water under reflux. Alternatively, using H2SO4 as a catalyst.

So, if B is HCl, that would provide the acidic conditions needed for the nitrile hydrolysis.

So putting this together, for the first reaction, A is H3O+; for the second reaction, B is HCl. So looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

So that would mean in the first reaction, H3O+ is used, which is correct. The second reaction uses HCl, which is correct for the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, what if reagent A is NaHSO3? If A is NaHSO3, then that would provide H+ in solution as well (since NaHSO3 → Na+ + HSO3⁻, which can donate H+). So NaHSO3 could also act as an acid catalyst for the first reaction.

Wait, but in the first reaction, you're adding NaCN and the acid. So if the acid is H3O+, that's a strong acid. If it's NaHSO3, that's a milder acid. Are there any conditions where NaHSO3 is used for cyanohydrin formation? I'm not sure. Maybe either could work, but I think the more common reagent for such reactions is H3O+.

So sticking with option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A says B=HCl, which is correct for the second reaction. So option A would be the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options.

### Reaction 1: 
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where NaCN acts as the nucleophile, and the carbonyl carbon of butan-2-one reacts with CN⁻ to form a cyanohydrin. The reaction requires an acid to protonate the intermediate alkoxide formed after the nucleophilic attack. The suitable acid for this reaction is H₃O⁺, as it provides the necessary H⁺ ions to complete the reaction. Therefore, **A = H₃O⁺**.

### Reaction 2: 
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires acidic conditions. Among the given options, HCl is a strong acid that can provide the necessary acidic environment for this transformation. Therefore, **B = HCl**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions.  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While A is correct, CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weaker acid and less suitable for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in the second reaction.  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  NaHSO₃ can act as an acid, but H₃O⁺ is more commonly used for cyanohydrin formation.  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Both reagents are less suitable compared to H₃O⁺ and HCl.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** and **B = HCl**, which correspond to **Option A**.
