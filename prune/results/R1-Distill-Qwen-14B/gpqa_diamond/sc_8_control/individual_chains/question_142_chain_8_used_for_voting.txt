Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take my time to think through it.

The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubit space. The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me try to recall.

Wait, a density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1 and be idempotent (ρ² = ρ), right? But this ρ is given as an average of |0⟩ and |1⟩. Oh wait, maybe it's a mixed state. Because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal, so when you take the average, you get a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

So, let me write this out. The standard basis for a qubit is |0⟩ and |1⟩, which correspond to the computational basis. The density matrix ρ would then be:

ρ = (1/2) |0⟩⟨0| + (1/2) |1⟩⟨1|.

Expressed in matrix form, since |0⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |1⟩ is [0, 1]^T, their outer products would be:

|0⟩⟨0| = [[1,0],[0,0]]
|1⟩⟨1| = [[0,0],[0,1]]

So adding them together and multiplying by 1/2 gives ρ as [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. That's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. I think qubit space is represented as a point in a Bloch sphere, which is a way to visualize qubit states. The Bloch sphere is a unit sphere in three-dimensional space, where each point corresponds to a quantum state.

Wait, but Bloch sphere representation applies to pure states, right? Because a pure state can be written as a vector on the surface of the unit sphere. What about mixed states? Oh, right, for mixed states, it's a statistical mixture, not a point on the Bloch sphere. Instead, perhaps the density matrix can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere, where the purity determines how close it is to the surface.

So for the given density matrix, which is a completely mixed state, each basis state has equal probability. This should correspond to the maximally mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. Because any coherent information is lost, the state is as mixed as it can be.

The Bloch sphere's center is at the origin, which is (0,0,0) in three-dimensional coordinates. So the point r would be (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, let me think again. Is the Bloch vector for a density matrix defined differently? For a qubit, the density matrix can be written using the Bloch vector r, scaled by the Pauli matrices. The density matrix can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So if I have ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Comparing this with the given ρ, which is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], which is the same as (I + 0·σ_x + 0·σ_y + 0·σ_z)/2. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). So that's the center.

Yes, that makes sense. So the geometrical position is at the origin, which is option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In matrix form, it is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \), i.e., 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a single qubit, the Bloch sphere provides a geometric representation of quantum states. Pure states correspond to points on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while mixed states correspond to points inside the sphere. The center of the Bloch sphere, at \((0,0,0)\), represents the maximally mixed state. Since the given density matrix describes a maximally mixed state, it corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space is at the origin, \( r = (0,0,0) \).
