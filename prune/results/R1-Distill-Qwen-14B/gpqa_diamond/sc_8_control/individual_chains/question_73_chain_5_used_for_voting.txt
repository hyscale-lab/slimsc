Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about relativistic speeds and total energy for two astronauts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think it through.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the same direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed when dealing with relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because velocities don't add that way when they're close to the speed of light. So I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. It's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Both are moving in the positive x-direction, so v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

Plugging in the numbers: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute the numerator first: 0.1c. The denominator? 1 minus (0.3c²)/c² is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. So that's about 0.14c when rounded. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. Wait, so for each, I need to calculate gamma.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma1 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.36 c²)/c²) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

The second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c), gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So their energy is gamma2 *3m c² = approx 3.464 m c².

Adding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 m c². Wait, looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is less.

So the correct answer should be option C. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, relative velocity calculation: (0.6 -0.5)=0.1c. Denominator 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 0.7. 0.1/0.7 is approximately 0.1428, so about 0.14c. Yep, that's correct.

Energies: First astronaut's gamma is 1.25, times 2m gives 2.5. Second's gamma is about 1.1547, times 3m gives 3.464. Sum is about 5.964. So E≈5.96 mc², which is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, the problem says "the total energy of the system." But in relativity, energy depends on the frame of reference. Oh wait, but the question is probably considering each astronaut's rest frame energy? Or adding their energies as observed from the same frame.

Hmm, no, the problem states that the two astronauts are moving at those speeds. So perhaps in the same frame. So the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each.

Yes, so I think option C is correct.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative velocity between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\).

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \(2m\), speed = \(0.6c\).
- \(\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25\).
- Energy: \(E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2\).

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \(3m\), speed = \(0.5c\).
- \(\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5c)^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547\).
- Energy: \(E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2\).

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\),
- \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

This matches **Option C**.
