Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems.

The question is about identifying Compound X, which reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at a certain temperature. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what X is based on that.

First, let me recap what I know. The reaction conditions might be important. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Hofmann elimination reaction. Hofmann elimination typically occurs in amide compounds, leading to the formation of alkenes by removing a small substituent (like an amide group) and forming a double bond. So, if Compound X is reacting under these conditions, it's likely an epoxide or maybe an oxetane, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide that's undergoing elimination.

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also known as DABCO. I think it's used in the formation of epoxides or maybe in elimination reactions. Oh, right! It's a base that can facilitate elimination reactions, like the epoxide opening, but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, it might be involved in the shibasaki elimination or some other type of reaction.

Then, looking at the product's NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's list them:

- δ 2.28: 3H, singlet. That's probably a CH3 group attached to something that doesn't split the signal, like an electronegative atom or a ring where the protons are equivalent.
- δ 2.31: Another 3H singlet. So two methyl groups, maybe?
- δ 6.75: 1H, doublet. Hmm, aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton.
- δ7.08: 2H, doublet. More aromatic protons, perhaps part of a para-substituted group or something with two protons in a coupling pattern.
- δ7.68: 1H, doublet.
- δ7.71: 2H, doublet.

The 13C NMR has carbons at various shifts:

- 21.3 and 28.4: These are probably quaternary carbons or maybe CH3 groups. Wait, the 21.3 is a singlet, so maybe a CH3 attached to something that doesn't split the signal, like an electronegative group or part of a ring structure.
- 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C), 197.7 (1C). Those are typical for aromatic carbons, carbonyls, and maybe an oxygen-bearing carbon.

Wait, the 197.7 ppm is a strong indicator. I remember that carbonyl groups, especially ketones, are around 200-220 ppm. But wait, wait: no, that's not right. Wait, carbonyls like ketones are in the 205-220 range for 13C NMR. Wait, but wait, 197 is a bit lower. Let me think: maybe an ester or an amide? Or, wait, perhaps a carbonyl from an epoxide? No, epoxides are ethers, so their carbons are around 50-70 ppm or so. Hmm.

Wait, actually, wait. Wait, another thought: the carbonyl group in an epoxide isn't present. So maybe that 197.7 is a ketone. Or perhaps an acetylenic carbon? No, those are higher. Wait, maybe a carbonyl in an aromatic ring substituent. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl, like in a styryl group.

Wait, looking back at the 1H NMR, there's a singlet at 2.28 and 2.31, each for 3H. So two methyl groups. Maybe one is attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an epoxide. Or perhaps they're both attached to a ring or something.

Looking at the options provided:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all the options are oxirane derivatives, which are epoxides. So, the product must be an epoxide, but wait, the reaction is between X and DABCO. Wait, maybe X is an epoxide, and DABCO is doing something else? Or perhaps the reaction is an opening of the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps Compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is a ring-opening. But I'm not sure. Wait, Hofmann elimination typically involves amides, but maybe in this case, the reaction is different.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the product's NMR. The product after reaction with DABCO.

The 1H NMR has two singlets for 3H each. So two methyl groups. Let's think about the structure. The aromatic signals suggest a substituted benzene ring. The 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). Wait, that looks like a para-substituted ring with perhaps some coupling. Let's think about the coupling patterns.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- The 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) could be trans protons in a double bond. Alternatively, maybe they are adjacent in a ring. Let me think about a vinyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a styryl group (a benzene ring attached to a double bond). For styryl groups, the protons on the double bond typically show up around 6.5-7.5 ppm, depending on substituents.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows a carbon at 197.7. That's a high value. Wait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think: carbonyl groups in ketones are about 205-220, but maybe a conjugated carbonyl is lower. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide carbonyl? No, epoxides are ethers, so they don't have carbonyls. Hmm.

Wait, wait, maybe it's a carbonyl in an ester or a ketone. But the product is from the reaction of X with DABCO, which is a ring-opening maybe.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Let me think about the 13C NMR. The 197.7 is a single carbon. Could that be an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an carbonyl? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the 197.7 is a carbonyl from a ketone. If so, that would imply that the product has a ketone group. How?

Wait, let's think about the options. Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So, it's an epoxide with a styryl group (a benzene ring attached via a double bond to an epoxide).

But how would that structure look? Let's imagine the epoxide is between two carbons, and one of them is attached to a double bond leading to a benzene ring.

The 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So perhaps the structure has two methyl groups attached to something.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the oxirane (epoxide) is at position 2, and the styryl group is at position 4 with a methyl. So the structure would have a benzene ring with a double bond connected to the epoxide, and a methyl group in the para position of the benzene.

In that case, the NMR would show a singlet for the methyl group attached to the benzene. So in the 1H NMR, the two singlets (2.28 and 2.31) would correspond to two different methyl groups.

Wait, but 4-methylstyryl would only have one methyl, right? So how come there are two singlet methyls in the product's NMR?

Hmm, perhaps I'm looking at it wrong. Let me think about each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide (oxirane) ring, with one of the oxygens attached to a carbon that's part of a double bond leading to a benzene ring. The benzene ring has a methyl group in the para position (relative to the double bond).

In that case, the structure would have a benzene ring with a CH2 group attached via a double bond to the epoxide. Wait, no, styryl is a vinyl group attached to benzene. So the structure would be O-CH2-C-O (epoxide) attached to a CH2-CHPh group, where the benzene has a methyl in the para position.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Styryl is a benzene ring with a vinyl group. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-C-O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH-O-O-C.

Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH-O-O-CH2, but no, that's not an epoxide. Wait, an epoxide is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen. So the structure would be O linking two carbons: one connected to the styryl group and another.

Wait, maybe the structure is like this: the epoxide has two carbons. One of them is connected to a styryl group (Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-... No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C-O-C

Where the first C is connected to the styryl group. So the styryl group is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-C-O?

Wait, no, that can't be. Styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH-.

Ah, I see. So styryl is Ph-CH=CH-. So if the epoxide is attached to the CH=CH group, then the structure would be something like Ph-CH=CH-O-CH2-C-O. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, let me get this straight. An oxirane (epoxide) is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen. So the structure would be:

O
||
C1-O-C2

In the case of styryl oxirane, one of the carbons (say C1) is connected to a styryl group (Ph-CH2-CH2-?), but wait, styryl is Ph-CH=CH-. So, perhaps C1 is attached to a CH2 group which is part of a double bond leading to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the group is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-C-O? No, that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is O-C-C-O (the epoxide), where one of the C is connected to a CH2-CHPh group. So the epoxide is at the end of a propenyl group attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, maybe I need to draw this mentally. Let's think of the epoxide as a three-membered ring: O connected to two carbons, C1 and C2, which are connected to each other. Suppose C1 is connected to a CH2 group, which is part of a double bond (CH2-CH2 is not a double bond, but CH2-CHPh would have a double bond if it's styryl.

Wait, perhaps the group is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-C-O, but that doesn't involve a double bond. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has a double bond adjacent to the epoxide. Like, O-C-C-O, where one of the C's (say C1) is connected to a CH2-CHPh group via a double bond. So it would be something like O-C(R)=CH-Ph.

Wait, that would make the group a styryl attached via a double bond to the epoxide. So the structure would be Ph-CH=CH-O-CH2-C-O (but that's a five-membered ring, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the structure would be O-C-C-O, with the two C's connected to each other and each connected to another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH-O-C-O, but that's not quite right. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure here. Maybe I should think about the NMR data again.

In the product's 1H NMR, there are two singlet methyl groups. So that's two different CH3 groups, each not split by neighboring protons. So perhaps one is attached to an oxygen (like an ether) and another is attached to a carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR, the 197.7 is a single carbon. If that's a carbonyl, then maybe the product has a ketone group. But wait, the starting material is an epoxide. How would that form a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. For example, DABCO could open an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or some type of elimination.

Wait, another thought: the carbonyl at 197.7 could be a result of an elimination reaction, forming a carbonyl group. For example, if X is a diol or something that, upon elimination, forms a carbonyl.

Wait, but the reaction is with DABCO, which is a base. So perhaps it's a deprotonation and elimination reaction.

Wait, but in the options, all the compounds are oxirane derivatives, which are epoxides. So perhaps the product is an epoxide, but then where's the 197.7 ppm coming from? Maybe that's not a carbonyl but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 197.7 could be a carbon attached to an oxygen, like an epoxide carbon. Wait, epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm in 13C NMR. So 197 is way higher, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps it's a carbonyl group in an ester or a ketone. Let me think about the reaction again. If X is an epoxide and reacts with DABCO, perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed ring opening, but DABCO is a base, so maybe it's a base-catalyzed ring opening.

Wait, another angle: the reaction conditions are nonpolar solvent at 403 K (which is about 130°C) for a day. That's quite high, so maybe it's a thermal reaction, like an elimination.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me instead analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the product, and then see which option matches.

1H NMR:

- 2.28 (3H, s): likely a CH3 attached to something de-shielding it, perhaps an electronegative atom or a ring. Maybe a methyl group attached to oxygen, like OCH3, but that's usually around δ 3.3-3.7. Alternatively, a CH3 attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, like CH2-O-CH3. Wait, but that would be split if near other protons. Alternatively, a methyl group in a ring, like a cyclopropane, but that's not indicated here.

Wait, but the 13C NMR shows a carbon at 21.3 (s) and 28.4 (s). Those are low shifts, perhaps for CH3 groups attached to something. The 21.3 is a very low shift, maybe a CH3 attached to a quaternary carbon, like in a neopentyl group or something. Alternatively, a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but in that case, the 13C shift would be higher, around 50-60 ppm.

Wait, maybe the 21.3 is a methyl attached to a carbon that's part of an aromatic ring. Like toluene's methyl is around 21 ppm in 13C NMR. So that's a possibility. So 21.3 could be a methyl group attached to a benzene ring, as in toluene.

Similarly, the 28.4 could be a CH3 group attached to a CH2 group, perhaps as part of a chain. Like CH2CH3, but then why the singlet? Unless it's part of a more complex structure where the neighboring protons are equivalent, but that's unlikely.

Wait, let's think about the aromatic signals.

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

This looks like a pattern of a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring. Let's imagine the benzene has substituents at positions 1 and 4. For example, a meta-substituted group and another group in the para position. Wait, but the splitting suggests doublets, which might indicate coupling with adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with a double bond adjacent.

Wait, another approach: if the product has a styryl group (benzene ring connected to a vinyl group), the protons on the double bond would show up as doublets. Let's say the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-C-O (but wait, that's not an epoxide...).

Wait, no. Let's think of the vinyl group as adjacent to the epoxide. So, the structure would be something like Ph-CH2-CH-O-CH2-C-O. Wait, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the structure could be Ph-CH=CH-O-C-O (but that's not correct either because it's an epoxide). Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a ring structure where one of the oxygen's adjacent carbons is connected to a styryl group.

Alternatively, think about the aromatic signals. The presence of two doublets for 2H each suggests two sets of equivalent protons on the benzene ring. Let me think of a substituent on the benzene that causes this.

Wait, for a para-substituted benzene, the protons adjacent to the substituent would be equivalent. For example, if there's a substituent at position 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. That could explain the 2H doublets.

But then, where are the other protons? The 1H NMR shows a 1H doublet at 6.75 and 7.68. Maybe that's from a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are part of a di-substituted benzene. Let me think of a substituent that causes two doublets of 2H each and two single doublets.

Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has protons in a certain pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted benzene with a substituent that has a double bond, like a styryl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group attached to an epoxide. So, the substituent is CH2-CH-O-CH2 (but that's not an epoxide). Wait, an epoxide is O connecting two carbons in a three-membered ring.

Ah, maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CH-O-CH2-C-O. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a cyclopropane structure, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is at the end of a chain attached to the benzene ring. For example, Ph-CH2-CH-O-C-O, but again, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the NMR data points to a structure where the benzene is connected via a double bond to a CH-O-CH2 group, which forms the epoxide.

Wait, maybe the structure is Ph-CH=CH-O-C-O. No, that's not an epoxide. Wait, Ph-CH=CH-O-C-O would be a four-membered ring, but that's not correct. The epoxide is a three-membered ring, so perhaps it's Ph-CH=CH-O-CH2-C-O, but that's a five-membered ring, which is not an epoxide.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should compare the options.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane

D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all these are oxiranes (epoxides) with substituents.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So, structure would be the epoxide with a styryl group attached to one of the carbons. So, the structure is O-C-C-O, where one C is connected to a styryl group.

The styryl group is Ph-CH=CH-.

So, the structure would be Ph-CH=CH-O-C-O? Wait, no, that would make a five-membered ring. No, the epoxide is a three-membered ring, so it's O-C-C-O, where one C is connected to a styryl group.

Wait, perhaps it's O-C-(CH2-CHPh)=CH-O? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is like this:

   O
   ||
C-O-C
   ||
   CH2-CHPh

Wait, but that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is Ph-CH2-CH-O-C-O, but again, that's not an epoxide.

I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should instead think about the NMR shifts.

In the 1H NMR, the two singlets (2.28 and 2.31) suggest two methyl groups, each attached to something that doesn't cause splitting. Let's think of a structure with two methyl groups, perhaps one on the benzene (like toluene) and another on a neighboring group.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the 197.7 is a single carbon. Maybe it's a carbonyl group. Wait, if the product is an epoxide, where would a carbonyl come from? Maybe the reaction produces a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of an ester or another group.

Wait, another thought: the 197.7 could be an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an epoxide carbon. But earlier, I thought that epoxide carbons are around 50-70 ppm. Let me confirm: in 13C NMR, epoxide carbons are typically in the range of 45-65 ppm. So 197 is way outside that. Therefore, that can't be an epoxide carbon.

So, this 197.7 must be a carbonyl. So, the product has a ketone group. How could that happen?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. DABCO is a base, and in such conditions, an epoxide could open to form a carbonyl group. For example, if the epoxide is treated with a base, it can undergo ring-opening to form a carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reaction. When an epoxide is treated with a strong base, it can undergo elimination to form a carbonyl group. For example, consider the opening of an epoxide to form a ketone or aldehyde. So, if the epoxide is symmetric, the ring opening could form a ketone.

Wait, but the options are all epoxides. So perhaps the product is an epoxide, and the 197.7 is something else.

Wait, perhaps the 197.7 is not a carbonyl. Let me think again. Wait, another possibility: in some cases, a carbon adjacent to an oxygen can show up around 100-200 ppm. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an sp2 hybridized carbon with a substituent.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product's structure has a carbonyl group. If that's the case, then the starting material (Compound X) must have had a group that could form a carbonyl upon reaction.

But wait, the options are all oxirane derivatives, so maybe the product is not the starting material. Wait, no, the question states that the product is formed when X reacts with DABCO.

Wait, perhaps X is an epoxide, and upon reaction with DABCO, it forms a different compound. But the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, which suggests that X isn't an epoxide but something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-read the question.

The question says that X is subjected to a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in nonpolar solvent at high temp. The product's NMR is given, and we need to find X.

So, X is the starting material, and the product is formed after reaction with DABCO.

So, the options are possible structures for X, which is an epoxide.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options are for X, which is the starting material. So, perhaps the product is the result of X reacting with DABCO.

Hmm, but if X is an epoxide, and DABCO is a base, then maybe the reaction is an acid-base reaction leading to ring-opening.

Wait, if the product has a carbonyl, perhaps X is an epoxide that, upon reaction with DABCO, forms a carbonyl.

Wait, but that would require the opening of the epoxide to form a carbonyl, which would involve removing an oxygen. I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. Let me think: epoxides can undergo various reactions, like ring-opening in acid or base conditions. In basic conditions, they typically open to form alcohols or other oxygenates.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of X (an epoxide) with DABCO (a base) leads to the formation of an epoxide again? That doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an amide, and DABCO is causing Hofmann elimination. But X's formula is C11H12O. Hmm. Hofmann elimination typically starts from amides, which would have a structure like RCONHR', and upon treatment with a strong base like DABCO, would lose NH3 or similar to form an alkene.

So, if X is an amide, the product would be an alkene. But the product's NMR doesn't show any signals that would indicate an alkene. The 1H NMR doesn't have any triplet or quartet that would suggest a CH2 adjacent to a double bond. Alternatively, the aromatic signals could come from a styryl group, which would be part of an alkene.

Wait, but looking at the options, they're all oxirane derivatives, which are epoxide-containing compounds. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and the product is a different epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an epoxide, and the reaction with DABCO doesn't change the epoxide but affects another part of the molecule, like opening a ring elsewhere.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The 13C NMR has carbons at 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 (1C), 144.1 (1C), 197.7 (1C), 21.3, and 28.4.

So, 126.9 is two carbons, which suggests perhaps two carbons in a vinyl group, each attached to two protons. The 127.1 is one carbon, perhaps a carbon attached to one proton. The 129.1 is two carbons, maybe part of a ring. The 130.3 is one carbon, perhaps an sp2 carbon. The 141.5 and 144.1 are likely carbons attached to oxygen, like carbons in an epoxide ring or carbons adjacent to oxygen in a benzene ring.

The 197.7 is a single carbon, likely a carbonyl group.

Wait, if the product has a carbonyl group, then maybe X is an epoxide that, upon reaction, forms a ketone. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening followed by an elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, after opening the epoxide, a base could abstract a proton leading to the formation of a double bond and a carbonyl group.

But I'm not entirely sure. This is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the options. Let me look at each option's structure and see what their NMR would look like.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Structure: oxirane ring with a substituent at position 2. The substituent is a 4-methylstyryl group. So, the structure is an epoxide where one of the carbons is attached to a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-) and a methyl group in the para position on the benzene ring.

So, the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH-O-CH2-C-O? Not sure. Alternatively, the substituent is Ph-CH=CH-O-C-O, but that's not correct for an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
|
C-O-C
|
CH2-CHPh (where Ph is a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position)

But I'm not certain. Let's think of the NMR.

In this case, the aromatic ring would have a methyl group in the para position, leading to certain NMR signals.

The 1H NMR would have a singlet for the methyl group on the benzene, which would be around 2.3 ppm, perhaps. Then, the double bond protons would show up as doublets or multiplets. But the product's NMR shows two singlet methyl groups, perhaps indicating two different methyl groups.

Wait, in option A, the substituent is 4-methylstyryl. So the benzene ring has a methyl in the para position relative to the styryl group. So the aromatic protons would be meta to the substituents. That might lead to a certain pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Ph-CH2-CH-O-CH2-C-O, but that's not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like Ph-CH=CH-O-C-O, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Let's try to imagine the product's structure. The product has a benzene ring (from the aromatic signals), two methyl groups (from the singlets), and a carbonyl group (from 197.7 ppm).

Wait, perhaps the product is a benzophenone derivative. But the molecular formula of the product isn't given, so I can't be sure.

Wait, X's formula is C11H12O. Let me compute the molecular formula of the product based on the NMR data.

Wait, the product's formula would be based on the integration of the NMR signals. Let's see:

1H NMR:

3H (s) + 3H (s) + 1H (d) + 2H (d) + 1H (d) + 2H (d) = 3+3+1+2+1+2 = 12 H.

So, the product has 12 H, which would correspond to a molecular formula of C9H12O or something similar. But wait, the product is the result of X (C11H12O) reacting with DABCO, which is C6H10N2.

Wait, but DABCO is a solvent here, so perhaps it's not part of the product. So, the product's molecular formula would be similar to X, maybe losing some groups.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an epoxide, and the product is an alkene. But the product's NMR shows carbonyl, which is confusing.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for which option's structure, when reacted with DABCO, would produce the given NMR.

Wait, another approach: the options are all oxirane derivatives. So X is an epoxide. The reaction with DABCO could be an acid-base reaction leading to ring-opening. So, if X is an epoxide, the product would be an alcohol or another oxide, but in this case, the product has a carbonyl, which suggests that perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, but how would an epoxide form a ketone upon reaction with a base? Maybe via elimination.

Wait, suppose X is an epoxide with adjacent hydroxyl groups. Upon treatment with a base, it could eliminate water to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an epoxide where one of the oxygen's adjacent carbons has a good leaving group, which, upon elimination, forms a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is an epoxide with a geminal diol structure. But wait, that's not possible because an epoxide is already an oxygen connecting two carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead look for the number of signals in the NMR.

The 1H NMR has 6 signals, which suggests a relatively complex structure but with some symmetry.

The 13C NMR has 9 signals, which would correspond to 9 unique carbons. So, the product has 9 carbons. Wait, the molecular formula of the product would be C9H8O? Because 9 carbons with 12 H (from the 1H NMR) and O. Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O. Hmm, maybe I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction with DABCO leads to loss of some groups. For example, if X is an epoxide with a substituent that leaves, like an -OH group, which upon elimination forms a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's structure is a benzene ring with substituents that include a carbonyl group and two methyl groups.

Wait, another possibility: the product is benzalacetone or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an aromatic aldehyde, but that would have a different NMR.

Wait, perhaps it's a diphenyl ketone, but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but again, not sure.

Hmm, I'm starting to think that perhaps the product is an epoxide with a carbonyl group. But I'm stuck on how that's possible.

Wait, looking back, the 13C NMR has a carbon at 197.7, which is probably a carbonyl. So, the product must have a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that typically involves ketones forming lactones or other groups, and I'm not sure if DABCO is used for that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which forms a carbonyl, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material X is an epoxide that upon reaction with DABCO forms a carbonyl. Let me think about how that would happen.

Wait, another thought: if X is a cyclic ether (epoxide), and DABCO acts as a base, maybe it induces elimination, forming a carbonyl group. For example, imagine X is an epoxide where one of the adjacent carbons has a hydrogen that can be abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond and a carbonyl.

Wait, but how? Let me think of an example. Suppose X is a cyclopropane epoxide. Upon elimination, it could form a double bond and a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a di-substituted epoxide, and upon base treatment, it forms a conjugated enone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a conjugated carbonyl.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the correct option is D) 2-styrylepoxide. Let me imagine what its structure would look like.

If X is 2-styrylepoxide, then the structure would be an epoxide with a styryl group attached to one of the carbons. So, the structure would be O-C-C-O, with one C connected to a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-).

Upon reaction with DABCO, perhaps the epoxide remains unchanged, but the styryl group's protons would show up in the NMR as doublets.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, which doesn't fit. So perhaps option D isn't correct.

Another option: option B is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

Structure: the oxirane ring has a substituent at position 2. The substituent is a 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl group. So, that would be a group like Ph-CH2-C(OH)-, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-C-O (but that's not an epoxide).

Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-C-O-CH2-O, but that's not right either.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should consider the coupling patterns in the 1H NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

The 6.75 (d, 1H) and 7.68 (d, 1H) could be two protons that are coupled to each other, perhaps in a trans configuration across a double bond.

The 7.08 (d, 2H) and 7.71 (d, 2H) could be para protons on a benzene ring, each coupled to their adjacent protons.

So, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond, leading to a vinyl group. The two doublets (6.75 and 7.68) could be the double bond protons, while the 7.08 and 7.71 are from the benzene ring.

So, putting this together, the structure could be a benzene ring connected via a double bond to a CH-O-CH group, forming an epoxide.

Wait, that would make sense. So, the structure would be Ph-CH=CH-O-CH2-C-O, but that's a five-membered ring, which isn't an epoxide. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, the structure is Ph-CH2-CH-O-C-O, but again, that's not an epoxide.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess.

Looking at the options, option C is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So, the epoxide is at position 3, and there's a methyl group at position 2, along with a styryl group.

In that case, the structure would have a methyl group, a styryl group, and an epoxide. The NMR would show the methyl as a singlet, which matches the 2.28 and 2.31 ppm signals. The styryl group would account for the aromatic signals.

The 13C NMR has a 197.7 which would be a carbonyl. But if X is an epoxide, how would the product have a carbonyl? Unless the reaction is forming a ketone from the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is an epoxide with a geminal diol group, which upon elimination forms a ketone. For example, if the epoxide is adjacent to two OH groups, treatment with a base could eliminate water to form a ketone.

But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen rearrangement, but that usually involves allyl vinyl ethers.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the NMR data.

The product has a carbonyl group (197.7), two methyl groups (2.28 and 2.31), and aromatic signals suggesting a substituted benzene ring.

So, the structure could be something like (Ph-CH2-CH2-) with a ketone group. Wait, but that doesn't fit with the options.

Wait, another approach: the two methyl groups could be part of a gem-dimethyl group attached to a carbonyl. For example, (CH3)2CO would be acetone, but that's only three carbons. Alternatively, maybe a longer chain with a ketone and two methyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is acetophenone with some substituents. Acetophenone's 13C NMR would have a carbonyl around 205-220, but the product's is at 197.7, which is lower.

Wait, maybe the structure is para-methylacetophenone. That would have a methyl group on the benzene ring and a ketone group.

But the product's 1H NMR shows two singlets for methyl groups, which would imply two methyl groups attached to different carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is diphenylketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's something like (Ph-CH2)2CO. That would have two CH2 groups attached to the ketone. The 1H NMR would show quartets for the CH2 groups, but the data shows singlets, so that's not matching.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, option D is 2-styrylepoxide. So, the product after reaction would have a styryl group and an epoxide. But the product's NMR shows a carbonyl, which doesn't fit.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the epoxide. Maybe the reaction is elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is the same as X, but I don't think so because the question states that X is reacted.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a simple solvolysis, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ring-opened epoxide, forming a diol, but the NMR doesn't show OH groups.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows a carbon at 141.5 and 144.1, which are likely carbons attached to oxygen, perhaps in an epoxide. The 197.7 is a carbonyl.

So the product has both an epoxide and a carbonyl group. That would make sense if the reaction forms a compound with both.

Wait, but how? Maybe X is a di-substituted epoxide, and upon reaction, a carbonyl is formed elsewhere.

But I'm not sure. Without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to proceed.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make a guess based on the options and the NMR data.

The presence of two singlet methyl groups suggests that the structure has two methyl groups, perhaps as branches. Looking at the options, option A has a 4-methylstyryl group (so one methyl on the benzene), and option B has a phenylpropenyl group (maybe another methyl).

Wait, option B is 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl and a methyl group attached. Let me imagine the structure:

The substituent is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2. So the epoxide carbon is attached to this group. This would give a structure with a methyl group (from the CH2) and a phenyl.

In the 1H NMR, the methyl group (CH2) would show up as a singlet. Wait, but there are two singlet methyl groups, so perhaps there's another methyl elsewhere.

Hmm.

Alternatively, option C is 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide is at position 3, and there's a methyl and a styryl group attached.

So, the structure would have a methyl group (singlet at 2.28 or 2.31), a styryl group (aromatic signals), and an epoxide.

But then the 13C NMR would show carbonyl at 197.7, which doesn't fit unless the epoxide has a carbonyl, which it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone from the epoxide.

In conclusion, given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option D: 2-styrylepoxide.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying Compound X, which reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) in nonpolar solvent at 403 K to form a product with the given NMR data. The analysis focuses on interpreting the NMR data and matching it to the structural features of the options provided.

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlet methyl groups, likely attached to carbons that do not cause splitting.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): Two doublets, suggesting protons on a double bond.
   - δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): Two doublets for 2H each, likely aromatic protons on a benzene ring.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Likely methyl carbons.
   - δ 126.9 (2C, s), δ 127.1 (1C, s), δ 129.1 (2C, s), δ 130.3 (1C, s): Aromatic carbons.
   - δ 141.5 (1C, s) and δ 144.1 (1C, s): Likely carbons attached to oxygen, such as in an epoxide.
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A carbonyl carbon, which is unusual for an epoxide but suggests a ketone or similar group in the product.

### Reaction and Structural Analysis:
- The reaction conditions (DABCO, a base, at high temperature) suggest a possible elimination or epoxide ring-opening reaction.
- The product's NMR data indicates the presence of a benzene ring, two methyl groups, and a carbonyl group (δ 197.7 in 13C NMR). This suggests the product has both aromatic and carbonyl features.
- The options provided are oxirane derivatives, meaning Compound X is likely an epoxide. The reaction may involve structural rearrangement or elimination to form the observed product.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**  
   - Contains a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-) and a methyl group on the benzene ring.  
   - The NMR data does not fully align, as it would lack the two distinct methyl singlets observed in the product.

2. **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**  
   - Contains a phenylpropenyl group with a methyl branch.  
   - The structure does not clearly account for the two singlet methyl groups or the carbonyl signal in the product.

3. **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**  
   - Contains a methyl group and a styryl group attached to the epoxide.  
   - The NMR data partially matches, but the presence of a carbonyl group in the product is not explained by this structure.

4. **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**  
   - Contains a styryl group (Ph-CH=CH-) directly attached to the epoxide.  
   - This structure aligns with the aromatic signals in the NMR data. However, the carbonyl signal (δ 197.7) is not consistent with a typical epoxide, suggesting a possible rearrangement or additional functional group in the product.

### Conclusion:
Given the NMR data and the structural features of the options, **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide** is the most plausible choice, as it matches the aromatic and epoxide-related signals. The carbonyl signal may arise from a structural rearrangement or additional functional group formed during the reaction.
