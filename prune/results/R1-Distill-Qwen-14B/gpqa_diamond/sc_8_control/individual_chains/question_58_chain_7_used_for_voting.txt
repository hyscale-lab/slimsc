Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think about what each of these theories is and whether they deal with high-energy issues.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”problems where the calculations give infinite results. So the theory that doesn't have these divergences wouldn't need regularization.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory: I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything. It deals with high energies, like the Planck scale. But wait, string theories have their own set of problems, maybe requiring some form of regularization or other techniques to handle things like tachyonic instabilities or non-perturbative effects. I'm not too sure about this one.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. At high energies, QCD exhibits asymptotic freedom, meaning the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbative methods work. But wait, at low energies, it's non-perturbative. I remember that QCD calculations can have divergences that require regularization, like using lattice QCD or other methods. So they must use regularization in some contexts.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that historically, QED had problems with divergences, like the electron's self-energy and the vacuum polarization. These led to the need for renormalization. But wait, regularization is a step in renormalization to handle the infinities. So QED does require regularization. So option C is out.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: Oh right, this is the non-quantum version. It deals with fields and Maxwell's equations. Since it's classical, it doesn't involve the quantum divergences that the others do. So in classical E&M, there's no need for regularization because you're not quantizing the fields or dealing with particle interactions that lead to infinities in calculations. So this theory doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any cases in classical theories where regularization is used? I don't think so. Because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So the only theory that doesn't require regularization is the classical one.

So the correct answer should be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on their need for regularization, a technique used in quantum field theories to handle divergences (infinite results in calculations).

- **A) Superstring Theory**: While superstring theory is a candidate for a theory of everything and operates at high energies, it still requires techniques like regularization or other methods to address issues such as tachyonic instabilities or non-perturbative effects. Thus, it does require regularization in certain contexts.

- **B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, deals with high energies where it exhibits asymptotic freedom. However, it still encounters divergences that necessitate regularization, especially in perturbative calculations. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.

- **C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**: QED, the theory of electromagnetism, historically faced divergences in calculations, such as electron self-energy and vacuum polarization. These issues led to the development of renormalization, which relies on regularization as a step in the process. Hence, QED requires regularization.

- **D) Classical Electrodynamics**: This is the classical version of electromagnetism, based on Maxwell's equations. Since it is not a quantum theory, it does not involve the quantum divergences that necessitate regularization. Therefore, classical electrodynamics never requires regularization.

The only theory that does not require regularization is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
