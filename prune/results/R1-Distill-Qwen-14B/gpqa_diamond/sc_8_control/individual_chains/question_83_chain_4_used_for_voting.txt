Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh wait, so the total volume after dilution would be 40.00 cm³, right? Because 20 + 20 equals 40. 

I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial concentration M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 liters. After dilution, V2 is 0.04 liters. So solving for M2: M2 = (M1V1)/V2. Plugging in the numbers: (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04. Let me calculate that. 0.001 divided by 0.04 is 0.025. Oh, so the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid. When we dilute it, it dissociates more, but the concentration of H+ ions won't be as straightforward because of the dissociation equilibrium.

But the first part of the problem is about the pH at 25% titration. Oh, and the second part is the equivalence point pH.

Wait, let me think about titration. We're titrating the diluted acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH. So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let's think about how that affects the solution.

First, let's find out how much acetic acid we have initially after dilution. Moles of acetic acid = M * V. Diluted solution is 0.025 M in 0.04 L, so moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, wait again, no: M is in mol/L. So 0.025 mol/L * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Right.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. Since the reaction is 1:1, that's 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH neutralized, forming CH3COO^-.

So after adding that NaOH, the moles of acetic acid left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol, and the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point would be the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but I don't know the volume of NaOH yet. Oh, wait, the problem says it's at 25% titration, so perhaps I don't need the exact volume. Alternatively, I can calculate the volume of NaOH used.

Wait, let me think. The total moles of acetic acid is 0.001. At 25% titration, 0.25 moles are neutralized. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume V is moles / M = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 liters, which is 2.5 cm³.

So the total volume after adding NaOH is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

Now, the concentrations of acetic acid and acetate. The moles are 0.00075 and 0.00025 respectively. So concentration of CH3COOH is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let me calculate. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. And the acetate is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.74 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733).

So pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. So log(0.333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.263. So around 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. So the first part is likely 4.26.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. The ratio of acetate to acetic acid is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So the log(1/3) is about -0.477. So yes, 4.74 minus 0.477 is about 4.263, so approximately 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the concentration of acetate is from 0.001 moles of CH3COOH, which becomes 0.001 moles of CH3COO^-.

But wait, the volume is important here. The total volume would be the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence. Let me find that.

Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol (same as moles of acetic acid). The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ =0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

But acetate is a weak base. So it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions. The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for this can be calculated using Kw = Ka * Kb → Kb = Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Using the approximation for weak bases, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02. Hmm, but none of the options have 9.02 as the equivalence point. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → no, because I got 9.02.

Option B: 3.17; 6.73 → no.

Option C: 4.73;7.00 → no.

Option D:4.57;6.92 → no.

Wait, so none of the options match my calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, let me think again. Wait, when the solution is at equivalence, the acetate ion comes from a strong base and a weak acid. So the solution is basic. So the pH should be above 7.

But I think I might have messed up the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb for acetate is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. Wait, that's correct.

Concentration is 0.02 M. So the hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 ≈ 0.02 + x.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → which is 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, so pOH is about 4.98. pH = 14 -4.98 =9.02. But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: maybe I should consider that when you have a weak base that's formed from a strong acid titration, the solution is basic, but perhaps I should account for activity coefficients or something else. Or maybe I made a mistake in volume calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the volume. After adding 10 cm³ of NaOH (0.01 L) to the 40 cm³ (0.04 L) solution, the total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact method instead of the approximation. Let's try that.

Set up the equation: Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x). Since x is small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so same as before. So x is about 1.04e-5.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't that simple. Maybe the acetate solution isn't that concentrated, but no, 0.02 M is still a low concentration. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the formula for pH at equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with a strong base. The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + pKw) → pKa is 4.74, pKw is 14. So pH = ½ (4.74 +14) = ½ (18.74) =9.37. Hmm, that's not matching the earlier calculation. Wait, maybe that's a different approach.

Wait, alternatively, the pH at equivalence can be calculated using pOH = ½ (pKa + pKw) → pOH = ½ (4.74 +14) = 9.37. So pH would be 14 -9.37=4.63. Wait, that can't be right because equivalence is basic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is pH = pKa + pH = pKa + (pKw - pKa)/2? Hmm, I'm confused. Alternatively, let's think in terms of H+.

Wait, another approach: the solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. So the solution is basic. The pH can be found using the Kb of acetate.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me write the expression again:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

We have [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M, initial.

Assume x is the [OH^-] produced.

At equilibrium, [CH3COOH] =x, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x.

So Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x).

Since Kb is small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH =14-4.98=9.02.

But the options for the equivalence point don't have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, maybe I should think about the dilution again. Let me double-check the initial moles.

Original acetic acid: 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 =0.001 mol.

Diluted with 20 cm³ of water, so total volume 40 cm³, concentration 0.001 / 0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

Equivalence point: all 0.001 mol of CH3COOH is neutralized into CH3COO^-.

So moles of CH3COO^- is 0.001 mol. Volume is 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH needed.

NaOH needed: moles =0.001 → V =0.001 /0.1=0.01 L=10 cm³. So total volume 50 cm³.

So concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.001 / 0.05=0.02 M. So that part was correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, or I made a miscalculation. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options, the equivalence points are:

A)8.52; B)6.73; C)7.00; D)6.92.

Wait, all of them are below 7 except A's 8.52, which is close to my 9.02 but not exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that the solution isn't just the acetate and water, but maybe some other factors.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the initial solution after dilution is not 0.025 M. Let me recheck that.

Dilution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, and 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L =0.001 mol. Diluted to 0.04 L, so concentration is 0.001 /0.04 =0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: when we add NaOH, the solution's temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so activity is considered with concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact method without approximation. Let's set up the equation again.

Kb = 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 -x). Let's write this as x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so x² ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈1.04e-5, as before. So pOH is 4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options match. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the initial acetic acid concentration after dilution, but maybe I miscalculated that. Let me check.

Dilution: 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid to 40 cm³.

Moles =0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol. Diluted to 0.04 L →0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me think about the equivalence point. Another approach: the pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak base.

But perhaps the solution's pH is not as high as I thought. Let me see another approach. Maybe the solution isn't that basic because the concentration of acetate is low.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should consider that the solution is dilute, so the activity coefficients might change, but I think that's beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the pKa calculation. Let me check: Ka=1.85e-5 → pKa= log(1/(1.85e-5))= log(1.85e5)^-1 → wait, no, pKa is -log(1.85e-5).

Calculating log(1.85)=0.267, so pKa=4.74-0.267? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, log(1.85e-5)= log(1.85)+ log(1e-5)=0.267-5= -4.733. So pKa would be 4.733, which is approximately 4.73.

Wait, but in the first part, the pH was 4.26, which is lower than the pKa, which makes sense because we're dealing with a buffer where more of the acid is present than the conjugate base (since it's 25% titrated).

Wait, but the equivalence point pH is definitely higher than 7, but the options don't have any that high except option A's 8.52. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the Kb.

Ka=1.85e-5 → Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 =5.405e-10. Correct.

Concentration of acetate:0.02 M.

So the hydrolysis is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ⇌ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

Using the formula for [OH^-]:

√(Kb * C) = √(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = √(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. So perhaps the problem expects a different approach, like using the exact expression without approximation.

Let me set up the equation without approximation. Let x be [OH^-].

Kb = x²/(0.02 -x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02-x).

Multiply both sides by (0.02 -x): x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Rearranged: x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) → approx 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 → approximately 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11) is about 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6 / 2 ≈1.644e-6.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the previous approximation gave 1.04e-5. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me do the discriminant again.

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20=29.214e-20=2.9214e-19.

4ac=4 *1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11. But since c is negative, 4ac is -4.324e-11.

Wait, no, the quadratic equation is ax² +bx +c=0. So in standard form, it's x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0. So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

The discriminant is b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 → which is approximately 4.324e-11 (since 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19).

So sqrt(4.324e-11)= ~6.576e-6.

So x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] /2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 )/2 → approximately (6.576e-6)/2 →3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.288e-6 M → pOH=5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514. Oh! So approximately 8.51, which rounds to 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52. So looking back at the options, option A's equivalence point is 8.52. So that would make the first part 4.26 and the second 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, that makes sense. So the mistake I made earlier was in the quadratic approach. I had a sign error perhaps. So the correct [OH^-] is around 3.288e-6 M, leading to a pH of about 8.52.

Wait, but in the first part, the pH at 25% titration was about 4.26, which matches option A's first value.

So the correct answer would be option A: 4.26 and 8.52.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid with NaOH in two parts: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at the equivalence point.

### Part 1: pH at 25% Titration
1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - Volume of acetic acid after dilution: \( 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \) (0.04 L).  
   - Concentration of acetic acid after dilution:  
     \[
     M = \frac{\text{moles}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
     \]  
   - Moles of acetic acid:  
     \[
     \text{moles} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
     \]

2. **At 25% Titration**:  
   - Moles of NaOH added: \( 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Moles of acetic acid remaining: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Moles of acetate ion formed: \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total volume after adding NaOH:  
     \[
     40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
     \]  
   - Concentrations:  
     \[
     [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
     \]

3. **Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right).
   \]  
   - \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), so \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.74 \).  
   - Ratio:  
     \[
     \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \approx 0.333.
     \]  
   - \( \log(0.333) \approx -0.477 \).  
   - \( \text{pH} = 4.74 - 0.477 \approx 4.26 \).

### Part 2: pH at the Equivalence Point
1. **At Equivalence**:  
   - All \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \) of acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ion.  
   - Moles of NaOH added: \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Volume of NaOH:  
     \[
     V = \frac{\text{moles}}{\text{concentration}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
     \]  
   - Total volume:  
     \[
     40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
     \]  
   - Concentration of acetate:  
     \[
     [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
     \]

2. **Using the Kb of Acetate**:  
   - \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), so \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10} \).  
   - Hydrolysis reaction:  
     \[
     \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
     \]  
   - Using the approximation for weak bases:  
     \[
     [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
     \]  
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98 \), so \( \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02 \).  
   - However, using a more precise calculation, the pH is closer to \( 8.52 \).

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \( 8.52 \).  

**Answer: A**
