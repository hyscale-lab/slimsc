Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. 

Hmm, the operator P is given in terms of its components: P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I think the operator P itself is a vector operator, meaning P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z, but in this case, since the direction n is in the x-z plane, the y-component might not be entirely zero, but wait, no, the direction n can have x, y, and z components, but in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. Wait, no, the plane is x-z, which means any point in the plane has y=0. So the direction vector n lies in x-z plane, so its y-component is zero. So the operator we're considering is along direction n, which is in x-z. So the operator P must be the component along n, which would be a combination of P_x and P_z.

Wait, the operator for a general direction is P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

Our goal is to find the eigenvector of this operator P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. The eigenvector would be a normalized vector, so we need to solve the eigenvalue equation for P.

But the problem gives the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as specific matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down to get a clear picture.

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, for the operator along direction n, say n has components (nx, 0, nz), because it's in the x-z plane. Then, the operator P is:

P = nx * P_x + nz * P_z.

Let me compute that. Let's denote nx and nz as the direction cosines. But since n is a unit vector, nx^2 + nz^2 = 1. So, nx = cos(theta), nz = sin(theta), perhaps? Wait, but the direction n lies in the x-z plane, so the angle theta is measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis, or maybe from the x-axis towards the z-axis. Hmm, I'll keep that in mind.

So, substituting in the matrices, P would be:

nx * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]] + nz * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Let me compute this matrix. Let's factor out (ħ/2) since it's common.

P = (ħ/2) * [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Multiplying the terms inside:

The (1,1) element is nz * 1
The (1,2) element is nx * 1
The (2,1) element is nx * 1
The (2,2) element is (-nz) * 1

So P becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx],
           [nx, -nz] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is P |v> = λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue. Here, λ is given as +ħ/2.

So, the equation is (P - λ I) |v> = 0.

Substituting in the matrix:

(P - λ I) = (ħ/2) * [ [nz, nx],
                     [nx, -nz] ] - (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0,1]]

Which simplifies to:

(ħ/2) [ [nz - 1, nx],
         [nx, -nz - 1] ]

So the matrix for the equation is:

[ (nz -1) , nx       ]
[ nx      , (-nz -1) ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate. Wait, each element is (ħ/2) times the respective element in the matrix. So when subtracting λ, which is ħ/2, times the identity matrix, each diagonal element is (current matrix element) - (ħ/2) * 1, but wait, no, because the entire matrix is multiplied by ħ/2, so (P - λ I) would have each diagonal element as (nz - 1) times (ħ/2), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to scale out the ħ/2. Let me factor that out.

Let me write the matrix equation as:

( (nz -1), nx      )
( nx     , (-nz -1) )

But wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the original matrix P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the 2x2 matrix:

[ nz, nx ]
[ nx, -nz ]

So, when we subtract λ I, which is (ħ/2) * I, we get:

(ħ/2) [nz, nx; nx, -nz] - (ħ/2) [1,0;0,1] = (ħ/2) [nz-1, nx; nx, -nz-1]

So the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) * [ nz -1, nx      ]
          [ nx     , -nz -1 ]

So the equation is:

(ħ/2) * [ (nz - 1)  nx        ] [a]   = 0
          [ nx        (-nz -1) ] [b]

But since ħ/2 is a scalar multiplier, we can factor it out and focus on the matrix equation:

[ nz -1, nx      ] [a]   = 0
[ nx     , -nz -1 ] [b]

So the equations are:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0
nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

We can write these two equations:

1. (nz -1) a + nx b = 0
2. nx a + (-nz -1) b = 0

Since we're looking for non-trivial solutions (eigenvectors), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. But wait, the determinant is:

Determinant = (nz -1)(-nz -1) - (nx^2) 
= (-nz(nz+1) -1*(nz +1)) ) - nx^2
Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2.

Alternatively, from equation 1, express a in terms of b or vice versa.

From equation 1: (nz-1) a = -nx b => a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b

From equation 2: nx a = (nz +1) b
Substituting a from equation 1 into equation 2 gives:

nx * [ -nx / (nz -1) ) b ] = (nz +1) b

Simplify:

(nx * (-nx)) / (nz - 1) * b = (nz +1) b

Assuming b ≠ 0 (otherwise trivial solution), we can divide both sides by b:

(-nx²) / (nz -1) = nz +1

Multiply both sides by (nz -1):

-nx² = (nz +1)(nz -1)
= nz² - 1

So,

-nx² = nz² -1
=> nz² + nx² = 1

But since n is a unit vector, this holds true because nx² + nz² =1.

So the equations are consistent, and we can proceed to find the eigenvectors.

From equation 1: a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ a, b ] = [ -nx / (nz-1), 1 ] multiplied by b.

Wait, but since we can choose the component b as a normalization factor, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of a and b.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of the direction angles.

Wait, but since n lies in the x-z plane, the angle theta could be measured from the z-axis, so that nx = sin(theta), nz = cos(theta). Wait, no, if theta is the angle from the z-axis, then for a point in the x-z plane, x is along the right angle, so perhaps nx = sin(theta), nz = cos(theta). Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sin(theta) cos(phi), but since phi is zero here (in x-z plane), it's just sin(theta). Similarly, z is cos(theta). So yes, maybe nz = cos(theta), nx = sin(theta).

So let's substitute nz = cos(theta), nx = sin(theta).

Then, equation 1 becomes:

a = [ - sin(theta) / (cos(theta) -1) ] b

Simplify the denominator:

cos(theta) -1 = -2 sin^2(theta/2) [using the identity cos(theta) = 1 - 2 sin^2(theta/2) ]

So,

a = [ - sin(theta) / (-2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] b
= [ sin(theta) / (2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] b

But sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So substitute that in:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / (2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] b
= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] b
= cot(theta/2) * b

So the ratio a/b is cot(theta/2).

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2) * b, b ]

To simplify, let's set b = 1, so a = cot(theta/2). But wait, that would make the vector [cot(theta/2), 1]. But we need to normalize this vector. Let's compute the norm.

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = (cot^2(theta/2) ) + 1 = csc^2(theta/2 ), since 1 + cot^2 x = csc^2 x.

So the norm is |csc(theta/2)| = 1 / sin(theta/2)

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is [ cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, because:

a = cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)
b = 1

So the unnormalized vector is [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), 1 ]

When normalized:

Multiply each component by sin(theta/2) to get:

[ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, because dividing by the norm, which is 1/sin(theta/2), is the same as multiplying by sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, that looks familiar. So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the eigenvector is in terms of theta, which is the angle of the direction n in the x-z plane.

Now, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). That seems like a possible answer. But wait, the question says the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Let me check the calculation again because sometimes the sign can matter.

Wait, in the earlier steps, when I substituted, I got a = cot(theta/2) * b. But perhaps I should double-check the signs.

Wait, let's go back to the matrix after substitution.

The equation after substitution was:

[-nx²/(nz -1) ] = (nz + 1)

Wait, no, I think my earlier steps were correct, but I can also approach this from another angle. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, perhaps the eigenstate can be expressed as a spin-1/2 particle's state along that direction. The eigenvectors for spin along a direction n are given by the spinor [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ], but since in this case, phi is zero because the direction is along x-z plane (so phi is 0?), but wait, no, the direction could have any angle in x-z plane, so phi could be non-zero. But in the options provided, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is for a 2-sphere parameterization, but the eigenvector for spin-1/2 in direction (theta, phi) is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But in this problem, the direction is in x-z plane, so phi is zero. So the eigenvector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

But wait, the options given are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)
B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

So looking at option C, it matches our result. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the problem mentions the operator is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector would depend on theta, the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, another approach: the operator P is the Pauli matrix for spin along direction n. The eigenvectors are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. The spin-up state for direction n is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)).

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so e^{i phi} = 1. So the spin-up state is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero, and the operator $\vec{P}$ can be written as:

\[
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the direction cosines, satisfying $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $P$ becomes:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P |v\rangle = \lambda |v\rangle,
\]

where $\lambda = +\hbar/2$ is the eigenvalue, and $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P$ and $\lambda$ into the eigenvalue equation, we solve for $a$ and $b$. After simplification, the eigenvector is proportional to:

\[
|v\rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},
\]

where $\theta$ is the angle measured from the z-axis to the direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. Normalizing this vector gives the normalized eigenvector:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not depend on $\theta$.
- **Option B** represents a general spherical coordinate parameterization but does not match the eigenvector for a spin-1/2 system.
- **Option D** introduces incorrect normalization factors involving $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the derived eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
