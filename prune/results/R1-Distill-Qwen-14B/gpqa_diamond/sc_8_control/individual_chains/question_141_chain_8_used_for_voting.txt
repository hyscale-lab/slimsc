Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A to D.

Hmm, wait. First, I need to figure out what the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d is. Oh, wait, wait, maybe that's a typo or shorthand. Because benzene has six carbons. 1-bromo would be at position 1, and 2-dâ€”maybe that's a deuterium? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3-dideutero benzene? Or maybe it's 2-deutero. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromobenzene-d2, but that would be two deuteriums. But the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so probably just a single deuterium at position 2.

But wait, maybe the "d" is part of the solvent, but no, the question says it's the starting material. So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium at position 2.

Wait, but why would that matter? Because when it undergoes a reaction, perhaps the deuterium affects the outcome. But maybe it's a substitution scenario, and the position of the substituents affects whether certain products form.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I'm trying to remember what NaNH2 does. I think NaNH2 is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. In aromatic chemistry, it's used for deprotonating compounds to form an aromatic ring with a negative charge, which can then undergo various reactions like coupling or substitution.

Wait, in the context of benzene rings, NaNH2 in ammonia is often used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in elimination reactions. For example, in the formation of benzynes from bromobenzene. But wait, that's when there are two leaving groups, perhaps? Or when the substituents are in positions that allow elimination.

Wait, benzene with one substituent: for example, bromobenzene. If you treat that with a strong base like NaNH2, would it undergo elimination? Well, normally, elimination requires adjacent leaving groups, like in vicinal dihalides. So for example, 1,2-dibromo benzene would lose two bromides to form a benzyne intermediate.

But in this case, our starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So that's a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Wait, but deuterium is a hydrogen isotope; in the context of leaving groups, would that matter? Because D is a poor leaving group compared to H, which is even worse. So perhaps the deuterium isn't involved in the reaction.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think about the reaction. So, if I have a bromobenzene derivative and treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, the base would abstract a proton, but where?

But wait, in benzene, the positions adjacent to the bromine are ortho (positions 2 and 6), meta (3 and 5), and para (4). So in 1-bromobenzene, the adjacent positions are ortho (2 and 6). So in our case, the 2 position is a deuterium. So the bromine is at 1, and position 2 has D.

So when the base (NH2^-) is added, would it abstract a proton from the ring? But wait, the deuterium is at position 2. So the adjacent positions to bromine (which is at 1) are 2 and 6. So position 6 is a regular hydrogen.

Wait, but in the starting material, position 2 is D, and position 6 is H. So when NaNH2 is added, the base would abstract a proton from position 6, because position 2 is a deuterium and not a proton. Wait, but deuterium is a hydrogen isotope, so in the ring, the position 2 has D instead of H. So the base can abstract a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to the bromine.

So, the base abstracts the proton at position 6, making a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6 and the bromine at position 1. But that's an unstable situation. Wait, but wait, perhaps the mechanism is different. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: when a strong base like NaNH2 is used with a monosubstituted benzene, especially when there's another substituent that can act as a leaving group, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the leaving group, leading to the formation of an aromatic ring with a negative charge, which can then eliminate the leaving group.

Wait, but in monosubstituted benzene, can elimination occur? Because elimination typically requires two leaving groups in vicinal positions. So, for example, in 1,2-dihalobenzenes, the base can abstract a proton to form a double bond (or a triple bond?), leading to elimination of both halides and forming a triple bond (like benzyne).

But in our case, we only have one bromine, and a deuterium in the adjacent position. Wait, but deuterium isn't a good leaving group. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine, but the only available proton is at position 6, because position 2 is D.

So, the base abstracts the H at position 6, leading to a ring with a negative charge at position 6 and a Br at position 1. But since the Br is a good leaving group, perhaps the Br leaves, and we get a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6 and a triple bond between positions 1 and 2?

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like this: when the H at position 6 is abstracted, the ring becomes deprotonated at position 6. The Br at position 1 is a good leaving group, so perhaps the Br leaves, and the negative charge moves to position 1, but that doesn't make sense because the ring is conjugated.

Wait, maybe I should think about it step by step. So, bromobenzene has Br at position 1. The base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, which would be position 2 or 6. But in our case, position 2 is D, so the base can abstract a proton from position 6.

So, abstracting H from position 6: the ring becomes deprotonated there. Now, the Br at position 1 is a good leaving group, so perhaps the base-induced elimination occurs between C1 and C2? Wait, but position 2 is D, but that's a different issue.

Wait, after deprotonation at C6, the ring has a negative charge at C6. The Br is at C1. Then, perhaps the Br leaves, and the negative charge on C6 can form a triple bond with C1. Wait, but the positions are adjacent. So, eliminating Br and H? Or forming a triple bond between C1 and C2?

Wait, but wait a second. If the base abstracts a proton from C6, and the Br is at C1, perhaps the Br leaves, and the ring undergoes elimination to form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that would require the formation of a benzyne intermediate. But that would require two adjacent leaving groups, right? Or perhaps a single elimination with a base abstracting a proton and a leaving group departing.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of another angle. Maybe the reaction is a substitution, but with the deuterium affecting the outcome.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base is so strong that it abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzoxide ion, which then loses the bromide as a leaving group.

Wait, but benzene rings are stable, and substitution typically requires a good activating group, which Br is deactivating. So maybe elimination is more likely.

Wait, but in any case, let's think about the product possibilities. The reaction of bromobenzene with NaNH2 in ammonia typically leads to elimination, forming a triple bond (benzyne) and releasing HBr. But for that to happen, you usually need two adjacent leaving groups, like in 1,2-dibromobenzene. So in our case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, which only has one bromine and a deuterium adjacent to it.

Wait, but perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the elimination. So, when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the Br at position 1 leaves, and the ring forms a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, position 2 is D. Could that be a problem?

Wait, maybe not. Because the deuterium is at position 2, but the elimination would involve position 1 and 6 adjacent to the Br? Or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to a deprotonated ring. Then, the Br leaves, and the ring forms a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but position 2 has a D. Hmm, but that would involve a D in the triple bond, which is possible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then the Br is at position 1, and the ring has a negative charge at position 6. Then, the Br leaves, and the ring would have a negative charge at position 6, which could form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But how does that work when position 2 has a D?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but with a D on position 2. But wait, if the triple bond is between 1 and 2, then the ring would have a triple bond, making it benzyne, but with a D in position 2.

But benzyne is a very reactive intermediate. Once formed, it can undergo various reactions, such as trapping with another molecule or undergoing some kind of cyclization.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, if the reaction forms benzyne, what are the possible products?

Wait, but benzyne is a diradical or a triple bond, but I think in this case, the reaction would form benzyne, which is a strained alkyne. Then, maybe it would undergo some kind of addition or coupling.

But the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between positions 1 and 2. But position 2 has a D, so the triple bond would be between C1 and C2, with C2 having a D.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, and a D attached to C2.

But wait, let me think about the possible products. So, if the reaction goes to form benzyne, which is a triple bond, perhaps the structure would be a ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2. But since the starting material has a Br at C1 and a D at C2, elimination would lead to the loss of Br and H (from C6), but the D at C2 remains.

Wait, but the product after elimination would be a triple bond between C1 and C2. So the ring would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, and a D at C2, and perhaps a hydrogen at C6? Or maybe not.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think again about the reaction.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, positions are:

1: Br

2: D

So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, adjacent to the Br at position 1, then the Br leaves, and the ring forms a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but position 2 is D, not H. So when the triple bond forms between C1 and C2, the D is at C2. So the triple bond would be Câ‰¡C, with one end connected to the rest of the ring, and the other end (C2) having a D.

But would that affect anything? Or is the D just a substituent on the triple bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium doesn't interfere with the formation of the triple bond.

So, the product after elimination would be benzyne with a D at position 2. But wait, benzyne is a cyclic alkyne, so the structure would be a ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, and a D attached to C2.

But benzyne itself is an alkyne, so it's a very strained structure, and it's usually a transient intermediate. But in this case, maybe the reaction stops at that point. Or perhaps the solvent (condensed ammonia) would deprotonate something else.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed to form benzyne, but instead forms a substituted benzene via some other mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the deuterium affects the acidity of the adjacent protons. Because deuterium is less acidic than protium, right? So in the ring, the presence of D at position 2 might affect the acidity of the H at position 6.

Wait, but how does that help? The base (NH2^-) is strong enough to abstract protons from the ring if they're sufficiently acidic. If the H at position 6 is more acidic than the H at position 2 (which is D, so not available), then the base would abstract H at 6, leading to elimination.

But I'm not sure about the acidity in that scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium at position 2 makes the adjacent protons (like at position 6) more acidic because of some sort of conjugation or stabilization effect.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the possible products. The question is about how many organic products form.

If the reaction forms benzyne, which is a triple bond between C1 and C2, and then what? Benzyne can dimerize, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne could trap another molecule.

Wait, but the solvent is condensed ammonia. So, maybe the benzyne could undergo some reaction with ammonia.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction stops at the benzyne stage, and that's the product.

But wait, the question is asking about the number of possible organic products. So, perhaps the reaction produces more than one product. Or maybe only one.

Wait, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and the reaction produces benzyne with a D in position 2, how many isomers could form?

Wait, in benzene, the positions are all equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. But in this case, the starting material is a specific isomer with Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So when elimination occurs, would the product have any possibility of different structures?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When the base abstracts H from position 6, the elimination leads to a triple bond between C1 and C2 (since Br is at C1 and H is at C6). So the product would be a ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, and a D at C2.

But in benzene, the numbering is arbitrary, so the triple bond is between C1 and C2, but after elimination, the structure is a ring with a triple bond between adjacent carbons. So how many possible products would that lead to?

Wait, the triple bond could form between C1 and C2, but in a benzene ring, that's just one possible position. Or is there another possibility?

Wait, maybe if the base abstracts H from a different position, but in our starting material, the only available H adjacent to Br is at position 6. Because position 2 is D.

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1. So yes, the base abstracts H from 6, leading to elimination between 1 and 2. So, the product would have a triple bond between 1 and 2, and a D at position 2.

But since the ring is symmetric, is there another possible position for the triple bond? Or is the triple bond fixed once the H is abstracted from position 6?

Wait, no. Because the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So, the Br is fixed at position 1, and D at position 2. So when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the elimination leads to a triple bond between 1 and 2, with D at position 2.

So, only one product is formed in this case. So, the number of possible products is 1?

Wait, but maybe the deuterium affects the stability or formation of the product in a way that leads to different products. Or perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as expected.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne but instead undergoes some kind of substitution. But substitution on benzene rings typically requires activating groups, and Br is a deactivating group, making substitution less likely.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton, perhaps it leads to a meta-directing effect, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the starting material has a deuterium in the ortho position, which affects the reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: when the base abstracts H from position 6, the ring becomes deprotonated, and the Br leaves, but the ring forms a triple bond between 1 and 2. But if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, then the triple bond would be between 1 and 2, with D at 2. So the product would be a substituted benzyne.

But benzyne is a very reactive intermediate, so perhaps it doesn't isolate as a product. Instead, the reaction might stop at the benzyne stage, but since the question is about possible products, perhaps that counts as one product.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the possibility of the reaction not proceeding, but that's unlikely as NaNH2 is a strong base.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible products. So, if the reaction produces only one product, the answer would be B) 1.

But wait, another possibility: could the base abstract a different proton, leading to a different product? For example, if there's another proton that can be abstracted, perhaps leading to a different position of elimination.

Wait, in the starting material, the only protons adjacent to the Br are at positions 2 and 6. But position 2 is D, so only position 6 has a H available. So the base can only abstract H from position 6, leading to only one possible product.

Therefore, the number of possible organic products is 1, so the correct answer is B) 1.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2) with NaNHâ‚‚ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNHâ‚‚ is a strong base that typically abstracts protons adjacent to leaving groups, facilitating elimination reactions. 

In this case, the bromine at position 1 is a good leaving group, and the base can abstract a proton from position 6 (the only available proton adjacent to the bromine, as position 2 is a deuterium). This deprotonation leads to the elimination of the bromine atom, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. The resulting product is a benzyne intermediate with a deuterium atom at position 2.

Given the structure of the starting material, the base can only abstract a proton from position 6, and the elimination leads to a single product: a benzyne intermediate with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2 and a deuterium at position 2. There are no other possible products because the starting material is fixed, and the reaction mechanism does not allow for alternative pathways.

Thus, the number of possible organic products in this reaction is **1**.
