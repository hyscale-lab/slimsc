Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question is about three different reactions, A, B, and C, and we have to determine the products based on the given options. I'll tackle each one separately.

Starting with reaction A: It's dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) and ethanol. From what I remember, the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups and a carbonyl, so it's a good nucleophile in this context because the enolate can form. 

Wait, the enolate would come from the malonate. The malonate is a diester, so when deprotonated, it forms a strong nucleophile. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group instead of a methyl. Wait, no, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So it's CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but the E-configuration and one of the substituents is p-tolyl. Hmm, wait, no, the structure of 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So it's probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a substituent on the beta carbon (the CH2 end is the alpha, the CH is the beta, and then the COOCH3 is gamma). Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH3, and the p-tolyl group is on the alpha carbon (the CH2 end? No, because that's the alpha position). Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, that would be 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Hmm, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me think: when you have 3-substituted acrylate, it's the third carbon, but acrylate is only three carbons: COOCH3 is the third carbon? No, I think I'm not visualizing it correctly.

In any case, the Michael addition here: The enolate (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta carbon (the CH2 part) of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the unsaturated ester (methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate) has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a substituent on the alpha position? Or wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C2. Then the Michael acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the C1 and C2 are double bonded, and C3 is the carbonyl).

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. In that case, the alpha is the CH2, beta is the C(p-tolyl), and then the carbonyl is gamma. So when the enolate attacks the beta position (the C(p-tolyl)), the attack would form a new bond there. 

So dimethyl malonate is a diester, which upon deprotonation (with NaOEt) forms an enolate. The enolate would be a strong nucleophile, attacking the beta carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. 

So the product would be a new compound where the malonate's enolate has added to the beta position of the acrylate. Let's think about the structure. The enolate would attack the acrylate, opening it up. So the acrylate's structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The enolate (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 part?), wait no. Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2? Or on the CH? Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between the CH2 and the CH(p-tolyl). Then the carbonyl is at the end. 

So when the enolate attacks the beta position (the CH(p-tolyl)), the attack would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's carbon and the CH(p-tolyl). So the product would have the malonate part (now with two ester groups) attached to that CH. 

Wait, perhaps the product would have the structure where the CH(p-tolyl) is now connected to the enolate's carbon (which is part of the malonate). So the product would be something like CH2-C(-OOCR)2-CO-OCH3, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the general Michael addition mechanism. 

The Michael donor is the enolate, and the Michael acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The enolate attacks the beta carbon, leading to a new bond and the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. 

So in this case, the enolate of dimethyl malonate (which is a strong nucleophile) will attack the beta carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The attack will form a new bond, and then the carbonyl group will re-form, leading to a new ester structure.

So, the product of reaction A should be a trimethyl something tricarboxylate. Looking at the options, option A for A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The starting materials are dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(COOCH3)2) and the acrylate (CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3). After Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position (the CH2 group) of the acrylate. Wait, no, the acrylate's structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the double bond. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So in this case, the alpha is the CH2, beta is the C with p-tolyl, then the carbonyl.

When the enolate attacks, it adds to the beta carbon (the one with the p-tolyl), so the enolate's carbon (from the malonate) connects to the p-tolyl group. Then the carbonyl would re-form, leading to a new structure.

So the product would have the malonate part attached to the p-tolyl group. So the resulting molecule would have a central carbon connected to three ester groups (from the malonate) and the p-tolyl group. Wait, no. Let me think: dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. When it forms the enolate, it's the central CH that's deprotonated, so the enolate would attack at the beta position, which is the CH2 group of the acrylate.

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. The enolate is CH2- [with a negative charge on the central C], and the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), adding to it. Then the double bond would shift, and the carbonyl would form. So the product would have a new carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a tricarboxylate, where the malonate's enolate adds to the acrylate. So, after the addition, the product would be something like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   |
COOCH3-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is more like:

The malonate's central carbon (which was the enolate) attaches to the CH2 part of the acrylate. So after the attack, the acrylate's CH2 is now connected to the malonate's C, which has two COOCH3 groups. Then the double bond would shift, and the carbonyl would form, leading to a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a trimethyl ester with a p-tolyl group attached. So looking at the options, option A's A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Wait, propane with three carbonyl groups? Wait, propane has three carbons. 1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have two on the first carbon and one on the third? Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right, but perhaps the product is a tricarboxylate where the p-tolyl is on the second carbon.

So for reaction A, the product is likely option A's A: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Now moving on to reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine reacting with (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of methanol and H3O+.

Wait, but wait. The Michael reaction usually involves a nucleophile (enolate) attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. However, in this case, the reactants are 1-(cyclohexenyl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. Hmm, but but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN. So it's an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. Is that a Michael acceptor? Or is the piperidine acting as a nucleophile?

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a cyclic amine with a cyclohexene ring attached. So the piperidine has a double bond in the cyclohexene ring. But in this reaction, would it act as a nucleophile? Or is the other compound the nucleophile?

Wait, Michael addition typically involves a nucleophile (like an enolate) attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the electrophile). So in this case, perhaps the piperidine is the nucleophile. But piperidine is a secondary amine; can it form an enolate? Or perhaps it's a different type of addition.

Wait, wait, but the presence of MeOH and H3O+ suggests that it's an acid-catalyzed reaction. So perhaps it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition) where the piperidine acts as a nucleophile.

1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine would have a cyclohexene ring connected to the nitrogen. The cyclohexene is conjugated with the piperidine ring, making the alpha position (probably the cyclohexene's double bond) susceptible to attack.

But the other reagent is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CHCN. That's an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile. Nitriles are good electron-withdrawing groups, so this would make the double bond a good Michael acceptor.

Wait, but in the Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. In this case, if the but-2-enenitrile is the acceptor, the nucleophile would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 group). But I'm not sure if the piperidine can act as the nucleophile here.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is acting as the Michael acceptor, and the butenitrile is the nucleophile. But that doesn't seem right because the nitrile is a better Michael acceptor.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The Michael addition is when a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. In this case, the butenitrile is an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile, which can act as a Michael acceptor. The other compound, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, has a conjugated system. Maybe the piperidine's ring is electron-rich and could act as a nucleophile.

Wait, under acidic conditions, perhaps the piperidine would be protonated, making it more nucleophilic? Not sure. Alternatively, the cyclohexene ring might act as a donor, but I'm not very clear on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition where the piperidine's double bond (the cyclohexene) donates electrons. Wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder type reaction, but that's a [4+2] cycloaddition, which doesn't fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a base, deprotonating the butenitrile to form an enolate, which then attacks the cyclohexene. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the butenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the piperidine is the nucleophile. But piperidine is a secondary amine, not a strong nucleophile. However, under acidic conditions, maybe the amine is protonated, making it a better leaving group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition (Michael) where the piperidine's enolate (if formed) attacks the butenitrile.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options for reaction B. The options are:

Option A: B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile
Option B: same as A for B
Option C: B = 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile
Option D: same as C for B.

Wait, the product is butanenitrile with some substituents. So the butenitrile is CH2=CHCN. If the piperidine is adding to the beta position, then the nitrile would be at the end.

Wait, another approach: the product would have the structure where the piperidine has added to the butenitrile. So the butenitrile's structure is CH2-CH2-CN, but that's not right. Wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCN, right? So the structure is CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond between the first and second carbons.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (probably from piperidine) attacks the beta carbon (the second carbon) of the butenitrile. So the product would have the piperidine's substituent added to the second carbon.

Wait, but the piperidine is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So the cyclohexene is attached to the piperidine's nitrogen. So perhaps the cyclohexene is acting as a nucleophile, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a base, but under acidic conditions, that seems less likely.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible product. The options for B are 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile or 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Wait, but the product would have the piperidine substituent attached to the butenitrile. Alternatively, the cyclohexene might add to the butenitrile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the piperidine is not the nucleophile. Maybe the butenitrile is the nucleophile, but that doesn't make sense because nitriles are not typically nucleophiles in this context.

Another thought: the reaction conditions are MeOH and H3O+. So perhaps it's a conjugate addition under acidic conditions. But I'm not certain about the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe the piperidine is acting as a base, and the butenitrile is the electrophile. But that's getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition where the piperidine's enamine acts as a nucleophile. Enamines are known to undergo Michael additions. Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine would have an enamine structure. Enamines are good nucleophiles and can perform Michael additions.

So, the piperidine has a cyclohexene ring attached, which is part of an enamine. The enamine would be a strong nucleophile, so it would attack the beta carbon of the butenitrile. So, the enamine (from the piperidine) attacks the CH2 group of CH2=CHCN, leading to a new bond formation.

The product would then have the enamine's substituent (the cyclohexene part) attached to the CH2 group of the butenitrile. But I'm not exactly sure about the structure.

Wait, but the product options for B are butanenitriles with substituents. Let's see, the product would be something like CH2-C(cyclohexene)-CH2-CN. Or maybe CH2-CH(cyclohexene)-CH2-CN? Wait, no, because the attack is on the beta carbon (the second carbon) of the butenitrile (CH2=CHCN). 

So the structure would be CH2-C(cyclohexenyl)-CH2-CN? But I'm not sure about the exact connectivity.

Looking at the options, option B says B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. That would imply that the butanenitrile has a 3-position with a 2-oxocyclohexyl group. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(cyclohexyl-2-one)-CN? Or perhaps the cyclohexyl is connected to the third carbon.

Wait, maybe the product is (E)-but-2-enenitrile undergoing a Michael addition with the enamine from the piperidine, leading to the addition of the cyclohexenyl group to the beta position.

So the product would be CH2-C(cyclohexenyl)-CH2-CN, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-(cyclohexenyl)butanenitrile, but the options don't exactly match that.

Wait, looking at the options, option A and B for B have 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and options C and D have 3-(2-hydroxycyclohex-1-en-1-yl)butanenitrile.

Assuming that the addition of the enamine leads to a ketone after protonation, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Because the enamine addition would form a new carbon-carbon bond, and upon protonation and tautomerization, a ketone would form.

So, for reaction B, the product would be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Looking at the options, option A and B for B have this structure. So either option A or B is correct for B.

Now, let's look at reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O gives 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. That structure has two ketone groups on the cyclohexane (at positions 1 and 3) and a substituent at position 2 which is a 3-oxobutyl group.

So, the reaction is a Michael addition where a nucleophile (probably enolate) attacks the beta position of but-3-en-2-one.

But-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2CO with a double bond. Wait, but-3-en-2-one structure: CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one would be CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3? Wait, no. Butene is four carbons. So but-3-en-2-one would be CH2-CO-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(O)-R, where R is methyl or another group. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3? No, that's 3-penten-2-one or something. Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one would be CH2=C-CH2-C(O)-something? Wait, maybe I should think:

But-3-en-2-one: the longest chain is four carbons. The ketone is on C2, and the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2? No, that's not possible because the double bond should be between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3? No, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one would be:

CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3? That would be 3-penten-2-one, not butenone. Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. Wait, but that's not but-3-en-2-one. Let me think again: the butenone has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-one would be CH2=CH-C(O)-R, where R is the fourth carbon. Wait, but four carbons would be:

1: CH2-
2: C(=O)
3: CH2?
Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. Yes, that makes sense. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-CH3.

So, when this reacts with compound C in the presence of KOH and water, it forms 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, the product has a cyclohexane ring with two ketone groups (at positions 1 and 3) and a substituent at position 2 which is a 3-oxobutyl group. The 3-oxobutyl group is (CH2)2-C(O)-CH2-, perhaps.

So, the reaction is a Michael addition where the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position (the CH2 group) of the butenone. The enolate would come from the cyclohexane-1,3-dione, perhaps.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3-dione is a diketone, so when treated with a base like KOH, it can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta carbon of the but-3-en-2-one (the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl). 

So, in the product, the cyclohexane-1,3-dione would have a substituent added at position 2, which is the product of the addition. The substituent would be derived from the butenone's alpha carbon.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is a 3-oxobutyl group. That suggests that the enolate added to the butenone's alpha position, leading to a new chain.

Wait, perhaps the enolate from the cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the butenone's beta carbon, adding a butyl group with a ketone.

Wait, but the butenone is CH2=CH-CO-CH3. When the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 group), the attack would form a new bond. The product would then have the enolate's carbon connected to the CH2, and the rest would shift to form a new carbonyl.

So, the resulting structure would have a new substituent on the cyclohexane ring, which is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3. So the substituent is -(CH2)2-CO-CH3, but perhaps I'm missing something.

But looking at the product, it's 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is a 3-oxobutyl group, which is CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? Or CH2-CH(CO-CH3)-CH2-?

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CO-CH3, but that would be a 4-oxopentyl group. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the substituent is -(CH2)3-CO-. Wait, no, the product is 3-oxobutyl, which is (CH2)2-CO-CH2. So the substituent is -(CH2)2-CO-CH2- connected to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is as follows: the enolate from the cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks the butenone's beta position. The butenone has CH2=CH-CO-CH3. The enolate attacks the CH2, leading to a new bond, and the double bond shifts, forming a new carbonyl group. So the product would have the enolate's carbon connected to the CH2, and the rest becomes a carbonyl.

So the substituent added would be a CH2-CH2-CO-CH3 group? That would make the 3-oxobutyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but let's focus on the options for reaction C. The options for C are:

Option A: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione
Option B: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione
Option C: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione (same as B)
Option D: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione (same as A)

Wait, the question says that C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH gives 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So in the reaction, what is C?

Wait, the reaction is C (the starting material) plus butenone (the Michael acceptor) and KOH (base) to form the product. So C must be the nucleophile, which is likely the enolate form of the cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but in the options, for reaction C, the product is given as 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the starting material C would be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which upon deprotonation forms the enolate, which then attacks the butenone.

So the starting material C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which under basic conditions forms an enolate. The enolate attacks the beta position of the butenone, leading to the product.

So, for reaction C, the reactant C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and the product is as given. Looking at the options, for reaction C, options B and C have C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione. Options A and D have C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, the correct product would require that C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the correct option for reaction C is either B or C.

Now, looking back at the overall options, let's see which options match:

Option A: A is trimethyl..., B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. But according to reaction C, C should be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so option A is incorrect for C.

Option B: A is same, B is same, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So this would be correct for C.

Option C: A is trimethyl..., B is 3-(2-oxo...), but C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So C would be correct here as well.

Wait, but looking at the given options, each option gives a set for A, B, and C.

So the correct set would be:

For A: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (so A is correct).

For B: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

For C: the starting material is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, so the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the correct option for C is either B or C.

Wait, in the options, the letters A, B, C, D each have a set of A, B, C.

Looking at the options:

Option A) A = correct A, B = correct B, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But in reaction C, the starting material is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is not the same as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. So option A is incorrect for C.

Option B) A = correct, B = correct, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So this is correct.

Option C) A = trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate. That seems incorrect because for reaction A, the product should be 2-(p-tolyl), not 3.

Option D) A is incorrect, same as C.

So, putting it all together, the correct option is B, where A is trimethyl..., B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves three Michael addition reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct reactants and products based on the given options. Here's the analysis:

---

### Reaction A:  
**Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH.  
**Mechanism:** Dimethyl malonate forms an enolate under basic conditions, which acts as a nucleophile. The enolate attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ester (methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate). This results in a conjugate addition, forming a resonance-stabilized intermediate. The product is a trimethyl ester with a p-tolyl group attached to the second carbon of the chain.  

**Product:** Trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.  

---

### Reaction B:  
**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H₃O⁺.  
**Mechanism:** The piperidine derivative acts as a nucleophile due to its enamine structure, which is stabilized by the conjugated cyclohexene ring. The enamine attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated nitrile (but-2-enenitrile). After the reaction, the product contains a nitrile group and a cyclohexenyl substituent.  

**Product:** 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.  

---

### Reaction C:  
**Reactants:** Cyclohexane-1,3-dione, but-3-en-2-one, and KOH in water.  
**Mechanism:** Cyclohexane-1,3-dione forms an enolate under basic conditions, which attacks the β-carbon of the α,β-unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one). The enolate addition results in a new carbon-carbon bond, and the product contains a 3-oxobutyl substituent on the cyclohexane ring.  

**Product:** 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.  
**Starting Material (C):** Cyclohexane-1,3-dione.  

---

### Evaluation of Options:  
- **Option A:** Incorrect for Reaction C, as it lists 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione instead of cyclohexane-1,3-dione.  
- **Option B:** Correct for all reactions: A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.  
- **Option C:** Incorrect for Reaction A, as it lists trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate instead of the correct product.  
- **Option D:** Incorrect for Reaction A and Reaction C, as it lists incorrect products for both.  

---

**Final Answer:**  
The correct option is **B**, where all products and starting materials are consistent with the reactions.  

**Answer: B**
