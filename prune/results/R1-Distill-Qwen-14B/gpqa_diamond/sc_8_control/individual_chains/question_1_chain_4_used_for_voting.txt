Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through this.

The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A) 1e-9 eV, B) 1e-11 eV, C) 1e-4 eV, D) 1e-8 eV.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime (which is the uncertainty in time). The principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the product of the energy uncertainty and the time uncertainty is on the order of ħ.

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes are given. So I think the uncertainty in time (Δt) for each state is approximately its lifetime. So for E1, Δt1 is 1e-9 s, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 s. 

The energy difference ΔE between the two states must be such that it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state to be resolved. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE_i is approximately ħ / Δt_i. And to distinguish E1 and E2, the actual energy difference between them should be bigger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, I suppose. Or maybe it's the maximum of the two uncertainties? Wait, maybe I should calculate the uncertainty for each and see what the minimum energy difference needs to be.

So first, let's compute the uncertainty in energy for each state.

The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the question uses eV, I'll need to convert units.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So let's compute ΔE for each state.

For E1: Δt1 = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2 * Δt1). But wait, sometimes the uncertainty is approximated as ħ/Δt, so maybe I can ignore the factor of 2 for this estimation. Let's proceed with ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

So ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J. Now, convert that to eV.

Since 1 J = 1/(1.60218e-19) eV, so 1 J ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ (1.0545718e-25 J) * (6.242e18 eV/J) ≈ (1.0545718e-25) * 6.242e18 ≈ 6.58e-7 eV. Wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate that.

Wait wait, because 1 J is 6.242e18 eV. So 1e-25 J would be 6.242e18 * 1e-25 eV. Which is 6.242e-7 eV. So ΔE1 ≈ 6.242e-7 eV. Wait, but 6.2e-7 eV is 0.62 microvolts? Hmm, that's a very small energy difference.

For E2: Δt2 = 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ/(Δt2) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/(1e-8 s) = 1.0545718e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.0545718e-26 J * 6.242e18 eV/J = 1.0545718e-26 * 6.242e18 ≈ (1.0545718 *6.242) * 1e-8 eV. 1.05 *6 is about 6.3, so 6.3e-8 eV. So approximately 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainties are about 6.6e-7 eV for E1 and 6.6e-8 eV for E2. So to distinguish E1 and E2, the energy difference between them (ΔE) should be at least larger than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe just larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, but each state's uncertainty is their own. So when we have two states, their energy difference must be greater than the combined uncertainty. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Because each state's uncertainty is the uncertainty in its own energy, so the energy difference between the two needs to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties to be resolvable.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to consider the energy difference relative to the uncertainty of each state. Because if the energy levels are too close, their lifetimes (and hence energy uncertainties) might mean that the energy difference is below the detection threshold.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for both states. But to make it clear, it should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time is around ħ. So for each state, the energy uncertainty is ΔE_i = ħ/(Δt_i). So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 is about 6.6e-7 eV. For E2, ΔE2 is about 6.6e-8 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties? Or maybe just larger than the maximum of the two. Because when you're trying to resolve two lines in a spectrum, the separation needs to be greater than the sum of their linewidths (which are 2ΔE, perhaps). Wait, maybe the actual formula is that the minimum energy difference should be greater than the sum of the two uncertainties.

Alternatively, perhaps each state's energy uncertainty is about ΔE_i, so the separation ΔE between E2 and E1 must be at least the sum of the individual uncertainties. Or maybe just larger than the larger of the two.

Wait, let's compute the sum: 6.6e-7 eV + 6.6e-8 eV = approx 7.26e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be greater than 7e-7 eV to be clearly resolved.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → way smaller than 7e-7, so no.

B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 7e-7. So that's definitely larger.

D) 1e-8 eV → which is 0.01e-6 eV, which is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV. Hmm, less than 7e-7 eV (which is 0.0000007 eV). So 1e-8 is 0.01e-6, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7 (0.0000007). So D is 0.00000001, which is smaller than the required 0.0000007. So D isn't sufficient.

So the only option that's larger than 7e-7 is option C, which is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, way bigger.

So the correct answer is C) 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \Delta t \)) of the state:  

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The lifetimes of the two states are given as \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainty for each state is approximately:

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2}
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \)
1. For \( \Delta E_1 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{J} = 6.242 \times 10^{18} \, \text{eV} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx (1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}) \cdot (6.242 \times 10^{18}) \, \text{eV} \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. For \( \Delta E_2 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx (1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}) \cdot (6.242 \times 10^{18}) \, \text{eV} \approx 6.6 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
   \]

### Step 2: Energy Difference Requirement
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_2 \) and \( E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.6 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.6 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the Options
- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is also much smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Final Answer
The only option that satisfies the condition is **C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**.
