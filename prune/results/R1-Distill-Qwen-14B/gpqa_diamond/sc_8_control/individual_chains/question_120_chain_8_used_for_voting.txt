Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about the distribution of stars based on parallax. Hmm, let's think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So as plx increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that the number density of stars is the same throughout space. Wait, but how does that translate into the number of stars observed with a certain parallax?

I think I should consider a volume of space. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume should be proportional to the volume. But wait, what's the volume related to a range of parallax?

Parallax is 1/d, so for a small range in plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, I need to find the corresponding change in distance. Let me see: plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. If plx increases by dplx, then the distance changes by dd. Let's compute dd in terms of dplx.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking derivative: dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases. But when considering the range, perhaps the absolute value is more relevant. So dd = (1/plx^2) dplx. Wait, no. Let me think again. If plx increases by dplx (positive), then d decreases. So the distance difference would be dd = - (dplx / plx^2). But since we're looking for the volume, maybe we should express the volume in terms of distance.

The volume of a spherical shell between distance d and d + dd is (4/3)π ( (d + dd)^3 - d^3 ). For small dd, this approximates to 4π d^2 dd. So the volume element is 4π d^2 dd.

Now, since the number of stars is uniform, the number per unit volume is constant. Let's call the number density n (stars per cubic parsec). So the number of stars in the volume element would be n * 4π d^2 dd.

But we want the number of stars per unit parallax range (dplx). So, we can express the number of stars as:

N = n * 4π d^2 * dd

But since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substituting d, we get:

d = 1/plx → d^2 = 1/plx².

And dd comes from plx. Let's find dd in terms of dplx. From plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Taking differential, d (d) = - (1/plx²) dplx. So dd = (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but since plx increases, d decreases, so the distance range would be from d to d - something. Hmm, maybe it's better to express dd in terms of dplx.

Wait, plx increases by dplx, so from plx to plx + dplx, the distance goes from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). The change in distance is 1/(plx + dplx) - 1/plx. For small dplx, we can approximate this as 1/(plx)² * (-dplx) [using derivative]. But in terms of absolute change, the shell's thickness in distance is approx (dplx)/(plx^2).

Wait, but in the volume element, that's the dd. So dd ≈ (dplx)/(plx²).

Putting all together, the number of stars in this shell:

N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) )

Wait, no. Because d^2 is (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx², and dd is (dplx)/(plx²). So:

N = n * 4π * (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) )

Wait, that's 4 π n (dplx) * (1/plx^4). So N is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So if we have dN = number of stars in a small dplx around plx, then:

dN = k * (1/plx^4) dplx, where k is a constant.

Wait, but the question asks "how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx?" So that's the number per unit plx, which is dN/dplx. So,

dN/dplx = k * (1/plx^4) )

Which suggests that the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option would be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, did I make any mistake here? Let me think again. Another approach: the number of stars depends on the volume. Since the number density is uniform, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4 pi d^2 dd * n.

And since parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Also, plx varies by dplx → d varies by dd = - (dplx)/(d^2) = - (dplx * plx^2) because d=1/plx. Wait, is that correct? Let's compute:

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the thickness in distance is |dd| = (dplx)/(plx^2).

Substituting back into the number of stars:

dN = n * 4 pi d^2 |dd|

Which is,

dN = n * 4 pi (1/plx^2) * (dplx/plx^2 )

So dN = 4 pi n dplx (1/plx^4)

Thus, the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer is A) ~1/plx^4.

Alternatively, another way: the number of stars in a given range of plx is proportional to the volume per unit plx, which depends on 1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. As plx increases, the distance decreases. 

The stars are uniformly distributed, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant throughout space. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we have \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \). To express \( dd \) in terms of \( d\text{plx} \), we use the relation \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), which gives \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The absolute value of \( dd \) is:

\[
|dd| = \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}
\]

Substituting \( d^2 \) and \( |dd| \) into the expression for \( dN \), we get:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
dN = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

The number of stars per unit range of plx is therefore proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This corresponds to option A.
