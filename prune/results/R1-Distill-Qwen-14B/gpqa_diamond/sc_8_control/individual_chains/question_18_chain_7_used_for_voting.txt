Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

First, I remember that the notation like [Si/Fe]_1 means the logarithm of the ratio of silicon to iron abundances compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] equals log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_Sun. Oh wait, no wait—actually, I think the notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) for solar composition. Like, for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5, which I guess comes from the given data.

The problem gives me [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So that means the ratio of silicon to iron in Star 1 is higher than in the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3. Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, so magnesium to silicon ratio in Star 2 is higher by 10^0.3 compared to the Sun.

Wait, but I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. So [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2], or [Si_1/Si_2]?

Wait, no. The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So the ratio n_Si1 / n_Si2.

But to find that, I need expressions for the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen, perhaps.

Let me think about the given data:

For Star 1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

[Fe/H]_1 = 0, so (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So [Fe/H] is log10(n_Fe/n_H) - log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 0 → same as Sun.

For Star 2:
[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

[ Mg/H ]_2 = 0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun.

Wait, but I need to find [Si] in each star. Let's see.

Let me write down the solar values first. The Sun's data is given as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Wait, but wait: the notation is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun → so [X/Y]_star = log10( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun ) ) → which is log10( (nX/nY)_star ) - log10( (nX/nY)_sun ) = [X/Y].

Wait, no, actually, the formula is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun, right? Or is it (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun = 10^{[X/Y]_star}.

So for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

So for Star 1, since [Fe/H] is 0, the metallicity is solar. So n_Fe = n_Fe,sun * (n_H / n_H_sun) → but if [Fe/H] is 0, then n_Fe/n_H = n_Fe,sun/n_H,sun → so assuming same H, maybe?

Wait, but for the total composition, we can assume that for each star, the hydrogen abundance is the same as solar (since [Fe/H] is 0 for Star 1), but wait, Star 2's [Mg/H] is 0, so similar reasoning.

Wait, but Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means n_Fe/n_H = solar value. So for Star_1, n_Fe = (10^-4.5) * n_H, where n_H is the number density of hydrogen in Star_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → n_Mg/n_H = solar value, which is 1e-5.

But I'm more interested in the silicon abundance in each star.

Let me proceed step by step.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

We know (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun can be calculated from solar values.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is log10( (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun ) - log10( (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun ) = 0, so [Si/Fe]_sun = 0. So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

But wait, from the Sun's data, n_Fe = 10^(-4.5) * n_H_sun.

Similarly, what is n_Si in the Sun? Wait, the problem doesn't give [Si/Fe]_sun, but perhaps I can compute it.

Wait, the Sun's [X/H] for Fe is 7.5, which is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =-5.

But what about n_Si in the Sun? Hmm, the problem doesn't provide it. Oh, wait, maybe I can find [Si/Fe]_sun from the given data. Because I don't have the data for Si in the Sun. Without that, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun from the given [Mg/Si]_sun, but wait, the problem doesn't give [Mg/Si]_sun. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps using the given data, I can find [Si/Fe]_sun. Oh wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require that. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about the ratio n_Si1 / n_Si2. So I can express both in terms of n_H, and then take the ratio.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 * n_Fe1.

From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe)_sun * (n_H / n_H_sun) → but since [Fe/H]_1 =0, (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe)_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun) → but I don't know n_H1. Wait, but since we're taking a ratio of n_Si1 and n_Si2, perhaps the n_H will cancel out.

Wait, let's write expressions.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = (n_Si1/n_Fe1) * n_Fe1.

n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).

So n_Si1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).

The n_Fe_sun cancels, so:

n_Si1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

= 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun).

So from (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = 10^{0.3} (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun → n_Mg2 = 10^{0.3} (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) * n_Si2.

But n_Mg2 is also equal to n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun).

So setting them equal:

n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun) = 10^{0.3} (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) * n_Si2.

Divide both sides by n_Mg_sun:

n_H2 / n_H_sun = 10^{0.3} (1 / n_Si_sun) * n_Si2.

→ n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun / 10^{0.3}) ) * (n_H2 / n_H_sun).

Wait, but I'm trying to find n_Si2 in terms of n_H2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express n_Si2 in terms of n_H2.

Wait, let's think about Star 2:

n_Si2 = (n_Si/n_H)_2 * n_H2.

But what is (n_Si/n_H)_2? Hmm, the problem doesn't provide [Si/H] directly, but perhaps I can find it using the given [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = 10^{0.3} (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

But we know (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun → [Mg/H]_2 =0.

So (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_2 / (n_Si/n_H)_2.

Which is (n_Mg/n_H)_sun / (n_Si/n_H)_2.

= 10^{0.3} (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

So,

(n_Mg/n_H)_sun / (n_Si/n_H)_2 = 10^{0.3} (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

We can rearrange this to solve for (n_Si/n_H)_2.

(n_Si/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun / (10^{0.3} (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun )

= [ (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) ] / [ 10^{0.3} (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) ] * [ n_Si_sun / (n_Mg_sun * 10^{0.3} ) ) ]

= (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) / 10^{0.3}.

So,

n_Si2 = (n_Si/n_H)_2 * n_H2 = [ (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) / 10^{0.3} ] * n_H2.

Now, let's write down n_Si1 and n_Si2.

n_Si1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) / 10^{0.3} * n_H2.

So the ratio n_Si1 / n_Si2 would be:

[10^{0.3} * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1 ] / [ (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) / 10^{0.3} * n_H2 ]

Simplifying this:

The (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) terms cancel. So,

= [10^{0.3} * n_H1 ] / [ (1/10^{0.3}) ) * n_H2 ]

= [10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} * (n_H1 / n_H2) ]

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H1 / n_H2 ).

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2. Wait, but the stars have different masses. The problem says Star_1 has 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 has 1.2. But wait, how does that relate to the number of hydrogen atoms in their photospheres? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, the problem states that the masses are 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses, but unless I know more about their sizes or temperatures, I can't directly relate them to the number of hydrogen atoms. Wait, but in the photosphere, the number density of hydrogen would depend on the star's radius and temperature, but perhaps the problem assumes that the two stars have the same radius and temperature as the Sun, making n_H proportional to mass? Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, no, wait. The problem gives each star's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], which are 0 for both. Wait, no: [Fe/H]_1 is 0, [Fe/H]_2 is not given, but Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 =0. Wait, no, the problem states [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

Wait, the problem says: [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means for Star_1, (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (n_Mg/n_H)_2 = (n_Mg/n_H)_sun.

But how does that affect n_H in each star? Well, if a star has the same [X/H] as the Sun, does that mean that the number of X and H scale similarly? But I'm trying to find n_Si1 / n_Si2, and I've arrived at 10^{0.6} * (n_H1 / n_H2).

But I don't have data on n_H1 or n_H2. Hmm. Maybe I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars is the same as the ratio of the Sun's H because [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1 and [Mg/H] is 0 for Star_2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no. For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2 / n_H_sun).

But maybe the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same as the Sun, so n_H1 = n_H_sun * (mass factor?), but without more information, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the number of H atoms is the same as the Sun in both stars, but that doesn't make sense because the stars have different masses. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the ratio n_H1 / n_H2 cancels out. Let me check.

Wait, in the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2, the n_H1 and n_H2 terms are in the numerator and denominator, respectively. So unless I can find a relation between n_H1 and n_H2, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the fact that the stars have [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] as 0 can be used to find their H abundances.

Wait, for Star_1:

n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun).

Because [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Mg2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun) * n_H2.

But I don't see how this connects to n_H1 and n_H2.

Wait, perhaps the mass information is a red herring, and the problem is intended to ignore it. Maybe the ratio is only based on the given abundance ratios, irrespective of the star's mass. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the number of H atoms in each star is the same as the Sun. But that can't be correct because their masses are different. Alternatively, perhaps the number of H atoms is proportional to the mass of the star? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H abundance is the same in both stars, but I don't see any information supporting that.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the ratio I have. I have ratio = 10^{0.6} * (n_H1 / n_H2). But without knowing n_H1 and n_H2, I can't find the ratio. So perhaps I'm missing a crucial piece of information.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the mass of the stars. Because the only given data are the abundance ratios, so perhaps the ratio of H is 1, meaning n_H1 = n_H2. But that would only be the case if both stars have the same H abundance as the Sun, but given that their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are 0, perhaps it's the case.

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H]_1 =0 → (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun → but that doesn't necessarily imply that n_H1 =n_H_sun. It could be that n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 /n_H_sun). So unless we know how the total H abundance changes, we can't say.

Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that the total number of H is the same as the Sun. That might not be a correct assumption, but perhaps that's what the question expects.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and the H terms cancel out in the ratio. But from the expression I derived earlier, n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^{0.6} * (n_H1 / n_H2), which depends on the ratio of H densities in the two stars.

Wait, maybe the H density ratio is related to the mass ratio. But how? Well, the number of H atoms in a star would generally be proportional to its mass and inversely proportional to its volume, but without knowing the radius, I can't find the volume. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to neglect the H ratio, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the stars have the same radius and temperature, making their H number densities the same. But without that information, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe the [Fe/H] =0 implies that the H abundance is the same as the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun =0 → so n_Fe/n_H = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → which implies that n_Fe = n_Fe_sun * (n_H / n_H_sun).

But if n_Fe is the same proportion as the Sun, then perhaps the H abundance is the same as the Sun. Wait, but if the star has more mass, but same [Fe/H], then perhaps its overall H is the same as the Sun. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance in each star is the same as the Sun's. Then n_H1 =n_H_sun, n_H2= n_H_sun.

In that case, the ratio becomes 10^{0.6} → 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is about 3.98, which is option A.

Wait, but then why are the stars more massive than the Sun? Because if their H abundance is same as Sun, then their larger mass would imply more H in total, but perhaps per unit volume? I'm not sure.

But given the options, one of them is ~3.9, which would align with that reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the H ratio is the same as the mass ratio. So n_H1 /n_H2 = (1.5/1.2) = 5/4=1.25. Then the ratio would be 10^{0.6} * 1.25 ≈ 3.98 *1.25 ≈ 4.975, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mass doesn't affect the photospheric abundances, which are measured via EW, so perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the mass. Then n_H1 =n_H2 =n_H_sun, leading to the ratio of 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98 → option A.

But wait, the problem says that the stars each have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun. Does that affect the number of H atoms in their photospheres? I’m not entirely sure, but perhaps in this problem, the mass is a distractor, and the key is the elemental ratios.

Wait, then the ratio would be 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me recheck.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 * n_Fe1.

(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun * n_H1.

So n_Si1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun * n_H1.

But (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun * (n_Fe/n_H)_sun = n_Si/n_H)_sun.

So n_Si1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si/n_H)_sun * n_H1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (n_Mg/n_Si)_2 =10^{0.3} (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun).

So,

(n_Mg/n_Si)_2 = (n_Mg2) / n_Si2 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

Substituting n_Mg2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun):

(n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun)) / n_Si2 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

Divide both sides by (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun:

(n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun)) / n_Si2 ) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) = 10^{0.3}.

Simplify:

( (n_H2/n_H_sun) * n_Si_sun ) / n_Si2 ) =10^{0.3}.

→ n_Si2 = (n_H2/n_H_sun) * n_Si_sun / 10^{0.3}.

Which is the same as:

n_Si2 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H2 / 10^{0.3}.

So n_Si2 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * n_H2 /10^{0.3}.

Thus,

n_Si1 = 10^{0.3} * (n_Si/n_H)_sun * n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si/n_H)_sun * n_H2 / 10^{0.3}.

So ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) = [10^{0.3} * (n_Si/n_H)_sun *n_H1 ] / [ (n_Si/n_H)_sun *n_H2 / 10^{0.3} ].

Simplify: (n_Si/n_H)_sun cancels.

= [10^{0.3} * n_H1 ] / [n_H2/(10^{0.3}) ) ]

= 10^{0.3} * 10^{0.3} * (n_H1/n_H2 )

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H1/n_H2 )

Hmm.

But without knowing the ratio of n_H1 to n_H2, what can I do?

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to assume that the H abundance is the same as the Sun, so n_H1 =n_H_sun, n_H2 =n_H_sun. Then the ratio is 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which is option A.

But why would the H abundance be the same as the Sun in both stars? Because [Fe/H]_1 =0 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, [Fe/H]_1=0 implies that (n_Fe/n_H)_1=(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So for Star_1, n_Fe = (n_Fe_sun) * (n_H1/n_H_sun).

But if the star's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's relative to H, but the star's total mass is higher, that suggests that either n_H1 is higher or n_Fe1 is higher, but I think the problem is designed so that the H and Fe abundances are the same as the Sun's, meaning that n_H1 = n_H_sun × (mass factor?), but without knowing the radius, I can't calculate it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the H ratio, and the answer is 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which fits.

So I think the correct answer is A.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental ratios.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → \( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}} \)_1 = \( 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}_{\text{sun}} \).
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → \( \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{1}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{sun}} \).

2. **Star_2**:

   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → \( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{sun}} \).

3. **Solar Values**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\text{sun}} = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\text{sun}} = -4.5 \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\text{sun}} = 7 \) → \( \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\text{sun}} = -5 \).

### Derivation:
#### For Star_1:
- \( n_{\text{Si}}^{(1)} = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}} \right)_{\text{1}} \cdot n_{\text{Fe}}^{(1)} \).
- Substituting \( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}_{\text{1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}_{\text{sun}} \) and \( n_{\text{Fe}}^{(1)} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{(1)} \):
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}^{(1)} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}}_{\text{sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{(1)}.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}^{(1)} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{(1)}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- \( n_{\text{Si}}^{(2)} = \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}} \right)_{\text{2}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{(2)} \).
- Using \( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{2}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{sun}}}{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}}_{\text{sun}}} \):
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}^{(2)} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{sun}}}{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}}_{\text{sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{(2)}.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si}}^{(2)} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{sun}}}{10^{0.3}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{(2)}.

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
- The ratio \( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{(1)}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{(2)}} \) is:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{(1)}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{(2)}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{(1)}}{\frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{H}}}_{\text{sun}}}{10^{0.3}} \cdot n_{\text{H}}^{(2)}}.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{(1)}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{(2)}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}^{(1)}}{n_{\text{H}}^{(2)}}.
  \]

### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit information about the hydrogen abundance ratio \( \frac{n_{\text{H}}^{(1)}}{n_{\text{H}}^{(2)}} \). Assuming the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars (i.e., \( \frac{n_{\text{H}}^{(1)}}{n_{\text{H}}^{(2)}} = 1 \)), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{(1)}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{(2)}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Calculation:
- \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), which corresponds to option **A**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
