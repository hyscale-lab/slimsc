Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me take a deep breath and try to figure it out. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, stochiometric means it's in a 1:1 ratio. So each formula unit of Ca-EDTA is one calcium ion and one EDTA^4- ion. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

But the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Oh right, because the complex dissociates to some extent. So the formula for the complex dissociation would be Ca-EDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. Wait, no, wait. Wait, EDTA is usually H4Y, and the deprotonated form is Y^4-. So the complex would be CaY^2- or something like that. So if the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and Y^4-.

The given K value is 5x10^10. Wait, K for the complex formation. I think K for the complex is the formation constant, Kf. The formation constant is Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]). Or wait, sometimes K is given for the reverse reaction, but I think in this case, K is the formation constant, so high K means the complex is very stable.

Wait, but to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions, I need to relate [Ca²+] with the concentration of the complex. Since the complex is 0.02 M, but some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA.

Let me think. Let's let the concentration of the complex be C, which is 0.02 M. Let's say that the complex dissociates by an amount x. So, the concentration of Ca²+ would be x, and the concentration of EDTA^4- would be x as well (because each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-). But wait, in reality, EDTA is present in solution from the dissociation of the complex, but if the concentration of EDTA from other sources is negligible, then the EDTA comes mainly from the complex.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because EDTA could also come from the dissociation of other complexes, but I think in this problem, we can assume that the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, it produces x of Ca²+ and x of EDTA^4-.

Wait, but in reality, the complex is CaY^2-, so when it dissociates, it's into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me set up the equation.

Let me define the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So, when the complex dissociates, [Ca²+] = x, and [Y^4- ] = x. The concentration of the complex, [CaY^2- ], would be 0.02 - x. But since K is a very large number (5e10), the dissociation is very small. So x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, the K expression is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4- ]).

Substituting the values: 5e10 = (0.02)/(x^2).

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / 5e10.

Calculate that: 0.02 is 2e-2.

So x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) ) = (2 /5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

So x² = 4e-13, because 0.4e-12 is 4e-13? Wait, 0.4 * 1e-12 is 4e-13? Wait, 0.4e-12 is 4e-13, yes.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root would be sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that looks familiar. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that would be the concentration of Ca²+.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, K = 5e10 = (0.02) / (x^2).

So x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2)/(5e12) ) = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * (1e-6.5) = 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. So that's correct.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant for the complex is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of Ca²⁺ ions that dissociate from the complex. At equilibrium:

- \([Ca^{2+}] = x\),
- \([Y^{4-}] = x\),
- \([CaY^{2-}] \approx 0.02 - x \approx 0.02\) (since \( x \) is very small compared to 0.02 M).

The equilibrium expression for \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
