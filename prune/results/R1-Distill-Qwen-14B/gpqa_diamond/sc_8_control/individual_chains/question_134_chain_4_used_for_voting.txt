Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. So, the first step is to figure out which of these are acids and which are bases.

HCl is hydrochloric acid, definitely an acid. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, another acid. Ba(OH)2 is barium hydroxide, which is a strong base. So, the acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the base is Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but how much of each is being used? The volumes and molarities are given. Let me note those down. 

HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M.

Wait a second, but when you mix an acid and a base, the neutralization reaction depends on the moles of H+ and OH- ions. Oh right, but since H2SO4 is a strong acid, it'll donate two H+ ions per molecule. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions.

Wait, no, wait. Ba(OH)2 is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH⁻. So each mole gives two OH⁻ ions. Same as H2SO4, H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

So, the moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, HCl is a monoprotic acid, right? Each HCl gives one H+. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each gives two H+ ions.

So, let's compute the moles of H+ from each acid.

First, HCl: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since each gives one H+, that's 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Each gives two H+, so 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base, Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each gives two OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, so the H+ is 0.28 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles. Hmm, so the OH- is less than H+.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio. So the limiting reagent here is OH- because there's only 0.2 moles of it. So only 0.2 moles of H+ will react, leaving some H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization. Oh right, the enthalpy change per mole of reaction. I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually considered per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting.

But wait, in this case, the reaction is between the acids and the base, so the overall reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each such reaction releases a certain amount of energy (exothermic).

I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases. Wait, but sometimes it's given as about -13.7 kcal/mol. Hmm, which unit are the options using? Let's check.

The options are A and B in kcal, C in kcal, and D in kJ. So, need to be careful with units.

Wait, standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. So, if 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, then the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have -11.42 kcal as option B, but that's kcal, not kJ. Hmm, so maybe I should check the unit conversions.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, if the standard enthalpy is -57 kJ/mol, that's about -13.61 kcal/mol. Because 57 divided by 4.184 is approximately 13.61.

Wait, let me compute that: 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.61. So per mole, it's about -13.61 kcal.

Wait, but if in this problem, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacted, then the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-13.61) kcal ≈ -2.72 kcal. Which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's 0.2 moles reacting, so 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. But that's in kJ, which isn't one of the options except D, which is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. So perhaps I should consider which unit the question expects.

Looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the correct answer is in kJ, then -11.4 kJ would be close to option D, but D is -16.0, which is much bigger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the amount of H+ and OH-.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L, 0.2 M → 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M → 0.09 moles H2SO4. Since it's diprotic, 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L, 0.5 M → 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

So, reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The H+ available is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

So, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (ΔH per mole of H+).

Wait, the standard enthalpy for neutralization is per mole of H+ or per mole of OH-? Because each mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form one mole of water.

So, the standard enthalpy per mole of reaction (H+ + OH- → H2O) is about -57 kJ/mol or -13.7 kcal/mol.

But wait, sometimes, because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, does that affect the enthalpy? I think each H+ contributes to the enthalpy change, so using the same value.

So, per mole of H+ reacting, it's about -57 kJ.

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is quite a bit higher. Hmm, where's the mistake here?

Wait, maybe I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so when it reacts with a base, both H+ ions are available for neutralization. But in this case, the base's OH- is limited, so only part of the H+ from H2SO4 is used.

Wait, but in this problem, the total available H+ is 0.28 moles, but the OH- is 0.2. So, all the OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+.

So, the total enthalpy released is 0.2 moles * ΔH per mole.

Wait, but what's the ΔH per mole? The standard value is usually given per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. So, it's typically about -57 kJ per mole of H+.

So, 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options have -11.4 kJ. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's way off. Did I miscalculate the moles?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles from the volumes. Let me recheck that.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, the moles are correct. So, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

Hmm, then why isn't option D -11.4 kJ? Or perhaps the question is considering the neutralization of both H+ ions from H2SO4, but that's not possible because the OH- is limiting.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is looking for the enthalpy of the overall reaction, which might include the formation of BaSO4 and any other salts. Because when H2SO4 (acid) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (base), the products would be BaSO4, water, and some other stuff.

Wait, this complicates things because my initial approach considered only the neutralization part, but maybe the overall reaction is more complex. Let me think about the possible reaction.

H2SO4 (strong acid) and Ba(OH)2 (strong base) reacting. The neutralization reaction would produce BaSO4 as a salt, water, and perhaps excess H+ ions if the base is not enough.

Wait, let me write the reaction.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + H2O.

But since H2SO4 is diprotic, each molecule can donate two H+ ions, and Ba(OH)2 can donate two OH- ions per formula unit.

So, the balanced equation would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, let me check that. On the left, we have 2 H+ (from H2SO4) and 2 OH- (from Ba(OH)2). So total H+ and OH- are 2 each, combining to make 2 H2O.

Right side: BaSO4 (solid) and 2 H2O.

So, the balanced equation is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, wait. H2SO4 is diprotic, so perhaps the reaction is:

H2SO4 + 2 Ba(OH)2 → Ba2(SO4) + 4 H2O?

No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps each mole of H2SO4 can react with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

Because H2SO4 has 2 H+ and Ba(OH)2 has 2 OH- per formula unit. So combining them:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Yes, that seems correct.

But in the problem, we have other acids as well (HCl), so the total reaction would involve all the H+ from both acids and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but maybe I should approach this by calculating the total moles of H+ and OH-, then see which is limiting, and then compute the enthalpy based on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the neutralization is between all the H+ from both acids and the OH- from the base, and the excess H+ will remain.

But let me think again. Let's compute the total moles of H+ and OH- from each solution.

HCl provides 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 provides 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.2 mol OH-.

So, the neutralization will proceed as H+ + OH- → H2O.

The OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

But the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released per mole of H+ neutralized. So, 0.2 moles × standard enthalpy per mole.

So, standard enthalpy is about -57 kJ/mol. So 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps the standard enthalpy is being considered as -13.7 kcal/mol, which would give 0.2 × (-13.7) = -2.74 kcal, approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different standard value, like -13.6 kcal/mol, leading to 0.2 × (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why would the answer be in kcal and not kJ? Let me check the options:

Options A and B are in kcal, C is in kcal, and D is in kJ. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but wait, I thought the enthalpy per mole is about -57 kJ, which is about -13.6 kcal.

So, 0.2 moles × (-13.6 kcal/mol) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid or base, but I don't think so. It's usually per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but in the reaction, the HCl is a monoprotic acid, and H2SO4 is diprotic, but when they react with a base, each H+ contributes. So, perhaps the calculation is correct as 0.2 × (-57 kJ) → -11.4 kJ, but that's not one of the options except D. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps the question is considering the neutralization as a process where all the H+ from both acids are neutralized, but that's not possible because OH- is limited.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, and HCl is just extra and doesn't react. But that can't be right because HCl is a strong acid and would definitely react with the OH-.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the solution volumes. The problem states that all three solutions are mixed. So the total volume is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL, but that's probably not relevant for moles.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the reaction between the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, and the HCl is just an additional acid that doesn't react because the OH- is already used up.

Wait, no, because HCl would donate H+ which would react with any remaining OH-.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from both acids: 0.28 mol.

Total OH-: 0.2 mol.

So, 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

The enthalpy change is due to the 0.2 mol reaction. So, 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But in the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I'm using the wrong standard enthalpy value.

Wait, maybe the standard enthalpy of neutralization for sulfuric acid is different. Because H2SO4 is a strong acid, but its first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be, but in solution, H2SO4 is considered to donate both H+ ions. So, in that case, the enthalpy per H+ would be similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value, like -13.7 kcal/mol.

Wait, 0.2 mol × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal, which is approximately -2.72 kcal, option A.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem doesn't account for the excess H+ and only the neutralization part is considered. So, using 0.2 moles.

So, if the standard enthalpy is -13.6 kcal per mole, then 0.2 × (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, if the standard enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole, then 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ, but that isn't an option except possibly D if I miscalculated.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is about -24.8 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal), wait no, that's the other way around: 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ. So, 11.4 kJ = 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

Wait, wait, 11.4 kJ is how many kcal? 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So, 0.2 moles × (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ = -2.72 kcal.

So, the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But why is option D -16.0 kJ? That would be a larger value. Maybe the question is considering that each mole of H2SO4 releases more enthalpy, but that doesn't make sense because per H+ it's the same.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles of H+.

Wait, HCl: 500 mL × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ is 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL × 0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, 0.2 mol OH- reacting, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

So, the enthalpy is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

So, the correct answer is option A, which is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, the options also have option B as -11.42 kcal. That would be if the calculation was done in kcal. Let me see: 0.2 × (-13.7 kcal/mol) = -2.74 kcal. If the standard value is -13.7 kcal/mol, then 0.2 × (-13.7) = -2.74≈-2.72 kcal. So, that's option A.

But another thought: perhaps the problem is considering both H+ from H2SO4 and the OH- from Ba(OH)2, but also considering the formation of BaSO4, which is a solid, and that has a lattice enthalpy, which would affect the overall enthalpy change. But that complicates things and I don't think the problem expects that level of detail, especially since it's a multiple-choice question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 contributes two moles of H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes two moles of OH-, but that is already accounted for in the moles calculation.

Wait, another angle: perhaps enthalpy of neutralization is defined as the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base. So, in the case of H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2, since H2SO4 provides two H+ and Ba(OH)2 provides two OH-, each mole of H2SO4 would neutralize one mole of Ba(OH)2, releasing 2 × (enthalpy per H+).

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let me think.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, two H+ from H2SO4 react with two OH- from Ba(OH)2 to form two H2O molecules.

So, each mole of H2SO4 reacting with one mole of Ba(OH)2 releases 2 × (ΔH per H+). Assuming ΔH per H+ is -57 kJ, then per mole of H2SO4, it would release 2 × (-57) = -114 kJ.

But in this problem, how many moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are reacting?

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

But in the reaction, 1:1 molar ratio. So, 0.09 mol H2SO4 would require 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

But we have 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 available. So, H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here.

So, 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, releasing 0.09 × 2 × (-57) kJ = 0.09 × (-114) kJ = -10.26 kJ.

But wait, what about the HCl? HCl is a strong acid and will donate H+ which will react with any remaining OH-.

So, after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction, how much OH- is left?

Initial moles Ba(OH)2: 0.1 → OH- = 0.2 mol.

Used in reaction with H2SO4: 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.

Remaining OH-: 0.2 - 0.18 = 0.02 mol.

Then, the HCl's H+ is 0.1 mol. So, the remaining OH- (0.02 mol) will react with H+ from HCl, leaving 0.1 - 0.02 = 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

So, the total enthalpy change is from two parts:

1. Reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2: 0.09 mol H2SO4 × 2 × (-57 kJ) = -10.26 kJ.

2. Reaction between HCl and remaining OH-: 0.02 mol H+ × (-57 kJ) = -1.14 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: -10.26 -1.14 = -11.4 kJ.

Which is about -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72).

So, the answer would be -2.72 kcal, option A.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the overall reaction can be considered as all the H+ from all the acids reacting with OH- from the base. So, the total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So, 0.2 mol H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ → which is -2.72 kcal.

So, the answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are considered:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ from the acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \), contributing \( 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \), contributing \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine the moles of OH⁻ from the base:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \), contributing \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

3. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since \( 0.28 \, \text{mol H⁺} \) and \( 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \) are present, OH⁻ is the limiting reagent. Only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol H⁺} \) and \( 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \) will react.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol H⁺} \) reacting, the enthalpy change is:
     \[
     0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
     Converting to kcal:
     \[
     -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Match the result to the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change of \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) corresponds to option A.

Thus, the enthalpy of neutralization for the reaction is **-2.72 kcal**.

Answer: A
