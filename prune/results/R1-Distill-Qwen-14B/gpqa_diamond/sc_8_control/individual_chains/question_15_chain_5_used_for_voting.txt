Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet the researchers should observe for transits. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and host stars are different. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. From what I recall, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But the exact formula is a bit fuzzy in my memory. I think the probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Or maybe it's the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is something like P = (R_s / a)^2, where R_s is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no—wait, I think it's more about the relative sizes. Oh right, another approach: the probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth compared to the area of the planet's orbital plane. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, squared? Or is it the other way?

Wait, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_s / (a)) * (something else). Wait, perhaps the probability is (R_*/ a)^2, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_*/ a), but squared. Or maybe not squared. Let me think.

Another approach: the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane aligns with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is closer to our line of sight. The probability is roughly the area of the star's disk compared to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit subtends in the sky. Oh, right! The probability is roughly (R_* / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So the probability is proportional to (R_*^2 / a^2). Because the area of the star's disk is πR_*^2, and the area of the sphere is 4πa^2 (since the planet's orbit is a circle with radius a, and the area is 4πa^2 when considering a sphere). So the ratio is (πR_*^2) / (4πa^2) ) = R_*^2/(4a^2). So the probability is proportional to (R_*/(2a))^2, but in terms of proportionality, it's just (R_* / a)^2.

Wait, no, I think the actual formula is (R_* / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) )) , but wait, no, that's for the Doppler method detection probabilities. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I think the transit probability is given by (R_*/a)², but I'm not entirely confident. Let me check in my mind.

Another thought: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter, squared. The orbital diameter is 2a, so the ratio is (2 R_*)/(2a) ) = R_*/a. Oh wait no, wait. No, the vertical alignment must be such that the planet's path crosses our line of sight. The chance of that is proportional to (R_* / a) multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, the probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by (1 / (1 - e²)^0.5), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So for circular orbits, the probability is (R_* / a).

Wait no, maybe it's (R_* / (a (1 - e²)^0.5 )) ), but e=0 here, so it's R_* / a. Wait, but I've also heard that the probability is (R_* + R_p ) / a. But R_p is much smaller than R_*, so maybe it's approximated as R_* / a.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The probability is roughly (R_* / a), but wait, another source says that the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a)^2.

Alternatively, the transit probability is given by (R_* / a) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1-(b^2)) )) where b is the impact parameter, but that's more about when the transit actually occurs, not the probability. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should remember the formula correctly. The probability of a transit is (R_*/a)², but wait, I think that's when considering the area. So the transit probability P is approximately (R_*/a)^2. Let me see: area of the star is π R_*², the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit covers is 4 π a². So the probability is (π R_*²) / (4 π a²) ) = (R_*²)/(4a²) = (R_* / (2a))². So the probability is proportional to (R_* / (2a))², but since 2 is a constant, the proportionality is (R_*/a)^2.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (R_* / a) * (something else). Let me think of an example. Suppose a is equal to R_*, then the probability would be (R_* / a)² =1, which would be 100%, which doesn't make sense because a planet with a= R_* would have a much larger orbit, but in reality, the transit probability is higher when a is smaller, because the planet is more likely to pass in front.

Wait, no, when a is smaller, the planet's orbit is tighter, so the chance of a transit is higher. Let me think: if a is 1 unit, and R_* is 0.5 units, then the probability would be (0.5/1)^2 = 0.25 or 25%. If R_* is 0.5 and a is 0.5, then (0.5/0.5)^2 is 1, which is 100% probability. That makes sense because the planet is orbiting very close, so it's more likely to transit.

Wait, but when a is 1, and R_* is 1, then the probability would be (1/1)^2 = 100%, which isn't correct because that would imply that every planet with a = R_* would transit, but in reality, only when the orbital plane is edge-on. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, another approach: the probability is (R_* / a). Let's say a is 1, R_* is 0.5, then P is 0.5. But that doesn't fit because when a is small, the probability should be higher. Alternatively, if P is proportional to (R_* / a), then a planet with a smaller a would have a higher probability. So for a=1, R_*=0.5, P is 0.5. For a=0.5, R_*=0.5, then P is 1. That makes sense because the planet is closer, so higher chance of transit.

But I'm not confident about the exact formula. Let's look for another approach. The transit probability is given by the formula:

P = (R_* / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_p/M_* )^2 )) )

Wait, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, the probability is (R_* + R_p) / (a) ), but that's probably an approximation. Since the planets are Earth-like, their radii are much smaller than the stars, so R_p can be neglected.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is simply (R_* / a). Let me try to think of the formula again. I think the correct formula is:

P = (R_* / a) × (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_p / M_* )^2 )) )

But since M_p << M_*, this term is approximately 1, so P ≈ R_* / a.

Alternatively, another source says that the transit probability is:

P = (R_* / a) × (1 / (sqrt(1 - e^2)) ), but since e=0, it's R_* / a.

So in this case, with circular orbits, the probability is P = R_* / a.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: the probability that the planet transits is approximately (R_* / a), but only if the planet's orbital period is known. Wait, no, the period is connected to a via Kepler's third law.

But in this problem, we're given the orbital periods. So let's see: the period P_orb relates a and the star's mass via Kepler's law: P^2 = (4π²/G M_*) a^3.

But perhaps we don't need to get into that because all we need is the probability for each planet, which depends on R_* and a.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that both host stars have the same radii. Because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but their radii are the same. So R_*1 = R_*2 = R.

So the only variables are a1 and a2, the semi-major axes of the planets' orbits.

So, since the probability P is proportional to R_* / a, and R_* is the same for both stars, P is inversely proportional to a.

So if Planet_1 has a smaller a (because its period is shorter), then P1 should be higher than P2.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2. So P1 = P2 /3.

But how does the period relate to the semi-major axis a? Using Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) ) = G(M_* + M_p) / (4π²). Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, which is the mass of the star, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So, for each planet, a^3 = (G M_* P^2) / (4 π^2).

So a is proportional to (M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

So a = k * (M_* )^(1/3) * P^(2/3), where k is a constant.

So let's compute a for each planet.

For Planet_1:

M_*1 = 2 M_*2, since the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host.

P1 = (P2) /3.

So a1 = k * (2 M_*2 )^(1/3) * (P2/3)^(2/3).

a1 = k * (2)^(1/3) * (M_*2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3) * (1/3)^(2/3).

Similarly, for Planet_2:

a2 = k * (M_*2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3).

So the ratio a1/a2 is:

[2^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3)] / 1.

Let me compute this value.

2^(1/3) is approximately 1.26, since 1.26^3 ≈ 2.

(1/3)^(2/3) is equal to (3)^(-2/3) ≈ 1/(3^(0.6667)) ≈ 1/(2.08) ≈ 0.48.

So 1.26 * 0.48 ≈ 0.605.

So a1 is about 0.605 times a2.

Wait, but that ratio is a1/a2 = 0.605, so a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, the transit probability P is proportional to R_* / a. Since R_* is same for both, P is proportional to 1/a.

So P1/P2 = (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2) ) = a2 / a1 = 1/(0.605) ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, that would mean Planet_1 has a higher probability to transit, so the researchers should observe Planet_1, which is option C or D.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: ~2.7 times higher.

So according to my calculation, it's 1.65 times, so option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the ratio.

Wait, let me compute a1/a2 more accurately.

a1 = k * (2)^(1/3) * (1/3)^(2/3) * (M_*2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3).

a2 = k * (M_*2)^(1/3) * (P2)^(2/3).

So a1/a2 = (2^(1/3)) * (1/3)^(2/3).

Compute 2^(1/3) = cube root of 2 ≈ 1.2599.

(1/3)^(2/3) = cube root of (1/3)^2 = cube root of 1/9 ≈ 0.4807.

Multiply them: 1.2599 * 0.4807 ≈ 0.604.

So a1 is 0.604 * a2.

So 1/a1 is 1/(0.604 a2) = (1/0.604) * (1/a2) ≈ 1.653 * (1/a2).

So P1 = R*/a1 ≈ 1.653 * (R*/a2) = 1.653 * P2.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

Thus, Planet_1 has higher probability and the answer should be option C.

To determine which planet the researchers should observe for transits, we analyze the transit probability, which depends on the star's radius \( R_* \) and the planet's orbital distance \( a \). The transit probability is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_{*1} = R_{*2} \)), the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \( a \).

The semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_* \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_*^{1/3} P^{2/3}.
\]

For Planet_1:
- Host star mass: \( M_{*1} = 2M_{*2} \),
- Orbital period: \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \).

For Planet_2:
- Host star mass: \( M_{*2} \),
- Orbital period: \( P_2 \).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{*1}}{M_{*2}}\right)^{1/3} \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Substituting \( M_{*1} = 2M_{*2} \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(2\right)^{1/3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Approximating:
- \( 2^{1/3} \approx 1.26 \),
- \( \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{2/3} \approx 0.48 \).

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 1.26 \times 0.48 \approx 0.605.
\]

This means \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \), so Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
