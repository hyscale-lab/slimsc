Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to make sense of it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

Alright, from what I remember, the wave function's probability density must integrate to 1 over all space because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. Oh wait, but in this case, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. So the integral of the probability density from 1 to 3 should be 1.

The given wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, wait, that seems a bit odd. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function, but when calculating probabilities, we look at the modulus squared, right? So the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

But hold on, the way the wave function is written here. Let me think. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) can be written as A + B i, where A is a real part and B is the imaginary part. So the modulus squared would be A² + B². 

So, the probability density is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))² ] + (0.5)^2. Because the imaginary part is 0.5i, so when squared, it adds (0.5)^2. 

Wait, no, wait. The probability density is |ψ(x)|² which is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So yes, that's correct.

So our probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. That's because [a/sqrt(1+x)]² is a²/(1+x), and (0.5)^2 is 0.25.

But wait, the problem says that none of the particles were found outside x <1 and x>3. So the probability of finding the particle outside this region is zero. That means the integral of the probability density from negative infinity to 1, and from 3 to positive infinity is zero. Which probably implies that the wave function is zero outside this interval. Or perhaps the wave function is only defined non-zero between 1 and 3. 

Wait, but the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe this is valid only between x=1 and x=3. Because if x is less than 1, the denominator sqrt(1+x) would have a negative inside if x is less than -1. But in the problem, the particle is found between 1 and 3, so x is at least 1, so 1+x is 2 to 4. So the wave function is non-zero in that region.

But wait, the wave function outside 1 to 3 is zero. Because the measurements show that particles are only found in that region. So the wave function is zero elsewhere. So the function ψ(x) is defined as given only for x between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but how does that affect the integral? Because when we calculate the normalization, we integrate |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3, and that must equal 1.

So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 is 1.

So let's write that down. The integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Because ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So integrating that from 1 to 3:

∫(1 to 3) [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

So I can split this integral into two parts:

a² ∫(1 to 3) [1/(1+x)] dx + 0.25 ∫(1 to 3) dx = 1.

Let me compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). 

Second integral: ∫dx from 1 to 3 is (3-1) = 2.

So plugging back into the equation:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Then a is sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8487.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations. Did I account for everything correctly?

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So |ψ|^2 is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Yes. So the integral is correct. So the a squared is 0.5 / ln(2), which is about 0.7202, so a is sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8487, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is the answer.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting the probability density:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln|1+x| \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} dx = 3 - 1 = 2.
   \]

Substituting these results back:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.25 \cdot 2 = 1.
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Subtract \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202.
\]

Take the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8487.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
