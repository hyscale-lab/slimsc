Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules like O2 or HCl can be modeled using the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models. But this is the rotation-vibration model or non-rigid rotor, which probably means it's a bit more advanced than the basic rigid rotor.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. Oh wait, wait—what's the fundamental state? I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the first excited state would be the next one. But wait, in the context of rotation-vibration, maybe it's the ground state of both rotation and vibration modes?

The given data includes masses Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. I need to find the momentum p of the photon.

Wait, photons have energy and momentum. The energy of a photon is related to its frequency by E = h*f, and momentum p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. But how does that tie into the molecule's energy transition?

So the molecule is absorbing a photon. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states. So I need to calculate the energy difference between the current state and the next state. But wait, what's the current state? It's the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But wait, no—wait, the rigid rotor has quantized rotational energy levels, and the harmonic oscillator has quantized vibrational levels. The fundamental state is the first excited state? No, no, the ground state is the lowest possible, so the fundamental state is the ground state.

Wait, the problem says it's the fundamental state. So for the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0) and needs to transition to the next higher state, which would be either v=1 or J=1. But which one is lower in energy?

Wait, the energy levels in a diatomic molecule are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. For a diatomic, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) h w. The rotational energy levels are EJ = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant.

The fundamental state is the state with the lowest energy, so v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next possible state, which could be either the next rotational state (J=1) or the next vibrational state (v=1). But which one has a lower energy?

Wait, the rotational levels are spaced by 2B for each step: from J=0 to J=1, the energy increases by 2B. The vibrational levels increase by h w each step.

So we need to compare 2B and h w. If 2B is smaller than h w, then the next higher state is rotational (J=1), otherwise it's vibrational (v=1).

So, I should calculate both 2B and h w and see which is smaller.

But wait, the problem states that it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy must match either the next available transition, whichever is lower between the two.

But wait, the molecule can't absorb just any photon. The transition must be allowed, but I'm assuming that either a vibrational or rotational transition is possible. So the photon must have the energy equal to the difference between the current state and the next state.

So first, find the rotational constant B. B is given by ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia.

I for a diatomic molecule is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let me compute that.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but I need to convert this into kg because the standard units are in SI.

1 amu is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu * 1.660539e-27 kg/amu ≈ let's calculate that.

1.818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ let's see, 1.8 * 1.66 is around 2.988, so 2.988e-27 kg? Wait, wait, 1.818 *1.660539 = let's compute more accurately.

1.818 * 1.660539 = let's compute:

1.8 * 1.660539 = 2.989 (approx)
0.018 * 1.660539 ≈ 0.02989
Total ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, 1.818 * 1.660539e-27 = 1.818 * 1.660539 is approximately 3.0184e-27 kg.

So I = μ R².

R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So R squared is (2e-10 m)^2 = 4e-20 m².

Thus, I = μ R² = 3.0184e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2074e-46 kg·m².

Now, B is ħ²/(2 I). ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.2074e-46)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.112 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2074e-46 = 2.4148e-46 kg·m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4148e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 2.4148) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.4603 * 1e-22 = 4.603e-23 J.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, wait, 1e-34 squared is 1e-68. So numerator is (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator is 2 * 1.2074e-46 = 2.4148e-46.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.4148e-46) = (1.112 / 2.4148) * 1e-22.

Wait, 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22.

So 1.112 / 2.4148 ≈ approximately 0.4603.

So B ≈ 0.4603e-22 J, which is 4.603e-23 J.

Wait, but that's the value of B, the rotational constant, which is in Joules.

The energy levels for rotation are EJ = B J (J + 1). So when J=0, E0=0. J=1: E1= 2B.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B.

Now, h w is the energy spacing for the vibrational levels. w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

So h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-20 = 26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Earlier, B was 4.603e-23 J. So 2B is 9.206e-23 J.

Comparing 2B (9.2e-23 J) and hw (2.65e-19 J). Which is smaller? 2B is smaller than hw.

So the energy difference for transitioning from J=0 to J=1 is 9.2e-23 J, which is lower than the vibrational energy difference of 2.65e-19 J.

But wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one with the smallest energy increment. So the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or rotational state. The rotational transition requires less energy, so that's the next state.

So the photon's energy should match 2B, which is 9.206e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, actually, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B. So the photon must have energy E_photon = 2B =9.206e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Momentum p is E/c, since for a photon, E = pc. So p = E / (3e8 m/s).

So p = 9.206e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.0687e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

9.206e-23 / 3e8 = (9.206 / 3) * 1e-31 ≈ 3.0687e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, none of the options are in the 1e-31 range. The options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let's re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let's double-check μ.

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 40/22 is 1.81818... amu, correct.

Converting to kg: 1.81818 amu * 1.660539e-27 kg/amu.

Calculating 1.81818 *1.660539: let's compute step by step.

1.81818 * 1.660539 ≈ 1.8 *1.66 = about 2.988? Let me compute accurately.

1.81818 *1.660539 = ?

1.81818 *1.660539 = let's compute 1.81818 *1.660539.

I can approximate this as 1.81818 *1.66 ≈ 1.81818 * 1.66.

1.81818 *1.6 = 2.909088,

1.81818 *0.06 = 0.1090908.

Total ≈ 2.909088 + 0.1090908 = 3.0181788.

So 3.0181788e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² = 3.0181788e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10 m)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = 3.0181788e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20727e-46 kg·m².

Now, B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.20727e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.4145e-46 = 4.606e-23 J.

Wait, same as before. So 2B is 9.212e-23 J.

But wait, the energy for photon is E = h f = pc, so p = E/c.

So p = (9.212e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.212e-23) / (3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way off. The options are on the order of 1e-27, which is 1e4 times bigger than what I calculated. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the rotational transition with the vibrational transition. Let me think about this again.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the ground state. The next state could involve either a rotational or vibrational transition. But perhaps the photon's energy has to account for both rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, no. If the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state would be the one with the lowest energy. So the lowest energy transition is the rotational one because 2B is smaller than hw. So the photon's energy is 2B, and the momentum is E/c.

Wait, but the numbers don't match any options. The options are like 1e-27, which is 1e4 times bigger than what I have.

Ah! Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me re-express B correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state which is a combination of both rotational and vibrational. Or perhaps the model is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator, and the energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

The fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which requires less energy? We need to compare the energy of (v=1, J=0) which is Ev = (1 + ½) h w, and (v=0, J=1) which is EJ = 2B.

We already calculated that 2B is about 9.2e-23 J, and Ev (v=1) is (3/2) h w = 3.975e-19 J. So 2B is much smaller, so the next state is J=1, v=0.

So the energy difference is 2B, about 9.2e-23 J.

Then, the momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are close to that.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Hmm, these are all in 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. My calculation is way smaller.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, amu to kg step. 1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 amu *1.66e-27 kg/amu = approx 3.018e-27 kg.

I = μ R^2 = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.207e-46)

Wait, (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Divided by (2 *1.207e-46) = 2.414e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 = (1.112 /2.414) * 1e-22.

1.112 /2.414 ≈ 0.4605.

So B = 0.4605e-22 = 4.605e-23 J.

2B = 9.21e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = 9.21e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are higher by four orders of magnitude. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should have used B = h/(8 π² c I) ?

Wait, wait, another approach: the rotational constant B is also given by B = (h)/(8 π² I c), but I'm getting confused. Let me double-check the formula for B.

The rotational energy levels are EJ = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2 I). ħ is h/(2π), so ħ² is h²/(4 π²). Thus,

B = (h²)/(8 π² I).

Ah, so maybe I should compute B using this formula.

Let me compute B using this.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

I = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 π² * 1.207e-46).

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 * (9.8696) * 1.207e-46 = 8 * 9.8696 = 78.9568 approx.

So denominator = 78.9568 * 1.207e-46 ≈ 95.33e-46 = 9.533e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 /9.533e-45 = (4.39 /9.533 ) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.460 * 1e-22 = 4.60e-23 J.

Same as before. So no mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from v=0 to v=1, but that's a vibrational transition. Let's compute that.

E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is close but smaller.

Wait, but 8.83e-28 is not among the options. So perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator and a rigid rotor, and the next state is the first excited vibrational state, but perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule undergoes a transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which would be vibrational. Because 2B is much smaller than h w, but why the options don't match.

Wait, but the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy". The energy levels are a combination of vibrational and rotational. So the next state after (v=0,J=0) would be (v=0, J=1), which has lower energy than (v=1, J=0).

Because 2B < h w. So the photon's energy should be 2B, and the momentum is p=2B/c= (9.2e-23 J)/(3e8 m/s) =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia correctly.

Wait, bond length R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R².

μ is the reduced mass.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818... amu.

But wait, 1 amu is 1.660539e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) * 1.660539e-27 kg.

Which is (40/22) *1.660539e-27 = (20/11) * 1.660539e-27 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy for J=0 to J=1, which is 2B.

But according to the calculation, 2B is ~9.2e-23 J, which gives p = ~3e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way higher. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the model is different. Maybe it's a non-rigid rotor, which complicates things, but I think the approach remains similar.

Wait, wait—perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which would require h w.

But then, the energy is 2.65e-19 J, and p = 8.8e-28 kg m/s, which is 8.8e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.8e-28 N·s. None of the options match that either. The options are A:1.9e-28, B:2.3e-27, C:1.1e-27, D:1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the transition that involves both a change in vibration and rotation. But the lowest energy transition is the rotational one.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule is excited to the first vibrational state, irrespective of rotation, which would require the photon's energy to be h w, leading to p = h w /c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(3e8) = (2.65e-19)/3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is about 8.8e-28 Ns.

But the option closest to this is A)1.9e-28 and D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute h w.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

So h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e-20 = 26.504e-20 =2.6504e-19 J.

p= E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = (2.6504 /3) *1e-27 = 0.8835e-27 =8.835e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.835e-28 N·s.

But the options don't have this. The closest is D)1.4e-28, which is about half.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B again.

B = ħ²/(2 I).

ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

I is 1.207e-46 kg m².

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68 ) / (2 *1.207e-46) = (1.112 / 2.414) * 1e-22 = 0.460 *1e-22 =4.6e-23 J.

2B =9.2e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

p =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm, that's way off from the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model. Maybe the energy levels are a combination of both, and the next state is the first excited state in either mode. But perhaps the transition requires energy that is the sum of rotational and vibrational parts? Or perhaps the question is referring to the transition to the next state in the vibrational mode, assuming that the rotational mode is not involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0). But that would require energy h w.

Wait, but earlier calculation of p =8.8e-28 Ns, which is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I should be using the reduced mass correctly. Wait, no, I think I did that right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition in the rotational state, but the molecule is diatomic and the moment of inertia is correctly calculated.

Alternative approach: let's compute each option's corresponding energy and see which matches 2B or hw.

Compute the energy for each option:

Option A: p=1.9e-28 kg m/s.

E = p c =1.9e-28 *3e8 =5.7e-20 J.

Is this equal to 2B or hw?

Earlier, 2B is 9.2e-23 J. 5.7e-20 is much larger.

hw is 2.65e-19 J. 5.7e-20 is about 21% of that. So not matching.

Option B: p=2.3e-27 kg m/s.

E=2.3e-27 *3e8 =6.9e-19 J.

hw is 2.65e-19 J. 6.9e-19 is much higher than hw. So not matching.

Option C: p=1.1e-27 kg m/s.

E=1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-19 J. Still larger than hw.

Option D: p=1.4e-28 kg m/s.

E=1.4e-28 *3e8=4.2e-20 J.

Compare to 2B =9.2e-23 J. 4.2e-20 is 460 times larger than 2B. Not matching.

Hmm, none of the options match 2B or hw.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

Wait, I is 1.207e-46 kg m².

B is ħ²/(2 I).

ħ=1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.05457e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 *1.207e-46) ) = (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46) ) = (1.112 /2.414) * 1e-22 = 0.4605e-22 =4.605e-23 J.

Same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question meant the next state with the next higher energy, but for some reason, the vibrational transition is chosen. But then the photon's energy would need to be h w =2.65e-19 J, so p=8.83e-28 kg m/s, which isn't an option. But option D is 1.4e-28, which is about half of that.

Wait, perhaps the actual calculation uses a different approach. Let's think about the energy levels again.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering that the next state is the first state with higher energy than the fundamental state, which could involve a transition to the first vibrational level, but the calculation is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=1), but that would be higher energy.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to compute the value of 2B in different units.

2B is 9.2e-23 J.

But 1 J is 1 kg m²/s².

So 9.2e-23 J = 9.2e-23 kg m²/s².

p = E/c = 9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 N s (since N s is kg m/s).

Looking at the options, none are close. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2) / (20 +2) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Wait, 1.818 amu in kg is 1.818 *1.66e-27 ≈3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of 1.660539e-27 kg per amu.

So μ = (20 *2)/(22) *1.660539e-27 kg.

= (40/22)*1.660539e-27.

40/22 = 1.8181818...

So 1.8181818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition not from the ground state, but from the fundamental state, which could be the first rotational state.

Wait, the term 'fundamental state' is a bit ambiguous. Wait, in spectroscopy, the fundamental vibrational state is v=0. The rotational fundamental state is J=0. So the fundamental state of the molecule would be (v=0, J=0).

Alternatively, perhaps the 'fundamental state' refers to the state with the lowest vibrational energy, which is v=0, but J could be any value. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the vibrational ground state (v=0) but in an excited rotational state, say J=1.

But the question states it's the fundamental state, which I think is (v=0, J=0).

So I'm not sure. Given that none of the options match my calculation, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the problem.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state which is the first vibrational excited state, and the photon's energy is h w. So p= h w/c.

Wait, let's compute that.

hw=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28 or D:1.4e-28.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from (v=0,J=0) to (v=1,J=1), which would involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But that would require more energy.

E = Evibrational (from v=0 to v=1) + Erotational (from J=0 to J=1).

Evibrational = h w =2.65e-19 J.

Erotational =2B=9.2e-23 J.

Total E=2.65e-19 +9.2e-23 ≈2.65e-19 J (since 9.2e-23 is much smaller).

So p would still be approx 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But again, not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state in the rotational mode, and in that case, p=3.07e-31 kg m/s. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the question made a mistake in the given data. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the reduced mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the rotational constant in cm^-1 and then convert to energy.

Wait, the rotational constant B is often expressed in wavenumbers (cm^-1), where B(cm^-1) = h/(8 π² c I).

Wait, let me compute that.

c is the speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So B(cm^-1) = (6.626e-34 J·s) / (8 * π² * 3e8 m/s * 1.207e-46 kg m²).

Wait, compute the denominator.

8 * π² is about 78.96.

So denominator =78.96 * 3e8 *1.207e-46.

3e8 *1.207e-46 =3.621e-38.

Multiply by 78.96: 78.96 *3.621e-38 ≈ 2.86e-36.

So B(cm^-1) =6.626e-34 /2.86e-36 = approx 231.5 cm^-1.

But I'm not sure if this helps. Since 1 cm^-1 is approximately 1.986e-23 J.

So B (in J) is 231.5 *1.986e-23 ≈4.6e-21 J.

Wait, but earlier calculation was 4.6e-23 J. So this is different. Hmm, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute B in cm^-1 again.

B(cm^-1) = h/(8 π² c I).

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

I=1.207e-46 kg m².

So B=6.626e-34/(8 * π² * 3e8 *1.207e-46).

Compute denominator:

8 * π² ≈78.96

3e8 *1.207e-46 = 3.621e-38.

78.96 *3.621e-38 = approx 2.86e-36.

So denominator =2.86e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 /2.86e-36 = approx 2315 cm^-1.

Wait, that's 2315 cm^-1. Earlier I thought it was 231.5, but correct is 2315.

Wait, 1 cm^-1 is 1.986e-23 J, so B=2315 cm^-1 *1.986e-23 J/cm^-1 ≈4.6e-20 J.

Wait, that's different from what I had earlier.

Wait, this is a problem. Earlier, when I computed B in J, I got 4.6e-23 J, but using this method, I get 4.6e-20 J.

But that's a big discrepancy. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! I think I made a mistake in the formula.

The correct formula for B in terms of cm^-1 is:

B = h/(8 π² c I) → which gives B in cm^-1.

But when I compute the numerical value, perhaps I did the exponents wrong.

Let me recompute B in cm^-1.

Denominator:

8 π² c I = 8 * (9.8696) *3e8 m/s * 1.207e-46 kg m².

Compute each step:

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *3e8 = approx 2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.207e-46 = 2.3687e10 *1.207e-46 = 2.3687 *1.207 *1e-36 = approx 2.86e-36.

So denominator is 2.86e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 /2.86e-36 = approx 2316 cm^-1.

So B is about 2316 cm^-1.

Now, 1 cm^-1 is 1.986e-23 J, so B =2316 *1.986e-23 ≈4.6e-20 J.

But earlier calculation using B = ħ²/(2I) gave me B=4.6e-23 J.

So where is the error? I think I messed up the exponents somewhere.

Wait, let me recompute B using B = ħ²/(2I).

ħ = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

I=1.207e-46 kg m².

So B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.207e-46) ) = (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46) ) = (1.112/2.414 ) *1e-22 = 0.46 *1e-22 =4.6e-23 J.

Ah, so that's where the discrepancy is. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. The correct formula for B in terms of rotational energy is EJ = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2 I).

But when B is expressed in terms of cm^-1, it's done through the relation B(cm^-1) = h c/(8 π² I), where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

Wait, let me recheck.

The rotational constant in cm^-1 is given by B_rot = h c/(8 π² I).

So, B_rot = (6.626e-34 J·s *3e8 m/s)/(8 π² *1.207e-46 kg m²).

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator:8 π² *1.207e-46 =78.9568 *1.207e-46 =9.53e-45.

So B_rot =1.9878e-25 /9.53e-45 ≈2.084e19 cm^-1.

Wait, that can't be right. 2e19 cm^-1 is way too high.

Wait, no, because 1 m =100 cm, so 1 m=1e2 cm.

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute in correct units.

Wait, another approach: in calculating B_rot in cm^-1, the formula is:

B_rot = h/(8 π² c I) * (1/m) → but maybe I should convert I into g cm².

Wait, because sometimes rotational constants are expressed in terms of g cm².

Wait, 1 kg m² =10^3 g * (100 cm)^2 =1e5 g cm².

So I=1.207e-46 kg m² =1.207e-46 *1e5 g cm²=1.207e-41 g cm².

h =6.626e-34 J s =6.626e-34 kg m²/s.

So B_rot = h/(8 π² c I) → but with I in kg m².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in cgs units.

h =6.626e-34 J·s =6.626e-34 kg m²/s.

I =1.207e-46 kg m² =1.207e-46 *1e5 g cm² =1.207e-41 g cm².

c =3e10 cm/s.

So B_rot = h/(8 π² c I) → but all in cgs units.

h =6.626e-34 erg·s (since 1 erg = 1e-7 J, so 6.626e-34 J s =6.626e-24 erg s).

c =3e10 cm/s.

I=1.207e-41 g cm².

So denominator:8 π² c I =8*(9.8696)*3e10 *1.207e-41.

Compute:

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *3e10 =2.3687e12.

2.3687e12 *1.207e-41 =2.86e-29.

So denominator is 2.86e-29 erg s / (g cm²/s) ??? Wait, not sure.

Wait, numerator is h=6.626e-24 erg s.

Denominator is 8 π² c I =78.9568 *3e10 *1.207e-41.

Wait, 3e10 cm/s *1.207e-41 g cm² =3.621e-31 g cm³/s.

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 *3.621e-31 =2.86e-29 g cm³/s.

So denominator is 2.86e-29 g cm³/s.

So B_rot =6.626e-24 erg s / 2.86e-29 g cm³/s.

Erg is g cm²/s². So erg s = g cm²/s.

Denominator is g cm³/s.

So units: (g cm²/s) / (g cm³/s) ) = 1/cm.

Which is cm^-1. So correct.

Now, the numerical value:6.626e-24 /2.86e-29 = (6.626/2.86) *1e5 = approx 2.316 *1e5 =2.316e5 cm^-1.

Wait, that's 231600 cm^-1. Which is way too high. That can't be right.

Wait, but earlier calculation when using mks units gave B_rot=2316 cm^-1. So I must have made a mistake in the cgs calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let's try again.

Compute denominator:

8 π² c I =78.9568 *3e10 cm/s *1.207e-41 g cm².

=78.9568 *3e10 *1.207e-41 → 78.9568 *3 = 236.87, multiplied by 1e10 → 2.3687e12.

Multiply by 1.207e-41: 2.3687e12 *1.207e-41 = 2.86e-29.

So yes, denominator is 2.86e-29.

Numerator:6.626e-24.

So B_rot =6.626e-24 /2.86e-29 = (6.626 /2.86 ) *1e5 → 2.316 *1e5 →2.316e5 cm^-1.

Which is 231600 cm^-1. That's way too high, because typical rotational constants are in tens of cm^-1.

Wait, I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the rotational constant formula as B = ħ²/(2 I), which gave me 4.6e-23 J. So EJ= B J(J+1).

If J=1, energy is 2B=9.2e-23 J.

Hmm.

But regardless, after all this, I'm not getting an option that matches.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is about the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), and thus the photon's energy is 2B=9.2e-23 J, which gives p=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, but the energy is given by the vibrational constant, which is hw.

So E = hw =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute p.

hw =6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) *1e-20 =26.504e-20 →2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 → approx 1.9e-28.

B)2.3e-27.

C)1.1e-27.

D)1.4e-28.

Hmm. 8.8e-28 isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps the problem expects the rotational transition.

But given that none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not present, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition to the first state which is higher in energy, which could be (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1), whichever is lower.

As 2B=9.2e-23 J < hw=2.65e-19 J, the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 kg m/s. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for R. The bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which I converted correctly to 2e-10 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me recheck.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ= (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which requires energy h w.

Then, p= h w /c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(3e8) = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But option A is 1.9e-28.

Hmm. 8.83e-28 is about 4.6 times larger than option A.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of h w. Let me compute it again precisely.

h =6.62607015e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = (6.62607015 *4) *1e-20 =26.5042806e-20 =2.65042806e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.83476e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options are, again, much lower.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the transition to the next state in the rotational mode, but uses a different value for B.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the vibrational transition, and the correct option is not present. But that's unlikely.

After much confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum, and perhaps I should have used the angular frequency instead of the regular frequency. But no, in the formula p = E/c, E is in joules, which already accounts for angular frequency properly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state, which is the first excited state, which would involve vibrational (v=1) and rotational (J=0) change, but perhaps the angular frequency is given as the vibrational frequency, so the photon's energy is hw. So I think the correct approach is to calculate p = hw/c =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But again, the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the given options are incorrect.

Given that, I think the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a photon but a phonon or something else. Unlikely.

After much consideration, I think the correct approach is to compute the photon's momentum as E/c, where E is the energy difference for the next state. Since the next state is rotational, E=2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

p=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg m/s=3.07e-31 N s.

But none of the options match this, so perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But since the options are given, I must choose the closest.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B once more.

B= ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2*1.207e-46) =1.112e-68 /2.414e-46=4.6e-23 J.

2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but this is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the first state after the fundamental, which is the first vibrational state, and the energy is hw=2.65e-19 J.

p=8.83e-28 Ns.

But again, none of the options match.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and must conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me recompute μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ= (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg:1.81818 *1.660539e-27 kg= approx 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, correct. I think I didn't make a mistake there.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to go with the initial calculation, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state to the first state with both vibrational and rotational excitation, but that would require a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to (v=1, J=0), which requires hw, and the momentum is 8.83e-28 kg m/s, which is not an option.

After all this, I think the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be option C)1.1e-27 Ns. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=2)? No, that would require higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the transition to the first vibrational state, but the given options are off by a factor of 4.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute hw/c.

hw=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option D:1.4e-28, which is about 1/6th of this value.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere. Wait, perhaps the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, but it's the reduced mass that's being used. Wait, no, I used the reduced mass correctly.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since I have to choose, I'll go with the one that matches hw/c, which is approximately 8.8e-28 Ns. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option A)1.9e-28 Ns, which is about 1/5th of the calculated value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition to the next rotational state, but with a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the rotational energy as E= (J(J+1) B), where B is in different units.

But I'm not sure.

After much deliberation, I think the correct approach is to choose the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition, which is approximately 8.8e-28 Ns. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Wait, but option C is 1.1e-27 Ns, which is about 12.5 times larger than my calculated value for the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B. Let me recompute B once more.

Wait, I=μ R²=3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.018e-27 *4e-20=1.207e-46 kg m².

B= (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.207e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46) =4.6e-23 J.

Yes, same as before.

Hmm. I think I've spent enough time on this. The correct answer is likely option A)1.9e-28 Ns, corresponding to a photon energy of ≈5.7e-20 J. But I can't see how that relates to the energy differences.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the energy transitions in the quantum rotation-vibration model for a diatomic molecule. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest energy state with vibrational quantum number \( v = 0 \) and rotational quantum number \( J = 0 \). The goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Reduced Mass (\( \mu \)):**
   The reduced mass is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y}
   \]
   Substituting \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \) and \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \):
   \[
   \mu = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.660539 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.660539 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia (\( I \)):**
   The moment of inertia is given by:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2,
   \]
   where \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Substituting:
   \[
   I = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \cdot 4 \times 10^{-20} = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Constant (\( B \)):**
   The rotational constant is calculated using:
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I},
   \]
   where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Substituting:
   \[
   B = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} = \frac{1.112 \times 10^{-68}}{2.414 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.60 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \)):**
   The energy difference between \( J = 0 \) and \( J = 1 \) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_J(J=1) - E_J(J=0) = 2B = 2 \cdot 4.60 \times 10^{-23} = 9.20 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Energy Difference for Vibrational Transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \)):**
   The vibrational energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

6. **Photon Momentum (\( p \)):**
   The momentum of a photon is related to its energy by:
   \[
   p = \frac{E}{c},
   \]
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{9.20 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
   \]
   For the vibrational transition:
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
   \]

### Comparison with Options:
- **Option A (\( p = 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)):** This corresponds to an energy of \( E = pc = 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 5.7 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \), which does not match either \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \) or \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \).
- **Option B (\( p = 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \)):** This corresponds to \( E = 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 6.9 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which is much larger than both \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \) and \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \).
- **Option C (\( p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \)):** This corresponds to \( E = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 3.3 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which is also much larger than both \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \) and \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \).
- **Option D (\( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)):** This corresponds to \( E = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 4.2 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \), which does not match either \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \) or \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \).

### Conclusion:
The calculated photon momentum for the rotational transition (\( p = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \)) and vibrational transition (\( p = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)) do not match any of the given options. However, the vibrational transition energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)) is closer to the options provided, though none match exactly. Based on the reasoning and the available options, **Option C (\( p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s} \))** is selected as the most plausible answer, even though it does not perfectly align with the calculations.
