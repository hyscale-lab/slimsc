Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says that we have three solutions being mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change for this neutralization reaction. The options are given, so I think the answer will be one of the letters A to D.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but here the concentrations and volumes are different, so I guess I need to calculate the moles involved.

First, I should figure out how much acid and base are present. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, and H2SO4 is a strong acid too. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So it's an acid-base neutralization, where acids react with the base.

But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Each molecule can donate two H+ ions. So for H2SO4, the number of H+ ions contributed per mole is 2. Similarly, HCl is monoprotic, so each mole gives one H+. Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, is a strong base and each mole gives two OH- ions because its formula is Ba(OH)2. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-.

The reaction between an acid and a base generally produces water. The neutralization reaction can be written as H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this is the focus here.

But wait, the problem is about mixing three solutions. So the first step is to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Then, determine which is in excess, if any, because the reaction will proceed until one of them is used up.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution.

1. HCl:
Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So 500 mL is 0.5 liters. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

2. H2SO4:
Again, 300 mL is 0.3 liters. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, the total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Ba(OH)2:
200 mL is 0.2 liters. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from base: 0.2 moles.

Now, the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH- to produce one mole of water.

So, comparing the moles available:

H+ available: 0.28 mol
OH- available: 0.2 mol

The OH- is the limiting reactant here because it's less. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, using up 0.2 moles of H+.

So moles of water formed are 0.2 mol.

But wait, the total H+ from the acids is 0.28, and we used 0.2. So the leftover H+ is 0.08 moles. But I'm not sure if that affects the enthalpy calculation because the neutralization is only for the amount that reacts.

So the total enthalpy change would be based on the moles of H+ that actually react, which is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. Is the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H+? Because each mole of H+ reacting with OH- releases a certain amount of energy. For strong acids and bases, the enthalpy change is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). 

So each mole of H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ. But wait, sometimes it's expressed per mole of H2O formed. Because each mole of H2O is formed from one H+ and one OH-. So for each mole of H2O, the enthalpy change is -57 kJ. But wait, wait, the standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O. So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check: 57 kJ per mole is approximately 13.7 kcal per mole (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ; so 57 /4.184 ≈13.62 kcal/mol).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form one mole of water. So if that's the case, each mole of H+ reacts to release 57 kJ (or approximately 13.6 kcal).

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would release 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. Or 0.2 ×13.6 kcal ≈2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait: Is it per mole of H+? Or per mole of H2O? Because when H+ reacts with OH-, each pair makes one H2O molecule. So 0.2 moles of H2O would be formed, and the enthalpy change would be 0.2 ×57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have both kJ and kcal. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So 11.4 kJ is option D (but D is -16 kJ, so that's not matching). Option B is -11.42 kcal. But earlier I thought 0.2 moles would release about 11.4 kJ or 2.72 kcal.

Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let's double-check the calculations.

Wait, the initial moles of H+:

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 mol → 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ is 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L ×0.5 M = 0.1 mol → 2 × 0.1 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles of H+ available: 0.28.

Moles of OH- available: 0.2.

So OH- is limiting. Hence, 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 × (ΔH per mole of H+).

Wait, but wait: The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole for each H+.

So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's per mole of H2O.

Wait, each mole of H2O is formed from one mole of H+ and one of OH-, so the enthalpy per mole is -57 kJ. So 0.2 moles would be -11.4 kJ. So the answer would be -11.4 kJ, but looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the water produced. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total acid versus base. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the equivalents.

Wait, another approach: calculate the equivalents of H+ and OH-.

Equivalents = moles × n (where n is the number of H+ or OH- per formula unit).

HCl: 0.1 moles × 1 = 0.1 equivalents H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles ×2 = 0.18 equivalents H+.

Total H+ equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles ×2 = 0.2 equivalents OH-.

So the H+ equivalents (0.28) and OH- (0.2). The neutralization will proceed until the OH- is consumed, using up 0.2 eq of H+. So 0.2 eq H+ × 57 kJ per eq = 11.4 kJ.

But the options are in kJ and kcal. 11.4 kJ is 11400 J. Wait, but the options: option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which one is in excess.

Wait, H+ equivalents = 0.28.

OH- equivalents = 0.2.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent, which uses up 0.2 H+ equivalents.

So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 equivalents, leading to 0.2 moles of H2O formed.

So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But that's 11.4 kJ, which would be about 2.72 kcal (since 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal, so 11.4 × 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal).

Looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close to this value. But wait, why is that the case? Because the H+ reacting is 0.2 moles, and each mole releases 57 kJ, which is about 13.6 kcal per mole.

Wait, 57 kJ/mol is equal to 57,000 J/mol. Since 1 kcal is about 4184 J, 57,000 J is 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal/mol.

So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 ×13.6 = 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal. That's option A.

But wait, why is the answer not 11.4 kJ? Because the question gives options in both units. So the correct calculation leads to 2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But let me think if I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recalculate the moles again.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L, 0.2 M → 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M → 0.3 *0.3=0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L, 0.5 M → 0.2 *0.5=0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So the H+ available is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles H+ reacts, using up all OH-.

So the reaction produces 0.2 moles H2O.

Each mole of H2O releases 57 kJ, so 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, that's 11.4 kJ, which is 11,400 J. How many kcal is that?

11,400 J /4184 J/kcal ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately 11.4 ×2.2? No, that wouldn't make sense. Wait, 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the total reaction. Let me write the balanced equation.

HCl is H+ + Cl-.

H2SO4 is 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

So when these are mixed, the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from the base.

The net reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is limiting, so 0.2 H+ will be used, and the rest 0.08 H+ remains.

So the heat released is 0.2 × 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ → 2.72 kcal.

So the answer should be option A, -2.72 kcal.

But another thought: when H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, it fully dissociates. So each mole gives two H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- per mole. So all of that is accounted for in the H+ and OH- equivalents.

I think I got it right. So the correct answer is option A: -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl:  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, moles of H⁺ = 0.1 mol.
   - H₂SO₄:  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since Ba(OH)₂ releases 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit, moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
     The moles of H⁺ available are 0.28 mol, and the moles of OH⁻ available are 0.2 mol.  
     OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it will be completely consumed, leaving 0.08 mol of H⁺ unreacted.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
     Since 0.2 mol of OH⁻ reacts, the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Match the result with the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to option A.

**Final Answer:**  
The enthalpy of neutralization for the given reaction is **-2.72 kcal**.  
Answer: A
