Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, stochiometric—I think that means it's in a 1:1 ratio? So each Ca is bound by one EDTA. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that affecting the stability of the complex. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, I guess. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So the reaction would be Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, right? And Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

In this case, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But what about the dissociation? Because some of the Ca-EDTA will dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, the problem says stochiometric. Hmm. Oh, maybe the solution is just the complex, so initially, [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero. But that can't be because the complex can't form without these. Wait, no, the initial state is just the complex. So in solution, some of it will dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, no, because the complex is already formed. So in solution, the complex is in equilibrium with its ions. So the reaction is:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−

Wait, no, the complex is the product. So if I have CaEDTA^2−, it can dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. So the K for the dissociation would be the reciprocal of the formation constant. Oh right! Because K for dissociation is Kd = 1/Kf. Since Kf is 5e10, Kd would be 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So I can model this as:

Kd = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2−]

We know that the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2− is 0.02 M. Since the dissociation is small, the change in [CaEDTA^2−] will be negligible. So we can approximate [CaEDTA^2−] ≈ 0.02 M.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ produced from dissociation. So [Ca^2+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x as well because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So the Kd expression becomes:

Kd = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02

We know Kd = 2e-11, so:

x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 2e-11 * 0.02

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-11 * 2e-2 = (2*2) * 10^(-11-2) = 4e-13.

So x²=4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, that's around 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's probably the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my steps. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. The dissociation is x from each, so [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x. Because for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of each ion.

So the calculation is correct. Kd is 2e-11, so x^2 = 0.02 * Kd → 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, wait. Wait, 4e-13 = (2e-6.5)^2, because (2e-6.5)^2 = 4e-13. So x is 2e-6.5. What's 10^-6.5? 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-6.5 is approx 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7, which rounds to 6.3e-7, so option C.

Alternatively, if I calculate sqrt(4e-13) exactly. sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5=3.1623e-7. So 2*3.1623e-7=6.3246e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7. So yes, option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the reciprocal of the formation constant \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions formed from the dissociation of the complex. The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}.
\]

Since the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M and dissociation is small, we approximate \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02\) M. Substituting \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\), the equation becomes:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x \approx 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
