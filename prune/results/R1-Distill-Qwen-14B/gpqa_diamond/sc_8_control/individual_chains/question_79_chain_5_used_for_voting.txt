--- Reasoning Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound X after a reaction. The compound has the formula C11H12O. The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they give the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product, and I have to figure out what the original compound X was. The options are A to D.

Wait, so the reaction is probably some kind of ring-opening or maybe an addition. The reactant is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which I think is a type of catalyst or a base. Oh right, that's a common reagent for epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially in acid-catalyzed conditions. But wait, the solvent is nonpolar and the temperature is 403 K, which is pretty high. Hmm, maybe it's an elimination reaction or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let me look at that. The 1H NMR has several signals. Let me parse them:

- δ 2.28: 3H, singlet. That's probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split it, maybe a carbonyl or an aromatic ring.
- δ 2.31: Another 3H singlet. Another methyl group, perhaps in a similar environment.
- Then some aromatic signals. 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So aromatic protons with some coupling. The doublets suggest two adjacent protons maybe? Or perhaps part of a para-substituted group.

The 13C NMR shows some carbons. Let me see:

- 21.3 and 28.4, each a singlet, probably two different methyl groups.
- Then a bunch of carbons in the aromatic region: 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C). Also a carbonyl at 197.7, which is probably a ketone or an ester or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehyde would typically be higher, maybe around 200-210. Hmm, so maybe a ketone.

Wait, the product has a carbonyl group, so maybe the original compound X had an epoxide, which upon reaction opened to form a carbonyl. Because epoxides can open under certain conditions, especially under acid or base catalysis.

Looking at the options. All the options are oxiranes, which are epoxides. So, the reaction is likely an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. Wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? It's often used as a catalyst in reactions like the Sharpless epoxidation or in epoxide ring-opening reactions as a base. So maybe it's a ring-opening under basic conditions.

Wait, when an epoxide opens under basic conditions, it typically does so with a nucleophile attacking the less substituted oxygen, leading to a trans diol. But wait, sometimes it can also lead to other products, depending on the structure.

But wait, the product has a carbonyl group. Hmm, that suggests maybe a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide was part of a bicyclic structure that upon reaction forms a carbonyl. Or maybe the reaction is an elimination, leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and after the reaction, it's been opened to form a carbonyl group. Let's think about that. For example, if the epoxide is adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps upon ring-opening, the carbonyl remains, but the structure changes.

Wait, looking at the product NMR: the 13C NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7 ppm. That's a strong indication of a ketone. So the product has a ketone group.

So, the original compound was an epoxide (since the options are all oxiranes), and the reaction opened the epoxide to form a ketone. How does that happen?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the original compound is a cyclopropane or a strained ring, but the options are all epoxides. So I'll focus on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol is a 1,2-diol which, under acidic conditions, can eliminate water to form a carbonyl. But wait, in this case, the starting compound is an epoxide, not a diol.

Wait, but if the epoxide opens under acid or base conditions to form a diol, which then undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, considering the structure of the product. Let's try to reconstruct it from the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has two singlet methyl groups. That suggests two methyl groups that are not split by neighboring protons. So, perhaps they are attached to something that doesn't allow splitting, like a carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

Looking at the aromatic region:

- δ 6.75 (d, 1H)
- δ 7.08 (d, 2H)
- δ 7.68 (d, 1H)
- δ 7.71 (d, 2H)

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think: A typical doublet for an aromatic proton might be adjacent to another proton. Alternatively, if it's a para-substituted group, then it can have a doublet of doublets or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent on a benzene ring with two substituents.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two sets of doublets. For example, the 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) could be from a para-substituted benzene ring, like two doublets each integrating to 2H, which are the ortho and para protons. Wait, but that would usually give a triplet for each set, like in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually a doublet of doublets, but perhaps if it's a coupling with a substituent, it could be a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are part of a styryl group, which is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. Styryl groups (like in styrene) have protons on the double bond, which can show up as doublets.

Wait, let's think about the 13C NMR. The carbons at 141.5 and 144.1 are likely to be carbonyls or quaternary carbons. The 197.7 is definitely a carbonyl, probably a ketone.

So the product has a ketone and some aromatic ring. Let's think about the structure.

Suppose the product is a ketone with an aromatic substituent. The two methyl groups (singlets) could be attached to the carbonyl. Wait, but a ketone is R-CO-R'. If both R groups are methyl, that would be acetone, but the molecular formula would be different. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups are attached to the aromatic ring.

Alternatively, the structure could be something like (methyl)(something) ketone attached to an aromatic ring.

Wait, the product's formula can be determined from the 13C NMR. Let me think: The molecular formula of the product is not given, but the starting compound is C11H12O. Let's see: The reaction is between compound X (C11H12O) and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is C6H12N2. But probably, the reagent is a catalyst, so it doesn't get incorporated into the product. So the product's formula would remain C11H12O. But wait, the product's 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups (each 3H), so that's 6 H in methyl groups. So the product must have two methyl groups.

Let me count the number of carbons. The product's 13C NMR has 9 signals, so 9 unique carbons. Let's see:

- 2 methyl carbons (21.3 and 28.4)
- 1 carbonyl (197.7)
- 5 aromatic carbons (126.9 ×2, 127.1, 129.1 ×2, 130.3)
- 2 other carbons (141.5 and 144.1, perhaps quaternary carbons)

Wait, but the molecular formula is C11H12O. So, 11 carbons. Let's count:

- 2 methyl carbons: 2 C
- 1 carbonyl C: 1 C
- 5 aromatic C: 5 C
- 2 quaternary C: 2 C
Total so far: 10 C. Hmm, where's the 11th?

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is a ketone, and the other carbons are connected. Maybe the structure is something like a methyl ketone attached to a styryl group.

Wait, putting it all together: the product has a ketone, two methyl groups, and an aromatic ring with substituents.

Let me think about the NMR shifts. The 1H NMR shows aromatic protons in the 6.75-7.71 region. That's typical for vinyl protons or aromatic protons attached to a double bond. For example, a styryl group (benzene with a vinyl substituent) would have protons on the vinyl group.

Wait, maybe the product is something like a benzyl ketone with a substituent. Let's think about the 13C NMR: the two quaternary carbons at 141.5 and 144.1 could be carbons in a conjugated system, perhaps part of a double bond or a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to an aryl group that has a double bond.

Wait, let me think of the structure. Maybe it's (E)-4-methyl-3-penten-2-one attached to a benzene ring? Or perhaps a benzoyl group with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzophenone derivative, but that's not fitting the data as well.

Alternatively, maybe it's (4-methylphenyl)propiolone or something similar. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a methyl ketone attached to a benzene ring with a double bond. For example, methyl (E)-3-phenylpropenoate, but that's an ester, not a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like (4-methylstyryl)ketone. Styryl is CH2=CH-C6H4-.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the coupling in the 1H NMR.

The 1H NMR shows:

- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, perhaps this is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. For example, in a trans configuration, the protons on the double bond would be split into doublets, and the aromatic protons would have their own patterns.

Alternatively, the aromatic ring could have substituents that cause the splitting. Let me imagine a para-substituted benzene ring with a substituent that has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the product has a structure like (4-methylphenyl)propenone. For example, the ketone is at the end of a propenyl chain attached to a benzene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl group connected to a benzene ring via a double bond, as in a benzylidene group.

Wait, considering the 1H NMR:

The aromatic protons could be part of a para-substituted benzene. The two doublets each integrating to 2H suggest that perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and the two protons on each side are equivalent. But then the other doublets would be for adjacent groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a double bond somewhere else.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that is a carbonyl group connected to a double bond and a methyl group.

Wait, another thought: The 1H NMR has four signals in the aromatic region. Two of them are doublets integrating to 2H each, and two are doublets integrating to 1H each.

That might suggest an aromatic ring where two pairs of protons are each split into doublets. For example, in a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, the protons adjacent to substituents would have specific coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: a carbonyl group and a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, such as a vinyl group. For example, the benzene is connected via a double bond to a carbonyl group with a methyl substituent.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Suppose the product is (E)-4-methyl-3-benzylidone. So, structure would be:

Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, that would have more protons.

Wait, trying to match the NMR:

The two singlet methyl groups: perhaps one is attached to the carbonyl, and another is on the benzene ring.

Wait, for example, the structure could be 4-methylbenzaldehyde acetone? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (4-methylphenyl) acetone, but that would be (4-methylphenyl)propanone. Let me think: that would have a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position, and a ketone group attached to a two-carbon chain. But the NMR doesn't seem to fit that.

Wait, perhaps the product is 4-methylacetophenone. Structure: Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Let's see:

The CH3 groups: one attached to the carbonyl (so a singlet at δ 2.28), and another on the benzene ring (singlet at δ 2.31). The aromatic protons would be on the benzene ring. For acetophenone, the aromatic protons are typically split into a pattern. For 4-methylacetophenone, the ring would have substituents in the para position. So the ring would have substituents at positions 4 (methyl) and 1 (ketone). The aromatic protons would be at ortho and meta positions. Let me see: in 4-methylacetophenone, the ring would have a ketone group at position 1 and methyl at 4. The protons adjacent to the ketone would be deshielded.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has aromatic protons at δ 6.75, 7.08, 7.68, and 7.71. Let's think about the splitting. If the ring is 4-methylacetophenone, the ring would be 1,4-disubstituted. The protons ortho to the substituents would couple with each other and with the substituents' protons. Hmm, but acetophenone derivatives usually have simpler aromatic NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an acetophenone but a propenone attached to a benzene ring. For example, (4-methylstyryl) ketone.

Wait, maybe the structure is a vinyl group attached to the benzene ring, which is then attached to a ketone. So, like Ph-CH2-CO-CH3. No, that would not have the vinyl protons. Alternatively, Ph-CH=CH-CO-CH3. That would have a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (4-methylphenyl)propenone. Structure: Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH3. No, that's acetophenone again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-methyl-3-buten-2-one, but that's not connected to a benzene ring.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like (E)-4-methyl-3-phenylpropen-2-one. That would be:

Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the structure would be Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3, which is 4-methylphenylacetone. But that doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the options for compound X. The options are all oxiranes. So X is an epoxide. After reaction, it becomes a ketone.

So, the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening that forms a ketone. How can that happen? Maybe the epoxide is part of a bicyclic structure, or perhaps the ring-opening leads to elimination.

Wait, maybe it's a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, if the epoxide is part of a cyclic ketone, opening it could create a longer chain with a ketone.

Wait, another thought: The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K. That sounds like a base and heat. Maybe it's an elimination reaction. If the original compound had a structure that, upon ring-opening of the epoxide, would form a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, considering the possible structures of the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure: epoxide ring connected to a styryl group (CH2=CH-C6H4-CH2-). Wait, 4-methylstyryl would have a methyl on the benzene ring in the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. Hmm, that's a bit more complex. The substituent on the epoxide is a propenyl group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at the 2nd position. The phenyl group is attached to C1.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide is at position 2, and there's a styryl group at position 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide is at position 2, connected to a styryl group.

Wait, let's think about each option. The reaction is with a base, which opens the epoxide. The product has a ketone, so perhaps the ring-opening leads to a carbonyl group.

Wait, when an epoxide is opened under basic conditions, it typically forms an alkoxide, which can then get protonated. But in this case, the product has a ketone, so maybe the ring-opening followed by elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the ring-opening of the epoxide leads to a carbonyl through an oxidation. But under basic conditions, without an oxidizing agent, that's less likely.

Wait, another possibility: The epoxide is part of a carbonyl-containing structure. For example, in an α,β-epoxide, which upon ring-opening could form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure of X is an epoxide that upon ring-opening under basic conditions forms a ketone. Let's think about each option.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure would be an epoxide ring attached to a styryl group, which is CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH3 (but wait, the styryl group is CH2=CH-C6H4-). So the epoxide is connected to the CH2 of the styryl group.

When this epoxide opens, under basic conditions, the nucleophile would attack the less substituted oxygen. The styryl group is more substituted, so the base might attack the other oxygen. Let's say it's a trans opening. So the attack would lead to a diol. Hmm, but the product has a ketone, not a diol.

Wait, but maybe the ring-opening leads to a carbonyl. How? Maybe the epoxide is adjacent to a carbonyl, so upon opening, the carbonyl remains.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of a six-membered ring with a carbonyl. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's usually in the context of carbocation shifts.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's look at the product's structure again.

The product has:

- A ketone (197.7 ppm)
- Two methyl groups (singlets)
- A benzene ring with substituents
- Some carbons in the aromatic region

So the product could be 4-methylacetophenone, but that's C9H10O. But the original compound is C11H12O, so that's not matching. So the product must have more carbons.

Wait, the product has 11 carbons. So 4-methylacetophenone is C9H10O. So need two more carbons. So maybe the benzene ring has a substituent with a propenone group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (4-methylphenyl)(methyl)ketone, but that would need more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the product is 4-methyl-3-penten-2-one attached to a benzene ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, the product is 4-methylcinnamaldehyde acetone? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (4-methylstyryl)acetone, which would have the ketone and the styryl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (4-methylphenyl)propan-2-one. So, (4-methylphenyl)C(O)CH2CH3. That would have a benzene ring with a methyl in para position, and a ketone with a two-carbon chain.

In that structure, the H NMR would have:

- The two CH3 groups: one at the ketone (singlet at around 2.1 ppm), and the methyl on the benzene (singlet around 2.3 ppm). That matches the two singlet signals in the product's 1H NMR.

The aromatic protons would be on the benzene ring. For a para-substituted acetophenone, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the ortho and meta positions. But in 4-methylacetophenone, the ring is 1,4-disubstituted (assuming the ketone is at position 1 and methyl at 4). So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6.

In such a case, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be equivalent, and the meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be equivalent. So their NMR signals would split into two doublets. But wait, the product's 1H NMR shows four signals in the aromatic region, not two. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't 4-methylacetophenone but has a vinyl group.

Wait, another thought: The product's 13C NMR has carbons at 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), which adds up to 6 carbons. Plus the two methyl carbons (21.3 and 28.4), the carbonyl (197.7), and the two quaternary carbons (141.5 and 144.1). That makes 10 carbons. So where's the 11th?

Oh wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount.

13C NMR:

- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

That's 9 carbons. But the molecular formula is C11H12O. So there are two more carbons unaccounted for. Hmm, perhaps the structure has a geminal di-substitution or something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a di-substituted benzene with a ketone. Let me think: the ketone is attached to a benzene ring, which has another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a vinyl ketone, such as (E)-4-methyl-3-phenylpropen-2-one. That would have the structure Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's a straight chain. Or Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3 is 4-phenylpentan-3-one, but not matching the NMR.

Alternatively, the structure could be (E)-Ph-CH=CH-C(O)-CH3. Let's see:

The Ph is benzene, then CH=CH, then carbonyl, then methyl. So the structure is Ph-CH=CH-CO-CH3. That would have:

- The methyl group attached to the carbonyl (singlet at ~2.28 ppm)
- The benzene ring
- The double bond between the two CH groups

In the 1H NMR, the double bond's protons would show up as doublets. Let's say the double bond is between the benzene and the carbonyl. The protons on the double bond would be split into two doublets (each integrating to 1H), and the aromatic protons would have their own patterns.

In the 1H NMR:

- The two protons on the double bond (CH=CH) would each be a doublet. For example, the protons on the CH next to the benzene would be a doublet at δ around 6.75, and the protons on the CH next to the carbonyl would be a doublet at δ around 7.68. But wait, in the NMR data, there are two more doublets (7.08 and 7.71), each integrating to 2H.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. But that's pentan-3-one with a phenyl group. However, the 1H NMR would have the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl as triplets or something else. But the data shows singlets for the methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (4-methylphenyl)isopropyl ketone. So, the structure would be Ph-C(O)-CH(CH2CH3)2. No, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is (4-methylphenyl)methyl ketone, but that's 4-methylacetophenone.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the starting material. The starting material is an epoxide (oxirane). Let's think about each option:

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide. Structure: epoxide where one oxygen is connected to a styryl group (CH2=CH-C6H4-).

If this epoxide reacts, perhaps under basic conditions, it would open to form a diol. But the product has a ketone. So maybe the ring-opening followed by elimination to form a carbonyl.

Wait, when an epoxide opens under basic conditions, it forms a trans diol. Then, if there's elimination (like dehydration), the diol could form a double bond or a carbonyl.

Wait, if the diol is adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps elimination could form a ketone. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a neighboring group participation, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the original epoxide is part of a structure where opening leads to a ketone through a rearrangement.

Let me think about option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure would be oxirane where one oxygen is attached to a styryl group. So it's (CH2=CH-C6H4-O)-CH2-O- (but the actual structure is more like (CH2=CH-C6H4-O) connected as an epoxide.

Wait, the correct structure would be an epoxide where one of the oxygen's neighboring carbons is part of a styryl group. So, the epoxide is between a CH2 group and a styryl group.

When this epoxide is opened under basic conditions, the base would attack the less hindered oxygen. Let's say the attack occurs at the CH2-O part, leading to a trans diol.

But how does that lead to a ketone?

Wait, perhaps after the diol is formed, the molecule undergoes an elimination reaction, removing water to form a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, if the diol is adjacent to a carbonyl group, then elimination could form a carbonyl and a double bond. But in the case of option D, the diol would be between the epoxide's two carbons. If one of those carbons is part of a styryl group, maybe elimination leads to forming a double bond and a carbonyl.

Wait, let me draw a possible structure after ring-opening. If the starting material is (CH2=CH-C6H4-O-CH2-O)-, but that's not correct. The actual structure of D is 2-styrylepoxide, which is (CH2CH2-C6H4-O)-CH2-O. No, more accurately, it's (CH2-CH2-C6H4-O) connected as an epoxide. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The epoxide is between two CH2 groups, one of which is attached to the styryl group. So:

(CH2=CH-C6H4)-O-CH2-O-

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2=CH-C6H4)-O-CH2-CH2-O, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the structure is (CH2=CH-C6H4)-CH2-O-CH2- group, but that's not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 2-styrylepoxide is:

(CH2=CH-C6H4)-CH2-O-CH2-O, but that's not correct. An epoxide has two adjacent oxygen atoms connected to two carbons. So, for 2-styrylepoxide, the structure is likely:

O
||
CH2-CH2-C6H4-O-CH2-O

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is a three-membered ring: O connected to two adjacent carbons, one of which is connected to the styryl group.

So, structure is (CH2=CH-C6H4)-CH2-O-CH2- as a ring? No, wait, oxirane is a three-membered ring: O connected to two carbons, which are each connected to another carbon.

Ah, okay, the structure is:

O
||
CH2-CH2-C6H4
|
O

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The correct structure of 2-styrylepoxide is a three-membered ring where one of the carbons is connected to a styryl group.

So, it's:

O
|
CH2
|
CH2-CH2-C6H4

Wait, that's not making sense. Alternatively, the structure is a cyclopropane with an oxygen bridge. So, the two CH2 groups are connected by the oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH2=CH-C6H4)-CH2-O-CH2- as a ring, but that's a five-membered ring, which isn't an epoxide. Epoxide is a three-membered ring, so the structure is:

O
|
CH2
|
CH2-CH2-C6H4

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
CH2
|
CH2-CH2-C6H4

No, that's not right. I'm getting stuck on the structure of option D. Maybe I should think about the reaction.

If X is 2-styrylepoxide, then upon reaction with the base, the epoxide would open. The base would deprotonate and attack the less hindered oxygen. After ring-opening, you'd get a diol. But then, how does that diol form a ketone? Unless there's a neighboring group that can participate in elimination.

Wait, perhaps the diol undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, if the diol is adjacent to a CH2 group, elimination could form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a structure where the epoxide ring is adjacent to a carbonyl, making the product a ketone upon ring-opening.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the product's 13C NMR. The carbonyl is at 197.7, which is a ketone. The two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4. Let's say one is attached to the carbonyl (like CH3-CO-) and the other is attached to the aromatic ring (like CH3-C6H4-).

The aromatic carbons: 126.9 (2C), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C). That suggests a para-substituted benzene, where the substituents are a methyl group and a ketone group.

Wait, if the benzene has a methyl group and a ketone substituent in para positions, the aromatic carbons would have certain shifts. The carbons ortho to the substituents would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield depending on the substituent.

But perhaps instead, the benzene is connected to a propenyl group, which is then connected to a ketone.

Wait, another thought: The product's structure might be (E)-4-methyl-3-phenylpropen-2-one. Structure:

Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's 4-phenylpentan-3-one, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH=CH-C(O)-CH3. That would be (E)-3-phenylpropen-2-one with a methyl group.

In this structure, the H NMR would show:

- The two protons on the double bond (CH=CH) as doublets. The H on the CH2 would couple with each other, so each would be a doublet.
- The aromatic protons would be as in a benzene ring with a substituent (CH=CH-C(O)-CH3).

So the aromatic protons would be split into two sets: the ortho and meta to the substituent. Let's say the substituent is at position 1 of the benzene. Then positions 2 and 6 are ortho, 3 and 5 are meta, and 4 is the para position (which is a methyl group in the product's case). So the aromatic protons would be:

- Ortho (2 and 6): each H would couple with their adjacent H and with the substituent's H. But in a para-substituted benzene, the ortho and meta protons would each be a doublet of doublets, but in the product's NMR, they are simple doublets.

Alternatively, the substituent is at position 4 (para) of the benzene. Then, the substituent is CH=CH-C(O)-CH3. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6.

In such a case, positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the substituent, and positions 3 and 5 would be meta. Each of these protons would couple with adjacent protons.

But in the product's NMR, the aromatic region has four signals: a doublet integrating to 1H, another doublet for 2H, another for 1H, and another for 2H.

Hmm, perhaps the structure isn't a simple para-substituted benzene but has a substituent that causes more splitting.

Wait, another angle: The product's 1H NMR shows that the aromatic protons include two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests that there are two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons.

In a benzene ring, if there are two substituents in the para positions, the remaining four protons split into two sets of two, each as a doublet. For example, substituents at positions 1 and 4 would leave positions 2,3,5,6. These would split into two doublets: positions 2 and 6 as one set, and 3 and 5 as another.

So, for a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. But in the product's NMR, there are four signals. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't on the benzene but on a side chain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring connected by a propenyl group to an aldehyde. But the product in question has a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Wait, looking back at the 13C NMR: the carbons at 141.5 and 144.1 are likely to be carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, in a propenone structure, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl would be around 125-140 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3, but that's 4-phenylpentan-3-one. Let me check the NMR.

The methyl groups would be at δ 2.28 and 2.31. The aromatic protons would be a triplet or something else. But according to the product's data, the aromatic protons are four signals, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-Ph-CH=CH-C(O)-CH3. Then, the two double bond protons would each be a doublet. The aromatic protons would have a certain pattern. Let's think:

The benzene ring would have a substituent at position 1: CH=CH-C(O)-CH3. The substituent is in the para position, so the ring would have the substituent at 1 and 4 (for a 1,4-disubstituted benzene). But that would leave the aromatic protons at positions 2,3,5,6, which would split into two doublets. However, the product's NMR shows four signals in the aromatic region.

Wait, another thought: The substituent is at position 3 of the benzene, making it a meta substituent. So, the substituent is at position 3, and the methyl is elsewhere. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't a benzene ring but a different aromatic structure, but that seems unlikely since the options are all styryl-based.

Wait, perhaps the product is a vinyl ketone, such as (E)-4-methyl-3-phenylpropen-2-one. The structure would be Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a straight chain.

Wait, perhaps it's (E)-Ph-CH=CH-C(O)-CH3. Let me imagine the NMR.

The two protons on the double bond (CH=CH) would be as follows: the CH2 protons would be split into doublets. The H adjacent to the benzene would be around δ 6.75 (d), and the H adjacent to the carbonyl would be around δ 7.68 (d). Then, the aromatic protons would be the ortho and para to the substituent.

Wait, for the benzene ring, if the substituent is a CH=CH-C(O)-CH3 group at position 1, the ring would have substituents at position 1 and 4 (if it's a para substituent). The aromatic protons would then be at positions 2,3,5,6.

Each of these protons would be split by their adjacent protons. For example, the protons at 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent) would be equivalent and form one doublet (each coupled with their adjacent H and the substituent's H), and the protons at 3 and 5 (meta to substituent) would form another doublet.

So in the 1H NMR, the aromatic region would have two doublets: one for the ortho protons (2H) and one for the meta protons (2H). Additionally, the two double bond protons would each be a doublet (1H each), leading to four signals in the aromatic region.

Wait, but the product's 1H NMR shows four signals in the aromatic region:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

Hmm, that doesn't exactly match. Because in this structure, the aromatic protons would be two doublets (each 2H), and the double bond would add two more doublets (each 1H).

But the product's NMR has four signals: two doublets of 1H each, and two doublets of 2H each. That fits with the structure I'm thinking of: the double bond protons are each a doublet (1H each), and the aromatic ring has two doublets (2H each).

So the structure would be:

Ph-CH=CH-C(O)-CH3

But wait, that's (E)-4-phenylprop-2-en-2-one. Wait, the structure would have the ketone at the end of the double bond. Let me write it as:

CH3-C(O)-CH=CH-Ph

But that's (E)- or (Z)- configuration. The 13C NMR would show the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl as around 125-140 ppm. The carbons in the double bond would be around 125-130 ppm.

Looking back at the 13C data, the carbons at 126.9 (2C), 127.1, 129.1 (2C), and 130.3 are in the aromatic region, but perhaps they are part of the double bond and the benzene.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows 126.9 (2C), which could be the two double bond carbons (each 126.9). Then, 127.1 (1C), perhaps a carbon adjacent to the substituent. The 129.1 (2C) could be the carbons in the benzene ring adjacent to the substituent, and 130.3 (1C) could be the para carbon.

The two quaternary carbons at 141.5 and 144.1 could be the carbonyl-adjacent carbons.

Putting it all together, the product is (E)-4-phenylprop-2-en-2-one, but with a methyl group attached somewhere.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR has two methyl groups. So the structure must have two methyl groups. One is attached to the carbonyl (as in CH3-C(O)-), and the other is on the benzene ring, perhaps at the para position.

So the structure would be 4-methyl-Ph-CH=CH-C(O)-CH3. So the benzene ring has a methyl group in the para position to the substituent CH=CH-C(O)-CH3.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and meta positions to the substituent, which is at position 1, and the methyl at position 4.

So the aromatic protons would be:

- Positions 2 and 6: ortho to substituent, each with a certain shift.
- Positions 3 and 5: meta to substituent, each with another shift.

Each of these would form doublets, as they are coupled with adjacent protons. The substituent's double bond would have two protons, each as a doublet.

So, the 1H NMR would show:

- Two protons on the double bond: δ 6.75 (d, 1H) and δ 7.68 (d, 1H)
- Aromatic protons: ortho (positions 2 and 6) as a doublet at δ 7.08 (2H), and meta (positions 3 and 5) as a doublet at δ 7.71 (2H)

Wait, that matches the product's 1H NMR data exactly! So the product is 4-methyl-Ph-CH=CH-C(O)-CH3.

Now, how does this product relate to the starting material?

The starting material is an epoxide, and the product is a ketone. So the reaction must have opened the epoxide to form the ketone.

Looking at the options, the correct starting material would be the one whose structure upon reaction would form this product.

So, the starting material was an epoxide that, upon ring-opening, forms this structure.

Which of the options would, upon reaction, form 4-methyl-Ph-CH=CH-C(O)-CH3?

Looking at the options:

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2. No, wait, that's not right. Let me think again: 2-styrylepoxide would have the styryl group (CH=CH-C6H4-) attached to the epoxide.

Wait, the structure of 2-styrylepoxide is an epoxide where one of the oxygen's adjacent carbons is part of a styryl group. So it's (CH2=CH-C6H4-O)-CH2-O- as a three-membered ring.

When this epoxide is opened under basic conditions, the base would attack the less substituted oxygen. In the case of a styryl epoxide, the less substituted oxygen is the one attached to the CH2 group (since the styryl group is more substituted). So the attack would occur at that oxygen, leading to a diol.

Wait, the diol would have the structure Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the diol would be Ph-CH2-CH2-OH and HO-CH2-CH2-O- but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the ring-opening of 2-styrylepoxide under basic conditions leads to the formation of a trans diol. For example:

The epoxide is:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2

No, wait, the correct structure is:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2 (as a ring). No, that's not right. The actual structure is a three-membered ring: O connected to two CH2 groups, one of which is connected to the styryl group.

So, the structure is:

O
||
CH2
|
CH2-CH2-C6H4 (with double bond)

Wait, no. The correct structure is:

The epoxide is between two CH2 groups, one of which is attached to a CH=CH-C6H4 group.

So, the epoxide is:

(CH2=CH-C6H4)-CH2-O-CH2-

When it opens under basic conditions, the base attacks the less substituted carbon (the CH2-OH), leading to a trans diol.

So, the diol would be:

(CH2=CH-C6H4)-CH2-OH
|
CH2-OH

But wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the diol would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-C6H4-CH2

No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The reaction conditions are basic, so the ring-opening would form a trans diol.

The starting material is an epoxide with a styryl group. After ring-opening, the product would have adjacent OH groups.

But the product we have is a ketone, so there's a transformation from an epoxide to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the diol undergoes an elimination reaction to form a carbonyl group. For example, if the diol is adjacent to a CH2 group, elimination of water would form a double bond and a carbonyl.

But in this case, the product has a ketone, so perhaps the diol undergoes oxidation or some rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: The ring-opening forms a diol, which then loses a water molecule to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, if the diol is Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH, perhaps under basic conditions, it loses water to form Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-O- which then further reacts. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol undergoes an intramolecular dehydration to form a carbonyl.

Wait, if the diol is Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH, perhaps the OH groups are on adjacent carbons. Losing water would form Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-O- but that's not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is such that after ring-opening, the structure is Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH. Then, under certain conditions, this could lose water to form Ph-CH2-C(O)-CH2-O-.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement, which converts a 1,2-diol into a carbonyl compound.

The pinacol rearrangement involves a 1,2-diol (pinacol) which under acidic conditions loses water to form a carbonyl group. The product would have the carbonyl group and a new structure.

In our case, the diol from the epoxide would need to be a 1,2-diol to undergo a pinacol rearrangement. If the diol is Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OH, that's not a 1,2-diol. So perhaps the starting material's epoxide leads to a 1,2-diol upon ring-opening.

Wait, if the epoxide is between two adjacent carbons, then the diol would be a 1,2-diol. For example, if the epoxide is between C1 and C2, opening would give a 1,2-diol.

So, if the product undergoes a pinacol rearrangement, the diol would lose water and form a carbonyl group.

So, the starting material's epoxide would be between two CH2 groups, leading to a 1,2-diol upon ring-opening.

In that case, the diol would be HO-CH2-CH2-OH, but connected to a benzene ring.

Wait, but that's not possible because the diol would need to be vicinal (1,2) to undergo the pinacol rearrangement.

So, in the product, the ketone would be formed from the diol via the pinacol rearrangement.

Putting it all together, the starting material would be an epoxide where the two carbons are adjacent, connected to a benzene ring and a methyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which is the structure where the epoxide is part of a styryl group. So, the epoxide is between the CH2 and the CH2 groups attached to the benzene and the double bond.

When this epoxide opens under basic conditions, it would form a diol. Then, perhaps under the reaction conditions, the diol undergoes a pinacol rearrangement to form a carbonyl.

But the product is a ketone with two methyl groups. So the starting material must have had a structure that, upon ring-opening and rearrangement, forms the product.

Given all this, I think the correct starting material is option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Because upon ring-opening and rearrangement, it forms the ketone product with the appropriate NMR signals.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying Compound X, an oxirane (epoxide), based on the reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for 1 day, and the provided 1H- and 13C-NMR data of the product. The product has a molecular formula of C11H12O, a ketone group (indicated by the 13C NMR signal at δ 197.7 ppm), two methyl groups (singlets at δ 21.3 and 28.4 ppm), and aromatic signals suggesting a substituted benzene ring.

### Key Observations:
1. **1H NMR Analysis**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two methyl groups, likely attached to a carbonyl and an aromatic ring.
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d), δ 7.08 (2H, d), δ 7.68 (1H, d), δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic protons and vinyl protons, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring with a vinyl group.

2. **13C NMR Analysis**:
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A ketone group.
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Two methyl groups.
   - Aromatic carbons at δ 126.9 (2C), δ 127.1 (1C), δ 129.1 (2C), δ 130.3 (1C), δ 141.5 (1C), and δ 144.1 (1C): Consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring and a vinyl group.

3. **Reaction Conditions**:
   - The reaction likely involves epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions, followed by a rearrangement to form the ketone product.

### Structural Analysis of the Product:
The product is identified as **(E)-4-methyl-3-phenylpropen-2-one**, with the following structure:
- A para-methyl group on a benzene ring.
- A vinyl group (CH=CH) attached to the benzene.
- A ketone group (C=O) at the terminal position of the vinyl chain.

This structure matches the NMR data:
- The two methyl groups appear as singlets in the 1H NMR.
- The aromatic protons split into two doublets (2H each), consistent with a para-substituted benzene.
- The vinyl protons appear as doublets (1H each), consistent with the (E)-configuration.

### Reaction Pathway:
The starting material, **2-styrylepoxide** (Option D), undergoes ring-opening under basic conditions to form a diol. Subsequently, a pinacol rearrangement occurs, leading to the formation of the ketone product. This pathway explains the transformation from the epoxide to the observed ketone structure.

### Conclusion:
The starting material is **2-styrylepoxide**, as it is the only option that leads to the observed product structure after the described reaction.
