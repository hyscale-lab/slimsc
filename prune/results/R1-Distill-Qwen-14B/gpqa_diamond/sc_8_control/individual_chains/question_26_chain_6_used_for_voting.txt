Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves dienes and a reaction, so I think it's about some kind of diene reaction mechanism. 

The reaction given is Cyclohexene + A → 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. Hmm, so cyclohexene is a cyclic alkene, and when it reacts with compound A, it forms this bicyclic compound with two iodine atoms.

Wait, the product has the bicyclo[4.2.0] structure. That's a norbornene-like structure, right? Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1], but this is [4.2.0], which might be different. Let me visualize it. Bicyclo[4.2.0]octane would have two bridge rings, one with four carbons and another with two. The product has an 8,8-diiodo group and a ketone at position 7.

So, thinking about the reaction: cyclohexene is reacting with A to form this compound. I'm trying to remember what kind of reactions involve dienes and cyclohexene. Oh, wait, maybe a Diels-Alder reaction? But Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. Alternatively, this could be a diene undergoing some kind of addition reaction.

Wait, the product has two iodine atoms. So where do they come from? A might be a diiodo compound. Looking at the options given for A: options A and B have 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, while C and D have 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one. So, A is a diiodo compound that could be acting as a dienophile or undergoing a reaction with cyclohexene.

Wait, maybe it's an example of a [2+4] cycloaddition, which is the Diels-Alder. So, cyclohexene is a diene (but wait, cyclohexene has a single double bond, so maybe it's acting as a diene if there's another double bond elsewhere, but that doesn't seem to fit here. Or maybe A is a dienophile.

Alternatively, another possibility is that A is an iodine source. So, perhaps A is an iodine donor in some addition reaction.

Wait, if cyclohexene is reacting with a dienophile that has two iodine atoms, then perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction. But cyclohexene is a diene, so the dienophile would need a double bond. But the product is bicyclic, so perhaps this is an example of a [4+2] cycloaddition forming a bridged structure.

Wait, maybe A is a dienophile with two iodine atoms. Let me think about the structure of A. For example, if A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, that would have a cyclobutane ring with a ketone and two iodines. Or alternatively, ethen-1-one with two iodines.

If A is a dienophile, then in a Diels-Alder-like reaction, the diene (cyclohexene) would attack the dienophile. Let me think about the structure. The product is a bicyclo[4.2.0]octanone with two iodines at position 8. So the ketone is at position 7, and the iodines are on a bridgehead.

Wait, the product's structure suggests that two carbons are bridged with iodines. So perhaps A is a dienophile that upon reaction with cyclohexene forms this bridged structure. Let me think about the Diels-Alder reaction: the diene (conjugated double bonds) reacts with a dienophile (like a ketone with a double bond) to form a six-membered ring with substituents.

Wait, but cyclohexene doesn't have another double bond. Unless the dienophile has a conjugated system, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is an example of a Michael reaction, but that's more about addition to alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyls.

Wait, another approach: the product has a bicyclo structure, which might result from a [2+2] cycloaddition, but those are usually not as favorable unless under specific conditions. But the presence of two iodines suggests perhaps an iodination step.

Alternatively, maybe this is a ring-closing reaction. If cyclohexene reacts with a dienophile that's a cyclic iodoketone, perhaps forming a bridge. So, perhaps A is a dienophile such as 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one. Then, cyclohexene (acting as a diene) would react with it.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene is conjugated (like 1,3-diene), and the dienophile is a molecule with a double bond (like a ketone with a double bond, such as a dienophile like maleic anhydride). So if A is a dienophile with a ketone and two iodines, when it reacts with cyclohexene (the diene), it would form a six-membered ring with substituents.

Wait, but the product is bicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one, which is a fused ring structure. So perhaps the reaction is not a simple Diels-Alder but a more complex pericyclic reaction or a ring-opening followed by ring-closing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a conjugate addition. Wait, cyclohexene could be opening a dienophile in a way that forms a bridge.

Hmm, maybe it's a 1,4-conjugate addition. Let me think: if A is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone with iodines, like 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, then cyclohexene could attack at the alpha position, leading to a ring formation. So, cyclohexene would add across the conjugated system of A, leading to the bridged structure.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact mechanism here. Maybe I should look at the possible structures of A. The options for A are either 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one or 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one.

If A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, that would be a four-membered ring with a ketone and two iodines opposite each other. Then, when it reacts with cyclohexene, perhaps via a Diels-Alder-like reaction, the cycloaddition would form a bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one is a smaller molecule, maybe a diketone with iodines on the same carbon. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: the product has two iodine atoms on the same carbon (8,8-diiodo). So A must have two iodines on a single carbon. Looking at the options for A:

Option A: 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one → two iodines on C4.

Option C: 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one → two iodines on C2.

So, in the product, the two iodines are on C8. That suggests that perhaps in the reaction, the two iodines come from a single carbon in A. So, if A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, then during the reaction, the C4 would become part of the bridge, leading to the two iodines on C8.

Alternatively, if A is 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one, perhaps it's a smaller molecule, but I'm not sure how that would fit into the bicyclic structure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible dienophiles. A dienophile could be something like maleic anhydride or another electron-deficient dienophile. But in this case, A would be the dienophile, so perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone with iodine substituents.

Wait, another angle: the bicyclo[4.2.0] structure. Let me think about how that forms. Suppose cyclohexene (a six-membered ring with a single double bond) reacts with a dienophile that is a four-membered ring. For example, if A is a cyclobutene derivative.

Wait, cyclobutene is a four-membered ring with a double bond. But A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one. So, it's a cyclobutene ring with a ketone and two iodines on the same carbon.

If cyclohexene (the diene) reacts with this dienophile, perhaps via Diels-Alder, but wait cyclohexene is a monoene. Oh, wait, no, cyclohexene has one double bond, so it's a diene? No, a diene is two double bonds or a conjugated diene. Oh wait, the question says dienes are compounds with two adjacent double bonds, which is a conjugated diene. So perhaps the reactant has a diene structure.

Wait, but in the reaction, the starting material is cyclohexene, which is a single double bond. So perhaps the dienophile is A, which has a conjugated diene. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't Diels-Alder. Maybe it's a [2+2] cycloaddition, but those are less common. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening metathesis or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diels-alder type where cyclohexene is the diene, but that requires a conjugated diene. Wait, cyclohexene is a monoene, so it can't act as a diene in a Diels-Alder. Hmm, so maybe cyclohexene is the dienophile, and A is the diene. Wait, but A would have to be a conjugated diene.

Wait, the options for A are (among others) 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene, which is a conjugated diene. Oh, but in the reaction, A is a reactant, and the product is bicyclic. So perhaps A is a diene that reacts with cyclohexene (which is a dienophile) in a Diels-Alder-like reaction.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a monoene, so maybe it's acting as a dienophile. So the diene would be A. So if A is a conjugated diene, reacting with cyclohexene (the dienophile) would give a six-membered ring. But the product is bicyclo[4.2.0]octanone, which is an eight-membered bicyclic compound. So maybe the diene is a four-membered ring, and the dienophile is a four-membered ring as well, leading to a bicyclo structure.

Wait, perhaps A is a diene with a ring. For example, cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring. Or (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene is a conjugated diene in a six-membered chain.

Wait, but the product is bicyclo[4.2.0], so perhaps the diene is a four-membered ring and the dienophile is cyclohexene.

Wait, maybe the diene is a cyclobutadiene, but that's antiaromatic and unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is a substituted cyclobutene.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is a four-membered ring with two double bonds, but I'm not sure.

Wait, since the product is bicyclo[4.2.0], which has two bridge rings, perhaps the diene and dienophile each contribute parts to form the bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not Diels-Alder but another type of pericyclic reaction, like electrocyclic or another cycloaddition. But I'm not as familiar with those.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a ring-opening diels-alder. For example, if A is a bicyclic dienophile and cyclohexene opens it up.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of A. The options for A are either 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one or 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one.

If A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, then it's a four-membered ring with a ketone and two iodines on the same carbon. So, perhaps during the reaction, cyclohexene (the diene) attacks this molecule, which acts as a dienophile.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a single double bond. So, perhaps it's the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. But cyclohexene is a monoene, not a diene. Oh wait, wait! The question says dienes are compounds with two adjacent double bonds, so A must be a diene.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about dienes in general, but the reaction involves cyclohexene and A. So perhaps A is a dienophile, not a diene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's look at the product, 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. The bicyclo structure suggests that two rings are formed. The ketone is at position 7, and the two iodines are at position 8. So, the molecule has a bridge structure.

So, if cyclohexene (6-membered ring with a double bond) reacts with A, which may be a dienophile, to form this bicyclic compound. So, perhaps A is a dienophile that, when reacted with cyclohexene, forms the bicyclo structure.

Wait, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene and dienophile combine to form a six-membered ring. But to get a bicyclo structure, the dienophile might have a ring structure that, when combined with the diene, forms a bridge.

So, if A is a cyclic dienophile, perhaps a cyclobutene ring with a ketone and two iodines, then upon reaction with cyclohexene (the diene), the Diels-Alder would form a bicyclic structure.

Wait, cyclohexene (the diene) is a six-membered ring with a double bond. The dienophile would be a four-membered ring with a double bond and substituents. When they react, the diene (cyclohexene) would attack the dienophile (A), leading to a bicyclo structure.

Hmm, let me think about the structures. Suppose A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one. The structure is a four-membered ring, with a ketone at position 1 and two iodines at position 4. The double bond is between C2 and C3.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (cyclohexene) would attack the dienophile (cyclobutene derivative) such that the dienophile's double bond (C2-C3) reacts with the diene's double bond (C1-C2 in cyclohexene, perhaps). But I'm not entirely certain how the rings would form.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclohexene acts as the dienophile, and A is the diene. Wait, but A isn't a diene in that case. The options for A aren't dienes; they're either cyclobut-2-en-1-one derivatives or ethen-1-one derivatives. So, perhaps A is the dienophile, and the diene is elsewhere.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact mechanism, so maybe I should look at the second part of the question, which is about the reactivity of the dienes in option B.

The options for B are:

1. 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene
2. (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene
3. cyclopenta-1,3-diene
4. (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene

The question asks for the correct sequence of these dienes from most reactive to least reactive. So, I need to determine the order of their reactivity as dienes in some reaction, likely Diels-Alder.

In Diels-Alder reactions, the reactivity of the diene is influenced by several factors: conjugation, electron-donating groups (which increase reactivity), and electron-withdrawing groups (which decrease reactivity). Additionally, ring strain can affect reactivity; more strained dienes (like cyclopentadiene) are more reactive because they gain more stability upon ring opening.

Let's analyze each diene:

1. 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene: This is a conjugated diene with two methyl groups at the 2 and 3 positions. Methyl groups are electron-donating by the inductive effect, which increases the electron density of the diene, making it more reactive. Additionally, the diene is a four-carbon chain, which is the minimum length for a conjugated diene, so it's a good diene.

2. (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene: This is a conjugated diene with two double bonds. The structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, wait, no. Wait, hexa-2,4-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, hexa-2,4-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH=CH-CH3? No, wait, correction: hexa-2,4-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, that's actually not possible because hexa-2,4-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me write it properly.

Wait, hexa-2,4-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that would be 1,3-pentadiene. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. No, wait, hexa-2,4-diene would have double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 4-5. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's 1-2-3-4-5-6, so hexa-2,4-diene would be positions 2 and 4. So, structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, which doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, no, it's CH₂=CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₃? No, that's 2-pentene. Wait, perhaps the diene is CH₂=CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂? No, that can't have two double bonds. Maybe it's CH₂=CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂– but that's seven carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂, but that's not possible. Maybe I need to reconsider. Oh, maybe it's 1,3-diene in a six-carbon chain. So, hexa-2,4-diene would be CH₂=CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₃. Wait, that's only one double bond. Oh, wait, no, hexa-2,4-diene would have double bonds at 2 and 4 positions, meaning between 2-3 and 4-5. So structure is CH₂=CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂? No, that's not correct. Alternatively, it's CH₂=CH–CH₂–CH=CH–CH₂? Wait, that would place double bonds at 2 and 4, making the structure CH₂=CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂. Hmm, maybe it's not a conjugated diene because the double bonds are separated by a single bond. Wait, no, 2 and 4 positions in a six-carbon chain would imply double bonds at 2-3 and 4-5, making them conjugated (since they are separated by a single bond). So, yes, it's a conjugated diene.

3. cyclopenta-1,3-diene: This is a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring. Conjugated dienes are more reactive than isolated ones. Additionally, cyclopentadiene is known to be a very good diene because of the ring strain in the cyclopentane system. Upon opening into a six-membered transition state, the ring strain is relieved, making the reaction more favorable.

4. (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene: This is a conjugated diene similar to option 2, but with Z configuration. The configuration (cis or trans) can affect the reactivity, but generally, in Diels-Alder reactions, the endo rule suggests that the more substituted product is favored, but the diene's reactivity isn't significantly altered by being Z or E. However, the electron density is more important.

Now, considering reactivity: the more electron-rich the diene, the more reactive it is in Diels-Alder reactions. Electron-donating groups (like methyl groups) increase reactivity, while electron-withdrawing groups decrease it.

So, looking at the options:

Option 1: 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene. Two methyl groups at the 2 and 3 positions. Methyl groups donate electrons via inductive effect, making the diene more electron-rich. So, this diene should be quite reactive.

Option 3: cyclopenta-1,3-diene. This is a highly strained molecule. The ring strain makes the molecule more reactive because it seeks to relieve this strain by reacting. So, this diene is more reactive than typical conjugated dienes.

Option 2: (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene. A conjugated diene without any substituents. So, its reactivity would be lower than option 1 but higher than option 4, perhaps, because it's longer but more substituted.

Wait, no. The length might affect the s-cis conformation. But generally, longer dienes can have more substituents, but the presence of substituents (like methyl groups) increases reactivity.

Option 4: (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene. Same structure as option 2 but with Z configuration. The configuration might slightly affect reactivity but not as much as substituents.

So, arranging them from most reactive to least:

- cyclopenta-1,3-diene (option 3) is the most reactive due to ring strain.

- 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (option 1) is next because of the electron-donating methyl groups.

- Then, the substituted hexa-2,4-diene (option 2) since it's a conjugated diene without substituents but longer than the butadiene.

Wait, no, wait. In Diels-Alder, the diene's reactivity also depends on the ability to adopt the s-cis conformation. For longer dienes, this is easier. So, buta-1,3-diene is a four-carbon conjugated diene, which can have s-cis conformation. Hexa-2,4-diene is longer but more substituted, but without substituents, it might be less reactive than the buta diene with substituents.

So, the reactivity order would be:

3 (cyclopentadiene) > 1 (2,3-dimethylbutadiene) > 2 (E,E-hexadiene) > 4 (Z,Z-hexadiene)

Wait, but why would hexa-2,4-diene (E,E) be more reactive than hexa-2,4-diene (Z,Z)? Because the configuration doesn't change the electron density. So, maybe the order is based on the electron density and substituents.

Wait, but the hexa-2,4-diene in option 2 is E,E, which is more likely to adopt the s-cis conformation than Z,Z. Wait, no, the s-cis conformation refers to the arrangement around the single bond between the two double bonds. For a diene to be in s-cis, the two double bonds must be on the same side.

In E,E and Z,Z configurations, the substituents are in a way that the diene can more easily adopt the s-cis. However, I'm not sure if the configuration affects reactivity significantly here.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene with substituents (option 1) is more reactive than the hexa-2,4-dienes because of the electron-donating groups.

So, putting it all together, the reactivity order is:

3 (most reactive), 1, 2, 4 (least reactive).

Wait, but this contradicts what I thought earlier. Let me think again.

The cyclopentadiene (option 3) is the most reactive because of ring strain. Next, the 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (option 1) because methyl groups donate electrons, increasing reactivity. Then comes the (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene (option 2), which is a conjugated diene without substituents, so less reactive than option 1. The least reactive would be (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene (option 4), but wait, why? Because Z,Z might not be as good in s-cis? Or perhaps because of steric hindrance?

Wait, the Z,Z configuration might lead to more steric hindrance, making the s-cis conformation less favorable, thus reducing reactivity. So, option 4 would be less reactive than option 2.

So the order is 3 > 1 > 2 > 4.

Wait, but the options for B are:

Option A: B = 3,1,2,4

Option B: B= 4,2,1,3 (no, that can't be right)

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: B is 3,1,2,4.

Option B: B is 4,2,1,3.

Option C: B is 4,2,1,3.

Option D: B is 3,1,2,4.

Wait, no, let me check the options given again.

The options are:

A) A = 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, B = 3, 1, 2, 4

B) A = same as A, B = 4, 2, 1, 3

C) A = 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one, B = 4, 2, 1, 3

D) A = 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one, B =3,1,2,4.

So, according to my analysis, B's correct order is 3,1,2,4, which matches option A and D.

Now, for part A, which of the options is the correct A?

The product is 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one. So, it's a bicyclic compound with two iodines on carbon 8 and a ketone on 7.

Assuming the reaction is a Diels-Alder between cyclohexene (the diene) and A (the dienophile), but cyclohexene is a monoene, so perhaps A is a dienophile with a double bond and iodine substituents.

But wait, earlier I thought that A is the dienophile, which would have a double bond. So, 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one has a double bond at 2,3. So when cyclohexene (the diene) reacts with this, the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring, but the product is a bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone with iodines, which upon reaction with cyclohexene forms the bicyclic product.

Wait, but the product has a ketone at position 7. So, perhaps the ketone in A becomes the ketone in the product. So, in A, the ketone is at position 1 of cyclobut-2-en-1-one.

So, when A reacts, the ketone remains, and the two iodines at position 4 are now at position 8 in the product.

So, the dienophile is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one. Then, when it reacts with cyclohexene (the diene), the Diels-Alder forms a bicyclic structure.

So, option A has A as 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, and B is 3,1,2,4.

Option D has A as 2,2-diiodoethen-1-one. So, if A is this, it's a smaller molecule, perhaps not forming the bicyclic structure upon reaction with cyclohexene.

Thus, the correct A is 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one, which is option A or B. But looking at the options, only option A has A as 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one and B as 3,1,2,4.

So, the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct reactant (A) for the reaction **Cyclohexene + A → 8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one** and the reactivity order of the given dienes (B). The product, **8,8-diiodobicyclo[4.2.0]octan-7-one**, is a bicyclic compound with a ketone at position 7 and two iodines at position 8. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Part A: Identifying Reactant (A)
1. **Structure of the Product**: The product is a bicyclic compound with a ketone and two iodines. This suggests that A must contain a ketone and two iodines, which are incorporated into the product.
2. **Options for A**:
   - **4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one**: A four-membered ring with a ketone at position 1 and two iodines at position 4. This structure aligns with the product's bicyclic nature and the presence of a ketone and iodines.
   - **2,2-diiodoethen-1-one**: A smaller molecule with a ketone and two iodines on the same carbon. This structure is less likely to form the bicyclic product.

3. **Mechanism**: The reaction likely proceeds via a Diels-Alder-like mechanism, where cyclohexene (the diene) reacts with A (the dienophile). The bicyclic product suggests that A must have a structure capable of forming the bridged system. **4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one** is the most plausible reactant, as it can form the required bicyclic structure.

### Part B: Reactivity of the Dienes
1. **Dienes Given**:
   - **1. 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene**: A conjugated diene with two electron-donating methyl groups, increasing its reactivity.
   - **2. (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene**: A conjugated diene without substituents, less reactive than 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene.
   - **3. cyclopenta-1,3-diene**: A highly strained five-membered ring, making it the most reactive due to ring strain relief upon reaction.
   - **4. (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene**: A conjugated diene with Z configuration, which may experience steric hindrance, making it the least reactive.

2. **Reactivity Order**: Based on electron density, substituents, and ring strain:
   - **Most reactive**: cyclopenta-1,3-diene (3).
   - **Next**: 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (1).
   - **Then**: (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-diene (2).
   - **Least reactive**: (2Z,4Z)-hexa-2,4-diene (4).

   Thus, the reactivity order is **3 > 1 > 2 > 4**.

### Final Answer
- **A**: 4,4-diiodocyclobut-2-en-1-one.
- **B**: 3, 1, 2, 4.

This matches **Option A**.

ANSWER: A
