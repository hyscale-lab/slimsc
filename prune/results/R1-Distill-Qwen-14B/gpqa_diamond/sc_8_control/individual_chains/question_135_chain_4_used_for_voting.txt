Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the decay modes of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes how particles interact. So, in this case, the boson X interacts with fermions.

Wait, the Lagrangian looks like it's for Yukawa interactions, right? Because Yukawa couplings involve a scalar field (like X here) and fermion fields. The general form is something like λ ψ̄ ψ X, which is what's written here except for the v term. Oh but v is probably the vacuum expectation value, but maybe it's not relevant for the decay process since the boson is X. So the interaction term is proportional to X ψ̄ψ.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs. The question is about kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So we're looking for which fermion pairs the X can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

Okay, so kinematically allowed means that the fermion pair's combined mass must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Because in a decay process, the parent particle's mass must be at least the sum of the daughter particles' masses (assuming they're at rest).

So first, I need to list all possible fermions that could be produced. Let's recall the known fermions and their masses. Fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos). But neutrinos have very tiny masses, probably negligible, so they might not contribute here, but the problem doesn't mention them, so maybe we can ignore them.

For the standard model fermions, the masses are approximately:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV
- Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): around 173 GeV (way heavier than X)
- Electron (e): about 0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): about 105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are negligible.

Wait, but the boson X is 6 GeV, so the sum of the fermion pair masses must be ≤6 GeV.

So possible fermions that X can decay into as a pair (like f and fbar) are those where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Because each fermion would have mass m_f, so two would sum to 2m_f.

Looking at each fermion:

- u quark: 2.2 MeV → 4.4 MeV → way less than 6 GeV. So u and ū can be produced.
- d quark: 4.7 MeV → 9.4 MeV. Also fine.
- s quark: 95 MeV → ~0.19 GeV. Still much less than 6 GeV.
- c quark: 1.5 GeV → 3 GeV. So 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6. So c and cbar can be produced.
- b quark: 4.5 GeV → 9 GeV. Oh wait, 4.5 *2=9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b and bbar because that would require 9 GeV, which is higher than 6. So no bb decay.
- t quark: 173 GeV, way over. So no.
- e: 0.511 MeV → 1.022 MeV. Definitely allowed.
- μ: 105.7 MeV → 211.4 MeV. Also allowed.
- τ: 1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV. So 2m_τ is ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV → allowed.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. The mass of the tau is about 1.78 GeV each. So two taus would be 3.56 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. So X can decay into τ+τ-.

So the possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

But wait, what about the possibility of pair production like (u ū), (d dbar), etc.? Also, considering whether the Lagrangian allows for each of these. The given Lagrangian is -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So each term in the sum is for a specific fermion f, right? That is, for each fermion f, there's a coupling. So X can interact with any fermion f, so any f and fbar can be produced as long as the mass is okay.

So possible decay channels:

X → u ū, d dbar, s sbar, c cbar, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Wait, but the mass of tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

So looking at the options, the possible decay modes are into all these pairs except for b, t, and any others with masses over 3 GeV.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau tau, e e.

But wait, 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So option A is incorrect because it includes bbar.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau tau, mu mu, e e. So all of these are allowed, but where is the tau? I think in the options, "tau^{+}tau^{-}".

Wait, option B says c cbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So yes, that's allowed because each pair's mass is under 6 GeV.

Option C: c cbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, t tbar, tau tau, mu mu, e e. But wait, t is top quark, which has mass around 170 GeV. So 2m_t is 340 GeV, way above 6 GeV. So option C includes t tbar, which is impossible, so C is wrong.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau tau, mu mu, e e. Again, b is too heavy (sum 9 GeV), so D is wrong.

Wait, so the correct option is B, because it includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, but not b or t.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the masses.

Tau: each is about 1.78 GeV. So their sum is 3.56 GeV. 6 GeV is more than that, so allowed.

c: each is 1.5 GeV, so sum is 3 GeV, allowed.

b: sum 9 GeV, too much.

So the allowed fermions are: u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but the question is about the decay products. Each decay is into a pair, like s sbar, etc.

So the option that includes all except b and t is option B.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u u, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

So that's correct. All of those pairs have combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Option A includes b, which is wrong.

Option D includes b, which is wrong.

Option C includes t, which is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but I just thought of another thing. Does the coupling allow for the decay? Because the interaction is given as L = ... (v + X) ψ̄ ψ.

In Yukawa coupling, the interaction is proportional to X ψ̄ ψ. So for each fermion f, there's a coupling. So X can decay into any f and fbar, as long as the mass allows.

So yeah, all fermions with 2m_f ≤6 GeV are allowed.

So the only possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided describes the coupling of \( X \) to fermions, and the decay process must satisfy the condition that the total mass of the decay products does not exceed the mass of \( X \). This means \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fermion Masses**:
   - Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u = 4.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d = 9.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s = 190 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
   - Top quark (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e = 1.022 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu = 211.4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

2. **Allowed Decays**:
   The boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs where the total mass of the pair is less than or equal to 6 GeV. This includes:
   - \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( c\bar{c} \), \( e^+e^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \).
   - \( b\bar{b} \) and \( t\bar{t} \) are excluded because their combined masses exceed 6 GeV.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), \( e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
