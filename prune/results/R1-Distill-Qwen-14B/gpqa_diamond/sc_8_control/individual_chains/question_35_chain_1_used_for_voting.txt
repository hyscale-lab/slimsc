Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. The setup is that Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. Oh wait, the matrix S's first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). Hmm.

Wait, I remember that S might be related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. Let me think: the standard Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh wait, that's exactly what S is here. S is σy, because the first row is 0 and -i, and the second is i and 0. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by σy. Now, the problem says to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix (like σy) are ±1. So for σy, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. But here, Ay is c times σy, where c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of σy. So that would be (h/(4π)) * (+1) and (h/(4π)) * (-1). Simplifying, the eigenvalues should be +h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, let me make sure. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 Hermitian matrices, so their eigenvalues are real. So σy has eigenvalues ±1, which are real. When you multiply by a scalar c, the eigenvalues are multiplied by c. So yeah, Ay's eigenvalues are ±c.

So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So looking at the options, which ones have these values?

Looking at the options, option A says the eigenvalue's imaginary part is ±2πh or ±..., but wait, the eigenvalues are real, right? Because Ay is Hermitian. Because S is Hermitian (since σy is Hermitian) and c is a real scalar, so Ay is Hermitian. So eigenvalues must be real. So any option that talks about imaginary parts being non-zero can be ruled out.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary part ±2πh or ±..., that's impossible because eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary part ±1/2, real part ±1. Also, eigenvalues are real, so B's eigenvalues have imaginary parts, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². Well, A is an operator, and A² is (c S)^2. S is σy, so S² = I, the identity matrix. Because σy^2 = I for Pauli matrices. So A^2 = c² I. So any eigenvector of Ay will also be an eigenvector of A², because A² is a multiple of the identity. Because the identity matrix's eigenvectors are all vectors. So any vector is an eigenvector, so yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? Az is another component, maybe the Z-component. Well, whether they share eigenvectors depends on whether Ay and Az commute. Since they are components of angular momentum, they usually don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of Ay (eigenstates of S_y) are not eigenstates of S_z. So option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That seems correct. But let me think again.

Wait, A² would be (c S)^2 = c² S². S is σy, so S² = I. So A² is c² I. So any vector is an eigenvector of A². So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay will automatically be eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since S_y and S_z don't commute, their eigenvectors are different, so the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that means. The basis functions refer to the eigenvectors, which form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the operator. Well, for a 2x2 matrix, which is 2-dimensional, the two eigenvectors (assuming they are distinct and non-degenerate) should form a basis. So D's statement seems correct, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the matrix S is σy. Its eigenvalues are 1 and -1, so it's diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal. So the two eigenvectors form a basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) φ are indeed the basis functions for the operator. So option D seems correct as well.

Wait, but I thought option C was correct. Let me check the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. So yes, because A² is c² I, so any vector is an eigenvector of A², so the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A². But for Az, since they're different components, the eigenvectors are different, so they are not eigenvectors of Az. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis of the matrix operator. I'm a bit confused about that wording. The basis functions might refer to the basis vectors, which are the eigenvectors. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but let's re-examine the options.

Looking at the options, only one can be correct. Let me check each one.

Wait, looking back, the options are all statements about which is correct during the calculation. So perhaps only one is correct.

So let's think again: the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π). So real numbers. So any options mentioning imaginary parts are wrong. So option A and B are incorrect.

So between C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A² but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Option C is about whether the eigenvectors are also eigenvectors of A², which they are, because A² is a multiple of identity. So any vector is an eigenvector. So yes, they are. So the first part is correct. The second part is whether they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Az is another component, which doesn't commute with Ay, their eigenvectors are different. So C is correct.

Option D: Since the operator is 2x2, if it's diagonalizable, the eigenvectors form a basis. So the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay's matrix. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D might be correct, but let's see the options.

Wait, the problem gives four options, and only one is correct. So which one is correct.

Wait, let's think again about option D. The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the basis functions for a matrix operator might refer to the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. Since the eigenvectors diagonalize Ay, their span is the basis. So D is correct.

But then why is option C also correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the eigenvectors.

So, S is σy. The eigenvectors of σy are the two possible states. Let me compute them.

The matrix σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

To find the eigenvalues, we solve det(S - λ I) = 0.

So determinant of [[-λ, -i], [i, -λ]] = (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) ) = λ² - (i*(-i)) = λ² - (1) = 0. So λ² =1, so λ=1 and -1.

For λ=1, solve (S - I) v =0.

Matrix becomes [[-1, -i], [i, -1]].

Equation 1: -v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

So eigenvector is [ -i v2; v2 ] = v2 [ -i; 1 ].

So, normalized, [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for λ=-1, the eigenvector is [ i, 1 ]^T, perhaps.

So the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

So the eigenfunctions are these vectors, which form an orthonormal basis.

So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the matrix is 2x2, and the two eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But let's go back to the options. So the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

So the options are:

C) The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So both C and D could be correct statements, but the options are for which one is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So all options are possible, but only one is correct.

Wait, another approach: looking at the statements.

Which statements are correct?

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

As explained, since A² is proportional to the identity matrix, any vector is an eigenvector of A². Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So statement C's first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Az is the Z-component, which is another Pauli matrix, and the eigenstates of S_y and S_z are different (they don't share eigenvectors), so yes, the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az. So option C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the eigenvectors form a basis (they're orthogonal and non-degenerate), this is correct. So D is correct.

Wait, but wait. The matrix representation of Ay is in the standard basis. The eigenvectors are in that basis, right? So the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, but the eigenvectors form another basis.

Wait, no. The matrix is given in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors might not be the standard basis vectors. So the basis functions (standard basis) are not the same as the eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions φ are the eigenvectors, which form a different basis.

Wait, perhaps the statement in D is incorrect because the basis functions of the operator are not the same as the eigenvectors. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, the "basis functions of the matrix operator" might refer to the basis in which the matrix is diagonal, which are the eigenvectors. So in that sense, the eigenvectors form the basis, so D is correct.

But if the question is whether the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) themselves are the basis functions of the operator, then yes, because they form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to think about the question again.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

Option C's statement is about the eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of A², which they are, and not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D's statement is about the eigenfunctions being the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which they are, because they're the eigenvectors. So D is correct.

Wait, but can both C and D be correct?

Looking back at the options, the problem says which statement is correct. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a point here. Let me think about the dimensions. The operator is 2x2, so it's in a two-dimensional space. The eigenvectors form a basis for this space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) can serve as a basis. So D is correct.

But then, if both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for that, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should analyze each option's correctness.

Option A: Im eigenvalue is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real, so A is incorrect.

Option B: eigenvalue's imaginary part ±1/2, real part ±1. Also, eigenvalues are real, so B is incorrect.

Option C: correct because eigenvectors are also eigenvectors of A² (since A² is identity scaled), but not of Az (since S_y and S_z don't commute).

Option D: correct because eigenvectors form a basis.

But the question is which statement is correct. So both C and D seem correct, but perhaps there's a mistake in this reasoning.

Wait, but the problem says "the statement below will you consider to be correct." So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another angle: the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So when you calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which of the statements is true.

C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So since A² is proportional to identity, any vector is an eigenfunction, so yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of C is correct.

The second part, that they are not eigenfunctions of Az, is correct because S_y and S_z don't share eigenvectors. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix is represented in the standard basis, but the eigenfunctions are in another basis. So perhaps the basis functions refer to the standard basis vectors, not the eigenvectors. So D's statement might not be correct.

Alternatively, the statement in D is correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis, regardless of whether it's the standard basis or not.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the answer.

If I had to choose between C and D, which one is correct.

The question is about the multiple-choice, so perhaps the correct statement is C.

Wait, another point: the operator Ay is proportional to σy, so the square is (c σy)^2 = c² σy² = c² I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A², with eigenvalue c². So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So statement C's first part is correct.

So the correct answer must be option C.

But wait, let me think about the answer options again.

The options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

So yes, that's correct.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm. The basis functions of the matrix operator. That's a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the matrix operator Ay is in the standard basis, which is |+x> and |−x> or something like that. The eigenvectors of Ay are in a different basis. So the statement in D is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That would mean that the matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis. So when you represent Ay in its eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal. But the question says that the matrix is given as c S, which is in the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a different basis, which would diagonalize Ay. So D's statement is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The statement in D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix operator's basis is the set of vectors that form a basis for the space, which includes all vectors, but in this case, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options can't both be correct. So perhaps only one is correct.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the options are only one correct. Let me think again about each option.

Option C: Correct, because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is identity scaled), but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the operator. Which is correct because any set of eigenvectors can form a basis.

So both C and D are correct? But that can't be, because the answer must be one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a point about the operator A. Since A is the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, which in quantum mechanics has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for spin-½ particles. Wait, but in this problem, the operator is given as c S, where c is h/(4π), and S is σy.

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum for electrons (or muons, which are similar) is ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. So for example, S_y is (ħ/2) σy. So in this problem, Ay is c S, where c is h/(4π), and S is σy. Let me compute that.

Wait, c = h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. But in standard notation, S_y = (ħ/2) σy.

So Ay = (h/(4π)) σy = (ħ/(2 * 2π)) σy = (ħ/(2 * (2π)) ) σy.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. But regardless, the eigenvalues are ± c. So ± h/(4π).

Wait, but the question is about the options. So again, considering the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². That's correct.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, since the matrix is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the matrix is already diagonal in its own eigenbasis, so the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors. So D is correct.

But the question is to choose which statement is correct, and the options are A, B, C, D.

Given that, perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But the options likely have only one correct. So perhaps I should see which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but let me think about the calculation.

The operator Ay is given by c times σy. So its eigenvalues are ±c. The eigenvectors are orthogonal.

The operator A² is c² σy² = c² I. So any vector is an eigenvector of A². Therefore, the eigenvectors of Ay are also eigenvectors of A².

The operator Az would be c times σz, perhaps. Since σy and σz don't commute, their eigenvectors are different. So the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az. So C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real because \( A_y \) is Hermitian (as \( S \) is Hermitian and \( c \) is real).

2. **Imaginary Parts of Eigenvalues:**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real, so any option suggesting non-zero imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is incorrect.

3. **Option A:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) or \( \pm h \), which is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real and equal to \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

4. **Option B:**
   - Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \), which is also incorrect for the same reason as above.

5. **Option C:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).
   - \( A^2 = (c \cdot S)^2 = c^2 \cdot S^2 \). Since \( S^2 = I \) (the identity matrix), \( A^2 = c^2 \cdot I \), meaning any vector is an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). Thus, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \).
   - \( A_z \), the \( Z \)-component of the angular momentum operator, corresponds to \( c \cdot S_z \), where \( S_z \) is the Pauli \( Z \)-matrix. Since \( S_y \) and \( S_z \) do not commute, their eigenvectors are different. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - This statement is correct.

6. **Option D:**
   - States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the two-dimensional space, as \( A_y \) is a 2x2 matrix with non-degenerate eigenvalues. Thus, this statement is also correct.

7. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, and option C explicitly addresses the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), making it the most appropriate choice.

### Conclusion:

The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
