Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. Astronomers have used the Equivalent Width (EW) method under LTE to determine their elemental abundances.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photosphere has:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Same for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH=10^(-5)

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we need to find [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or perhaps the ratio [Si_1 / Si_2]?

Wait, no. The ratio is the amount of silicon in Star_1 compared to Star_2. So, [Si]_1 / [Si]_2.

Wait, but how do I approach this? Let me think about the abundance ratios.

First, I remember that [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities, relative to the Sun's.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0.3

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → [Fe/H]_1 = log(n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) =0. So, log(n_Fe_1/n_H_sun) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun). So, n_Fe_1 /n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about [Fe/H] as the logarithmic abundance of Fe relative to hydrogen compared to the Sun. So:

[Fe/H] = log( (n_Fe / n_H) / (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) ) = 0 → (n_Fe / n_H) = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun )

So, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

But wait, in the Sun, n_H_sun is a certain value. But in Star_1, the total hydrogen density is n_H_1, which is a different number. But the ratio n_Fe_1/n_H_1 is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, but let me think about the Sun's composition. The given data is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12 = -4.5. So, nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, in the Sun, nFe = 1e-4.5 * nH, and nMg = 1e-5 * nH.

Now, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0, which as I said, implies n_Fe_1 /n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

So, n_Fe_1 = (1e-4.5) * n_H_1.

Similarly, the [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) =0.3.

We can compute log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) from the Sun's data.

n_Si_sun can be found using [Mg/Si]_2. Wait, no, wait. Let's take it step by step.

Wait, Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) - log(n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) = 0.3.

So, I need to find n_Si_1 and n_Si_2, then compute their ratio.

First, let's find n_Si_1 for Star_1.

Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

Wait, no, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun → 0.3 = log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

So, log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

We need to compute log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun). From the Sun's data:

n_Si_sun is not directly given. Hmm, because we have the Mg and Fe, but not Si.

Wait, perhaps we can find [Mg/Si]_sun from the Sun's data.

[Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun.

We know n_Mg_sun = 1e-5 * n_H_sun.

n_Fe_sun =1e-4.5 *n_H_sun.

But what about n_Si_sun? Hmm, perhaps we can get it from [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, perhaps I need to assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is 0? Because otherwise, I might not have enough info. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it.

Wait, from the given data for the Sun, we have n_Mg =1e-5 *n_H_sun. But we don't have n_Si. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Because without n_Si, I can't compute [Mg/Si]_sun. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to assume that the Sun has [Mg/Si]_sun = 0? Or perhaps I can calculate [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, we have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - [Mg/Si]_sun =0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3.

But without knowing [Mg/Si]_sun, I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute [Mg/Si]_sun using the Sun's data.

Yes, since in the Sun, n_Mg/n_H =1e-5, and n_Fe/n_H =1e-4.5.

But we don't have the Sun's n_Si. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a relation.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in the solar photosphere, the abundance ratios are known. Maybe we can express [Mg/Si]_sun in terms of the given data.

Wait, but I don't have [Mg/Si]_sun. Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, but that's not necessarily correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun from the given data on the Sun's composition.

Wait, I know n_Mg_sun and n_Fe_sun, but I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm, I'm stuck here. Is there another way?

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of hydrogen, and use the fact that [Fe/H] is zero in Star_1 and [Mg/H] is zero in Star_2.

Let me try this.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 1e-4.5.

So, n_Fe_1 = (1e-4.5) *n_H_1.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si_1 /n_Fe_1 ) - log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) =0.3.

Let me compute log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun) first.

But I don't know n_Si_sun. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can express [Mg/Si]_sun using the Sun's data.

Wait, but I have n_Mg_sun and n_Fe_sun, but not n_Si_sun. So perhaps I'm missing a piece of information. Is there a way to find n_Si_sun?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since I can't find [Mg/Si]_sun, perhaps I can relate [Mg/Si]_2 and the Sun's [Mg/Si].

Wait, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg_2/n_Si_2) = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3.

Additionally, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(n_Mg_2 /n_H_2) = [Mg/H]_sun.

We know [Mg/H]_sun is log( (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) ) = log(1e-5) = -5.

So, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(n_Mg_2 /n_H_2 ) = [Mg/H]_sun +0 → log(n_Mg_2/n_H_2) =-5 +0= -5 → n_Mg_2 /n_H_2 =1e-5.

So, n_Mg_2 = (1e-5) *n_H_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( (n_Mg_2/n_Si_2) ) = log( (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) +0.3.

But I don't know [Mg/Si]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of solar ratios.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of Si in the two stars can be found without knowing the exact solar [Mg/Si], but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find n_Si_1 and n_Si_2 in terms of n_H_1 and n_H_2.

Let's start with Star_1.

Star_1:

n_Fe_1 = (1e-4.5) *n_H_1.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si_1 /n_Fe_1 ) = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) +0.3.

Let me compute log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ).

From the Sun's data, n_Fe_sun = 1e-4.5 *n_H_sun.

n_Si_sun is not given, so perhaps I need to find [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, but [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) → which is log( (1e-5 *n_H_sun ) / (n_Si_sun) )

But without knowing n_Si_sun, I can't compute [Mg/Si]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find n_Si_sun in terms of the Sun's composition.

Wait, but the Sun's composition is given only for Fe and Mg. So perhaps I can't find n_Si_sun directly.

Hmm, maybe I've made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem provides [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. So, [Mg/Si]_2 = log( n_Mg2/n_Si2 ) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

We can rewrite this as log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) +0.3.

But without knowing [Mg/Si]_sun, I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can express [Mg/Si]_sun in terms of the Sun's n_Mg and n_Si.

Wait, n_Mg_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun.

But I don't know n_Si_sun. So perhaps I can't proceed this way. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's another way. Let's think about the problem again.

We need the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, (n_Si_1 / n_H_1) divided by (n_Si_2 /n_H_2) ) → (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2) * (n_H_2 /n_H_1).

Because the ratio is [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], which in terms of number densities would be (n_Si_1/n_H_1) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2) ) = (n_Si_1 *n_H_2 )/(n_Si_2 *n_H_1 ).

Alternatively, perhaps it's (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2) * (n_H_2 /n_H_1).

Either way, I need to find both n_Si_1 and n_Si_2, and the ratio of n_H_1 and n_H_2.

Wait, but how?

Let me think about Star_1 first.

Star_1:

We know:

n_Fe_1 = (1e-4.5) *n_H_1.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si_1 /n_Fe_1 ) = log(n_Si_sun /n_Fe_sun ) +0.3.

But without knowing n_Si_sun, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_1 in terms of [Si/H]_1 and [Fe/H]_1.

Because [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H].

In Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - 0 → [Si/H]_1 =0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) =0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ).

So, n_Si_1 /n_H_1 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for [Mg/Si]_2, perhaps I can do something similar.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0 → [Mg/H]_2 = log(n_Mg_2/n_H_2 ) - [Mg/H]_sun =0 → log(n_Mg_2/n_H_2 ) = [Mg/H]_sun → which is log(1e-5) =-5, so n_Mg_2=1e-5 *n_H_2.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg_2/n_Si_2 ) = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3.

But again, without [Mg/Si]_sun, I'm stuck.

Wait, but perhaps [Mg/Si]_sun can be found from the Sun's data.

Wait, in the Sun, n_Mg =1e-5 *n_H_sun, and n_Fe=1e-4.5 *n_H_sun. But I don't have n_Si_sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can find [Mg/Si]_sun using the solar [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] or something.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed.

Let me consider that in Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, and [Fe/H]_1 =0.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si_1 /n_H_1 ) =0.3 + log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ).

Which means, n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun *10^0.3 ) / (n_H_sun) ) * n_H_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg_2/n_Si_2 ) = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3.

But [Mg/Si]_sun is log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) = log( (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) ) *n_H_sun cancels out → log( (1e-5) / (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) ) ).

Wait, but n_Si_sun is (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H_sun.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun from the Sun's data.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log( (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) ).

But I don't have n_Si_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can find n_Si_sun from the fact that the Sun's [Fe/H] is known.

Wait, in the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun = log( (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) ) = log(1e-4.5 ) =-4.5.

But the problem says that for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which refers to their ratios relative to the Sun.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Fe/H] is -4.5, but in Star_1, it's 0, meaning the Fe abundance is the same as in the Sun relative to H.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should proceed differently.

Let me think about the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2.

The ratio is [Si_1 / Si_2] = (n_Si_1 /n_H_1 ) / (n_Si_2 /n_H_2 ) ) = (n_Si_1 *n_H_2 )/(n_Si_2 *n_H_1 )

So, I need to find (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 ) and (n_H_2 /n_H_1 ).

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio [Si_1 / Si_2] directly using their abundance ratios.

Wait, let's try to find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then take their ratio.

Star_1: [Si/H]_1 = [Fe/H]_1 + [Si/Fe]_1 → 0 +0.3 → [Si/H]_1=0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) =0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2, we can find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, from Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log( n_Mg_2/n_Si_2 ) = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(n_Mg_2/n_H_2 ) = [Mg/H]_sun = log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun ) = log(1e-5 )= -5.

So, log(n_Mg_2/n_H_2 )=0 → n_Mg_2/n_H_2 =1e0 → n_Mg_2= n_H_2.

Wait, no: [Mg/H]_2 =0 implies that log(n_Mg_2/n_H_2 ) = [Mg/H]_sun, which is log(1e-5 )= -5.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, [Mg/H]_2 = log(n_Mg_2/n_H_2 ) - log(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) =0 → log(n_Mg_2/n_H_2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun )

So, n_Mg_2/n_H_2 =n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun → n_Mg_2 = (n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H_2.

But n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun =1e-5.

So, n_Mg_2 =1e-5 *n_H_2.

Now, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(n_Mg_2/n_Si_2 ) = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3.

But [Mg/Si]_sun is log(n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) = log( (1e-5 *n_H_sun ) / (n_Si_sun ) )

Which can be written as log(1e-5) + log(n_H_sun /n_Si_sun ) → -5 + log(n_H_sun /n_Si_sun )

But without knowing n_Si_sun, I can't compute this. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [Mg/Si]_sun in terms of [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg/n_Si ) = log( (n_Mg/n_H) / (n_Si/n_H) ) ) = log( (n_Mg/n_H) ) - log(n_Si/n_H ) = [Mg/H]_sun - [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, because [X/H] = log(n_X/n_H).

So, [Mg/Si]_sun = [Mg/H]_sun - [Si/H]_sun.

In the Sun, [Mg/H]_sun is log(1e-5 )= -5.

[Si/H]_sun is log(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ).

So, [Mg/Si]_sun = (-5 ) - [Si/H]_sun.

Now, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3 → which doesn't make sense. Wait, no: [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg_2/n_Si_2 ) - [Mg/Si]_sun =0.3.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3.

Wait, no: [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y ) - log(n_X_sun/n_Y_sun )

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = log(n_Mg_2/n_Si_2 ) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) =0.3.

Which can be written as:

log( (n_Mg_2 /n_Si_2 ) / (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) ) =0.3.

But I'm stuck again because I don't know [Mg/Si]_sun.

Hmm, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_2.

Wait, perhaps I can express n_Si_2 in terms of n_Mg_2 and [Mg/Si]_2.

From [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3, we have:

n_Mg_2 = n_Si_2 * 10^{ [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3 }.

But since I don't know [Mg/Si]_sun, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = [Mg/H]_sun - [Si/H]_sun.

So, [Mg/Si]_sun = (-5 ) - [Si/H]_sun.

Thus, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3 = (-5 - [Si/H]_sun ) +0.3.

But [Mg/Si]_2 is given as 0.3, so:

0.3 = (-5 - [Si/H]_sun ) +0.3 → -5 - [Si/H]_sun =0 → [Si/H]_sun =-5.

Wait, that can't be right because in the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun is log(n_Fe/n_H )= log(1e-4.5 )= -4.5.

Wait, but [Si/H]_sun is log(n_Si/n_H ) = ?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can find [Si/H]_2 in terms of other known quantities.

Wait, for Star_2, we have [Mg/H]_2=0 and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3 → 0 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3 → [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → log(n_Si_2/n_H_2 ) = [Si/H]_sun + (-0.3).

Wait, no: [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H].

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3.

We have [Mg/H]_2=0, so 0 - [Si/H]_2 =0.3 → [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → log(n_Si_2/n_H_2 ) = [Si/H]_sun + (-0.3).

Wait, no, [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si_2/n_H_2 ) - [Si/H]_sun =-0.3 → log(n_Si_2/n_H_2 ) = [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) = [Si/H]_sun +0.3.

So, the ratio of the silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is:

(n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2 ) = (n_Si_1/n_Si_2 ) * (n_H_2/n_H_1 ) 

But I also need to relate n_H_1 and n_H_2.

Wait, but how?

Hmm, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be found from their masses. Wait, no, the mass doesn't directly affect the photospheric composition unless there's something else involved, like if the stars have different temperatures or gravities, but the problem doesn't provide that information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps I can find n_Si in each star in terms of n_Si_sun.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to proceed with what I have.

So, for Star_1:

n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun *10^0.3 ) * (n_H_1 /n_H_sun )

For Star_2:

n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun *10^{-0.3} ) * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun )

Thus, the ratio (n_Si_1)/(n_Si_2) = [10^0.3 /10^{-0.3}] * (n_H_1 /n_H_2 )

= 10^{0.6} * (n_H_1 /n_H_2 )

So, the total ratio (n_Si_1/n_Si_2) * (n_H_2 /n_H_1 ) = [10^{0.6} * (n_H_1 /n_H_2 ) ] * (n_H_2 /n_H_1 )

= 10^{0.6} * [ (n_H_1 /n_H_2 ) * (n_H_2 /n_H_1 ) ) ] =10^{0.6} * (1) → 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98 → approximately 4.

Wait, that can't be right, but looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, that would be the case if n_H_1 and n_H_2 are the same. But I don't know if they are.

Wait, but in the problem, we don't have any information about the hydrogen densities of the stars. Hmm, perhaps the ratio of hydrogen cancels out, as in the calculation above?

Wait, in the ratio, we have (n_Si_1/n_Si_2) * (n_H_2/n_H_1 ) = 10^0.6 * (n_H_1 /n_H_2 ) * (n_H_2/n_H_1 ) ) → which simplifies to 10^0.6, because the (n_H_1/ n_H_2 ) and (n_H_2/n_H_1 ) cancel out. So the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

So, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is ~3.98, which is option A.

Wait, but why did the masses of the stars matter here? The problem gave their masses but I didn't use them in the calculation. Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the masses are a red herring, and the answer is indeed ~3.98, which is option A.

But let me double-check.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) = [Si/H]_sun +0.3.

Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → log(n_Si_2/n_H_2 ) = [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

So, the ratio (n_Si_1/n_H_1 ) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2 ) = (10^{ [Si/H]_sun +0.3 } ) / (10^{ [Si/H]_sun -0.3 } ) ) =10^{0.6}.

Which is about 3.98.

So the answer is option A.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between abundance ratios and number densities.

     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}.
     \]
   - Combining these, the silicon abundance relative to H in Star_1 is:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}.
     \]

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the Mg abundance relative to H in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}.
     \]
   - From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the silicon abundance relative to Mg in Star_2 is:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{Mg,2}}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{Mg, sun}}}.
     \]
   - Combining these, the silicon abundance relative to H in Star_2 is:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}.
     \]

3. **Ratio of Silicon Abundances**:
   The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}.
   \]
   Approximating \(10^{0.6} \approx 3.98\), the ratio is approximately **3.9**.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 to Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
