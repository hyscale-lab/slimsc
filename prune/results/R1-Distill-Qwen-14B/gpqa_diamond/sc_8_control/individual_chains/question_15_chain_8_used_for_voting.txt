Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. They've already detected these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, both planets have the same mass. Got it. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 has a shorter period, meaning it's closer to its star, right? Because shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, being closer in.

The stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Oh, interesting. So even though one star is more massive, it's not larger in radius. That probably affects something related to the transit method.

Alright, the question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Also, the orbital inclination plays a big role. But wait, in the RV method, you can get some information about the orbit's inclination. Oh, but wait, the RV method gives the minimum mass because it depends on the sine of the inclination. So if the RV method has detected them, that means their orbits are edge-on enough that their velocities are detectable. But for transits, you need the orbit to be exactly edge-on, right? Or at least close enough that the probability is higher.

Wait, the transit probability formula—what's that again? I think the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (1 / (a_planet (1 - e²)^0.5 )). But wait, no, that's the probability of a transit occurring given an edge-on orbit. Or is it the probability considering the alignment? Hmm. Another thought: the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is closer to our line of sight. But the RV method can't tell us the exact inclination, just that it's at least a certain value (like i > 90 - some angle). So perhaps the RV method gives a lower limit on the mass, which depends on sin i. If sin i is higher, the mass is higher.

Wait, but the question says that both planets have the same minimum masses. So for each, M sin i is the same. But that doesn't directly tell me about the actual masses unless I know the inclination. But in terms of transit probability, which is the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it crosses our line of sight.

Wait, the RV method determines M sin i. So if a planet's M sin i is larger, it could mean either larger mass or higher inclination. But in this question, both planets have the same M sin i, so they have same (M sin i). But their actual masses are same, because the question says both have same masses. So if M sin i is same, and M is same, then sin i must be same. So their inclinations are the same. So the RV method would have same inclination for both. So the probability of transit depends on other factors, perhaps the star's size and planet's orbital parameters.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P_transit ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a(1 - e²)^0.5)). But assuming circular orbits (e=0), so it's (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/a). Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up some variables. Let me think again. The transit probability is the area of the planet relative to the star, and the chance that the orbital plane is aligned so that the planet passes in front. The formula I'm trying to recall is: the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a)) multiplied by something else, maybe the inclination. Hmm, perhaps the formula is more complex.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits in front of the star from our perspective. The probability is higher when the star is larger relative to the planet's orbit (small a). Or, more accurately, when the ratio (R_p / R_s) is smaller, the planet has a smaller chance of blocking the star. Wait, no—wait, the transit probability is higher when the planet is larger relative to the star, but no, that's not right. Wait, the probability is the ratio of the areas. The area of the planet's disk over the star's area gives the chance that a randomly aligned planet will block the star's light. So P_transit ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2, but that's only for edge-on orbits. But in reality, the probability also depends on the planet's orbital distance, because the star's position in the sky relative to the planet's orbit affects the chance of alignment.

Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit (in the plane perpendicular to our line of sight) to the area of the star, but that doesn't sound right. Wait, perhaps I should recall that the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital distance is smaller relative to the star's size. Wait, no. Let me think: the transit probability is the probability that, given a random orientation of the orbital plane, the planet's path crosses in front of the star. For a circular orbit, the formula is:

P_transit = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)) )

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the transit probability shouldn't depend on the semi-major axis a, but it's more about the relative sizes and the orbital distance. Maybe I'm confusing it with another parameter.

Alternatively, I remember that for a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be aligned such that its path crosses in front of the star. The probability of this alignment is higher when the star is larger relative to the planet's orbit. Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 (1 - e^2)) ) → no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the factors that affect transit probability. The key factors are:

1. The size of the planet relative to the star: larger planet, higher probability of blocking the star's light when aligned. But if the planet is smaller, the chance is lower.

2. The size of the star: a larger star makes the planet's disk smaller relative to the star, reducing the transit probability.

3. The orbital distance (semi-major axis a): the closer the planet is to the star (smaller a), the more likely the alignment is to produce a transit, because the planet's orbital plane is more likely to cross our line of sight.

Wait, but actually, the orbital distance affects the size of the orbit as seen from Earth. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but I don't remember exactly. Alternatively, the transit probability is the area of the star as seen from the planet's position, divided by the area of the planet's orbital plane as seen from Earth. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the same for all planets in a system with the same a and R_p, R_s. The probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2 * (1 / (1 - e^2)) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I've read somewhere that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)) ). But perhaps I should look for a simpler version.

Wait, here's a simplified approach. The probability that a planet transits is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, another source I recall says that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)) ) multiplied by some function of the inclination.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the geometric probability. The geometric probability of a transit is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit in the plane perpendicular to our line of sight.

Wait, the area of the star's disk is π R_s². The area of the planet's orbit (the circle it makes in the plane perpendicular to us) is π a² (1 - e²), because the cross-section area for a Keplerian orbit is π a² (1 - e²) due to the varying distance from the star at different points in the orbit. Wait, no—actually, the cross-section area for the orbit is π (a (1 - e^2))², but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, the formula for the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a (1 - e^2)^0.5)) )

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've seen the transit probability expressed as:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a)) )

Assuming e=0 (circular orbit), which is the case here.

So, given that, let's compute the transit probabilities for both planets.

But wait, in this problem, both planets have the same mass, same inclination (since their M sin i are same and masses are same), same e (e=0 for both), same R_p (since they're Earth-like; but wait, the question says they have same masses, but not necessarily same radii. Hmm, but for Earth-like planets, perhaps the radii are similar, but the question doesn't specify. Wait, the question says the planets have the same masses. So, perhaps their radii are similar, but not necessarily the same. But without knowing the radii, can we proceed? Wait, the question says "the radii of the host stars", not the planets. Oh, right, the host stars' radii are the same.

So, R_p1 and R_p2 could be different, but the question states that they are Earth-like. So assuming Earth-like radii, they are about the same. Let's say R_p1 ≈ R_p2. So R_p1 / R_p2 ≈ 1.

So, the transit probability for each planet would be proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a) ).

So, P ∝ (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/a).

Given that, let's compute for each planet.

First, let's note the given data:

- Both planets have same mass. So R_p1 ≈ R_p2.

- Host stars have same radius: R_s1 = R_s2.

Wait, the problem says: 'both host stars have same radii.' So R_s1 = R_s2.

So (R_p/R_s)^2 is same for both planets.

So the only factor that differentiates them is 1/a (since the other terms are same).

So, the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a.

Now, the period is related to a via Kepler's third law. For a circular orbit, the period P is related to a and the star's mass M by P² = (4π²/G M) a³.

So, for each planet, a can be found from their orbital periods and the host star's mass.

Given that, let's compute a for both.

Planet_1 has period P1 = P, Planet_2 has P2 = 3P.

Wait, no, the question says that Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

Wait, the question says: "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So, P1 = (1/3) P2 → P2 = 3 P1.

Wait, the host star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star. So M1 = 2 M2.

We need to find a1 and a2.

Using Kepler's third law: a^3 / P^2 = G M / (4π²). So,

a1³ = (G M1 P1²) / (4 π² )

a2³ = (G M2 P2² ) / (4 π² )

Divide a1³ by a2³:

(a1³)/(a2³) = (M1 P1²) / (M2 P2² )

Since M1 = 2 M2, and P2 = 3 P1, so P2²=9 P1².

So,

(a1³)/(a2³) = (2 M2 * P1²) / ( M2 * 9 P1²) ) = 2/(9) → (a1/a2)^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3)

Wait, but we can compute this numerically. Let's compute 2/9:

2 ÷ 9 ≈ 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So, a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Thus, a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense since Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive host star. So its orbit is tighter.

Now, back to the transit probability.

Transit probability P is proportional to (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/a )

Since R_p and R_s are same for both, (R_p/R_s)^2 is same for both.

So, P1 ∝ 1/a1, P2 ∝ 1/a2.

So, the ratio P1/P2 = (1/a1) / (1/a2 ) = a2/a1 ≈ 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, no, wait. Since P is proportional to 1/a, and a1 is 0.606 a2, then P1 = (1/ a1 ) = 1/(0.606 a2 ), and P2 = 1/(a2 ). So P1 = (1/0.606) * (1/a2 ) ≈ 1.65 * (1/a2 ). So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

That means Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times, which is higher.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps.

Wait, the transit probability is proportional to 1/a.

Wait, a1 is 0.606 a2.

So P1 = k * (1/a1 ), P2 = k * (1/a2 ).

So P1/P2 = (1/a1)/(1/a2 ) = a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65. So yes, P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability, so they should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says: C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

So the correct answer should be C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{a}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii (\(R_p\)) are assumed to be similar. Additionally, the host stars of both planets have the same radius (\(R_s\)), so the term \(\left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2\) is the same for both planets. Therefore, the transit probability depends only on the semi-major axis \(a\), with \(P_{\text{transit}} \propto \frac{1}{a}\).

### Step 1: Relating orbital period and semi-major axis
Using Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits:

\[
P^2 \propto a^3 \cdot \frac{1}{M_s}
\]

where \(P\) is the orbital period and \(M_s\) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1 has an orbital period \(P_1\), host star mass \(M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}\), and semi-major axis \(a_1\).
- Planet_2 has an orbital period \(P_2 = 3P_1\), host star mass \(M_{s2}\), and semi-major axis \(a_2\).

Dividing the equations for \(a_1^3\) and \(a_2^3\):

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{s1} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2}
\]

Substituting \(M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}\) and \(P_2 = 3P_1\):

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2M_{s2} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{s2} \cdot (3P_1)^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\).

### Step 2: Comparing transit probabilities
Since \(P_{\text{transit}} \propto \frac{1}{a}\), the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{a_1}}{\frac{1}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

### Step 3: Evaluating the options
- **Option A:** Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher transit probability.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a 1.5 times higher transit probability.
- **Option C:** Correct. Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. Planet_1 does not have a 2.7 times higher transit probability.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
