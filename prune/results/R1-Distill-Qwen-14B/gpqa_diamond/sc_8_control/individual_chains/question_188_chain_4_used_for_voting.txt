Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The question gives me the interatomic distance, which I think is the lattice parameter 'a'. Wait, but the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral crystal, all edges are equal, and all angles are the same.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... something with the angles... Oh wait, no, I remember that the formula uses the reciprocal of the metric tensor. Or maybe it's more straightforward. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal can be a bit tricky. I recall that for a general rhombohedral lattice, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (h^2 (1 - cos² α) ) / cos α + same for k and l? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, no, I think the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. That should simplify things.

Wait another thought: In a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h^2 +k^2 +l^2). But rhombohedral is a more general case and uses this modified formula with the angles.

Alternatively, another approach is using the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/(a²)) ) + (k^2 (1/(b²)) ) + (l^2 (1/(c²)) ) + ... terms involving cosines of angles ... )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and all angles are same, say theta. So let me write the metric tensor.

The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is:

[ (a², a² cos gamma, a² cos beta ),
  (a² cos gamma, a², a² cos alpha ),
  (a² cos beta, a² cos alpha, a² ) ]

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the reciprocal vectors. Another formula I found is:

d² = (1/(a²)) (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos(180 - gamma) + 2hl cos(180 - beta) + 2kl cos(180 - alpha) )

Wait, but wait, the angles in the metric tensor are the angles between the lattice vectors. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for d_{hkl} is given by:

1/d² = ( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 ) + 2*(h k cos gamma)/(a b) + 2*(h l cos beta)/(a c) + 2*(k l cos alpha)/(b c)

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta. So let's plug in those values.

So, 1/d² = [ (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) ) + 2hk cos(theta)/(a²) + 2hl cos(theta)/(a²) + 2kl cos(theta)/(a²) ) ]

Wait, that simplifies to:

1/d² = [ (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos(theta) + 2hl cos(theta) + 2kl cos(theta) ) ] / a²

Factor out 1/a²:

1/d² = [ h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos(theta) + 2hl cos(theta) + 2kl cos(theta) ) ] / a²

Which can be written as:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos(theta) + 2hl cos(theta) + 2kl cos(theta) )

Okay, that's the formula. So in this problem, hkl is 111. Let's plug in h=1, k=1, l=1. Theta is 30 degrees.

So compute the denominator:

denominator = (1^2 + 1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 )

Compute each part:

h² +k² +l² = 3.

The cross terms: 2* ( cos30 + cos30 + cos30 ) = 2*3*cos30 = 6 * cos30.

Cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So denominator is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So d = a / sqrt(8.196). Here a is 10 Angstrom.

Compute sqrt(8.196). Let's see, 8.196 is approximately (2.86)^2? Because 2.86^2 is about 8.1796. Hmm, let me calculate it exactly.

Wait, 2.86² = (2.8 + 0.06)^2 = 7.84 + 2*(2.8)(0.06) + 0.0036 = 7.84 + 0.336 + 0.0036 = 8.1796.

But 8.196 is a bit higher.

2.86² is 8.1796, so 8.196 - 8.1796 is 0.0164.

So approximately, 2.86 + (0.0164)/(2*2.86) ) = 2.86 + 0.0164/(5.72) ≈ 2.86 + 0.002868 ≈ 2.86286.

So sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.491 Angstrom? Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 9-10 Angstrom.

Wait, that suggests I made a mistake because the options are all around 9 or 10 Angstrom, but this calculation gives me about 3.49. That's way too small.

Wait, what did I do wrong here? Maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check again.

Alternative approach: perhaps I forgot that the formula includes 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta), but wait, wait. No, no, wait, in the formula, the cross terms are 2*(hk cos(theta) + hl cos(theta) + kl cos(theta)). Because for rhombohedral, the angles between the vectors are theta, so the dot product between vectors in the metric tensor would involve cos(theta). So it should be correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps I confused the angles. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles are 30 degrees, but in the formula, are they the angles between the axes, or 180 - the angles?

Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake with the angle in the formula. Because in some definitions, the angles in the metric tensor are the angles between the lattice vectors, which are the same as the angles given in the problem. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the angle alpha in a rhombohedral system is the angle between vectors a and b. So cos(theta) in the formula is the cosine of that angle, which is 30 degrees. So for the formula, it's correct.

Hmm, but the calculation I did gave d= ~3.49 Angstrom, which is way below the options given. But the options are around 9 Angstrom. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe I should have used the reciprocal of the metric tensor differently.

Wait another approach: the interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of (h^2, k^2, l^2) multiplied by the respective terms from the metric tensor.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes is:

d^2 = (1/(h²A + k²B + l²C + 2h k D + 2h l E + 2k l F )) 

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [ 1, 1, 1 ] / sqrt( ... )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for d in terms of the Miller indices and the lattice parameters, considering the angles.

Wait, another source I recall says that for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and angles alpha = beta = gamma = theta, the interplanar distance is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, but wait, cos(theta) where theta is 30 degrees. Let me compute it again.

So hkl =111.

Compute numerator: 3.

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*(1 +1 +1) * cos(30)).

Wait, because (hk + hl + kl) = 1*1 +1*1 +1*1 =3.

So denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*3*cos(30) )

Compute 2*3=6. cos(30)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

6 * 0.8660 ≈5.196.

So 3 +5.196 =8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approximately 2.863.

So, d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.491 Angstrom.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are all around 9 Angstrom.

I must have made a mistake here. Perhaps I need to re-examine the formula.

Wait, maybe I confused the angles. Because in some conventions, the angles used in the formula are 180 - theta. Because the angle in the crystal is the angle between the vectors, which could be the angle in the lattice. So perhaps in the formula, we should use cos(180 - theta), which is -cos(theta).

Wait, let's try that. So cos(theta) would be cos(30) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866, but if I use cos(180-30)=cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈-0.866.

So, let me recalculate with cos(theta) as cos(150 degrees) which is -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator inside the square root becomes 3 + 2*(3)* (-0.866).

So 3 + 6*(-0.866) = 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative, which can't be. Because the denominator would be sqrt of a negative number, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the formula uses the actual theta (30 degrees), not the 180-theta.

Wait, maybe the problem is that my formula is incorrect. Because in the case of a cubic system, the formula is d = a/sqrt(h^2 +k^2 + l^2), which matches when all angles are 90 degrees (so cos(theta) is zero, and the cross terms vanish).

So, in our case with theta=30 degrees, the interplanar distance should be shorter than the cubic case. Because the cross terms add a positive value.

Wait, but in the cubic case (theta=90), cos(theta)=0, and d= a/sqrt(3) ≈5.7735 for a=10, which is about 5.77 Angstrom.

But in our case, theta=30, so cos(theta) is positive, so the denominator is larger, so d is smaller than in the cubic case. But the options given are larger than the cubic case. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the formula's sign.

Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Maybe it's:

d^2 = (h² +k² + l² + 2(hk cos(180-theta) + hl cos(180-theta) + kl cos(180-theta) )) / a^2

Wait, but 180-theta would be 150 degrees, cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So let's try that.

So:

denominator = (1 + 1 +1) + 2*(1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) +1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) +1*1*(-sqrt(3)/2) )

= 3 + 2*( -3 * (sqrt(3)/2) )

= 3 - 3*sqrt(3)

Because 2*( -3*(sqrt(3)/2) )= -3*sqrt(3).

So denominator becomes 3 -3*1.732 ≈ 3 -5.196 ≈-2.196.

Which is negative again. So that's not possible.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should think of the problem differently.

Alternative approach: use the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral structure.

The general formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, that's different. Earlier I thought it was 2*(hk +...) cos(theta), but perhaps it's minus that.

Wait, let me think. In a cubic system, theta is 90 degrees, cos(theta)=0, so the formula gives d= a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²). Which is correct.

If I have theta=30, then cos(theta)= sqrt(3)/2 ~0.866.

So for hkl=111:

denominator =3 - 2*(3)*0.866 = 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Again, negative. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, I'm getting negative in the denominator again. So perhaps the formula uses cos(180-theta), which is -0.866.

So denominator becomes 3 - 2*(3)*(-0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

Which is positive. So then d=10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10/2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

Which brings me back to the same problem as before. But none of the options match this.

Wait perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Maybe the correct formula is:

d^2 = (h² +k² + l² + 2 hk cos(theta) + 2 hl cos(theta) + 2 kl cos(theta)) / a²

So that's the same as the first formula I used.

Wait, but let's try it with theta=30.

So the denominator becomes 3 + 3 * 2 cos(30) =3 +6*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

Which gives d=10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈3.49. Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator. Let me compute the denominator again.

Compute 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

Because 6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3*sqrt(3).

So denominator =3 +3*sqrt(3). Which is approximately 3 +5.196=8.196.

So it's the same as before.

Wait, maybe I'm not using the right value for a. The problem says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So 'a' is 10.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are 9, 8.95, etc. So that's way off.

Wait, I think I'm missing something. Maybe the formula involves another term. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the interatomic distance in a different way. Wait, maybe 'interatomic distance' in a rhombohedral structure isn't the same as 'a'? Because in some structures, the interatomic distance could refer to the nearest neighbor distance, which could be different from the lattice parameter 'a' if the structure is not cubic.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√1, so a = interatomic distance. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a * sqrt( ... something ... ). So maybe 'a' isn't 10 Angstrom, but the nearest neighbor distance is.

Wait, wait, the question says "the interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". So that's the distance between nearest atoms. So perhaps the lattice parameter 'a' is not 10 Angstrom.

Wait, let's think about the structure. In a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corners of a cube and the center of the cube? No, no, wait, no. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners of a parallelepiped. The nearest neighbor distance would be along the edges, but in a rhombohedral system, the edges are of length a, but the angles are such that the nearest neighbor distance could be a, or perhaps a different factor.

Wait, perhaps in a primitive rhombohedral unit cell, the nearest neighbor distance is a. Because the atoms are at the corners, and each corner is shared by adjacent cells. So the nearest neighbor distance would be along the edge, which is a. So in that case, if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, then a is 10.

But if the structure is not primitive, like a face-centered or body-centered, the nearest neighbor distance might be shorter. But the problem doesn't specify the type of rhombohedral structure. So perhaps it's a primitive rhombohedral, so a=10.

But then back to the calculation, which gives d= ~3.49, but the options are all around 9.

Wait, perhaps the (111) planes are not the same as the (100) planes in cubic structures. But no, the formula should still hold.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the formula involving the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, the volume of the unit cell V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos^2 alpha - cos^2 beta - cos^2 gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

But since alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, let's compute V.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe another idea: the interplanar distance can be found using the reciprocal of the plane's normal vector in reciprocal space.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal lattice vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a) (1,1,1) / D,

where D is sqrt(1 + 1 +1 + 2 cos alpha + 2 cos beta + 2 cos gamma )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [1, 1, 1] / (sqrt( ... )).

Wait, maybe I should compute the reciprocal lattice vectors.

Wait, in general, the reciprocal vectors are given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [1, 1, 1] / sqrt( ... )

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating things.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to calculate the structure factor, but that doesn't directly give interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the Miller indices (111) and the planes. The (111) planes in a rhombohedral system are similar to those in a cubic system, but the spacing would be different due to the angles.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can calculate the volume of the unit cell and then find the volume per reciprocal lattice point, but that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for interplanar distance in terms of the unit cell parameters. The formula is:

d_{hkl}^2 = (1)/( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) )

But wait, wait, that's not correct dimensionally. Let me think.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1/√( (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) + 2 (hk cos gamma)/(a b) + 2 (hl cos beta)/(a c) + 2 (kl cos alpha)/(b c) ) )

In a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and alpha=beta=gamma=theta.

So plugging in:

d_{hkl} = 1/√( (h² +k² +l²)/a^2 + 2 (hk cos theta + hl cos theta + kl cos theta ) / a^2 )

= a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Which brings me back to the same formula as before.

So again, for (111) plane, h=k=l=1, theta=30.

So denominator is 3 + 2*(3) * (sqrt(3)/2 ) =3 +3*sqrt(3) ≈3+5.196=8.196.

d=10/sqrt(8.196)= ~3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are all around 9-10. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used cos(180-theta) instead.

So cos(theta)=cos(30)=0.866, but if I instead use cos(150)= -0.866.

So denominator:

3 + 2*(3)*(-0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is negative, so d becomes imaginary, which is impossible. So that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should check online for the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, perhaps I can recall that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk cos theta + hl cos theta + kl cos theta) )

Yes, that's what I'm using. So that's correct.

But the result is about 3.49 Angstrom, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Perhaps 'a' is not the same as the interatomic distance. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor) might be a function of 'a' and the angles.

In a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√1 =a.

In a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2 = a/√2.

But in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance could be different. Because in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is connected to others via vectors a, b, c, which have angles theta between them.

So the distance between nearest neighbors is the magnitude of the vector, which could be along a, b, or c, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a, because the vectors a, b, c are of length a, and the angles are such that the shortest distance is along a.

Wait, no, because in a rhombohedral structure, the vectors a, b, c are all of length a, but the angles are 30 degrees. So the nearest neighbors are along the edges of the parallelepiped, which are length a. So the interatomic distance is a.

So in this problem, interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so a=10.

But then, the interplanar distance calculation gives d=3.49, which is not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the (100) plane, but no, the question is (111).

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another recollection: in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which is the same as what I have.

Wait, perhaps I should plug in the numbers again.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So:

h² +k² +l²=3.

2(hk + hl + kl)= 2*(1 +1 +1)=6.

cos(theta)=cos(30)=√3/2≈0.866.

So denominator inside sqrt is 3 +6*(0.866) =3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

Hmm, but the options are way larger. So is there a mistake in the formula? Or perhaps in the way I'm using the angles.

Wait, perhaps the angles are not 30 degrees, but 150 degrees?

Wait, let me think again about the angles. The angles in the crystallographic system are defined as the angles between the edges of the unit cell. So a rhombohedral system has three edges of equal length a, and the angles between each pair of edges is theta.

In the formula, the angles used are those between the edges, which are 30 degrees.

Wait, wait, but another thought: perhaps the formula uses the angle between the lattice vectors, which is 30 degrees, but in the formula, it's actually the angle between the reciprocal vectors?

No, I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the distance between adjacent planes, which is d, but perhaps the question is actually about the nearest neighbor distance, which is a, but the question is about the interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between 'interatomic distance' and 'interplanar distance'. The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstrom, which is the distance between nearest atoms. So that's a=10 Angstrom.

So I think the calculation is correct, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a negative in front of the cosine terms.

Alternative formula: d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

So for theta=30, cos(theta)=0.866.

Denominator =3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Which is negative, so d becomes imaginary. Impossible.

So that formula can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (180-theta), so cos(150)= -0.866.

So denominator =3 +6*(0.866) =8.196 again.

So same as before. So I'm back to the same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options given and see if any of them could fit.

The options are:

A) 9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05.

All are around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, perhaps I swapped 'a' with the interplanar distance. Or perhaps the formula is written differently.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Wait, no, that can't be right because for a cubic system, with theta=90, cos(theta)=0, so d would be a * sqrt(3) → which is larger than a, but in reality, for cubic (111) planes, d= a / sqrt(3) → which is smaller than a.

So that's the opposite of what I'm seeing.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is reciprocal. Wait, perhaps I have to take the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, in the formula I used, d= a / sqrt( ... )

But perhaps the formula is d= 1/ ( ... a ), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/d and see if that matches one of the options.

Wait, earlier d was approximately 3.49. So 1/d is about 0.286. Doesn't match any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Like, perhaps the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, but the question is about interplanar distance in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are 120 degrees instead of 30. Because if theta were 60 degrees, cos(theta)=0.5.

Wait, let's try with theta=60.

Denominator=3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6. So d=10/sqrt(6)=~4.08 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees, not 30. Let me see what the problem says.

The problem says angles alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of 'd' as the formula.

Wait, that would make d = a * sqrt( ... ), which would give a larger value.

Wait, if I mistakenly took:

d= a * sqrt( ... ), then with the same denominator:

d=10 * sqrt(8.196) →10 *2.863≈28.63 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula and it's 1/(d²)= [ ... ] / (a²), but that's what I did.

Another thought: perhaps the formula should be 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta), all divided by a².

Wait, that's the same as I did.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used 2*(hk +... ) instead of 2*(hk +... ) * cos(theta).

Wait, that would give denominator 3 +6=9. So d=10/3=3.33 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a negative sign for the cross terms.

So denominator becomes 3-6*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So d is imaginary. Not possible.

I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula for interplanar distance in rhombohedral is different.

Wait, an alternative approach is to compute the volume of the unit cell and then find the reciprocal of the volume.

Wait, the volume V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - cos² alpha - cos² beta - cos² gamma + 2 cos alpha cos beta cos gamma )

But since alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So,

V = a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(sqrt(3)/2)^2 + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

Compute each term:

sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So:

1 -3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) →1-2.25 +1.299= (1-2.25)= -1.25 +1.299≈0.049.

So V= a^3 * sqrt(0.049)= a^3 * 0.2214.

So V = a^3 *0.2214.

But I'm not sure how that helps me find the interplanar distance.

Wait, the volume of the unit cell is V, so the volume per reciprocal lattice point is 1/V.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the relation between interplanar distance and the volume.

The volume per reciprocal lattice point is 1/V. But I'm not sure.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is related to the volume and the Miller indices. The formula for d is:

d = (2π) / (|G|)

where G is the reciprocal lattice vector.

But perhaps I'm getting too deep into this without knowing the exact approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector G_{hkl} is given by:

G = h a^* + k b^* + l c^*

Where a^*, b^*, c^* are the reciprocal basis vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal basis vectors are given by:

a^* = (1/a) (1, 1, 1) / D,

where D is sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1*1 cos gamma + 1*1 cos beta +1*1 cos alpha) )

Wait, let's compute D.

D= sqrt( 3 + 6 * cos(30) )

Which is sqrt(3 +6*(√3/2))= sqrt(3 +3√3)≈sqrt(3+5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So a^* = (1/10) [1,1,1]/2.863.

Then G_{111}=1*a^* +1*b^* +1*c^*.

But since in rhombohedral, the reciprocal vectors are all the same, G_{111} = (1 +1 +1) a^* =3 a^*.

So |G| is the magnitude of G, which is 3 * |a^*|.

What's |a^*|? It's (1/a) / D = (1/10)/2.863 ≈0.0349.

So |G|=3 *0.0349=0.1047.

Then d = 2π / |G| =2π/0.1047 ≈60.7 Angstrom. Which is way larger than the options.

No, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in this approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula where d = 1/|G|.

Wait, no, the correct formula is d=2π/|G|.

But in this case, that gives 60.7 Angstrom, which isn't an option.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back.

The problem is definitely leading me to a formula I believe is correct, but the result doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps the issue is that the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Another approach: consider the relation between the interplanar distance and the unit cell edges and angles.

In a rhombohedral crystal, the relation between the lattice parameter a and the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 hk cos gamma + 2 hl cos beta + 2 kl cos alpha )

Assuming alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So the denominator becomes 3 + 6 * cos(30) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / 2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(180-theta) )

So for theta=30, 180-theta=150, cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator=3 + 6*(-0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196 → negative, which is impossible.

So that approach isn't working.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I calculated the reciprocal of the interplanar distance by mistake.

Wait, if d=3.49, then 1/d=0.286. But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the interatomic distance. But that's not the case.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should think that the given options are incorrect, but since this is a multiple-choice question, I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written differently. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )^{-1}.

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is something else. Let me think about the structure.

In a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the atoms are not at the corners but in a different positions, and the interatomic distance is different from 'a'.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a face-centered or body-centered rhombohedral. But the problem doesn't specify.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a√2 or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem states it's a rhombohedral crystal. If it's a primitive rhombohedral, the atoms are at the corners, and the interatomic distance is a, so a=10.

But then, the interplanar distance comes out to ~3.49, not matching the options. So perhaps the formula is different. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of sqrt(2).

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )^{-1}.

Which is the same as what I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 3.49 Angstrom, but the options are all way higher, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But in that case, for theta=30, cos(theta)=0.866.

Denominator inside sqrt would be 3 -6*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative. Impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) )

But that seems arbitrary.

For (111), denominator=3 -3=0. So d is infinite. Which is impossible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just try to find which option gives the correct result when plugged into the formula.

Wait, if the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom.

Let's see what denominator would that imply.

d=9.54, a=10.

So denominator =10/9.54 ≈1.048.

So 1.048 = sqrt(3 + 6*0.866).

Wait, 3 +6*0.866=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So 10/2.863≈3.49. So 9.54 is not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the formula as:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

So for a=10, h=1, etc.

Then denominator is 8.196 again.

So d=10 * sqrt(8.196) ≈10 * 2.863 ≈28.63. Which is way higher than options.

No.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But that led to negative numbers.

I'm stuck. I think I have to conclude that the correct calculation gives d≈3.49 Angstrom, but since it's not in the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But I think that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, the angles are 180 - theta. So cos(theta) becomes cos(150)= -0.866.

So denominator=3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. But that's negative, so no.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

So denominator=3 -6*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196 → imaginary.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely. Another approach is to compute the interplanar distance using the Miller indices and the lattice parameters with angles.

The general formula is:

1/d^2 = ( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 ) + 2*(hk cos gamma)/(a b) + 2*(hl cos beta)/(a c) + 2*(kl cos alpha)/(b c) )

In a rhombohedral system, a=b=c=10, alpha=beta=gamma=30.

So:

1/d^2 = (1 +1 +1)/10^2 + 2*(1*cos30 +1*cos30 +1*cos30 )/(10^2)

= (3)/100 + 2*(3 * 0.866)/100

= 0.03 + (6 * 0.866)/100

=0.03 + (5.196)/100

=0.03 +0.05196=0.08196.

So d^2=1/0.08196≈12.206.

d= sqrt(12.206)=3.493 Angstrom.

Again, same result as before.

But the options are way higher. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not a, but a different measure.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is not a but a*sqrt(1 - cos theta). Let me compute that.

Wait, but if the interatomic distance is 10, then a=10 / sqrt(1 - cos(30)).

Compute sqrt(1 - (sqrt(3)/2)^2 )= sqrt(1 - 3/4)=sqrt(1/4)=0.5.

So a=10 /0.5=20 Angstrom.

Wait, but that would make a=20. Let me recalculate d with a=20.

So denominator=3 + 6*(0.866)=8.196.

d=20 / sqrt(8.196)=20/2.863≈7.0. Which is still not matching the options.

Wait, but 7 is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is a * sqrt(1 - cos theta).

Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between two nearest atoms, which could be along the edge of the unit cell. So the edge length is a, so interatomic distance is a*sqrt(1 - 2 cos theta + cos² theta + ... )? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance between two atoms is the magnitude of the vector a +b where a and b are vectors of length a, with an angle theta between them.

So the interatomic distance would be sqrt( a² + a² + 2 a² cos theta )=a sqrt(2 + 2 cos theta).

Wait, theta=30, so cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866.

So interatomic distance= a * sqrt(2 + 2*0.866)=a*sqrt(2 +1.732)=a*sqrt(3.732)≈a*1.931.

Given the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so a=10/1.931≈5.175 Angstrom.

Then, using this a=5.175 in the interplanar distance formula.

Compute denominator:3 +6*(0.866)=8.196.

So d=5.175 / sqrt(8.196)=5.175/2.863≈1.808 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is a*sqrt( 1 + 2 cos theta ), but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the diagonal of the rhombohedron. For example, in a simple cube, the space diagonal is a√3. But that's for a cubic system.

In a rhombohedral system, perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is along a different vector.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between two adjacent atoms along the (111) plane direction. But that seems unlikely because the (111) plane's normal is what defines d.

I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to proceed with the calculation I have, which is d≈3.49, even though it doesn't match the options.

But wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, and I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/d=0.286, which is approximately 1/3.49. But 9.54 is about 3.49 *2.738. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the reciprocal of the denominator inside the square root.

Wait, I'm getting confused. I think I have to conclude that the correct calculation leads to d≈3.49 Angstrom, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula is written as d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

But that gives a negative denominator for theta=30, which is impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system with angles <90 degrees, the interplanar distance formula is different. But I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) )

Which for (111) would give denominator 3-6= -3. Which would be impossible.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've tried all possible approaches and can't find a way to get an answer matching the options. Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula somewhere. But given the time I've spent, I'll have to proceed with the calculation.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d_{111} \) for a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}
\]

### Step 1: Identify the Miller indices
For the (111) plane, \( h = k = l = 1 \).

### Step 2: Compute the denominator
The denominator is given by:
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)
\]

Substituting \( h = k = l = 1 \) and \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \):
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866 + 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.866)
\]
\[
\text{Denominator} = 3 + 2(3 \cdot 0.866) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

### Step 3: Compute the interplanar distance
The interplanar distance is:
\[
d_{111} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{\text{Denominator}}}
\]
Substituting \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and \( \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863 \):
\[
d_{111} = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated interplanar distance \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the given options, which are all around 9–10 Å. This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the formula or the interpretation of the problem. However, based on the calculation, the closest match to the derived result is not among the options.

### Conclusion
The calculation consistently yields \( d_{111} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), but since this does not align with the provided options, the correct answer cannot be determined from the given choices.
