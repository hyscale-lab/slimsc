Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, I remember that σ matrices come from the commutators of gamma matrices. 

Wait, the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Oh right, in quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants.

I think I need to find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the action ∫ d^4x L must be dimensionless. So L has dimension 4. Each ψ contributes (3/2), so ψ̄ ψ would be 3. But wait, here we have ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ. Oh, σ_{μν} is made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, right? Because gamma matrices are just matrices, not operators with dimensions. So ψ̄ σ ψ has the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, which is 3.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of electromagnetism, I think. F is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. The dimension of A is 1 because the covariant derivative is ∂ + i e A, and ∂ has dimension 1. So A has dimension 1. F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each term is ∂ (dim 1) acting on A (dim 1), so F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together, the term ψ̄ σ ψ F: the ψ̄ σ ψ part has dimension 3 (since each ψ is 3/2), and F is 2. So 3 + 2 = 5. Wait wait, the Lagrangian term has to have dimension 4, so the whole term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4.

So the dimension of κ multiplied by (3 + 2) must equal 4. Wait, wait, no. Because each field in the term contributes their own dimension. Let's see: each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ would be 3/2 * 2 (since two ψ's) but wait, σ is dimensionless, so it's just 3/2 * 2? Hmm, no. Wait, ψ̄ is (ψ^dagger γ^0), which has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then F is dimension 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 =5. So the entire term κ times that must have dimension 4. So the dimension of κ is 4 -5 = -1. Because κ multiplied by 5 (from fields) equals 4, so κ is 4-5= -1.

So [κ]_M = -1. That would correspond to options A or C.

Now, about renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Wait, no. Let me think again. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its dimension is ≤4. Wait, no, that's not the right way. The coupling constants' dimensions determine whether the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling constant (κ in this case) must be ≥ 0 for the theory to be renormalizable. Because if the coupling has negative mass dimension, that implies the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (since the dimension is negative, the coupling's strength grows with energy). Such theories are non-renormalizable because you can't absorb the infinities into a finite number of counterterms; you get an infinite number of terms.

So in our case, κ has dimension -1. Negative. So the theory is not renormalizable. Because if the coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction term is dimension 5, which is higher than 4, so it's a non-renormalizable interaction.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The dimension of the Lagrangian must be 4. The term κ ψ̄ σ F ψ has dimension [κ] + 3 + 2 = 4. So [κ] = -1. So the coupling has negative mass dimension, implying that the interaction is non-renormalizable.

So the theory is not renormalizable. So looking at the options, the correct option is either A (κ has dim -1, theory renormalizable) or C (κ -1, not renormalizable).

But since κ is dim -1, the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct option is C: [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable.

Wait but wait another thing: sometimes people consider higher-dimensional operators. For instance, in the Standard Model, some terms are non-renormalizable and require a cutoff. So yes, if the coupling has negative dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass Dimensions of Fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor is constructed from $\gamma$-matrices, which are dimensionless. Thus, $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is also dimensionless.

### Step 2: Dimension of the Interaction Term
The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has the same dimension as $\bar{\psi} \psi$, which is $[\bar{\psi} \psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3$. Multiplying by $F^{\mu\nu}$, the full term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 3 + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Here, $\kappa$ has a negative mass dimension ($[\kappa]_M = -1$), which implies the interaction term has dimension 5. Such terms are non-renormalizable because they introduce an infinite hierarchy of higher-dimensional operators that cannot be absorbed into a finite set of counterterms. Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
