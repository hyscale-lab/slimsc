Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me read it carefully and figure out what's going on.

The question says: I need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me break down the information given. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a specific matrix.

So, for P_x, the matrix is [[0,1], [1,0]]. So, P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Wait, I remember that these matrices look familiar. Oh right, they're the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So, P is probably the angular momentum operator for spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons.

Wait, but the operator in question is P, which is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means it's in the plane formed by the x and z axes. So any direction in x-z plane can be parametrized by an angle θ from the z-axis, I think. Because in spherical coordinates, the azimuthal angle φ would be 0 or π if it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, actually, φ is the angle around the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ is either 0 or π, depending on whether it's in the positive x or negative x direction. But maybe that's not too important right now.

Anyway, the operator along direction n would be P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n must be zero. So n is along x-z plane, so n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around: the z-component is cosθ, x is sinθ cosφ, y is sinθ sinφ. But since n is in x-z plane, φ is zero or π, so n_y =0. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if we take φ=0, or ( -sinθ, 0, cosθ) for φ=π. But regardless, the y-component is zero.

Wait, so the operator P along direction n is P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Because n_y is zero, so P_y doesn't contribute.

So the operator matrix becomes P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Let me compute that matrix.

Let me denote the matrix as (ħ/2) times [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Because when you add the matrices from P_x and P_z:

P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2, so that's (ħ/2)(0,1;1,0).

P_z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So combining them:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, because n_x P_x is (n_x (ħ/2)) * [[0,1],[1,0]], and n_z P_z is (n_z (ħ/2)) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So adding these:

The (1,1) element is n_z (ħ/2) *1.

The (1,2) element is (n_x ħ/2) *1.

The (2,1) element is same as (1,2) because the P_x matrix is symmetric.

The (2,2) element is n_z (ħ/2) * (-1) = -n_z (ħ/2).

So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

But wait, the direction vector n must be a unit vector, right? So n_x² + n_z² =1.

Hmm. But n is along x-z plane, so that's correct.

Now, the problem is to find the eigenvector of this operator P corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvector equation: P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, wait, the eigenvalue is ħ/2, right? So the equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So we can plug in P into this equation.

Let me write P as (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix M, where M is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So P = (ħ/2) M.

Then the equation becomes (ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Multiplying both sides by 2/ħ, we get M |v> = |v>.

So the matrix M has to have eigenvalues 1 and -1. Because M is a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvalues of M will determine the eigenvalues of P (but scaled by ħ/2). So M is the matrix that we're diagonalizing here.

So the eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1 are the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue ħ/2.

So now, the problem reduces to finding the eigenvectors of M corresponding to eigenvalue 1.

Matrix M is:
[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

We can compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that spin-1/2 operators have eigenstates aligned with the direction of the operator.

Wait, the operator P is along n, so the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2 should be the spin-up state along n.

In quantum mechanics, the spin-up state along a direction n can be written in the basis of spin-up and spin-down along the z-axis (like the computational basis |↑> and |↓>).

So the general form of the spin-up state along n is:

|+> = cos(θ/2)|↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓>

But wait, in our case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so φ is either 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe it's zero. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, no. If the direction is in the x-z plane, that corresponds to φ=0 or φ=π, right? Because in spherical coordinates, φ is the angle around the z-axis. So n in x-z plane would have φ=0 (for positive x) or φ=π (negative x). But since the problem states it's an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, perhaps the general case allows for any φ? No, wait, no—because in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. So the direction is either in the positive x or negative x direction, but still in the x-z plane.

Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Let me think again. Any direction in the x-z plane can be written as a combination of x and z, so the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So, for example, along the x-axis, θ=90 degrees (π/2 radians), and along the z-axis, θ=0.

But regardless, the eigenvector for the spin-up state along direction n would have components based on θ. So the state |+> would be cos(θ/2)|↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓>.

Wait, but since the direction n is in the x-z plane, then the azimuthal angle φ is zero (if the projection is in the positive x direction) or π (if in negative x). But perhaps the problem allows for any φ, but in this scenario, the direction is in x-z plane, so φ is either 0 or π, but the eigenvectors would have to account for that.

Wait, but the given options don't seem to include phi. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which seems similar to the general form I was thinking. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{iφ} sin(theta)), which seems to parametrize a point on the unit circle but with theta perhaps as the polar angle. Option D has both sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Another approach: Let's compute the eigenvectors of matrix M.

The matrix M is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

We can find the eigenvalues by solving det(M - λ I) = 0.

So determinant is (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) - n_x^2 = 0.

Expanding: (-n_z^2 - λ n_z + λ n_z + λ^2) - n_x^2 = 0.

Wait, (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = (-n_z)(n_z - λ) - λ (n_z - λ) ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as:

(n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = (-n_z)(n_z - λ) + (-λ)(n_z - λ) = -n_z^2 + n_z λ -n_z λ + λ^2 = -n_z^2 + λ^2.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute it correctly.

(n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = (n_z)(-n_z) + n_z (-λ) - λ (-n_z) - λ * λ = -n_z² -n_z λ +n_z λ - λ² = -n_z² - λ².

So the determinant is (-n_z² - λ²) - (n_x^2) = 0.

So -n_z² - λ² -n_x^2 = 0 → -(n_z^2 + n_x^2) - λ² = 0.

But n is a unit vector, so n_z² + n_x² = 1. So this becomes -1 - λ²=0 → λ² = -1 → λ = ±i.

Wait wait, that can't be right. Because if M is a real matrix, then the eigenvalues should be real or come in complex conjugate pairs. But if M is real and symmetric, then eigenvalues are real. But looking at M, is it symmetric?

Wait, M is:

[ n_z, n_x ]

[ n_x, -n_z ]

So M^T is the same as M, because the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are both n_x. So M is symmetric. So its eigenvalues should be real.

Hmm, but according to my calculation, the determinant led to λ² = -1, which would imply λ= i or -i. That's a problem. I must have made a mistake in the determinant calculation.

Let me re-do this.

The determinant of (M - λ I) is:

|n_z - λ       n_x          |
|n_x          -n_z - λ      |

So determinant is (n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) - (n_x)(n_x).

Expanding:

(n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = [ (-n_z)(n_z - λ) ) ] + [ (-λ)(n_z - λ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to multiply it out:

(n_z - λ)(-n_z - λ) = (n_z)(-n_z) + n_z (-λ) - λ (-n_z) + (-λ)(-λ)

Wait, that would be:

- n_z² - n_z λ + n_z λ + λ² = -n_z² + λ².

So the first term is (-n_z² + λ²).

Subtracting the second term, which is n_x^2.

So determinant is (-n_z² + λ²) - n_x^2 = λ² - (n_z² + n_x^2) = λ² - 1.

So setting determinant to zero: λ² -1 = 0 → λ = ±1.

Ah, that makes sense now. So the eigenvalues are 1 and -1.

So the eigenvalue we're interested in is 1. So, we can find the eigenvector by solving (M - I)|v> = 0.

So M - I is:

[ n_z - 1,    n_x        ]
[ n_x,       -n_z - 1    ]

So the equations are:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0,

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0.

So from the first equation: (n_z -1) v1 = -n_x v2 → v1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] v2.

Wait, but let me write it as:

(n_z -1) v1 = -n_x v2 → (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0.

Wait, perhaps to make it easier, let's parameterize the eigenvector as v = (v1, v2).

We can write the first equation as:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0 → v1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] v2.

But for v to be non-zero, we can choose v2 as a parameter. Let me set v2 = 1 (or any non-zero value, but let's say 1 for simplicity).

Then v1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ].

But wait, perhaps I should write it in terms of the direction vector's components.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of the polar angle theta.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Let me parameterize n using theta, where theta is the angle from the z-axis.

So n_x = sin(theta) (since projection on x), and n_z = cos(theta).

Wait, because in spherical coordinates, for a point in x-z plane, the x-component is r sin(theta) cos(phi), but since phi is 0 (for x-z positive x direction), so n_x = sin(theta) cos(0) = sin(theta), and n_z = cos(theta).

So substituting n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

So the matrix M becomes:

[ [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ],
  [ sin(theta), -cos(theta) ] ]

So, solving for eigenvectors when lambda=1.

So (M - I) is:

[ cos(theta)-1, sin(theta) ],
[ sin(theta), -cos(theta)-1 ]

So the equations are:

(cos(theta) -1) v1 + sin(theta) v2 = 0,

sin(theta) v1 + (-cos(theta) -1) v2 = 0.

From the first equation: v1 = [ - sin(theta) / (cos(theta) -1) ] v2.

Let me compute the denominator: cos(theta) -1 = -(1 - cos(theta)).

So v1 = [ - sin(theta) / ( - (1 - cos(theta)) ) ] v2 → [ sin(theta)/(1 - cos(theta)) ) ] v2.

We can simplify this expression.

We can use the identity 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2),

and sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So sin(theta)/(1 - cos(theta)) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin^2(theta/2)] ) = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] = cot(theta/2).

So v1 = cot(theta/2) v2.

Let me set v2 = sin(theta/2) for normalization later, but let's first write the components.

v1 = cot(theta/2) * v2.

So v1 = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * v2.

If I choose v2 = sin(theta/2), then v1 = cos(theta/2).

So the eigenvector becomes ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me check the normalization.

The vector (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) has magnitude sqrt( cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2) )=1, so it's normalized.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is exactly this: ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ).

But wait a second. Let me check the options again.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything.

So the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches option C.

But wait, the options also have factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) in options A and D. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the direction n could be along the same axis as the basis used for the eigenvectors. Wait, but in this case, the basis I'm using is the computational basis for P_z. So when the operator is measured along n, the eigenstates are |+> and |->, which are superpositions of |↑> and |↓> based on the angle theta.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of spin states. The spin-up state along direction n is given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |↓>.

But since our direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero or pi. So e^{i phi} is either 1 or -1.

Wait, but in the x-z plane, phi is zero, because the direction is along positive x or negative x. Wait, no, phi is the angle around the z-axis. So if the direction is along positive x, phi is 0. If it's along negative x, phi is pi.

So the spin-up state could be either cos(theta/2)|↑> + sin(theta/2)|↓>, or cos(theta/2)|↑> - sin(theta/2)|↓>, depending on the direction.

But in the case of the x-z plane, the general state would still be |+> = cos(theta/2)|↑> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|↓>, with phi=0 or phi=pi.

In our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, let's take phi=0 for simplicity. So the state would have e^{i phi}=1.

So the state is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

That's exactly what I got. So the eigenvector is as in option C.

But wait, the question states that the operator is in the x-z plane, which would affect the eigenvector? Or perhaps I'm missing a normalization factor, but the options don't have that.

Wait, but the eigenvector I found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3)ħ, sqrt(1/3)ħ). That doesn't seem right because the eigenvectors are dimensionless (in terms of the spin states), but the presence of ħ is confusing. Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator is given with factors of ħ/2, so perhaps the eigenvectors are expressed in terms of ħ? Or perhaps not. Because eigenvectors are usually dimensionless, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back, the problem asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvector's components should be dimensionless. So any option including ħ is probably incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3)ħ, sqrt(1/3)ħ). These have ħ, which seems wrong. So probably not.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). That's a different parametrization. Not matching what I found.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). Yes, matches what I found.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ). Again, the presence of ħ is odd, and the sqrt factors don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in parameterization.

Wait, let me double-check the direction of n.

If n is in the x-z plane, then n is (nx, 0, nz), with nx² + nz² =1.

But in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, so nx = sin(theta) cos(phi), nz = cos(theta).

But since we're in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi.

So yes, the parametrization I used earlier is correct.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

Therefore, the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parametrized using the polar angle $\theta$ from the z-axis, with $\phi = 0$ (for simplicity).

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}$
The operator $\vec{P}$ along the direction $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and is a unit vector). Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $\vec{P}$ becomes:
\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the eigenvector
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we find:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(n_z - 1)v_1 + n_x v_2 = 0, \quad n_x v_1 + (-n_z - 1)v_2 = 0
\]
From the first equation, we solve for $v_1$ in terms of $v_2$:
\[
v_1 = \frac{-n_x}{n_z - 1} v_2
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, we get:
\[
v_1 = \frac{-\sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1} v_2
\]
Using trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:
\[
v_1 = \cot\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) v_2
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
To normalize the eigenvector, we choose $v_2 = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, which gives:
\[
v_1 = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with the dimensionless nature of eigenvectors. This is incorrect.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ does not match the derived eigenvector, as it uses $\theta$ instead of $\theta/2$. This is incorrect.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector exactly. This is correct.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes incorrect normalization factors and $\hbar$, which is inconsistent. This is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
