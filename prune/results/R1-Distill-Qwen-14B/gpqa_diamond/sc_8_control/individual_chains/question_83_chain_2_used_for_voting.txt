Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration problems. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can figure it out.

First, I think I need to find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, you can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³ because we're adding 20 cm³ of water. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = 0.025 M. Got that, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH. The neutralization reaction would produce the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, but the question asks about 25% titration. So that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let me think about what that implies.

So, for the equivalence point first. To find the pH there, I remember that for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence solution is a solution of the conjugate base (acetate ion) in water. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

To find the pH at equivalence, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions and use the Kb (since it's a base). The Kb can be found from Ka: Kw = Ka * Kb, so Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5. Hmm, 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9, which is 5.405e-10, yes.

Next, I need the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence. Let's figure out the moles. The initial solution after dilution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which when diluted to 40 cm³ becomes 0.025 M. So the moles of acetic acid are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Since at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate, so moles of acetate are 0.001 mol.

The total volume at equivalence point will be the sum of the diluted acid volume and the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but I don't know the volume of NaOH added at equivalence. Hmm. Wait, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid.

Moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the total solution volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So I can set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced, then:

5.405e-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but I don't see 9.02 as an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let's recalculate the Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. That part seems right.

Moles of CH3COOH after dilution: 20 cm³ * 0.05 M = 1 mmol. Then diluted to 40 cm³, so 0.025 M, 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So that's correct.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 10 cm³. So total volume is 50 cm³, so 0.05 L. [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So Kb expression is correct. x^2 = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11. x=sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5. pOH is around 4.98, pH 9.02.

But looking at the options: all the equivalence point pHs are below 8. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the initial dilution. Let me check that again. Oh wait, wait! Wait a second. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³. So concentration after dilution is (0.05 * 20) /40 = 0.025 M. So that part is correct.

Wait, but when titrating, perhaps I should calculate the moles correctly.

Wait, moles of acetic acid in diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, all of this is converted to acetate. So moles of acetate: 0.001 mol.

Volume of solution: 40 cm³ + V_NaOH. V_NaOH is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 M) )= 0.01 L =10 cm³. So total volume is 50 cm³. So [CH3COO^-] is 0.001 /0.05 = 0.02 M. All correct.

Hmm, but the calculated pH is 9.02, but none of the options have that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the acetate concentration is 0.02 M, but maybe using the correct Kb calculation.

Wait, wait another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the formula for the pH of a salt solution. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the pH using the concentration of the acetate ion.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me compute it again.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the exact expression without approximation. Let's see:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial: 0.02 M, 0, 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 -x, x, x.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02, so x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 14 -4.98 =9.02.

But none of the options have pH around 9. So perhaps I got the equivalence point wrong. Let's look at the options:

Options:

A) 4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none have a pH near 9. So I must have made a mistake. Oh wait! Wait, wait. Wait, perhaps I messed up the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence is a buffer solution? No, no, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate, and the solution is just the sodium acetate. So it's a solution of a weak base in water. So the pH should be higher, but why my calculation doesn't match any options.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong Kb. Wait, let me compute Kb again.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps I should compute the concentration correctly. Let me recalculate the concentration of acetate.

Wait, when I titrate to equivalence, I have 0.001 mol of acetate in 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me think again.

Wait, initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles = 0.02 L *0.05 M = 0.001 mol. When diluted to 40 cm³, concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So everything seems correct, but the pH is 9.02, which isn't in any options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in another part. Oh wait! Wait, perhaps the problem is that the volume of NaOH added at equivalence is not 10 cm³. Let me check that.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. Moles needed to reach equivalence: 0.001 mol. So volume = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10=50 cm³.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Hmm, maybe I should compute the pH using the exact quadratic equation without approximations.

So, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

So x² =5.405e-10 (0.02 -x).

Assuming x is small, but let's see: 5.405e-10 *0.02 is 1.081e-11. The square root of that is about 1.04e-5, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds. So x is about 1.04e-5, so [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02. But that's not in any options.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the Kb. Let me compute it again:

Ka = 1.85e-5.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

Wait, 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 is 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm, maybe I should use the exact value without approximating. Let me see:

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x) → x² =5.405e-10 * 0.02 -5.405e-10 x.

So x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant: (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11.

Wait, (5.405e-10)^2 is approx 2.92e-19.

4ac=4*1*1.081e-11=4.324e-11.

So sqrt(2.92e-19 +4.324e-11) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) = ~6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] /2.

We take the positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10) /2 ≈ 6.576e-6/2 =3.288e-6.

So x ≈3.288e-6 → [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈5.48 → pH=14-5.48=8.52.

Ah! So that's 8.52. Oh wait, that's one of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the initial approximation, but using the exact quadratic gives a more accurate result, bringing it down to about 8.52, which is option A's equivalence point. So pH at equivalence is 8.52.

But wait, that doesn't match the earlier approximation. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the exact method.

Wait, so at equivalence, pH is around 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Hmm.

But earlier I thought the pH was 9.02 before considering the quadratic, but after exact calculation, it's 8.52. So that must be correct.

Now, the other part is the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

At 25% titration, the amount of NaOH added is 25% of the moles needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. So moles neutralized: 0.25 *0.001 = 0.00025 mol.

So remaining moles of acetic acid: 0.001 -0.00025 =0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 mol.

The solution now will have both acetic acid and acetate ions, so it's a buffer solution. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by Ka: pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = approximately 4.735.

Wait, exact calculation:

log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) ≈ 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328 → pKa = 4.7328.

So pKa is about 4.73.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3.

So pH = 4.73 + log(1/3) = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.25.

But wait, let me check the volumes again. Because the total volume will have increased due to adding NaOH.

Wait, when 25% of the moles are neutralized, how much NaOH is added?

Moles of NaOH is 0.00025 mol. Since the concentration is 0.1 M, volume is 0.00025 /0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

So the total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) + 2.5 cm³ of NaOH =42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations of HA and A^- are:

[HA] = (0.00075) / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = (0.00025) / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333 → log(1/3) is -0.477.

So pH =4.73 + (-0.477)=4.253, approximately 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So pH at 25% is about 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52.

Wait, but earlier when I did the quadratic equation for equivalence, the pH was 8.52. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the equivalence point. Another approach: perhaps I should calculate the pH using the concentration of the acetate ion and the exact Kb without the approximation.

Wait, more accurately:

[CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M.

Kb is 5.405e-10.

So the expression is:

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x)

As before, using the exact quadratic equation.

Earlier calculation gave x ≈3.288e-6 → [OH^-] =3.288e-6 → pOH=5.48 → pH=8.52.

So that's correct, so the equivalence point pH is 8.52.

So the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52, which matches option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation.

Wait, perhaps the volume of the solution affects the ratio. Let me re-calculate the ratio.

At 25% titration, the moles of HA and A^- are:

HA: 0.00075 mol.

A^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 cm³ +2.5 cm³ =42.5 cm³ =0.0425 L.

So [HA] =0.00075 /0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] =0.00025 /0.0425 ≈0.005882 M.

So [A^-]/[HA] =0.005882/0.017647 ≈0.3333.

Log(1/3) is -0.477, so pH=4.73 -0.477=4.253.

So 4.25, which rounds to 4.26, matching option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution using the dilution formula:

\[
M_1V_1 = M_2V_2
\]

Here, \( M_1 = 0.05 \, \text{M}, V_1 = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3, V_2 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \). Solving for \( M_2 \):

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20.00}{40.00} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

The diluted acetic acid concentration is \( 0.025 \, \text{M} \).

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At 25% titration, \( 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \) of acetic acid has been neutralized, forming \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \) of acetate ion (\( \text{A}^- \)). The remaining acetic acid (\( \text{HA} \)) is:

\[
\text{Moles of HA} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of \( \text{HA} \) and \( \text{A}^- \) are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \).

---

### At the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid (\( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \)) is neutralized, forming \( 0.001 \, \text{mol} \) of acetate ion (\( \text{A}^- \)). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( \text{K}_b \) is calculated from \( \text{K}_a \) using:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( \text{K}_b \):

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{A}^-] - [\text{OH}^-]}.
\]

Assuming \( [\text{OH}^-] \ll 0.02 \), we approximate:

\[
\text{K}_b \approx \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( [\text{OH}^-] \):

\[
[\text{OH}^-]^2 = \text{K}_b \times 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \times 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, using the exact quadratic equation without approximation gives a slightly lower pH of \( 8.52 \), which matches option A.

---

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \( 8.52 \). These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
