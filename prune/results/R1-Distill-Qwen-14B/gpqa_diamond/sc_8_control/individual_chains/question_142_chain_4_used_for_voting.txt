Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ and asks about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are various points in a three-dimensional space, I think. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

Wait, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). That looks familiar. Oh right, that's a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. So this would represent a qubit that's in a completely mixed state, meaning it's equally likely to be 0 or 1, regardless of the measurement basis. So it's like the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, I need to figure out where this state is positioned geometrically in the qubit space. I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on or inside a unit sphere. The Bloch vector has three components (x, y, z), and for a pure state |ψ>, it's given by (2 Re(ψψ₁*), 2 Im(ψψ₁*), |ψ|² - |ψ₁|²). Wait, or was that different? Maybe I should think about how the density matrix relates to the Bloch vector.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2

Where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). The condition is that |r| ≤ 1 because the state must be valid (i.e., positive semi-definite). 

So for the given ρ, let's expand it. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal, and |1><1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. Adding them gives a diagonal matrix [1,1]. Then, dividing by 2 gives the matrix [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Hmm, let me compare this with the general form. Let me calculate (I + r·σ)/2. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], and the Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Putting it all together, (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 should equal ρ, which is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So let's compute each element.

First, I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. Adding r_x σ_x gives [[0, r_x], [r_x, 0]], r_y σ_y gives [[0, -i r_y], [i r_y, 0]], r_z σ_z gives [[r_z, 0], [0, -r_z]]. So adding all together:

I + r·σ = 
[[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y ],
 [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z ]]

Then, divide by 2:

Each element becomes (1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2, and same for the others.

So the density matrix ρ is:

ρ = [ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ) ] ]

But in our case, the given ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements 1/2, and the off-diagonal elements are zero. So let's set the off-diagonal terms to zero and the diagonal terms to 1/2.

So (r_x - i r_y)/2 must be zero. That implies that both r_x and r_y must be zero. Because if (r_x - i r_y) is zero, then the real part (r_x) is zero and the imaginary part (r_y) is zero. So r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

Now, looking at the diagonal elements, (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5. Let's solve that:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because when I plug r_z =0, the diagonal elements are (1+0)/2 = 0.5 and (1 - 0)/2 = 0.5. So yes, that matches.

So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). That is, the origin in the Bloch sphere. But wait, that's the completely mixed state. Because a pure state would be on the surface of the sphere (radius 1), and the completely mixed state (like this one) is at the center (r=0). That makes sense because the density matrix is (I/2), which is the maximally mixed state.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which is the origin. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait, another way: the density matrix (I/2) is the maximally mixed state, so it's the center of the Bloch sphere. So yes, the position is (0,0,0). So the answer is C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the qubit is equally likely to be in state \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\), regardless of the measurement basis. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where the components correspond to the qubit's position in a three-dimensional space. The Bloch vector for a density matrix \(\rho\) is related to the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\) by the relation:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we find that the off-diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are zero, which implies that \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\). The diagonal terms are both \(1/2\), which corresponds to \(z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is geometrically represented by the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\)**  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\)**  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\)**  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as it represents the origin in the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.
