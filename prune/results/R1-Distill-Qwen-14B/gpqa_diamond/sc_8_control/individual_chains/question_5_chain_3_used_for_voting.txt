Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, eigenvectors of a quantum mechanical operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it.

The operator is given as P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue.

Wait, the question gives me the components of the operator P: Px, Py, Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down each component:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

Oh right, the operator P is the vector operator, so it's given by the components in terms of the direction vector n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it must be of the form (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, phi would be zero? Or maybe phi is arbitrary? Wait, no, the x-z plane is where y=0, so any direction in the x-z plane would have an angle φ=0 or π, but that's for the standard spherical coordinates where the z-axis is up. Alternatively, perhaps the direction n can be represented as (a, 0, b), with a² + b² = 1.

Wait, but the operator P along direction n is given by P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y =0. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So, the operator P is a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute that.

n_x is the x-component of the direction vector. Let me denote n as (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² =1.

So, P = (n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

Let me compute this matrix. Combining the two:

The (1,1) element is (n_z * (ħ/2)) * 1.

The (1,2) element is (ħ/2) * n_x * 1.

Similarly, the (2,1) element is (ħ/2)*n_x *1.

The (2,2) element is (n_z * (ħ/2)) * (-1).

So the matrix P is:

[ (n_z ħ/2 ) , (n_x ħ/2 ) ]
[ (n_x ħ/2 ) , (-n_z ħ/2 ) ]

We're looking for eigenvectors of this operator with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So, the matrix equation is:

[ (n_z ħ/2 ) , (n_x ħ/2 ) ] [a]   = (ħ/2) [a]
[ (n_x ħ/2 ) , (-n_z ħ/2 ) ] [b]     [b]

Let me write the equations:

(1) (n_z ħ/2 ) a + (n_x ħ/2 ) b = (ħ/2) a

(2) (n_x ħ/2 ) a + (-n_z ħ/2 ) b = (ħ/2) b

Let me divide both equations by ħ/2 to simplify.

Equation (1):
n_z a + n_x b = a

Equation (2):
n_x a - n_z b = b

Rearranging equation (1):

n_z a + n_x b - a =0
a(n_z -1) +n_x b=0

Equation (2):

n_x a - n_z b - b =0
n_x a - b (n_z +1)=0

Hmm, so we have:

Equation (1): a (n_z -1) + n_x b =0

Equation (2): n_x a - b (n_z +1 )=0

We can write these as:

(1) a (n_z -1) = -n_x b

(2) n_x a = b (n_z +1 )

Let me express a in terms of b from equation (2):

From (2): a = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] b

Wait, but only if n_x is not zero. Since n is in x-z plane, n_x can be zero (if direction is along z), but perhaps we can proceed.

Substituting a into equation (1):

[ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] b * (n_z -1 ) = -n_x b

Multiply both sides by n_x:

(n_z +1)(n_z -1) b = -n_x^2 b

(n_z² -1) b = -n_x^2 b

But n_x² + n_z² =1 → n_z² =1 -n_x².

So substituting n_z² =1 -n_x²,

( (1 -n_x²) -1 ) b = -n_x² b → (-n_x²) b = -n_x² b.

Which gives (-n_x² b) = -n_x² b → 0=0. So the equations are consistent, and we can find eigenvectors.

So, back to equation (2): a = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] b

Let me express a in terms of b. Let's let b be a parameter, say, b = t. Then a = [ (n_z +1 ) / n_x ] t.

The eigenvector is [a, b] = t [ (n_z +1 ) /n_x , 1 ]

But the eigenvector can be scaled by any non-zero scalar t. Let me choose t=1 for simplicity. So the vector is [ (n_z +1)/n_x , 1 ]

But wait, we need to normalize the eigenvector.

The norm is sqrt( |a|^2 + |b|^2 )

So:

|a|^2 = |(n_z +1)|² / n_x²

|b|^2 = 1

Since the vector is [ (n_z +1)/(n_x ), 1 ]

Wait, but n_x could be complex? No, because n is a unit vector in real space, so n_x and n_z are real numbers. Wait, no, n is a direction vector, but in quantum mechanics, when dealing with spin, the direction can be represented by real vectors. So n_x and n_z are real.

So let's compute the norm squared:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = [ (n_z +1)^2 / n_x^2 ] + 1.

But n_x^2 =1 - n_z^2, from n_x² + n_z²=1.

So,

[ (n_z +1)^2 ] / (1 - n_z^2 ) + 1.

Let me compute numerator: (n_z +1)^2 = n_z² + 2 n_z +1.

Denominator: (1 -n_z^2 ) = (1 - n_z)(1 +n_z )

So,

[ (n_z² + 2 n_z +1 ) ] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z ) ) ] +1.

Simplify numerator: n_z² + 2 n_z +1 = (n_z +1)^2.

So,

(n_z +1)^2 / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ] = (n_z +1)^2 / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ]

This simplifies to (n_z +1) / (1 -n_z )

Because (n_z +1)^2 divided by (n_z +1) is (n_z +1), and the denominator is (1-n_z) (n_z +1) ?

Wait, let me do it step by step.

(n_z +1)^2 / ( (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) )

= (n_z +1)^2 / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ]

= [ (n_z +1) * (n_z +1) ) ] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ]

= (n_z +1) * [ (n_z +1) / (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z)  ) ]

Wait, no. Let me factor the denominator as (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) = 1 - n_z².

So,

The first term becomes (n_z +1)^2 / (1 -n_z² ) = [ (n_z +1)^2 ] / [ (1 -n_z)(1 +n_z) ) ]

Which is [ (n_z +1) ]^2 / [ (1 -n_z)(n_z +1) ) ] = (n_z +1 ) / (1 -n_z )

So, the first term is (n_z +1)/(1 -n_z )

The second term is 1.

So overall, the norm squared is [ (n_z +1)/(1 -n_z ) ] + 1.

Let me combine these:

= [ (n_z +1) + (1 -n_z) ] / (1 -n_z )

= (n_z +1 +1 -n_z ) / (1 -n_z )

= (2 ) / (1 -n_z )

So the norm is sqrt( 2 / (1 -n_z ) )

Wait, but wait, the denominator is 1 -n_z.

Hmm, but 1 -n_z = (n_x² + n_z^2 ) - n_z = n_x² + n_z (1 -n_z )

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let me think about the possible parameterization of the direction vector n.

Since n is in the x-z plane, let's parameterize it using an angle θ in the x-z plane. Let me imagine that the direction vector makes an angle θ with the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Because in a direction in the x-z plane, the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis.

So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, since in spherical coordinates, x = sinθ cosφ, but since φ=0 (since in x-z plane), x=sinθ, z= cosθ.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the x-z plane: the standard spherical coordinates have x= r sinθ cosφ, y= sinθ sinφ, z= cosθ. So for a point in the x-z plane, φ=0 or φ=π. Let's say φ=0. So x= r sinθ cos0 = r sinθ, y=0, z= r cosθ. Since it's a unit vector, r=1. So n_x= sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

So, n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ.

So now, let's substitute n_z = cosθ, n_x= sinθ.

So, the norm squared is 2/(1 -n_z ) = 2/(1 - cosθ )

Hmm, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2). So 2/(2 sin²(theta/2)) ) = 1/( sin²(theta/2) )

So the norm is 1/( sin(theta/2) )

Hmm, but wait, the norm of the eigenvector is sqrt( [ (n_z +1)^2 / n_x^2 ] + 1 )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution earlier. Let me recalculate.

The norm squared is:

[ (n_z +1)^2 / n_x^2 ] + 1.

Substituting n_z=cosθ, n_x=sinθ,

= [ (cosθ +1)^2 ] / sin²θ + 1.

Expand (cosθ +1)^2 = cos²θ + 2 cosθ +1.

So,

[ cos²θ + 2 cosθ +1 ] / sin²θ + 1.

Hmm, let's compute that:

= [ (1 + cosθ)^2 ] / sin²θ + 1.

Wait, sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ = (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ).

So,

= [ (1 + cosθ)^2 ] / [ (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ) ] +1

= [ (1 + cosθ) ] / (1 - cosθ ) + 1.

Which simplifies to [ (1 + cosθ) + (1 - cosθ) ] / (1 - cosθ )

= [ 2 ] / (1 - cosθ )

So same as before, the norm squared is 2/(1 - cosθ ), so norm is sqrt( 2/(1 - cosθ) )

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), so sqrt( 2/(2 sin²(theta/2)) ) ) = sqrt( 1/( sin²(theta/2) )) = 1/( sin(theta/2) )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ a, b ] divided by the norm.

So, the unnormalized vector is [ (n_z +1)/n_x, 1 ] which, substituting n_z= cosθ, n_x= sinθ, gives [ (cosθ +1)/sinθ , 1 ]

So, the normalized vector is [ (cosθ +1)/( sinθ * (1/( sin(theta/2) )) ), 1/( sin(theta/2) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me compute each component.

We have a= (n_z +1)/n_x = (cosθ +1)/ sinθ.

The norm is 1/( sin(theta/2) )

So each component is multiplied by the reciprocal of the norm.

Wait, no. The vector is [a, b ] = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ, 1 ]

The norm is sqrt( a² + b² ) = sqrt( [ (cosθ +1)^2 / sin²θ ] + 1 )

Which, as computed earlier, is sqrt( 2/(1 - cosθ) )

So, to normalize, divide each component by sqrt(2/(1 - cosθ) )

So normalize the vector:

a_normalized = [ (cosθ +1)/ sinθ ] * sqrt( (1 - cosθ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly for b_normalized.

Wait, let me compute a.

a = (cosθ +1)/ sinθ.

Multiply and divide by sqrt( (1 - cosθ) ) / sqrt(2 ), i.e., multiply by sqrt( (1 - cosθ) ) and divide by sqrt(2 )

So,

a_normalized = (cosθ +1) / sinθ * sqrt( (1 - cosθ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Factor (cosθ +1 ) is 2 cos²(theta/2 )

Similarly, (1 - cosθ ) is 2 sin²(theta/2 )

So,

cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(theta/2 )

1 - cosθ= 2 sin²(theta/2 )

So,

a_normalized = (2 cos²(theta/2 )) / sinθ * sqrt( 2 sin²(theta/2 ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Wait, sqrt(2 sin²(theta/2 )) ) is sqrt(2) |sin(theta/2)|. Since theta is between 0 and pi, sin(theta/2) is positive.

So,

= 2 cos²(theta/2 ) / sinθ * sqrt(2) sin(theta/2 ) / sqrt(2 )

= 2 cos²(theta/2 ) / sinθ * sin(theta/2 )

Because sqrt(2) in numerator and denominator cancels.

But sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2 ) cos(theta/2 )

So,

= 2 cos²(theta/2 ) / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2 )

Simplify denominator: 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So,

= [ 2 cos²(theta/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2 )

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2 )

= cos(theta/2 )

Similarly, let's compute b_normalized.

b =1.

So,

b_normalized = 1 * sqrt( (1 - cosθ) / 2 )

Again, (1 - cosθ ) = 2 sin²(theta/2 ), so sqrt( (2 sin²(theta/2 )) / 2 )

= sqrt( sin²(theta/2 ) ) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait, in the first component, it's cos(theta/2 ), the second is sin(theta/2 )

So the vector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

Looking at the options, option C says ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, but I don't see any in our result.

Wait, but wait. Did I miss any scaling factors?

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the operator is P along n, and we found the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But wait, the operator's eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the state is an eigenstate of P with eigenvalue ħ/2. So, for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along a certain direction.

In the standard basis, the spin-up along the z-axis is (0,1), but wait, no, I think it's (1,0) for spin up along z. Wait, let's think. For the Pauli matrices, the eigenstates of sigma_z are |↑> = [1, 0], |↓> = [0,1]. So for our case, the operator P_z has eigenstates [1,0] and [0,1], with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvector we found is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Which is the same as the spin-up state along a direction making an angle theta with the z-axis. Which makes sense.

So, the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

Looking back at the options:

Option C says ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

Option B is ( cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

But wait, the eigenvector is in the (a, b) form, but I think the question is about a muon's spin, so perhaps the eigenvectors are in the spinor form, which are two-component vectors.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the parameterization.

Alternatively, let me think about the direction theta as the angle from the z-axis. So, the direction vector is in x-z plane, so phi=0. So, the state is the eigenstate of spin in that direction, which is a superposition of the x, y, z spin states.

The standard eigenstate for spin-up along direction theta (from z-axis) is a spinor [ cos(theta/2 ), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]

But since phi=0 in our case, because n is in x-z plane, phi=0. So the spinor is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Which matches option C.

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but the vectors in the options are in terms of hbar, but I think the eigenvector doesn't have hbar in it. Because eigenvectors are dimensionless, right? Because operators have units of ħ. The eigenvectors are just normalized vectors.

Wait, the eigenvectors are normalized vectors. So, options with hbar in them probably are incorrect, unless the components are in terms of some scaled vectors.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

That's a vector with components proportional to ħ, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )

Hmm, seems like a format for spherical coordinates but perhaps for a vector, not spinor. But wait, in the problem, the eigenvector is a 2-component vector, so option B has two components, which fit. But the form is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which would match a vector on the unit circle, but in the standard spherical coordinates, that's more like (x, y) components, but in 2D, perhaps.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Which is exactly what we derived.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Hmm, why sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3)? That would imply a specific direction, perhaps along some axis. But the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the eigenvector shouldn't have fixed coefficients like sqrt(2/3) unless the direction is fixed.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me re-examine the operator.

Wait, wait a second. The operator P is along the direction n, which is arbitrary in the x-z plane. The eigenvector should be expressed in terms of theta, the angle from the z-axis.

But in our earlier calculation, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], which is option C.

So, the correct answer should be option C.

But looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which matches.

So why is option D present? Option D has factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which I don't see arising from the problem. Maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the substitution?

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the operator P is actually the angular momentum operator, which for spin-1/2 has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the state should be normalized as a spinor. So the eigenvector we found is correct.

So, in conclusion, the correct option is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{n}$ and the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is then given by:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we compute:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ 
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is $\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$. Let the eigenvector be $|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting into the eigenvalue equation and solving, we find that the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This result matches the standard form of the spin-up state along a direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, parameterized by $\theta$.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This option introduces $\hbar$ into the components of the eigenvector, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless. Hence, this option is invalid.

- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
  This option represents a vector in spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector for a spin-1/2 system. It is inconsistent with the standard spinor form.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This matches the derived normalized eigenvector exactly. It is the correct answer.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This option introduces unnecessary scaling factors ($\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$) and $\hbar$, which are not justified by the problem setup. Hence, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
