Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I guess I need to consider how relativity affects the motion.

The question gives that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. They're asking for the maximum speed v_max. The options are all different expressions involving c, the speed of light, so relativity is definitely a factor here.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would just be v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, the options include c so this must be relativistic. So option C is probably the non-relativistic answer, and the correct answer would be one of the others.

In relativity, the energy considerations change. The total energy includes rest mass energy. So for a relativistic oscillator, the energy would be a combination of rest mass energy and the oscillatory potential energy. Oh right, in the relativistic case, the total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², but in the relativistic scenario, energy conservation might involve relativistic expressions. Wait, but the system is a harmonic oscillator, so the potential energy is similar but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement (since at maximum amplitude, all energy is potential).

Wait, that makes sense. At maximum amplitude A, the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so all its energy is potential. Then, as it moves towards equilibrium, potential energy converts to kinetic, which would be maximum at x=0.

So the total energy E is the rest energy plus the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E = gamma mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, wait, no. At maximum displacement, the oscillator's speed is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the total energy would be (1/2)kA² + mc², assuming mc² is the rest energy. But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but in this case, the rest mass energy is just mc².

Wait, no, that's the rest energy. But the oscillator's total energy is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy? Hmm. Let me think again. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is equal to the maximum kinetic energy.

In relativity, when the particle is at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is the rest energy plus the potential energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, maybe that's not right because in relativity, energy expressions can get more complicated.

Wait, another approach: the energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator might be expressed as the sum of the rest energy and the classical potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is considered as part of the total energy in the relativistic context.

Now, the maximum kinetic energy occurs when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position (x=0), so all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. But wait, in the relativistic case, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So at maximum speed, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and rest energy.

Wait, but at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy would be purely kinetic. But earlier, when x=A, the total energy is rest energy plus potential energy. So E at x=A is (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the total energy larger than just the rest energy. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is considered part of the rest energy. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach it from the conservation of energy perspective.

At maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that can't be right because the rest energy is mc². So maybe the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, another thought: in the relativistic case, the oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So when the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So E = mc² + K, where K is the maximum kinetic energy.

Wait, no, because when x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy, E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, that doesn't seem right because in the non-relativistic case, when the potential energy is (1/2)kA², the total energy is (1/2)kA², which is just the maximum kinetic energy. So in that case, E = (1/2)kA².

But if that's the case, then in the relativistic scenario, when x=A, E = (1/2)kA², but here E also equals mc² plus the kinetic energy, which is zero at x=A. So that would imply (1/2)kA² = mc². But that can't be right because when A is small, we should recover the non-relativistic case.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should instead express the energy in terms of the maximum speed.

At maximum speed, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic. The kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1)mc². So E = (gamma - 1)mc².

But the total energy must also equal the potential energy at maximum displacement, which is (1/2)kA², because that's when the kinetic energy is zero. So (gamma - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, no. Because at maximum displacement, the total energy is E = (1/2)kA². Because the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)kA². So in that case, E must be (gamma - 1)mc². Wait, no, because at x=A, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is just rest energy plus potential? Or is the potential energy already included in the rest energy?

Wait, perhaps I should model the system's total energy as the sum of its rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, that would imply that when the oscillator is at x=A, its speed is zero, so the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Then, when it's at x=0, all of that energy is kinetic. So, the kinetic energy is E - mc² = (1/2)kA².

But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So setting that equal to (1/2)kA².

So, (gamma - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

So, gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Wait, that makes sense.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let's call it term B. So,

gamma = 1 + B.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 + B.

Take reciprocal of both sides,

sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1/(1 + B).

Square both sides,

1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + B)^2.

Rearranged,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1+B)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2 ].

But let me compute B again: B = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ]

Take square root,

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I derived.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we consider the relativistic energy conservation. 

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \). At \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:

\[
K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

The Lorentz factor is also expressed as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( \gamma \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}},
\]

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
