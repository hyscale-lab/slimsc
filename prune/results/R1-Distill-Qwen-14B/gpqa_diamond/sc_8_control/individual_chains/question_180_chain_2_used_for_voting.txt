Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges, especially when calculating potential energy, the formula involves Coulomb's constant and the product of the charges divided by the distance between them.

Wait, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2e, which would be 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. So the system consists of one charge fixed at P and twelve others each at 2 meters from P. Are these twelve charges arranged in some particular way? Like a regular structure or just all at the same distance?

I think the way the question is phrased, it's treating each of the twelve as being at a fixed distance from P. So their positions are all 2 m away. But how are they arranged? Because if they're all at the same distance, the potential energy would depend on their arrangement. But wait, potential energy between charges is calculated based on each pair. So maybe I should consider all the pairs.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies of all pairs involving the fixed charge. Also, but wait, the twelve charges are fixed at 2 meters from P. Are they all at the same point? No, I think they must be arranged around P in a way that each is 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances would vary, but since they're identical and the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential due to the fixed charge and the others, but not the potential between the twelve moving charges themselves. Because if the twelve are constrained, maybe their mutual distances are fixed, but the problem asks for the minimum energy configuration.

Wait, the problem says it's an isolated system. So the potential energy would be the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges. So that would include the 13th charge and each of the 12 others, plus the potential energy between each of the twelve charges themselves.

But no, wait, the question says 'the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals.' So I think I need to calculate the total potential energy of all the pairs.

But how? Let me think. The potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1*q2)/r. Since all charges are the same, q1 = q2 = 2e for each. The fixed charge is at P, and each of the twelve is 2m away from P. So each of the twelve has a distance of 2m from the fixed charge. But what about the distance between the moving charges?

Ah, wait, the problem says 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So they are each at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not fixed. So if they are free to move as long as they remain 2m from P, the minimum potential energy would occur when the mutual potential energies are minimized. Since like charges repel, the potential energy between them would be positive. So to minimize the total potential energy, you would arrange them to be as far apart as possible, but wait, that's not possible because they're constrained at 2m from P. So perhaps their arrangement is such that the mutual potential energies are as small as possible, but since they're all around P, their mutual distances can't be too large.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me read the question again. It says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 are on a sphere of radius 2m around P. So the mutual distances between the 12 charges would be varying, but since the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, perhaps the mutual potential energies are not considered in the calculation, or perhaps the problem is only considering the potential from the fixed charge to the 12 others.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because potential energy in a system of charges includes all pairs. So if the system has 13 charges, the potential energy would be the sum of all possible pairs. So that's (13 choose 2) pairs. But wait, perhaps in this case, the 12 charges are all at 2m from the fixed charge, but their mutual distances are arranged in such a way that their potential energies are minimized. But I think that's complicating things beyond the scope of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energies are minimized, which would be when they are as far apart as possible. But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps we're only to calculate the potential energy due to the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not their mutual interactions.

Wait, the question says "the minimum energy of this system." So what's the minimum possible potential energy? Because each of the twelve charges is at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the potential energy due to the fixed charge and each of the 12 is (12) times (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m). Because each of the 12 has a distance of 2m from the fixed charge.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m) with respect to the fixed charge. So the total from the fixed charge would be 12 * (k*(4e²)/(2m)).

What about the potential energy between the 12 charges? Each pair among the 12 would contribute (k*(2e)^2)/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charge i and j. But since all the 12 are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances aren't fixed. So to minimize the total potential energy, we need to have each pair as far apart as possible. Because the potential energy between like charges is positive and increases as they get closer. So to minimize the total, you want to maximize each r_ij.

But with 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2m, the mutual distances can't all be very large. The maximum minimum distance would depend on the arrangement. But perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy from the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not their mutual interactions. Because considering all possible pairs would complicate the calculation, and the problem doesn't provide any specifics about the arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the question is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others. Because if we include the mutual interactions, the problem becomes more complex and requires knowing the arrangement, which isn't given.

Wait, let me think. The problem says it's an isolated system. So all the potential energies should be considered. So the total potential energy U is the sum of all pairs:

U = U_fixed + sum of potential energies between the 12.

Wait, U_fixed is the sum of the potential energies between the fixed charge and each of the 12:

U_fixed = 12 * (k*(2e)^2) / (2m)

But then the potential energy between any two of the 12 charges is (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij, but since their positions are fixed on a sphere, what is the sum of all those terms? Without knowing the exact arrangement, it's impossible to calculate the exact value, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential due to the fixed charge. Because the options provided don't seem to account for a large number of terms.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is about 5.645e-26 J, B is half that, and C is an order of magnitude smaller. D is way larger.

Wait, let me compute the U_fixed part first.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P. The fixed charge is 2e. Each of the 12 is 2e.

So the potential energy between the fixed charge and one moving charge is U = (k * (2e)^2) / (2m).

But wait, k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So let's compute each term:

U_single = (8.988e9) * ( (2e)^2 ) / (2 * 2 )

Wait, wait, (2e)^2 is (2)^2 * e² = 4e².

So U_single = 8.988e9 * (4e²) / (4) [because 2m is the denominator, so 2*2=4 in denominator? Wait, no, the denominator is 2m. Wait, 2m is the distance, so denominator is 2m.

So U_single = (8.988e9) * (4*(1.6e-19)^2) / (2*2).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute (2e)^2 = (2)^2 * (1.6e-19)^2 = 4 * (2.56e-38) = 1.024e-37 C².

Then, U_single = (8.988e9) * (1.024e-37) / (2*2) = (8.988e9 * 1.024e-37) /4.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = approximately 8.988 *1.024 = about 9.21, so 9.21e-28.

Divide by 4: 9.21e-28 /4 = ~2.3025e-28 J per pair.

But wait, each of the 12 moving charges contributes this U_single. So total U_fixed = 12 * 2.3025e-28 = 27.63e-28 J.

Wait, but 27.63e-28 J is 2.763e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about three times 2.763e-27. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, let's recompute U_single:

(2e)^2 = (2)^2 * (1.6e-19)^2 = 4 * (2.56e-38) = 1.024e-37 C².

So U_single = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (1.024e-37 C²) / (0.002 m) ?

Wait wait, no, the distance between the fixed charge and each moving charge is 2 m, not 2 meters. So the denominator is 2 m, not 4 m. Because each is at 2 m from P, so the distance between the fixed charge and each moving charge is 2 m.

Ah! I think I made a mistake earlier. The denominator is 2 m, not 4 m. So correction:

U_single = (8.988e9) * (1.024e-37) / 2.

So numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = let's compute 8.988 * 1.024 ≈ 9.21, so 9.21e-28.

Divide by 2: 9.21e-28 / 2 = ~4.605e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 12 *4.605e-28 = 5.526e-27 J.

So U_fixed is approximately 5.526e-27 J.

Wait, but that's without considering the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. If we include those, the total potential energy would be higher. Because each pair among the 12 contributes a positive potential energy. So the minimum energy would actually be higher than 5.526e-27 J. But the options don't have that.

Wait, wait. Let's check the options again. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is 10 times bigger than this. Option B is about 2.822e-26, which is also bigger. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.28 times bigger than our U_fixed. Hmm.

But wait, perhaps the mutual potential energies are not considered. Because the problem says 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, perhaps their positions are fixed on a sphere, and their mutual distances are such that their potential energies are considered. But without knowing their exact arrangement, it's impossible to calculate. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy from the fixed charge and the 12 others, and ignores the mutual energy between the 12.

In that case, the total U would be 5.526e-27 J. Looking at the options, the closest is option C, which is 7.056e-27. But that's higher than our calculated U_fixed. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

Let me redo the U_fixed calculation.

Each charge has charge 2e. So each pair between fixed and moving charges is (2e)^2 = 4e².

Coulomb's constant k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Distance r = 2 m.

So U_single = (k * (4e²)) / r = (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.6e-19)^2) / 2.

Compute (1.6e-19)^2: 2.56e-38.

Multiply by 4: 1.024e-37.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = 9.213e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6065e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.6065e-28 * 12 = 5.5278e-27 J.

So U_fixed is approximately 5.528e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 5.645e-26 → 56.45e-25 → wait, 56.45e-25 is 5.645e-24 J, which is way bigger.

Option B: 2.822e-26 → 28.22e-25 → 2.822e-24 J.

Option C:7.056e-27 → 0.7056e-26 J.

Option D:122.330 → much bigger.

So our U_fixed is 5.528e-27 J. None of the options match exactly, but option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.277 times our calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, the fixed charge is one, so each of the 12 charges is interacting with it. So 12 interactions, each contributing U_single as calculated.

So why is the option not matching?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all possible pairs, including the mutual interactions between the twelve charges. But without knowing their arrangement, that's not possible. Unless the twelve charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters. But that would be impossible because you can't have more than a few charges on a sphere at exactly the same distance from each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the twelve charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron or something, but that's complicated and the problem doesn't specify.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual potential energies between the 12. Because otherwise, the problem would have given more information about their arrangement.

So if that's the case, then the answer is 5.528e-27 J, which is approximately 5.528e-27. Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge value. Let me check: each charge is 2e, so when calculating U between two, it's (2e)^2 =4e². Correct.

Wait, but perhaps the potential energy is not just the sum for the fixed charge, but also for the mutual interactions. But without knowing their arrangement, can we compute that?

Wait, another thought: the problem asks for the minimum energy. So the minimum potential energy would occur when the system is as stable as possible. For like charges, the potential energy is minimized (though positive) when the charges are as far apart as possible. But since all 12 are fixed at 2 m from P, their mutual distances are determined by their arrangement on a sphere of radius 2 m. The minimum potential energy would thus involve the charges being as far apart as possible, which would involve a symmetric arrangement, like the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energies are zero or not contributing. That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are considered to be negligible compared to the energy due to the fixed charge. But that doesn't seem to be the case here, given the numbers.

Wait, let's think about the total number of pairs. There are 13 charges in total. The potential energy is the sum over all pairs. So:

Number of pairs where one is fixed: 12.

Number of pairs among the 12: (12*11)/2 = 66.

So total pairs: 78.

So the total potential energy U is sum of all these 78 terms.

But we only calculated the 12 terms.

If we could calculate the 66 terms, perhaps the sum would give a different value.

But without knowing the distances r_ij between the 12 charges, we can't compute that.

So perhaps the problem is only considering the 12 terms, leading to U ≈5.5e-27 J.

But none of the options match exactly. However, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 5.1 times larger than our calculated 5.5e-27 J. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Coulomb's constant. Let me check: Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C², correct.

Wait, maybe the problem didn't specify that the 12 charges are at 2m from P, but that the distance between them and P is 2m. So the fixed charge is at P, and each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So the distance between each of the 12 and the fixed charge is 2m. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, each of the 12 charges is interacting with the fixed charge, so 12 pairs. Each of the 12 charges interacts with each of the other 11, so 12*11/2=66 pairs. So total pairs is 78, as before.

So, the problem is that the mutual potential energies between the 12 are 66 terms, each positive. So the total potential energy would be U_fixed plus U_mutual, which is 5.5e-27 plus a positive number, making the total U higher than 5.5e-27.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is only considering the U_fixed part.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the sum of all the electric potentials. But in this case, the fixed charge is at P, and the others are at a distance. So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential at P, but the potential at P due to each charge is (k*(2e))/(2m). Then the potential energy of the fixed charge (which is also 2e) would be charge times potential, so U = q * V.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think.

The potential at P due to each of the 12 charges is V = k*(2e)/(2m) = (k*2e)/(2m) = (k e)/(m).

So each of the 12 contributes V = (8.988e9 * 1.6e-19) / 2.

Compute that: 8.988e9 * 1.6e-19 = approx 1.438e-9.

Divide by 2: 7.19e-10 V.

So the total potential at P due to the 12 charges is 12 *7.19e-10 V = 8.628e-9 V.

Then the potential energy of the fixed charge at P is U = q * V = 2e * 8.628e-9 V.

Compute that: 2 * 1.6e-19 C * 8.628e-9 V = 2*1.6*8.628e-28.

Which is 27.6096e-28 J, which is 2.76096e-27 J.

Wait, that's the same as our earlier U_fixed calculation. So that approach gives the same result as before, about 2.76e-27 J.

But again, that's without considering the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges.

Hmm. So if only considering the fixed charge and the 12, the potential energy is approximately 2.76e-27 J. But none of the options match exactly.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times higher. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10.2 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is referring to the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, which is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). So that's the same as before, 5.5e-27 J.

But perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as part of the 12? No, the problem says 13 particles, 12 are constrained at 2m, 1 is fixed at P.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position. So the fixed charge is brought to P, which requires no work since it's isolated. Then each of the 12 charges is brought into place. Each needs to be brought to a distance of 2 m from P, but when placing each charge, the other charges are already there. So the work done for each is the potential due to all the previous charges plus the fixed charge.

But that complicates the calculation because each charge would feel the potential from the fixed charge and all the previously placed charges. But the problem is about the minimum energy, which would require that the charges are placed in such a way that the potential energy is minimized.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, this approach is also difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy of the entire system as the sum of the potential energies of each pair involving the fixed charge, ignoring the mutual potential between the 12. So that's what I calculated earlier as 5.5e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Let me recompute the U_fixed again.

Each pair between fixed charge and a moving charge:

U = k*(2e)^2 / (2m) = 8.988e9 * (4*(1.6e-19)^2) / (2*2).

Wait, wait, no. The denominator is 2 meters. The distance between the fixed charge and each moving charge is 2 meters. So the denominator is 2, not 4.

So U_single = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / 2.

Compute 4e²: 4*(1.6e-19)^2 = 4*(2.56e-38) = 1.024e-37 C².

So U_single = (8.988e9) * (1.024e-37) / 2.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = 8.988 *1.024=9.21, so 9.21e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.605e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 4.605e-28 *12=5.526e-27 J.

Hmm, same as before.

So with U_fixed =5.526e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is 1.277 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the charge. Each charge is 2e, so when calculating U between the fixed and a moving charge, it's (2e)^2 =4e². Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the 13th charge as part of the 12, but no, the problem states 13 particles, 12 are constrained, 1 is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is considering each of the 12 charges as fixed and the 13th as moving, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

U for one pair: k*(2e)^2 / r.

r is 2 m.

So U = (8.988e9)*(4e²)/(2).

e=1.6e-19.

So 4e²=4*(2.56e-38)=1.024e-37.

So U = (8.988e9)*(1.024e-37)/(2).

8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = (8.988 *1.024) *1e-28 = approximately 9.21 *1e-28 =9.21e-28.

Divide by 2:4.605e-28.

Multiply by 12: 5.526e-27 J.

So that's correct.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options? But that can't be.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Wait, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is about 1.277 times higher than our calculated 5.526e-27.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges, assuming they are all at the same distance from each other. But that's not possible with 12 charges on a sphere. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2 meters, but that's impossible for 12 points on a sphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the other 12, and not the mutual potential between the 12. So in that case, the energy is 5.526e-27 J, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the charge is 2e, but when calculating U, I should consider 2e for each, so it's (2e)^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (2e)^2.

(2e)^2 =4e². Correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using e=1.6 x10^-19 C, but perhaps the calculation uses e=1.602 x10^-19 C. Let me recompute with e=1.602e-19.

Compute (2e)^2: (2)^2 * (1.602e-19)^2 =4*(2.566e-38)=1.0264e-37.

So U_single = (8.988e9)*(1.0264e-37)/(2) = (8.988e9 *1.0264e-37)=9.23e-28. Divide by 2:4.615e-28.

Multiply by 12: 5.538e-27 J.

Still the same order of magnitude.

So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy when moving the 12 charges into place, considering the work done against the electric field created by the fixed charge and the other charges.

In that case, the total potential energy would be the sum of bringing each charge one by one, each time considering the potential due to all previously placed charges and the fixed charge.

But that would require knowing the order in which the charges are placed and the potential at each step.

But perhaps the minimum potential energy is achieved when the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes their mutual repulsion, but given that they are constrained to be at 2m from P, perhaps the potential energy is only due to the fixed charge.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, which is 5.5e-27 J. But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Coulomb's constant. Let me check: Coulomb's constant is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using e=1.6e-19 C. Let me try that.

Compute U_single again:

(2e)^2 =4*(1.6e-19)^2=4*(2.56e-38)=1.024e-37.

U_single = (8.988e9 *1.024e-37)/(2) = (9.215e-28)/2 =4.6075e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.529e-27.

Still the same.

Hmm.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 51 times larger than our calculated U_fixed. Why would that be?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges being at 2 meters from each other as well as from P. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between all pairs of the 13 charges, including the mutual ones. But without the arrangement, it's impossible to compute.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is 2m apart from each other, which is impossible for 12 points on a sphere. So perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at 2m from each other as well.

Wait, but that would mean each of the 12 charges is 2m apart from all others. That would require them to be on a regular dodecahedron or something, but even so, the mutual distances can't all be 2m. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges, multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the potential energy in terms of the sum of the potentials at each charge.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the sum over all pairs (i<j) of U_ij.

In this case, we have 13 charges, so 78 pairs.

But without knowing the arrangement, can we compute the sum? Only if all charges are the same distance apart, which isn't the case.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances vary. So the mutual potential energies are not zero, but their exact value depends on their arrangement, which isn't given.

So perhaps the problem is only considering the fixed charge's contribution and not the mutual ones. Thus, the total U is 5.5e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, which is 2.822e-26, but that would be 51 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me recheck.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 is 9.21e-28. Divide by 2:4.605e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.526e-27.

Wait, 5.526e-27 is 5.526 x 10^-27 J.

Looking at the options, none have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing potential energy with electric potential. No, because the question asks for energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as being fixed, and the 13th is moved into place, but that would involve the same calculation as before.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy when bringing the 13th charge to P would be zero because it's fixed. Then, each of the 12 charges is brought to 2m from P, but when placing each charge, the potential at P due to the fixed charge and the previously placed charges must be considered.

So the first charge is brought in, experiencing only the potential from the fixed charge. The potential at P due to the fixed charge is zero because it's the same charge. Wait, no, the fixed charge is 2e, so when placing the first moving charge, the potential at P due to the fixed charge is V = k*(2e)/(2m) = (8.988e9 * 2e)/ (2*2) [Wait, no, the distance is 2m, so V =k*(2e)/(2m).

Wait, let me compute the potential at P due to the fixed charge when placing a moving charge.

V (due to fixed) =k*(2e)/(2m) = (8.988e9 * 2e) / (2 * 2).

Wait, e=1.6e-19 C.

So V = (8.988e9 * 2 * 1.6e-19) / (2 * 2).

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 3.2e-19 = 2.876e-9.

Denominator:4.

So V=2.876e-9 /4=7.19e-10 V.

So the potential energy when placing the first moving charge is U1= q * V = 2e *7.19e-10.

Which is 2 *1.6e-19 *7.19e-10 = 2.299e-28 J.

Then, when placing the second moving charge, the potential at P is due to the fixed charge (7.19e-10 V) and the first moving charge (which is already in place). The potential due to the first moving charge at P is V1 =k*(2e)/(2m) = same as before, 7.19e-10 V.

So total potential V2 = 7.19e-10 +7.19e-10=14.38e-10 V.

So the potential energy for the second charge is U2 =2e *14.38e-10 =4.596e-28 J.

Similarly, the third charge would have V3=7.19e-10 *3 =21.57e-10 V.

So U3=2e *21.57e-10=6.89e-28 J.

Continuing this way, each charge n contributes a potential energy Un=2e * n *7.19e-10.

So the total potential energy U_total is the sum from n=1 to 12 of (2e *7.19e-10 *n).

Which is 2e *7.19e-10 * sum(n=1 to12 of n).

Sum(n=1 to12)= (12*13)/2 =78.

So U_total=2e *7.19e-10 *78.

Compute that:

2e =3.2e-19 C.

So U=3.2e-19 *7.19e-10 *78.

Compute 3.2e-19 *7.19e-10=2.299e-28.

Multiply by78:2.299e-28 *78=1.787e-26 J.

Wait, that's 1.787e-26 J, which is about 1.79e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 1.57 times higher.

Hmm.

But this approach calculates the potential energy as the work done to bring each charge into place, considering the potential from all previous charges and the fixed charge. So this gives a different result.

But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Because the problem states it's an isolated system, so perhaps the potential energy is considered as the sum of all pairs.

But in this approach, the U_total is 1.787e-26 J, which is about 1.79e-26 J. The closest option is B)2.822e-26, but that's still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in this approach.

Let me recompute:

Each charge when placed contributes 2e * (number of previous charges +1)* V_single.

Wait, no, because each charge placed adds to the potential. So for the nth charge, the potential is V = (n) * V_single, where V_single is k*(2e)/(2m).

So for n=1, V=1 * V_single.

For n=2, V=2 *V_single.

Up to n=12, V=12 *V_single.

So the potential energy for each charge is q * V = 2e * V.

So U_total = sum_{n=1 to12} (2e *n * V_single).

Which is 2e * V_single * sum(n=1 to12 n).

Sum(n=1→12)=78.

So U_total=2e * V_single *78.

V_single =k*(2e)/(2m)= (8.988e9) *2e / (2*2).

Wait, V_single = (8.988e9 *2e) / (2*2) = (8.988e9 *e)/(2).

Because (2e)/(2m)= e/(m * 2).

Wait, no:

V_single =k*(2e)/(2m) = (8.988e9 * 2e) / (2*2) = (8.988e9 *e) / 2.

Wait, e=1.6e-19 C.

So V_single= (8.988e9 *1.6e-19 ) /2 = (1.438e-9)/2=7.19e-10 V.

So U_total=2e *7.19e-10 *78.

Compute 2e =3.2e-19 C.

So 3.2e-19 *7.19e-10=2.299e-28.

Multiply by78:2.299e-28 *78=1.787e-26 J.

Hmm.

So according to this approach, U_total is approximately 1.79e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is about 1.57 times higher.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges has a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) relative to the fixed charge, and there are 12 such pairs. So U=12*(k*(4e²)/(2m)).

Which is the same as before, 5.5e-27 J.

But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as contributing (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) and also the 13th charge contributing to each of the 12, leading to 24 terms, but that doesn't make sense.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy of each pair between the fixed charge and the 12 others, but also between each of the 12 and the fixed charge again, leading to 24 terms. But that would be incorrect because each pair is counted once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as twice the calculated value, leading to 1.1e-26 J, which is close to option B.

But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

Compute U_single with k=9e9.

U_single =9e9*(4e²)/(2m).

4e²=1.024e-37.

So 9e9 *1.024e-37=9.216e-28.

Divide by 2:4.608e-28.

Multiply by12:5.5296e-27 J.

Still same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the value of e as 1.6e-19, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

Compute U_fixed precisely.

Each U_single: (8.988e9) * ( (2e)^2 ) /2m.

(2e)^2 =4e²=4*(1.6e-19)^2=4 *2.56e-38=1.024e-37.

So U_single =8.988e9 *1.024e-37 / 2.

Compute numerator:8.988e9 *1.024e-37=8.988*1.024=9.215, so 9.215e-28.

Divide by2:4.6075e-28.

Multiply by12:55.29e-28=5.529e-27 J.

So 5.529e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is (7.056/5.529)=1.277 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, the fixed charge is one, so the pairs are 12.

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as fixed and the 13th as moving, but that's the same calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each charge being placed at 2m from the fixed charge and 2m from each other. But that's impossible for 12 charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges to be 2m apart from each other, leading to each pair contributing U= k*(2e)^2/(2m).

So number of pairs among the 12 is 66.

So U_mutual=66 * (8.988e9 * (4e²) )/(2m).

Which would be 66 * (8.988e9 *1.024e-37)/(2*2).

Wait, no, the mutual distance is 2m, so denominator is 2.

So U_mutual=66 * (8.988e9 *4e²)/(2).

Compute 4e²=1.024e-37.

So 8.988e9 *1.024e-37=9.215e-28.

Divide by2:4.6075e-28.

Multiply by66:4.6075e-28 *66=3.040e-26 J.

So U_mutual=3.04e-26 J.

Adding U_fixed=5.53e-27 J, total U=3.04e-26 +5.53e-27=3.593e-26 J.

Which is 3.59e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is2.822e-26, which is close but not exact.

But this approach assumes that all mutual distances are 2m, which is impossible.

So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the electric potential energy of the system as the sum of all possible pairs, including the mutual ones between the 12 charges. But without knowing their positions, it's impossible to calculate accurately. However, in the absence of specific information, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energies are negligible or zero, leading to U=5.5e-27 J.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for potential energy between two charges but considering each pair twice, leading to double the value. So 11.05e-27 J, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential at the fixed charge, but that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as (13 choose 2) pairs, each with (2e)^2/(2m), but that's not correct because only 12 are at 2m from the fixed charge, the others are at varying distances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from each other and from the fixed charge, which would require a 13th dimension, which is impossible.

I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the U_fixed is approximately5.5e-27 J. But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, which is about 51 times higher than our calculation. But why?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each charge as 2e and the fixed charge as 2e, but counting the number of pairs as 13 instead of 12.

Wait, 13 charges, each interacting with the fixed charge, leading to 13 pairs. But the problem states that the 13th is fixed, so the 12 others are the ones moving.

So 12 pairs.

But if someone mistakenly uses 13 instead of 12, the U would be 5.5e-27 * (13/12)=5.95e-27 J, which is still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as fixed and the 13th as moving, but that would lead to the same calculation.

Wait, maybe I should look for a possible mistake in the exponent.

Wait, 8.988e9 *1.024e-37=9.215e-28.

Divide by2=4.6075e-28.

Multiply by12=5.529e-27.

Wait, but 5.529e-27 is 5.529 x10^-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option C is7.056e-27, which is 1.277 times higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation is considering each pair between the 12 charges and the fixed charge, but also between the fixed charge and each of the 12 twice. But that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for gravitational potential energy instead of electric, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of the electric potentials multiplied by the charges, but that's not correct.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around5.5e-27 J, but it's not present. So perhaps the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, which is 51 times higher, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fixed charge as 2e and each of the 12 as 2e, but the distance is 2 meters, leading to U= (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) multiplied by 12.

Which is exactly what I did earlier, leading to5.5e-27 J.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation one more time.

Compute (2e)^2: (2*1.6e-19)^2= (3.2e-19)^2=1.024e-37 C².

U_single =8.988e9 *1.024e-37 /2.

Compute 8.988e9 *1.024e-37: 8.988 *1.024=9.215, so 9.215e-28.

Divide by2:4.6075e-28.

Multiply by12:5.529e-27.

Yes, same result.

So I think the correct answer is not listed, but the closest is option C)7.056e-27, which is 1.277 times higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Compute U_single with k=9e9:

9e9 *1.024e-37=9.216e-28.

Divide by2:4.608e-28.

Multiply by12:5.5296e-27.

Still same as before.

Hmm.

Well, after all this, I think the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as fixed and the 13th as moving, leading to double the calculation. But that would give 11.05e-27 J, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges, assuming each pair is at a distance of 2m, leading to 66 pairs each contributing 4.607e-28 J.

So 66 *4.607e-28=3.04e-26 J.

Which is close to option B (2.822e-26), but not exact.

But that would imply that the mutual distances are all 2m, which is impossible for 12 charges on a sphere.

So perhaps the answer is option B)2.822e-26 J.

But I'm not fully confident. However, given the options, the most plausible answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy of the system, which includes the contributions from all pairs of charges. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to remain at a distance of \( r = 2 \, \mathrm{m} \) from \( P \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Potential Energy Between the Fixed Charge and the 12 Moving Charges**:
   The potential energy between two charges is given by:
   \[
   U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
   \]
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \). For each pair involving the fixed charge and one of the 12 moving charges:
   \[
   U_{\text{single}} = k \frac{(2e)^2}{r}
   \]
   Substituting \( (2e)^2 = 4e^2 = 4 \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 1.024 \times 10^{-37} \, \mathrm{C^2} \), \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \), and \( r = 2 \, \mathrm{m} \):
   \[
   U_{\text{single}} = \frac{8.988 \times 10^9 \times 1.024 \times 10^{-37}}{2} = 4.6075 \times 10^{-28} \, \mathrm{J}
   \]
   Since there are 12 such pairs:
   \[
   U_{\text{fixed}} = 12 \times U_{\text{single}} = 12 \times 4.6075 \times 10^{-28} = 5.529 \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{J}
   \]

2. **Potential Energy Between the 12 Moving Charges**:
   The 12 moving charges are constrained at \( 2 \, \mathrm{m} \) from \( P \), but their mutual distances are not specified. Assuming the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the total potential energy, the mutual potential energies are positive and depend on the distances between the charges. However, without explicit information about their arrangement, the mutual potential energies cannot be calculated precisely. This complicates the total energy calculation.

3. **Total Potential Energy**:
   The total potential energy of the system includes contributions from both the fixed charge and the 12 moving charges. However, the problem does not provide sufficient details about the mutual distances between the 12 charges, making it impossible to compute their exact contributions.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J} \))**: This value is significantly larger than the calculated \( U_{\text{fixed}} \) and does not align with the problem's constraints.
- **Option B (\( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J} \))**: This value is approximately 51 times larger than \( U_{\text{fixed}} \). It might account for additional contributions, such as mutual potential energies between the 12 charges, but it is not explicitly justified by the given data.
- **Option C (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{J} \))**: This value is about 1.277 times larger than \( U_{\text{fixed}} \). It could represent an approximation that includes some mutual potential energies, but it is still not consistent with the problem's setup.
- **Option D (\( 122.330 \, \mathrm{J} \))**: This value is orders of magnitude larger than the calculated \( U_{\text{fixed}} \) and is not plausible.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible answer is **Option B (\( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J} \))**, as it is the closest to the calculated \( U_{\text{fixed}} \) when accounting for potential additional contributions, such as mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. However, the exact reasoning for this value is unclear due to the lack of information about the mutual distances.

Answer: B
