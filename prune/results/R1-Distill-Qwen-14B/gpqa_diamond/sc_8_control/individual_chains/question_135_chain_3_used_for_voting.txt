Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try my best.

The question says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by a certain Lagrangian. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. We need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson into fermions depends on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions involved. The general rule is that the boson must have enough mass to produce the fermion pair. Specifically, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion, because each fermion will carry away some energy, and they need to have enough to exist as real particles.

Looking at the Lagrangian provided: L(y) = -λf f_bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh, I think it's supposed to be something like L = -λ (some fermion field) times (v + X) times (another fermion field). Maybe it's the Yukawa interaction term. So, the interaction term would be something like λ ψ_f ψ_f (v + X), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact form. But I think the key here is that the boson X couples to fermions, so X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the possible decay products of X would be any fermion pair where the sum of the fermion masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, actually, since each fermion has a rest mass, the boson X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion for it to decay into that pair. Because in rest frame, the fermions would each have mass m, so 2m ≤ M_X.

What's the mass of X? It's 6 GeV. So let's list all the possible fermions that have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by two is 3 GeV.

Wait, but what are the masses of the standard model fermions?

Let me think. The up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV, which is much less than a GeV. So 6 GeV is way more than enough for them. Then, the strange quark is about 100 MeV, which is also much less. The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV. So twice that is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar.

The bottom quark is heavier. Its mass is around 4.5 GeV. So twice that is 9 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9, it can't decay into b b-bar. Because 6 < 9. So the decay into b quarks is not allowed. Similarly, the top quark is way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so no way X can decay into t t-bar.

What about leptons? The electron is about 0.5 MeV, so way under. The muon is around 0.1 GeV (105.7 MeV), so 2 * 0.1 is 0.2 GeV, which is much less than 6. So X can decay into mu+ mu-.

Tau lepton is about 1.78 GeV. So twice that is 3.56 GeV. Is 3.56 less than 6? Yes, so X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Wait, but wait. The tau is about 1.77 GeV, so 2 * 1.77 is 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6. So yes, decay into tau pairs is allowed.

What about the other charged leptons? Like the electron and muon, which are lighter, so their pairs are allowed.

What about neutrinos? Well, in the Lagrangian given, the interaction is with fermions, but the term is written as f and psi_f. Hmm, but neutrinos are leptons, but in the Standard Model, neutrinos are left-handed and don't have right-handed counterparts (except in some extensions like the seesaw mechanism). So if the interaction is with a Dirac fermion, then the neutrino can't be produced because it's only left-handed. But wait, I think the coupling would typically involve the Dirac mass term, which involves both left and right-handed components. But if the neutrino is left-handed and doesn't have a right-handed counterpart, it can't have mass, and thus, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are massless. So the X boson can't decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs because that would require the neutrino to have a mass, which in the SM they don't. So X can't decay into neutrinos.

Wait, but in the problem, the options don't include neutrinos, so that's probably not an issue here. So looking at the options, all of them are about charged leptons and quarks.

So which fermions are allowed?

Let me list the possible fermions and their masses:

- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV. Definitely allowed.
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV. Allowed.
- Tau (tau): ~1.77 GeV. Allowed as 3.54 GeV <6 GeV.
- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV. Allowed.
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV. Allowed.
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV. Allowed.
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV. Allowed (twice is 2.54 GeV <6).
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV. 2*4.7=9.4 GeV>6 → Not allowed.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV. Not allowed.

So the possible fermion pairs that X can decay into are any pairs of (u, u-bar), (d, d-bar), (s, s-bar), (c, c-bar), (e, e-bar), (mu, mu-bar), (tau, tau-bar). So all these pairs are allowed except for those involving b or t quarks.

Wait, but wait: in the options, some of them include b and t, others don't. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But since X is 6 GeV, and b has a mass around 4.5 GeV, 2*4.5=9 GeV. 6<9, so this decay is not allowed. So option A is incorrect because it includes b b-bar.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, let me count: option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed except for b and t. So option B's decay channels are allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way beyond, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed, so D is incorrect.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait a moment. The problem states that the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, which I think is the Yukawa coupling. So the coupling could depend on the type of fermion. For example, in the Standard Model, the Yukawa coupling for the Higgs to fermions depends on the fermion mass. But in this problem, perhaps the coupling is the same for all fermions, or maybe it's allowed for all that have a Dirac mass.

But the problem only asks about kinematical (mass) constraints, not about the actual strength of the interaction. So regardless of the coupling strength, which can influence whether the decay is possible at a certain rate, the question is about whether it's kinematically allowed.

So the possible decays are for fermion pairs where the sum of their masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. As we determined, that means any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV can be produced.

Looking back, so the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. So the possible decay products are any of the pairs from these.

So the correct options would include all these except for b and t.

Looking again at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed ones. So option B is correct.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: correct.

Option C: includes t, which is not allowed. So C is wrong.

Option D: includes b, which is wrong.

So the answer must be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The decay products must satisfy the condition that the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fermion Masses and Kinematic Constraints**:
   - The masses of Standard Model fermions are as follows:
     - \( e \) (electron): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
     - \( \mu \) (muon): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
     - \( \tau \) (tau lepton): \( \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \)
     - \( u \) (up quark): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \)
     - \( d \) (down quark): \( \sim 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
     - \( s \) (strange quark): \( \sim 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \)
     - \( c \) (charm quark): \( \sim 1.27 \, \text{GeV} \)
     - \( b \) (bottom quark): \( \sim 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)
     - \( t \) (top quark): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)
   - For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), the condition \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) must hold. This allows decays into \( e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \), but excludes \( b\bar{b} \) and \( t\bar{t} \) because their masses are too large.

2. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), as given in **Option B**.
