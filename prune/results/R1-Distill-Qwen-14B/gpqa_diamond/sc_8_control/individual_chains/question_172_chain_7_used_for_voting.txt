Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let's see what the question says. Oh right, it's about iron atoms in two stars and their energy levels. So, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is asking which equation correctly relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) holds.

Wait, LTE means that the gas in the photosphere behaves like a blackbody at temperature T. So, I think I'm supposed to use the Boltzmann distribution here. Because the population of energy levels in thermal equilibrium is given by the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant. So, if I have two states, say E1 and E2, with E1 higher than E2, then the ratio is (n2)/(n1) = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) )

But wait, in this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote this as delta E = E2 - E1. Wait, no, actually, the energy levels are specific, so if the higher energy state is E_upper and lower is E_lower, then delta E = E_upper - E_lower.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, I think that means the population of the higher energy level (excited state) in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, n1_upper / n1_lower = [some function of T1], and similarly for star_2.

Wait, but to get the ratio between the two stars, I should set up the ratios for each and then take the ratio of those.

Let me define: For star_1, the population ratio is (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = exp( -delta E/(k*T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, it's (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = exp( -delta E/(k*T2) )

The problem states that (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower). Wait, no. Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, I think that the ratio n_upper / n_lower is higher in star_1. So, the population of the upper level is higher relative to the lower level, which would mean that the temperature is higher because higher temperatures make the exponential term larger.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me get this straight: the population of the upper level compared to the lower level is higher in star_1. So, n1_upper /n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower). Or maybe it's twice as excited as the other, so for the same lower level, n_upper is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm. So, perhaps it's that the upper level population in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper.

But wait, we're considering the same energy levels in both stars. So, the ratio for each star would be n_upper/n_lower. Let me denote (n_upper)/(n_lower) as N1 for star 1, and N2 for star 2.

So, N1 = exp(-delta E/(k T1)), and N2 = exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

The problem states that N1 = 2 * N2. Because star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's.

So, N1 = 2 N2.

Substituting, exp(-delta E/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

Hmm, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

ln(exp(-delta E/(k T1))) = ln(2 exp(-delta E/(k T2)))

Which simplifies to:

- delta E/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-delta E)/(k T2)

Let me rearrange terms.

delta E/(k T1) = (delta E)/(k T2) - ln(2)

Hmm, wait, that's:

delta E/(k T1) = (delta E)/(k T2) - ln(2)

Let me subtract (delta E)/(k T2) from both sides:

delta E/(k T1) - delta E/(k T2) = - ln(2)

Factor out delta E/(k):

(delta E)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] = - ln(2)

Wait, that's:

(delta E)/(k) [ (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ] = - ln(2)

Wait, because (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2).

So:

(delta E)/(k) * (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) = - ln(2)

Multiply both sides by (T1 T2)/(delta E/k) ) and get:

(T2 - T1) = [ - ln(2) * (T1 T2) (k) ) ] / (delta E)

Wait, perhaps I should rearrange the earlier equation differently.

Wait, from delta E/(k T1) - delta E/(k T2) = - ln(2)

We can factor delta E/(k):

delta E/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) = - ln(2)

Which can be written as:

delta E/(k) ( (T2 - T1) ) / (T1 T2) ) = - ln(2)

Multiply both sides by (T1 T2)/(delta E/(k)) )

(T2 - T1) = [ - ln(2) * T1 T2 * k ) ] / delta E

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write this as:

(T2 - T1) = [ (k ln2) * T1 T2 ) ] / delta E

But let me think about the given delta E. The problem states it's approximately 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So, k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So, delta E here is equal to k.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me calculate delta E: it's 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k, the Boltzmann constant. Because k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, delta E = k.

So, substituting delta E = k into the equation:

(T2 - T1) = [ (k ln2) * T1 T2 ) ] / delta E

But since delta E = k, this becomes:

(T2 - T1) = [ (k ln2) * T1 T2 ) ] / k

The k's cancel out, and we get:

(T2 - T1) = ln(2) * T1 T2

Wait, but wait, earlier equation was:

delta E/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = - ln(2)

Wait, let me plug delta E = k into that:

k/(k) [ (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ] = - ln(2)

Which simplifies to:

[ (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ] = - ln(2)

But wait, that would mean:

(T2 - T1) = - ln(2) * T1 T2

Which can be rewritten as:

T1 - T2 = ln(2) * T1 T2

Because moving terms around:

(T2 - T1) = - ln(2) T1 T2 â†’ T1 - T2 = ln(2) T1 T2

So, T1 - T2 = ln(2) T1 T2

Hmm. Let's see. Let me write that as:

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 * T2

So, if I divide both sides by (T1 T2):

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is exactly this equation.

So, the correct equation is option D.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the populations of the upper and lower energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature of the system.

For star_1 and star_2, let the population ratios be \( N_1 = \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \) for star_1 and \( N_2 = \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \) for star_2. The problem states that \( N_1 = 2N_2 \), meaning the ratio of the upper to lower energy levels in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Substituting the Boltzmann distribution for each star:

\[
N_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad N_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Given \( N_1 = 2N_2 \), we have:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E/k \):

\[
\Delta E/k \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = -\ln(2).
\]

Simplify \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \) as \( \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1T_2} \):

\[
\Delta E/k \cdot \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1T_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

The problem states \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which is equal to \( k \) (Boltzmann's constant). Substituting \( \Delta E = k \):

\[
\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1T_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Rearranging:

\[
T_1 - T_2 = \ln(2) \cdot T_1T_2.
\]

Dividing both sides by \( T_1T_2 \):

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the equation in option D. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
