Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the confocal microscope after crossing the mouse model with SOX10-Cre mice. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me recap what I know from the question. There's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector used here. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. So the vector should allow both ligand and receptor to be expressed from the same transcript but translated separately because of the IRES element.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think, so that should drive expression of the ligand. The receptor is after the IRES, which allows internal ribosome entry, so the ribosome can translate the receptor without needing a new round of transcription. 

Looking at the stops: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is lox2272-stop-lox2272. These are stop cassettes, meaning that without Cre, the stop codon is in place, preventing expression of the downstream fluorescent proteins. But when Cre is present, it should recombine and remove the stop, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

So when the Cre is introduced, it should delete the stop cassettes. The ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP. The question says that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they cross with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I believe. So the Cre should be active in neural crest derivatives, like astrocytes perhaps.

The problem is that there's no green signal, which is the eGFP. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. What could go wrong?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but the question is about expression of the proteins themselves. If they're expressed in different cells, maybe the eGFP isn't present in the cells being visualized. But the setup is that the Cre is under a promoter active in certain cells (like SOX10), so both ligand and receptor should be expressed in the same cells, so maybe this isn't the issue. Or perhaps the vector isn't being correctly expressed in the intended cells.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't getting to the cell surface or is retained, maybe it's not fluorescent. But why would the eGFP not traffic properly? The question says the vector is made correctly, but perhaps the eGFP is not being properly translated or is part of a larger construct that doesn't traffic. Or maybe some mutation in the eGFP coding sequence? But the question doesn't mention any issues with the construct design beyond the stop cassettes.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so it should be expressed regardless of enhancers. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, so it's dependent on the same promoter as the ligand. Wait, the IRES is part of the 3' UTR of the ligand's mRNA, allowing for translation of the receptor. So both are under the CBA promoter. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the entire construct isn't expressed. But the question says that the vector was transfected into primary astrocytes and they used Western blot. So in vitro, the expression should have worked. Otherwise, they wouldn't have antibodies. Wait, but the issue is in the mice. So maybe in the mouse, the construct isn't being properly expressed? Hmm, but the vector design has the right promoters.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, that's a possibility. If the stop cassette is not correctly removed, the eGFP might not be expressed. Wait, but the stop is in the loxP cassette. So if the Cre isn't active, the stop remains. But the mouse was crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in the right cells. So in the cells where Cre is active, the lox2272 should be cut, and the stop removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed. But if the loxP and lox2272 are different, maybe the recombination doesn't happen? Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different sites. Cre can recognize loxP, but lox2272 is a variant. Oh, right, I remember that lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but has a different recombination outcome. Maybe the lox2272 site isn't being recognized, so the stop isn't removed. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop remains.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic vector with loxP stops for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor. If the Cre is active, it should only remove the loxP stops if they're flanked by loxP sites. Wait, no, the vector has ligand ORF followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP. So when Cre is present, it should delete the loxP-stop-loxP, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, for the receptor and eGFP, the lox2272 sites would be cut, but wait, I'm not sure if Cre can target lox2272. Because Cre is specific for loxP sites. Lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre, but they have different recombination outcomes. So in that case, the lox2272 sites would be cut, allowing the eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but if the vector uses loxP in one stop cassette and lox2272 in the other, perhaps only one of them gets recombined. So the ligand would be expressed because loxP is used, and the receptor-eGFP would require lox2272 recombination. But if the Cre in the mouse can't recognize lox2272, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. Because for Cre to remove a stop cassette, the lox sites need to flank the stop and be in the correct orientation. If they're in the reverse direction, the stop won't be removed. But the question says that the ligand's stop is in a loxP cassette, and the receptor's is in lox2272. If the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, then the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Wait, the SOX10-Cre is a transgenic mouse that expresses Cre under the control of SOX10. SOX10 is active in neural crest cells and their derivatives. So in the offspring, Cre is expressed in those cells, leading to recombination. But if the vector uses lox2272, which is a variant, perhaps the Cre can't recognize it. Because standard Cre doesn't cut lox2272 efficiently. Wait, I think lox2272 is a mutant version of the loxP site that has a different recombination efficiency and requires Cre with certain mutations to recombine. Alternatively, conventional Cre can recognize lox2272 but with lower efficiency, or perhaps not at all. 

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. From what I remember, lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site where the 3' site is altered. Cre can still recognize and cut these sites, but the recombination is directional. So in a bicistronic vector, the lox sites must be properly arranged. For a stop cassette to be removed, the lox sites should flank the stop in the same orientation. So if the vector has a lox2272 site before the stop and another after, and the right orientation, then Cre would cut between them, removing the stop.

But if the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites because it's not compatible, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the mouse, after crossing with SOX10-Cre, only the loxP sites are cut (if the ligand's stop is in loxP), but the lox2272 sites aren't cut, so the receptor and eGFP remain under the stop. Hence, no eGFP expression, so no green signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the vectors used have lox sites that are in the opposite orientation. So when Cre is introduced, the lox sites are recombined, but the stop remains because the lox sites were in the wrong order. But the question's vector description doesn't mention the orientation, so perhaps I shouldn't assume that's the problem.

Another possibility: the stop cassettes are in the wrong position. For example, if the lox sites don't correctly bracket the stop codon, recombination won't delete it. But the setup suggests they do.

Wait, but the construct is in a mouse model. The Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes. If the vector was working in vitro, but not in the mice, perhaps the issue is that the Cre isn't active in the right cells, or the expression isn't happening. But the question says the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, so Cre should be active in neural crest cells, which include astrocytes perhaps.

Hmm. Another angle: the eGFP is not being translated, perhaps due to a frameshift. The option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So perhaps the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed, so the eGFP isn't being expressed because the coding sequence is messed up. Wait, but the stop cassette is in between the receptor and eGFP. If the stop remains, the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would the eGFP not be in frame?

Alternatively, if the stop cassette is removed but the reading frame is messed up. For example, if the lox sites are in frame, their removal might cause a frameshift. But in this case, the lox sites are at the end of the receptor ORF and the beginning of eGFP. So if the lox sites are removed, the receptor is correctly in frame, and the eGFP is correctly added after.

Wait, but if the stop cassette has a stop codon and then the lox sites, removing them would allow the receptor ORF to continue into the eGFP. But if the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor, then it should be fine.

Another possibility: the vector's design leads to the eGFP being out of frame. Suppose the receptor's stop is followed by a stop cassette, but when it's removed, the eGFP is not in frame. So the eGFP's start codon is in a different frame, leading to no expression. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The question says the ligand is at 5' and receptor at 3', with stops in between. So for the receptor and eGFP, the stop is between them. When Cre recombines, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a single ORF? No, wait. The IRES is after the ligand, so the receptor is a separate ORF driven by the IRES. So the ligand is first, then IRES, then receptor. So the two ORFs are independent.

Wait, no. Wait, in a bicistronic vector, you have a single transcript with two ORFs. The first ORF is the ligand, then the IRES, then the receptor. So the IRES allows the ribosome to translate the receptor. So the receptor is a separate ORF. So the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor ORF, meaning that the eGFP is in frame with the receptor? Or is it a separate ORF? Hmm, perhaps the vector is designed such that the receptor is in frame with eGFP, but that's unclear.

Wait, the question says the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the receptor's coding sequence is followed by eGFP. So if the stop cassette is in between, then when Cre deletes the stop, the receptor and eGFP would be expressed as a single polyprotein? Or is it a separate ORF?

Wait, in the vector description, the ligand is at 5' with mCherry, but the ligand and mCherry are in the same ORF because the stop is in a cassette. Similarly, the receptor is at 3' with eGFP, so same ORF. So the vector is:

ligand ORF (with stop in loxP cassette) fused to mCherry; then IRES, then receptor ORF (with stop in lox2272 cassette) fused to eGFP.

So when Cre cuts the lox sites, the ligand and mCherry are expressed as a single ORF, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed as another single ORF.

So for the eGFP to be expressed, the lox2272 sites must be cut, removing the stop. If the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So why aren't the lox2272 sites being cut? Because perhaps the Cre isn't recognizing them.

Wait, I thought that the standard Cre recognizes loxP sites, and lox2272 is a variant that requires a different Cre (like Dre or another recombinase). Or maybe the Cre used here can't recognize lox2272, so the stop isn't removed. 

But I'm not entirely certain about this. Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses loxP sites for both, but the question says the ligand has loxP and the receptor has lox2272. So if the Cre can't recognize lox2272, then the receptor's stop isn't removed.

So when the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which provides Cre, only the loxP sites are cut, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 sites are not cut, so the receptor and eGFP remain under the stop, so no eGFP.

That would explain why the green signal (eGFP) isn't observed. So the correct answer would be that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut because the Cre doesn't recognize them, meaning the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, that's about the reading frame. If the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is removed but the frame is wrong, the eGFP would be expressed as part of a frame-shifted product, which might not fluoresce. But the problem is that the expression isn't happening at all.

Alternatively, the issue is that the lox2272 isn't being cut, so the stop remains.

So the most likely reason is that the Cre isn't able to recognize the lox2272 sites, hence the eGFP isn't expressed. But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. The options are A to D.

Option C is about the enhancer being missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which has its own promoter, so probably not.

Option D is about the frame. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed, which is what's happening. But if the stop isn't removed because the lox sites aren't cut, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, if they're arranged in a way that prevents recombination. But the question doesn't give that as an option.

Wait, another thought: the loxP and lox2272 sites are different. So the vector has a loxP site flanking the ligand's stop, and a lox2272 site flanking the receptor's stop. When Cre is introduced, it can only cut the loxP sites, not the lox2272. So the ligand's stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop isn't removed because Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. So the eGFP isn't expressed. That would mean the green signal isn't seen.

So the reason is that the lox sites are different, and the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites. But none of the options directly state that. So looking back at the options, D is about the receptor and eGFP being out of frame. But if the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed, regardless of the frame. So perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, but that's not an option listed. So the closest option is B, which suggests that the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. But why would it be stuck? That's about protein trafficking, not expression.

Wait, unless the eGFP is part of the same construct as the receptor, and if the receptor isn't correctly processed, it remains in the Golgi. But why? Maybe the receptor's signal peptide is missing, or there's a mutation in the protein causing it to misfold. But the question doesn't suggest any issues with the vector design except the stop cassettes.

Hmm. Maybe the real issue is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Since none of the options directly address this, perhaps the answer is D. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another thought: the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272, but if the Cre can't cut lox2272, then the stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut, hence eGFP isn't expressed. But none of the options say that. The options are more about other possibilities.

Looking again at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is removed, and the eGFP is in frame, it would be expressed. So if the stop remains, then no expression. But the question is about why the green isn't observed. The Western blot would detect the eGFP, but in the mouse model, the expression is knocked out.

Wait, but in the mouse, the construct is homozygous. When they use SOX10-Cre, which is a transgenic mouse line, it's possible that the Cre isn't active in the cells being analyzed. So perhaps the Cre isn't expressed in the right cells, so the stop remains. But the question says they crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest derivatives, so the Cre should be active in those cells.

Wait, another possible issue: the vector may have been inserted into a region that doesn't allow proper expression. But the question doesn't suggest that.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working in the specific cell type. IRES elements can be cell-type specific. If the IRES isn't functional in the cells, the receptor won't be expressed. But the ligand would be expressed, since it's under the CBA promoter. But the antibodies were raised against overexpressed proteins, so maybe the expression is cell-type dependent.

Wait, but the Western blot was done on transfected primary astrocytes. So in vitro, the construct works. So the stop cassettes are successfully removed in those cells, leading to expression. That suggests that the lox sites are correctly cut in vitro.

But in the mice, perhaps the expression isn't happening because the Cre isn't active in the cells or the vector isn't properly inserted. But the question states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background.

Hmm, maybe the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame. Let's think: the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP. When the stop is removed (if the lox2272 is cut), the receptor and eGFP are in frame. If the lox2272 isn't cut, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. But the reason the lox2272 isn't cut is because Cre can't recognize it. But this isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector design has the eGFP in the same frame only if the stop is removed correctly. If the stop isn't removed, the frame is broken. But that's not the case here; the presence of the stop would prevent eGFP from being expressed, regardless of frame.

I think the most plausible explanation, given the options, is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Since none of the options directly address this, perhaps the intended answer is D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not sure.

Wait another thought: the vector might have the ligand in frame with mCherry, and the receptor in frame with eGFP. But if the lox2272 sites aren't cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed, which is due to the stop not being removed. The possible reasons for that are either the Cre isn't active, or the lox sites aren't compatible.

Since the mouse is homozygous and crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in the right cells, the problem might be that the lox sites are incompatible. So the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, hence the stop remains. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the vector uses the same loxP for both stop cassettes. Then, if only one stop is cut, the other remains. But the question says that the ligand's stop is in loxP and the receptor's in lox2272.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the options again.

Option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed, but the reason could be the frame. But I don't think so; if the stop remains, the eGFP isn't translated at all.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed correctly. But how likely is that?

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the eGFP in a different reading frame, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly expressed. But that would be a design issue, not a Cre issue.

But the main issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed. So the most likely reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut, so the stop remains. Since that isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D, or option B.

Wait, another possibility: the eGFP is not being correctly trafficked. If the eGFP is a C-terminal tag on the receptor, and the receptor is retained in the ER or Golgi, then the eGFP wouldn't be seen on the surface, but would be present inside the cell. However, in the Western blot, they would detect the eGFP if it's expressed, regardless of localization. Since the question says that the antibodies were raised against overexpressed proteins, and the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, it seems that the eGFP is expressed in vitro. But in the mice, perhaps the eGFP isn't properly localized.

Wait, but the question's issue is that in the mouse, the eGFP isn't observed. So perhaps the eGFP is expressed but not on the cell surface. But the Western blot would still detect it, but perhaps not in the right compartment. But the question says that the Western blot was done after transfection to primary astrocytes, which shows that the proteins are expressed. So the problem isn't expression but detection in the mouse model.

Wait, but in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. Hence, no eGFP. So the issue is that the stop isn't removed, and the reason is that the lox2272 isn't being cut. But since none of the options state that, perhaps the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the same orientation, and the recombination deletes the region between them. So if the lox2272 sites are in the same direction, when Cre cuts, the stop is removed, and the eGFP is expressed. But if the orientation is wrong, the stop remains.

Wait, the vector has the receptor followed by a stop cassette (lox2272). So the construct would be:

ligand [stop cassette (loxP)] mCherry | IRES | receptor [stop cassette (lox2272)] eGFP

When Cre is introduced, the loxP sites are cut, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 sites would be cut, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

If the lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation, the stop isn't removed. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't address the orientation of the lox sites.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is A. But why? If the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship, meaning they're expressed by different cells, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed in the same cells as the ligand. But if the construct is designed to express both in the same cell, and the Cre is active in those cells, then why isn't the eGFP expressed?

Wait, perhaps the vector is designed so that the ligand and receptor are co-expressed, but if they're in a paracrine relationship, the ligand is secreted, and the receptor is on the surface of a different cell. But that's about their function, not their expression.

But the question says that the ligand-receptor pair is expressed in neural crest cells, so they should be expressed in the same cells. Therefore, the absence of eGFP is likely due to the stop not being removed, so the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut.

Since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses the same loxP for both stops, and only one gets cut. But the question says different lox sites.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the loxP and lox2272 sites are in the same orientation, so the Cre can't cut both. Or perhaps the lox sites are arranged in a way that leads to the removal of the entire region between them, which includes the receptor and eGFP. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette isn't properly positioned. For example, the stop codon is within the lox site, so even if the site is cut, the ORF isn't correctly restored.

I think I'm going around in circles. Let's try to think of each option again.

Option A: Ligand and receptor in paracrine. Unlikely because they're expressed in the same cells.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. Possible if the protein isn't trafficked, but why would that happen?

Option C: Enhancer missing. Unlikely, as the ligand has a strong promoter.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the stop isn't removed, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem could be that the stop isn't removed, leading to no eGFP. But why isn't the stop removed? Because the lox2272 isn't cut by Cre.

But since none of the options directly address that, the best fit is option D. Or perhaps the correct answer is that the lox2272 sites aren't cut, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame because the stop wasn't removed. But if the stop is present, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed regardless.

Hmm. I'm really not sure. Given the options, I'll have to make a choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is downstream of an IRES element. Stop cassettes (loxP for the ligand and lox2272 for the receptor) are present, which should be removed by Cre to allow expression of the fluorescent proteins. The mouse model is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, but no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor are expressed in different cells, but the vector design and SOX10-Cre activation in neural crest derivatives imply that both should be expressed in the same cells. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were mislocalized or retained in the Golgi, it might not fluoresce. However, the Western blot shows successful expression of the proteins in vitro, indicating that the issue is not with protein trafficking or expression but rather with the removal of the stop cassette.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which should drive its expression independently of enhancers. The receptor is downstream of an IRES, which allows internal ribosome entry. The issue is not with the promoter or enhancer but with the removal of the stop cassette.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the stop cassette is not removed, the eGFP would not be expressed at all, regardless of the reading frame. However, the question does not provide evidence that the stop cassette was removed incorrectly or that the eGFP is out of frame. The lack of eGFP expression is more likely due to the stop cassette remaining intact, which could be explained by the Cre not recognizing the lox2272 sites.  

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the lox2272 sites are not being cut by Cre, leaving the stop cassette intact and preventing eGFP expression. However, none of the options explicitly address this issue. Among the given options, **Option D** ("the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame") is the closest fit, as it indirectly relates to the failure of proper expression.  

Answer: D
