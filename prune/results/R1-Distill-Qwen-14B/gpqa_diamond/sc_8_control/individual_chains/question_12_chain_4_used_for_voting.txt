Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) plus a neutrino. The masses given are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the energy and momentum have to be conserved. 

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, almost zero. So I think I can approximate the neutrino's mass as zero for this calculation. That should simplify things a bit.

So, the reaction is π+ → μ+ + ν. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. That means p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its momentum p_nu is just E_nu (since for massless particles, E = pc). 

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion, because it's stationary. So the total energy after decay should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. 

The energy of each particle is their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. So for the muon, E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. For the neutrino, E_nu = K_nu (since its rest mass is zero). 

So the conservation of energy equation becomes:
m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

But wait, momentum must also be conserved. The momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p_mu = p_nu. 

Since p = gamma m v, but for the muon, it's moving, so I can write the momentum in terms of its kinetic energy. Alternatively, I can use the relation E² = (pc)² + (m c²)² for each particle.

Let me denote E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), and E_nu = p c. Because for the neutrino, E = pc.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c.

And this must equal the rest energy of the pion: m_pi c².

So the equation is:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c².

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let's let x = p c. Then the equation becomes:

sqrt( x² + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + x = m_pi c².

Subtracting x from both sides: sqrt(x² + m_mu² c^4 ) = (m_pi c² - x).

Then square both sides:

x² + m_mu² c^4 = (m_pi c² - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (m_pi c²)^2 - 2 m_pi c² x + x².

So, left side: x² + m_mu² c^4 = m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides: m_mu² c^4 = m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x.

Rearranging terms to solve for x:

2 m_pi c² x = m_pi² c^4 - m_mu² c^4.

Factor out c^4 on the right: 2 m_pi c^2 x = c^4 (m_pi² - m_mu²).

Divide both sides by c^2:

2 m_pi x = c² (m_pi² - m_mu²).

Wait, let me check units here. Hmm, maybe it's better to work in units where c=1 to simplify. Because in particle physics, they often use natural units where c=1, so energies and masses are in MeV, and momentum is in MeV/c, but when c=1, momentum is in MeV. So maybe that's where I should be going.

Let me redo the equations with c=1.

The equation becomes:

sqrt( x^2 + m_mu^2 ) + x = m_pi.

Where x is the momentum of the muon (since p_nu = x, and E_nu = x). Wait, actually, wait, in natural units, E_nu = p_nu c, but c=1, so E_nu = p_nu.

So, the setup is correct.

So, sqrt( x^2 + m_mu^2 ) + x = m_pi.

Let me rearrange:

sqrt(x² + m_mu²) = m_pi - x.

Square both sides:

x² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x + x².

Cancel x² on both sides: m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x.

Move terms:

2 m_pi x = m_pi² - m_mu².

So,

x = [ m_pi² - m_mu² ] / (2 m_pi )

Wait, that's a neat result! So the momentum of the muon is x = (m_pi² - m_mu²)/(2 m_pi).

Once I have x, I can find the energy of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. The masses are m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So,

x = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / (2 * 139.6 )

Let me compute that numerator first.

139.6 squared is approximately 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute that:

139^2 is 19321. 0.6^2 is 0.36. But 139.6 is 139 + 0.6, so (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.

So,

(139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*(139)*(0.6) + (0.6)^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19321 + 166.8 is 19487.8, plus 0.36 is 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7 squared: let's compute 100^2 = 10,000, 5.7^2 = 32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140.

So, 105.7^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10,000 + 1,140 +32.49= 11,172.49.

So the numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then denominator is 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So x= 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2:

279.2 * 29 is 8096.8 (since 279 *30=8370, so 29 would be 8096.8). 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

So 29 + (218.87 /279.2) ≈ 29 + 0.782 ≈ 29.782.

So x ≈ 29.78 MeV. Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the pion's mass is about 140 MeV, and if the muon is about 105 MeV, subtracting, the neutrino would carry away some momentum.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I should use a calculator approach.

Compute numerator: 139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

Difference: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

8315.67 / 279.2 = let's compute.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2=8376-279.2=8096.8.

So 29 gives 8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So total x≈29.782 MeV. Hmm, but wait, the mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and if the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, then the available kinetic energy is (139.6 -105.7)=33.9 MeV. So the muon can't have a momentum that's more than this, but 29.78 is less than 33.9, so that's acceptable.

Wait, but the muon's energy is given by sqrt( x^2 + m_mu^2 ). So E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let me calculate that: 29.78^2 = approx 887. Let's compute exactly: 30^2=900, so 29.78 is about 29.78^2 = (30 - 0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2=900 -13.2 +0.0484= 886.8484.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So sum is 886.8484 + 11172.49 = 12059.3384.

sqrt(12059.3384) is approx 109.81 MeV. Wait, but that would mean E_mu is about 109.8 MeV. But the muon's rest mass is 105.7, so K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² =109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV. Hmm, that seems low. But let's proceed.

The neutrino's energy is x, which is 29.78 MeV. So the kinetic energy of the muon is about 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the options are for the KEs of the product particles. Let me look at the options.

Option C says 3.52 MeV and 20.8 MeV. Hmm, no. Option D is 4.12 and 29.8. So that's close to what I'm getting. So that would be option D.

But wait, I'm getting K_mu ≈4.1 MeV, and K_nu ≈29.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, I thought that the neutrino's energy is x, which is 29.78 MeV, and the muon's KE is E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 MeV - 105.7 MeV =4.1 MeV. So the KEs would be 4.1 and 29.8.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So that's our answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for any possible mistakes. Because if I made a mistake in the momentum calculation, everything else would be off.

Wait, so x= (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi).

Plugging in the numbers:

m_pi^2 = (139.6)^2 =19488.16.

m_mu^2= (105.7)^2=11172.49.

Difference:19488.16 -11172.49= 8315.67.

Divide by (2 *139.6)=279.2.

8315.67/279.2= let me compute it more accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2=8096.8.

8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

218.87 /279.2 = 0.782.

So x=29.782 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( x^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.782)^2 + (105.7)^2 ).

29.782^2 = approx 29.78^2 = 886.8484.

105.7^2=11172.49.

Adding: 886.8484 +11172.49=12059.3384.

sqrt(12059.3384) = approx 109.81 MeV.

So K_mu=109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

Which rounds to about 4.12 MeV, matching option D.

And the neutrino's KE is x=29.78 MeV, which is 29.8 MeV when rounded to one decimal.

So option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So the answer should be D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino's mass is approximated as zero.

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the muon (\(p_{\mu}\)) and the neutrino (\(p_{\nu}\)) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:
\[
p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
\]

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi^+} c^2.
\]
The energy of the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4},
\]
and the energy of the neutrino is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c.
\]

### Solving for Momentum
Using the fact that \(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}\), we substitute \(E_{\nu} = p_{\mu} c\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4} + p_{\mu} c = m_{\pi^+} c^2.
\]
Let \(x = p_{\mu} c\). Then:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4} + x = m_{\pi^+} c^2.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 - x,
\]
\[
x^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4 = (m_{\pi^+} c^2 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4 = m_{\pi^+}^2 c^4 - 2 m_{\pi^+} c^2 x + x^2.
\]
Cancel \(x^2\) and solve for \(x\):
\[
2 m_{\pi^+} c^2 x = m_{\pi^+}^2 c^4 - m_{\mu}^2 c^4,
\]
\[
x = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 c^4 - m_{\mu}^2 c^4}{2 m_{\pi^+} c^2}.
\]

### Substituting Values
Using \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\), \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), and \(c = 1\) (natural units):
\[
x = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(139.6)^2 = 19488.16, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]
Then, calculate the denominator:
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 = 279.2.
\]
Thus:
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The energy of the muon is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
\]
Substitute \(x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
First, calculate:
\[
(29.78)^2 = 886.8484, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
\]
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.3384} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The kinetic energy of the neutrino is:
\[
K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**
