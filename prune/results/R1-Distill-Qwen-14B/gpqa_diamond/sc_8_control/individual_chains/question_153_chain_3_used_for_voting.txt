Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I remember the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think.

The first reaction is between dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's an enolate equivalent. The other reactant is the alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So, the Michael donor would be dimethyl malonate, and the acceptor is the acrylate.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. So, the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me sketch it out. The acceptor is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be something like (E)-CH2-C(=O)-OCH3, but wait, the substituent is at the 3-position. So the structure is CH2CH2? Wait, no. Maybe it's CH2-CH(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3 with the E configuration. Oh wait, no. Wait, the correct structure for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be the double bond between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl group on C3. So, it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2CH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2 where the substituent is at the 3 position. Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylic acid methyl ester. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group at the 3 position. Wait, that would make the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-OCH3? No, that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but with a substituent at the 3 position. Wait, that's not possible because the acrylate only has three carbons: 1 (CH2), 2 (CH), 3 (COOCH3). Wait, maybe it's (E)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-p-tolyl? No, I think I'm not getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-CH(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the middle (beta) carbon. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the substituent on C2 is the p-tolyl group. So, it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but in the E configuration. That makes sense. So, the acceptor has a double bond between C1 and C2, with a p-tolyl group on C2 and a COOCH3 on C3.

So, when the Michael addition happens, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta position, which is C2. Wait, but wait, in the acceptor, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the beta position is C2. But wait, dimethyl malonate is the enolate, so it's a strong nucleophile. So, it will attack the beta (C2) of the acceptor.

So, the attack would add the malonate's alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the two ester groups) to the C2 of the acceptor. So, the product would have the malonate's two ester groups on the new carbon, and the p-tolyl group attached.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The acceptor is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The nucleophile from dimethyl malonate is the enolate, which has the structure CH2-CO-OCH3 (twice?), but wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CH-, so the enolate is CH2(COOCH3)2^-.

So, when the enolate attacks the acceptor, it adds its CH2 group to the C2 of the acceptor. So, the product after attack would be a new carbon chain where the CH2 from the enolate is attached to the C2 of the acceptor.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure. The acceptor is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The enolate is from dimethyl malonate: O=C(OCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, but deprotonated to form the enolate: CH2(-)C(OOCH3)2.

So, when the enolate attacks the acceptor's C2, the product would have the structure CH2-C(OOCH3)2 attached to C2 of the acceptor. So, the product would be:

The acceptor's structure after adding the enolate would be CH2-C(OOCH3)2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the product would be a new molecule where the malonate's CH2 is attached to the acceptor's C2, and the acceptor's COOCH3 is now attached to the new carbon.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a conjugated system. Let me try to draw it out mentally. The acceptor after the Michael addition would have a new carbon added. So, the product would be:

The enolate (CH2(COOCH3)2-) attacks the beta carbon (C2) of the acceptor, which is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So, after attack, the structure becomes CH2-C(COOCH3)2 attached to the C2. So, the product would be CH2-C(COOCH3)2-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think again. The acceptor is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. The enolate attacks the beta carbon (C2). So, the enolate's CH2 would add to C2, making the structure CH2-CH(COOCH3)2 attached to the p-tolyl and the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the product would be CH2-CH(COOCH3)2 attached to the acceptor's structure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the product would be CH2-C(COOCH3)2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a p-tolyl group somewhere. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the product is trimethyl propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate substituted with p-tolyl.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-(p-tolyl)
|
O=C-OCH3

Wait, no, propane has three carbons. So, propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would be O=C-OCH3 at C1, another O=C-OCH3 at C1 (since it's 1,1,3), and another at C3. So, the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
CH2-C-O
   |   |
   COOCH3  COOCH3

Wait, but with a p-tolyl group on C2. So, maybe it's:

COOCH3
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-(p-tolyl)
|
COOCH3

Wait, that doesn't quite fit propane structure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-(p-tolyl)
|
COOCH3

But that would be a four-carbon chain, not propane. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic structure or some tricarboxylate with the p-tolyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So, that's a three-carbon chain with two COOCH3 groups on C1 and one on C3, and a p-tolyl group on C2.

So, the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
COOCH3
|
C
|
CH2-C-(p-tolyl)
|
COOCH3

Wait, that can't be because propane has three carbons. So, perhaps it's more like:

COOCH3
|
COOCH3
|
C - C(p-tolyl) - COOCH3

But that arrangement would require four carbons, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I should look for the correct product elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. The enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester at the beta position, resulting in a new carbon-carbon bond. The product would have the structure where the malonate's CH2 is added to the beta (C2) of the acceptor, which carries the p-tolyl group.

So, the product would be:

The enolate adds to the C2, making a new structure where the CH2 from the enolate is attached to C2. The acceptor's structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. After the attack, the product would have a new CH2 group attached to C2, and the double bond would shift.

Wait, but since it's a Michael addition, the double bond in the acceptor would be consumed, and the addition would form a new single bond. So, the product would have a single bond where the double bond was, and the enolate would add to the beta position.

So, the product for part A would be a tricarboxylate with a p-tolyl group. Looking at the options, option A and B have trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate as A.

So, moving on to part B. The reactants are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile, with MeOH and H3O+.

Wait, so 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine is a cyclic amine with a cyclohexene ring attached. The other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CH-CN with the E configuration (but wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN? No, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN? Wait, no. But-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, butenitrile is CH2CHCN, but more accurately, it's CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait. Let me think. But-2-enenitrile would be CH2CH2CN, but with the double bond between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CN, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, it's CH2=CHCH2CN? No, no, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN? No, wait, no. Wait, butenitrile is CH2CHCN, but that's but-1-enenitrile. Wait, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2CH2 with the nitrile on the third carbon. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CN? No, that would be but-2-enenitrile. So, structure is CH2=CHCH2CN.

So, the Michael addition here would involve the nucleophile from piperidine attacking the beta position of the nitrile. Wait, but in Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. But nitriles can act as Michael acceptors if they are alpha-beta unsaturated. So, (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile, which can act as a Michael acceptor.

Wait, but the other reagent is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. Piperidine is a six-membered amine ring. The cyclohexene ring is attached to the piperidine at position 1. So, the substituent is at the same position as the nitrogen in piperidine.

Wait, but wait, the piperidine has a cyclohexene ring attached. So, in 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine, the cyclohexene is at position 1 of piperidine, which is where the nitrogen is. So, the structure is a piperidine ring with a cyclohexene substituent on the nitrogen.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the first carbon of the piperidine, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, the key point is that this molecule has a conjugated system (the cyclohexene) which can act as a nucleophile, perhaps generating an enamine or enolate-like structure.

Wait, but in the presence of MeOH and H3O+, perhaps the reaction involves acid. Wait, but the Michael addition is typically done under basic conditions, but maybe in this case, it's done under acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe the piperidine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the alpha,beta-unsaturated nitrile.

So, the nitrile (but-2-enenitrile) is the Michael acceptor, and the piperidine's enamine or enolate is the nucleophile. So, the nucleophile would attack the beta carbon of the nitrile.

Wait, but wait, the piperidine has a conjugated cyclohexene ring. So, perhaps the cyclohexene's alpha position is where the attack happens. Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's lone pair can attack the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile.

Wait, under acidic conditions, maybe the piperidine is protonated, making it a better nucleophile. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring in the piperidine can act as a conjugated system, allowing the piperidine to act as a nucleophile.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene ring is part of an enamine, making the adjacent carbon more nucleophilic. Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine acts as a base, deprotonating the nitrile's alpha hydrogen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the piperidine is protonated, it might lose a proton from the cyclohexene ring. Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's nitrogen can attack the nitrile's carbonyl, but nitriles are usually less reactive than ketones.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure. The product is given as 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

Wait, the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which would have a cyclohexane ring (possibly with a keto group) attached to the third carbon of a four-carbon chain ending in nitrile.

Wait, but the starting nitrile is (E)-but-2-enenitrile. So, the Michael addition would add the nucleophile to the beta carbon of the nitrile. So, the product would have the nucleophile's group attached to the beta carbon of the nitrile.

In this case, the nucleophile is from the piperidine. So, perhaps the piperidine's ring opens up or the cyclohexene ring undergoes some change.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's nitrogen is involved in the attack. Wait, but the nitrile is a poor electrophile. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexene ring in the piperidine can form an enamine, which is a stronger nucleophile. Enamines are more nucleophilic than amines because of the conjugation. So, the piperidine with the cyclohexene would form an enamine, making the adjacent carbon more nucleophilic.

So, the enamine would attack the beta carbon of the nitrile. The nitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN. The beta carbon is the CH2 next to the nitrile's C.

Wait, but in but-2-enenitrile, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The beta position is C2. So, the attack would be on C2, which is the CH2 next to the double bond. Wait, no, the beta position is the next carbon after the double bond.

Wait, let me think. In an alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the nitrile is on C3. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CN. So, the alpha is C1 and beta is C2. So, the nucleophile attacks C2.

So, the enamine from the piperidine would attack the C2 of the nitrile. So, the product would have the enamine's R group attached to C2.

Wait, but the enamine is part of the piperidine ring. So, perhaps the cyclohexene ring would form a new bond to C2 of the nitrile, adding a new substituent.

So, the product would have the cyclohexene ring (now possibly with an oxygen or something) attached to the C2 of the nitrile. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So, the butanenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile on C4. On C3, there's a cyclohexyl group which has a ketone on C2.

So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(cyclohexyl)-CN, but the cyclohexyl has a ketone. So, the cyclohexane ring is substituted with a ketone group on C2.

Wait, and the cyclohexane is attached to the third carbon of the butanenitrile.

So, how does this form from the starting materials?

The starting materials are 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile. So, the reaction adds the cyclohexene ring to the nitrile's C2.

Wait, but the piperidine is a six-membered ring with a cyclohexene substituent. So, perhaps the enamine (from the cyclohexene) attacks the C2 of the nitrile. Once the attack happens, the cyclohexene would form a bond to C2, and the double bond would shift.

Wait, but the product has a cyclohexenyl group with a ketone. So, perhaps the addition forms a new ring or a fused structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's cyclohexene part adds to the nitrile's C2, and then the ring opens up or undergoes some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is part of the enamine, which attacks the nitrile. So, the enamine would have a lone pair on the adjacent carbon, attacking the C2 of the nitrile.

So, the product would have the cyclohexene attached to C2, and then perhaps the ring would open or form a new structure. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, meaning that the cyclohexane ring has a ketone group at C2 and is attached to the third carbon of the butanenitrile.

So, the butanenitrile part would be CH2CH2-C-(cyclohexyl)-CN, but wait, that's four carbons, so CH2CH2-C(cyclohexyl)-CN. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure how the addition proceeds.

But looking at the options, for part B, option A says B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and option C says the same for B. So, perhaps the correct product is that.

Now, moving to part C. The reactants are C, but-3-en-2-one, and KOH in H2O, producing 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, the starting material is but-3-en-2-one. Structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2. Wait, no. But-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2C=O-CH2. No, wait. But-3-en-2-one would be CH2-CO-CH2-CH3 with a double bond? No, correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-CH3? Or CH3-CO-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond at position 3. Wait, but but-3-en-2-one would have the carbonyl at C2 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, but but has four carbons. So, but-3-en-2-one is:

O
||
CH2-CO-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, correct structure would be CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, it's CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that would be but-3-en-2-one.

So, the structure is:

CH2
|
C=O
|
CH2-CH2

But with a double bond between C3 and C4, which would be CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, that's a bit confusing, but perhaps I can think of it as CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons.

Wait, but that's not possible because the fourth carbon is beyond. So, maybe the structure is CH2=C-CO-CH3. No, that would be but-1-en-2-one.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. The correct structure for but-3-en-2-one is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, but that's not possible because after CO comes CH2 and then CH2. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 as CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CO-CH2-CH2, but that can't have a double bond beyond the third carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2-CO-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-CH3. But that would be but-1-en-2-one. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. So, the molecule would be CH2-CO-CH2-CH2, but that's impossible because after CO comes CH2 and then another CH2, making it CH2-CO-CH2-CH2, which is but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, maybe it's:

O
||
CH2-C-O-CH2-CH2

But with a double bond between C3 and C4.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me proceed. The reaction is with KOH and H2O, which suggests a nucleophilic attack, possibly a Michael addition.

The product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the product has a cyclohexane ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3. Attached to position 2 of the cyclohexane is a 3-oxobutyl group.

So, the structure would be cyclohexane-1,3-dione with a substituent at C2: a butyl group that has a ketone at position 3. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CO-CH3 attached to C2.

Wait, but the starting material is but-3-en-2-one. So, perhaps the reaction involves the enolate of but-3-en-2-one attacking the cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the cyclohexane is 1,3-dione, and at C2, there's a butyl group with a ketone at position 3. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CO-CH3 on C2 of the cyclohexane.

Wait, but the starting material is but-3-en-2-one. So, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition of the enolate of the cyclohexane dione to the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone.

Wait, but the starting materials are C, but-3-en-2-one, and KOH, leading to the product. So, what is C? Looking at the options, for part C, options A and B have C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione or cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, I think the reaction is a Michael addition where the nucleophile is the enolate of the dione attacking the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one).

So, but-3-en-2-one has the structure CH2-CO-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, making it CH2-CO-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is (CH2)2COCH2, but with a double bond at position 3. Hmm.

In any case, when the enolate of the dione attacks, it would add to the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone. So, the enolate would attack the C3 (beta) of the but-3-en-2-one.

The product would then have the dione's ring attached to the C3 of the but-3-en-2-one, which would form a new carbon chain.

So, the product would have a substituent on the dione's ring where the alpha position (C2) is attached to the butyl group. So, perhaps the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione as given.

But how does that relate to the starting material C? Oh, because in the reaction, C is a reactant. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. The reaction is C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, C must be the nucleophile, which is the enolate form of cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, so C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. When treated with KOH, it forms its enolate, which then attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated ketone (but-3-en-2-one) in a Michael addition.

So, the product would have the dione attached to the butyl group. So, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, the starting material C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, looking at the options, option B says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and option C says C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but in the options, option B's C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, while option C's C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione as well. Hmm, no, let me check.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option B: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Option C: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Wait, no, options A says C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. Oh, but in the reaction, under KOH and H2O, if the enolate attacks, perhaps the product is what's given, and C is the starting material, which is the dione.

So, the correct option would have C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Now, putting it all together:

For A, the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which is options A and B.

For B, the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, which is options A and C.

For C, the product comes from C being cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is options B and C.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = ..., B = ..., C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, C is not correct.

Option B: A = ..., B = ..., C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Option C: A = ..., B = ..., C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, the correct options are A is as in options A and B, B is as in options A and C, and C is as in options B and C.

Looking at the options, only option B and C have correct C. But in the options, option B has C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione, and option C also has C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but wait the product in part C is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which comes from the dione (C) as the enolate attacking but-3-en-2-one.

So, the correct C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is option B and C.

Now, looking at all three parts:

Option A: A = correct, B = correct, C = 2-hydroxy... (incorrect).

Option B: A = correct, B = correct, C = correct.

Option C: A = ... Wait, option C's A is trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, which I think is incorrect.

Wait, the product A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which is option A and B.

So, for option B, A is correct, B is correct, C is correct.

So, the correct option is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing three Michael addition reactions and determining the correct reactants and products based on the given options. Here's the analysis:

---

### Reaction A:  
**Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH.  
- Dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile (enolate), and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate acts as the Michael acceptor.  
- The enolate attacks the β-carbon of the acceptor, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.  
- The product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**, which matches the description in **options A and B**.

---

### Reaction B:  
**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H3O+.  
- 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine acts as the nucleophile, likely via an enamine intermediate, and (E)-but-2-enenitrile acts as the Michael acceptor.  
- The nucleophile attacks the β-carbon of the nitrile, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.  
- The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, which matches the description in **options A and C**.

---

### Reaction C:  
**Reactants:** C, but-3-en-2-one, and KOH in H2O.  
- The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, which suggests that the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione (C) attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one.  
- Based on the product, the starting material C must be **cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, which matches the description in **options B and C**.

---

### Final Answer:  
- **Option A:** Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the product.  
- **Option B:** Correct because it lists A as trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B as 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, and C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione.  
- **Option C:** Incorrect because it lists A as trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, which is not the correct product for Reaction A.
