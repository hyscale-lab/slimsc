Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question is about a star whose properties change when spots cover part of its surface. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the effective temperature is the overall average, but the spots are cooler, so the star's overall brightness decreases, right?

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—when the star has no spots versus when it does.

So, the ratio is n1/n2, where n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in energy levels 1 and 2, respectively. The ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of two energy levels. The equation is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, does the presence of spots change the effective temperature of the entire photosphere? Or does it just that part of the surface is cooler, and the rest is at the original temperature?

Wait the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature decreases. So the star's overall Teff is now 5500 K. Because the spots are cooler, but the rest is at 6000 K. Hmm, but in reality, the star's effective temperature is calculated by the total emitted flux. So the star's luminosity is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but in the problem, they say that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's average temperature is lower because some of its surface is cooler.

But wait, the photosphere itself is a mix of cooler and hotter regions. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem states that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So we can treat the whole photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the spots are cooler regions on the surface. So the star's total effective temperature is lower, but the photosphere's temperature varies across the surface. But the problem says the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is spotted. So perhaps for the purpose of this question, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature (as in, the average) is 5500 K. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature.

Wait, the problem says when the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. So the effective temperature is the average based on the areas. So imagine that 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature, say T_spot, and the remaining 60% is at 6000 K. The total flux would be the sum of the flux from each region.

So the flux from a blackbody is sigma * T^4. So the total flux (L) is the sum of the flux from spotted and unspotted areas. The effective temperature T_eff is such that the total luminosity is the same as a blackbody with T_eff, so:

L_total = (0.6 * A_total) * sigma * (6000)^4 + (0.4 * A_total) * sigma * T_spot^4 )

But the effective temperature is given when 40% is covered, as 5500 K. So:

L_total = A_total * sigma * (5500)^4

So setting the two expressions equal:

A_total * sigma * (5500)^4 = 0.6 A_total sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 A_total sigma (T_spot)^4

We can cancel A_total and sigma:

(5500)^4 = 0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4

Let me compute each term.

Compute 6000^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12.

5.5^4: 5.5 *5.5=30.25; 30.25 *5.5=166.375; 166.375 *5.5= 915.0625.

So 5.5e3^4 = 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So:

9.150625e14 = 0.6*(1.296e15) + 0.4*(T_spot^4)

Compute 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 0.7776e15 =7.776e14.

So:

9.150625e14 =7.776e14 + 0.4 T_spot^4

Subtract 7.776e14 from both sides:

(9.150625e14 -7.776e14) = 0.4 T_spot^4

Which is (1.374625e14) =0.4 T_spot^4.

So T_spot^4 = 1.374625e14 / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root of 3.4365625e14.

Let me compute that.

First, 3.4365625e14 = 3.4365625 * 1e14.

The fourth root of 1e14 is 1e3.5 = 3162.27766.

Wait, 1e14 = (1e3.5)^4 because (1e3.5)^4 = 1e14.

Ok, so the fourth root of 3.4365625e14 is (3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4) = (approx 1.36) * 3162.27766 ≈ 4328 K.

Wait, let me calculate (3.4365625)^(1/4). Let's see, 3^(1/4)= about 1.316, 4^(1/4)= about 1.414. 3.436 is closer to 3.436, let's think: 3.436 is about 3.436.

Wait 3.436^(1/4) can be approximated.

Let me compute ln(3.436) ≈ 1.234.

Divide by 4: ~0.3085.

Exponentiate: e^0.3085 ≈ 1.36.

So 1.36 * 3162 ≈ 4328 K.

So the spot temperature T_spot is approximately 4328 K.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's compute T_spot^4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the square root twice.

First sqrt(3.4365625e14) = sqrt(3.4365625) *1e7.

sqrt(3.4365625) is about 1.8538 (since 1.85^2=3.4225, 1.8538^2 ~3.43656).

So sqrt(3.4365625e14) = 1.8538e7.

Then sqrt(1.8538e7) = sqrt(1.8538) * 1e3.5.

Wait, sqrt(1.8538) ≈ 1.3616.

1e3.5 is approx 3162.277.

So sqrt(1.8538e7) ≈ 1.3616 * 3162.277 ≈ 4316 K.

So approximately 4316 K.

So the spots are at about 4316 K.

But wait, why do we need the spot temperature? Hmm. Because the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. Wait, the problem states that in the stellar photosphere, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. We have to find by what factor this ratio changes.

Wait, the photosphere's temperature when the star doesn't have spots is 6000 K, and when it does have spots, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. So is the photosphere's temperature uniform? Because in reality, the spotted regions have lower temperature, but the rest is at 6000 K. So when the star has spots, the photosphere's temperature isn't uniform. But the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE (local thermal equilibrium), so perhaps each region's emission is considered based on its own temperature.

Wait, the problem says that when 40% is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So maybe the average temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K, but that can't be right because the rest is at 6000 K. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is simplifying things. Perhaps when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. So for the purpose of calculating the ionization or excitation of atoms, the effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the star's photosphere isn't at a uniform temperature when spots are present. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average temperature of the entire photosphere as 5500 K. But that's not correct physically because the presence of spots doesn't change the temperature of the unspotted regions. Hmm. Maybe the question is oversimplified, and when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, so the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K.

But the ratio of the populations of the Titanium atoms depends on the local temperature. So if some regions are cooler and others are hotter, then the overall ratio could be an average. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the ratio is lower when the average temperature is lower.

Wait, but the ratio (n1/n2) depends on the exponential factor exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)). So if T decreases, the exponent increases because E2-E1 is positive (since level 2 is higher in energy, assuming E2>E1). So exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)) increases as T decreases. Because the denominator is k T, so as T decreases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential increases.

Wait, no. Let me think. E2 > E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. So the exponent is -(positive)/(k T). As T decreases, the denominator gets smaller, so the entire term becomes more negative. Wait no: Wait, if T is smaller, then k T is smaller, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger. So the exponent is negative and larger in magnitude. So the exponential becomes smaller.

Wait, no, let me correct that. Let's say E2 > E1. So the difference is positive, so the exponent is negative. So the term is exp( - (positive) / (k T) ). As T decreases, the denominator k T becomes smaller, so the whole fraction becomes bigger in magnitude. So the exponent is more negative, so the exponential becomes smaller. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So as T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases because exp(-x) becomes smaller as x increases.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the temperature is lower, the ratio is lower. So in the non-spotted case, T is higher (6000 K), and ratio is higher. When T drops to 5500 K, the ratio drops.

So the ratio is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So the factor is exp[ -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ] / exp[ -(E2-E1)/(k T_spots) ]

Which simplifies to exp[ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) ) ]

Wait, let me compute this:

Factor = [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spots) ) ]

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots)) ) )

Wait, no:

Let me represent it as:

Factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots

= [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) ) ]

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots)) ) )

Wait, no. Wait:

The exponents are:

-(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) for the numerator,

and -(E2-E1)/(k T_spots) for the denominator.

So the ratio is exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] ) / exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T_spots) ) ] )

Which is:

exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) + (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) ) ] )

Factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) ( 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ) )

Wait, let me compute that. Since E2 > E1, (E2-E1) is positive. (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) is (1/5500 - 1/6000) which is positive because 5500 < 6000, so 1/5500 > 1/6000. So (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) is positive.

So the factor is exp( positive number ), which is greater than 1. So the ratio increases when T decreases. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, that's contradicting.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.

So the factor (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = ?

Which is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp(-dE/(k T_no_spots)) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -dE/(k T_spots) ) ) ] 

Simplify: exp( (dE)/(k) (1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots)) )

But since T_spots < T_no_spots, 1/(T_spots) > 1/(T_no_spots), so (1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots)) is positive.

So the exponent is (dE/(k)) * positive number.

Since dE is positive (E2 > E1), the exponent is positive. So the factor is exp(positive) which is >1.

So the ratio increases when moving from with spots to without spots. So in the no spots case, the ratio is higher than when spots are present. Which matches the problem statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, no. When spots are present, the ratio is lower. So when we compute the factor (no spots / with spots), it's higher than 1, meaning the ratio increases when the star doesn't have spots.

So the factor is exp( (dE)/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) ), where dE is E2-E1.

But the problem gives us the wavelength corresponding to the transition between the two energy levels, which is 1448 Å. That's in the near UV or visible range. So the energy of the photon is E = hc/λ.

So we can compute dE = E2 - E1 = hc/(λ).

h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. Let me compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But wait, E is in Joules. We can convert that to eV because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, is that correct? Because 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 1.372e-18 J is (1.372e-18)/(1.602e-19) ≈ 8.56 eV.

So dE = 8.56 eV.

But wait, that's the energy per photon. So we have dE in eV. Now, to compute the exponent in the Boltzmann factor.

We can compute (dE)/(k) where k is Boltzmann's constant.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So (dE)/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ approx 99346 K.

So (dE)/(k) ≈ 99346 K.

So the exponent is (dE/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^{-1}.

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 per K.

1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4 per K.

So the difference is 1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4 = 1.51e-5 per K.

Multiply by (dE/k) which is about 99346 K.

So (dE/k) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 99346 * 1.51e-5 ≈ let's compute that.

99346 * 1.51e-5 = approximately 1.50 (since 1e5 * 1e-5 is 1, so 99346≈1e5, 1e5 *1.51e-5=1.51. So 99346 *1.51e-5 ≈ 1.50 (since 99346 is about 99346 ≈ 1e5, so 1e5 *1.51e-5=1.51, but 99346 is 0.99346e5, so 0.99346 *1.51 ≈ 1.5).

So the exponent is approximately 1.5.

So the factor is exp(1.5) ≈ 4.48.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation:

Compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(5500*6000) )= 500/(33,000,000) )= 1/(66,000) ≈ 1.515e-5 per K.

Then (dE/k) = 8.56/(8.617e-5) ≈ 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ let's compute that.

8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ let me compute 8.56 / 8.617e-5.

8.56 ÷ 0.00008617 → same as 8.56 * (1/0.00008617) ≈ 8.56 * 11600 ≈ 8.56 * 1e4 = 85600, but 1/0.00008617 is approximately 11600. So 8.56 * 11600 ≈ 8.56 * 1e4 = 85600, but wait 11600 is 1.16e4, so 8.56 * 1.16e4 ≈ 99,  8.56 * 1.16 = approx 10.0, so 10 * 1e4 = 1e5. So (dE/k) is about 99,346 K.

So, 99,346 K * 1.515e-5 1/K = 99,346 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.506.

So exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506 ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

So the ratio when the star has no spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. Therefore, the factor by which it changes is approximately 4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots to having spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Temperature Without Spots (\(T_{\text{no spots}}\))**: \(6000 \, \text{K}\).
2. **Temperature With Spots (\(T_{\text{spots}}\))**: \(5500 \, \text{K}\).
3. **Energy Difference (\(E_2 - E_1\))**: Corresponds to a transition wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):
   \[
   E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

4. **Boltzmann Constant (\(k\))**: \(8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\).

### Factor Calculation:
The ratio of the populations changes by a factor of:
\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

\[
\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,346 \, \text{K}.
\]

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(99,346 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right) = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star transitions from having no spots to having spots.
