Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with different r dependencies.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance. That means as the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

The problem statement says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So substituting plx with 1/d, since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx^5 would be d^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So number of stars N is proportional to d^5?

Wait, so N ∝ d^5. But the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range of distance. That is, we're probably looking for dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r (I'll assume r is the same as d, the distance variable).

If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4. Hmm, so per unit distance, the number of stars grows with the fourth power of distance.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says "varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Given that, plx is 1/d, so 1/(1/d)^5 = d^5. So yeah, N is proportional to d^5. So when you take the derivative dN/dr, that's 5d^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars goes up by a factor of r^4. So if the distance increases by a small amount, the number of stars in that slice increases with r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but another way to think: the number of stars as a function of parallax is 1/plx^5. Parallax plx = 1/d, so N = k * (d)^5. Now, when you're looking at how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit distance), that's the derivative of N with respect to d. So dN/dd =5k d^4. So the rate at which stars are present increases with d^4. So for each unit increase in distance, the number of stars in that thin shell goes as r^4.

So yes, the correct answer is C.

The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, we calculate the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), taking the derivative gives \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4 \). This shows that the number of stars per unit distance increases with the fourth power of distance.

Among the options provided, the correct dependence on distance is \( r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
