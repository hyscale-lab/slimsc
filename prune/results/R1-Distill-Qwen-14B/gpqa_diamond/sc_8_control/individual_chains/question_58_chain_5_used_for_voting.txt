Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives four options: Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics. I need to figure out which one never requires regularization at high energies.

Wait, what's regularization again? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary 'cut-off' or some other method to handle the infinities, and then you take the cut-off to infinity or remove it in the end.

So, which theories don't need this? Let me think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, wait! Classical theories don't really have the same issues as quantum ones. In classical physics, like Maxwell's equations, there aren't divergent loop diagrams or anything like that. Quantum theories have these infinities because of the way particles and fields interact at small scales. So classical theories probably don't need regularization because they don't have those divergent problems. That might be the answer.

Now let's look at the other options. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum theory. I remember that QED calculations, like calculating the electron's magnetic moment, lead to divergent results. So regularization is used there, maybe through methods like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization. So QED does require it, so option C is not the answer.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It also deals with things like quarks and gluons. I think QCD calculations also have divergences, especially because of issues like confinement and asymptotic freedom. So they must use regularization as well. That would mean option B isn't the correct answer either.

Superstring Theory, option A. Superstring theory is a type of quantum theory that attempts to unify all the forces, including gravity. String theories in general deal with higher dimensions and are background-dependent. Do they require regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, string theories often deal with high energies and try to avoid some of the problems by having a more complete framework. But I'm not sure if they require regularization. Oh wait, I think string theories might not have the same types of divergences as QED or QCD because they're background-independent and the calculations are done in a different way. But wait, is that correct? Or do they still require some form of regularization?

Wait, actually, I'm not entirely sure about string theories. But I'm pretty confident that classical theories don't have divergences. So option D, Classical Electrodynamics, doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory and doesn't have the same infinities.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the given options:

1. **Superstring Theory (Option A):** While it is a quantum theory aiming to unify forces, including gravity, it operates in a different framework compared to standard quantum field theories. However, it still involves high-energy calculations and potential divergences, so regularization might be necessary in some contexts.

2. **Quantum Chromodynamics (Option B):** QCD, the theory of the strong interaction, deals with quarks and gluons. It encounters divergences in calculations, particularly due to issues like confinement and asymptotic freedom, requiring regularization techniques.

3. **Quantum Electrodynamics (Option C):** QED, the quantum theory of electromagnetism, is known to produce divergent results in calculations, such as those involving the electron's magnetic moment. Regularization is therefore essential in QED.

4. **Classical Electrodynamics (Option D):** This is a classical theory based on Maxwell's equations. Classical theories do not encounter the divergences or infinities that plague quantum theories, as they lack the loop diagrams and renormalization issues inherent in quantum field theory. Thus, classical electrodynamics does not require regularization.

Based on this analysis, the theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **Classical Electrodynamics**.
