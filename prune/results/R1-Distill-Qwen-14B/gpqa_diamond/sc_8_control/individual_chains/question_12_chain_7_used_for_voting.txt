Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the pion Pi+ is at rest and it decays into a muon mu+ and a neutrino nu. The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D, each giving two values which I assume are the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino respectively.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me try to remember what I know about particle decay and conservation laws. Oh right, in any decay, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero, so the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

So, the initial rest mass is given. The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is a bit tricky because I think it's considered massless, or at least its mass is negligible compared to the other particles. So the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

Let me denote the energies and momenta of the muon and neutrino. Let me think, for each particle:

The total energy of the muon (E_mu) would be gamma * m_mu * c^2, and its momentum (p_mu) is gamma * m_mu * v. Wait, but since the neutrino is massless, its energy (E_nu) is equal to its momentum (p_nu) multiplied by c, because for massless particles, E = pc.

But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the system must be zero. So the muon's momentum must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum. So p_mu = -p_nu. But because they are vectors, their magnitudes are equal, but directions opposite. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, and neutrino's as p as well, but opposite in direction.

Now, considering energy conservation. The initial energy is the rest mass of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. So the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino must be equal to this: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2 multiplied by c^2? Wait, no. Let me correct that. The total energy E of a particle is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ), because m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c².

The neutrino's energy E_nu is p c, since for massless particles, E=pc.

So putting it together:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6

Hmm, this looks like an equation in terms of p. Let me set x = p c to make it easier. Then the equation becomes:

sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6

Let me call sqrt(x² + a²) + x = M, where a is 105.7, M is 139.6.

So, sqrt(x² + a²) = M - x

Squaring both sides:

x² + a² = (M - x)^2

Expanding the right side: M² - 2 M x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

a² = M² - 2 M x

So rearranging:

2 M x = M² - a²

x = (M² - a²)/(2 M)

Plugging in M=139.6 and a=105.7:

Compute M² and a².

M² = (139.6)^2 = let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600, but since it's 139.6, let's compute 139.6 * 139.6.

139.6 * 139.6 = ?

Well, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2 * 140 * 0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Wait wait, no, 140^2 is 19600. 140 * 0.4 is 56, so 2*140*0.4 is 112. So 19600 - 112 = 19488. Then plus 0.16 is 19488.16. So M² is 19488.16 (MeV)^2.

a² is (105.7)^2. Let's calculate that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and cross terms: 2 * 100 *5.7= 1140. So, 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

So M² - a² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 (MeV)^2.

Then x = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Hmm, let me compute that. 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2, so 8376-279.2=8096.8. So 29 * 279.2 is 8096.8. But 8315.67 is larger than that.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.772 = ?

Wait perhaps I should do it differently.

8315.67 divided by 279.2. Let's see, 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 30 is too big. 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait 279.2 * 30 =8376. So 279.2 * (30 -0.2) = 8376 - (279.2 * 0.2) = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29.8 = 8320.16. Our numerator is 8315.67, which is 4.49 less. So x ≈ 29.8 - (4.49 / 279.2).

4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.0161. So x≈29.8 -0.0161≈29.7839.

So approximately 29.78 MeV. But wait, x is p c, so p = x / c. But since we're working in units where c=1, p = x ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation to avoid mistakes. Alternatively, 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Let me approximate 279.2 into 280 for easier calculation. 8315.67 / 280 ≈ 29.7.

Hmm, so x≈29.7 MeV.

So E_nu = x = ~29.7 MeV. And E_mu is sqrt(x² + a²) = sqrt( (29.7)^2 + (105.7)^2 ). Let's compute this.

29.7^2 = 882.09, 105.7^2=11172.49. Sum is 882.09 + 11172.49 = 12054.58. Square root of that is sqrt(12054.58) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So E_mu ≈109.8 MeV, E_nu≈29.7 MeV.

But wait, the initial energy is 139.6, and 109.8 +29.7=139.5, which is close enough considering rounding.

Now, the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.8 - 105.7 =4.1 MeV.

So the muon's kinetic energy is ~4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's is ~29.7 MeV. So looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to our estimate. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute M² and a² more accurately.

M =139.6 MeV, a=105.7 MeV.

M² = (139.6)^2 = let me compute 139 *139: 139^2 = 19321. Then 0.6^2=0.36. And the cross term is 2*139*0.6=166.8. So (139.6)^2 = (139 +0.6)^2 =139² + 2*139*0.6 +0.6² = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19321 +166.8 is 19487.8 +0.36 is 19488.16. Correct.

a² = (105.7)^2. Let's compute 105^2=11025, 0.7^2=0.49, 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2=105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2 =11025 +147 +0.49 =11172.49. Correct.

So M² - a²=19488.16 -11172.49= 8315.67. Correct.

x = (8315.67)/(2*139.6) =8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this division more accurately. 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87. 218.87 /279.2 ≈0.782. So 29 + 0.782=29.782. So x≈29.782 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.782)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.782^2: let's calculate 30^2=900, subtract (0.218)^2 (approx) and 2*30*0.218=13.08. So (30-0.218)^2 ≈900 - 2*30*0.218 + (0.218)^2 =900 -13.08 +0.0475≈886.9675.

Wait, but 29.782 is 30 -0.218? Wait 30-0.218 is 29.782. So (30 -0.218)^2 =30² - 2*30*0.218 + (0.218)^2 =900 -13.08 +0.0475≈886.9675.

So 29.782^2 is approximately 886.9675. 105.7^2 is 11172.49. Sum is 886.9675 +11172.49 =12059.4575.

Square root of 12059.4575: sqrt(12049)=109.8, since 109.8^2=12056.04. Hmm, wait 109.8^2 = (110-0.2)^2=110^2 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.2^2=12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04. So 12056.04 is 109.8^2. Our sum is 12059.4575, which is 3.4175 higher. So sqrt is approximately 109.8 + (3.4175)/(2*109.8) )=109.8 + (0.0156)=109.8156 MeV.

So E_mu is approximately 109.8156 MeV.

Then, the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c² =109.8156 -105.7=4.1156 MeV. Approximately 4.12 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is x=29.782 MeV, so its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy since its rest mass is zero. So 29.782 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Looking back at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the correct choice. The other options don't match these values.

To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay of a stationary pion, **π⁺ → μ⁺ + ν**, we apply conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses of the particles are given as follows:  
- Rest mass of π⁺: 139.6 MeV  
- Rest mass of μ⁺: 105.7 MeV  
- Rest mass of ν: negligible (treated as 0 for this calculation).  

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the decay products must equal the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   Here, \(E_{\mu}\) is the total energy of the muon, and \(E_{\nu}\) is the energy of the neutrino.

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

3. **Energy-Momentum Relation**:  
   For the muon:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}.
   \]  
   For the neutrino (massless):  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c.
   \]

### Solving for \(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p\):
From energy conservation,  
\[
\sqrt{(p c)^2 + (105.7)^2} + p c = 139.6.
\]  
Let \(x = p c\). Substituting,  
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6.
\]  
Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x + x^2.
\]  
Cancel \(x^2\) and solve for \(x\):  
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot x = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]  
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Thus, \(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c\).

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   Since \(E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c\),  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon Energy**:  
   Using \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(p_{\mu} c)^2 + (m_{\mu} c^2)^2}\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
   \]  
   Compute:  
   \[
   (29.78)^2 = 886.97, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49,
   \]  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.97 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.46} \approx 109.82 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

3. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   The kinetic energy of the muon is:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Results:
- Muon kinetic energy: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\)  
- Neutrino energy: \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\)  

These match the values in **Option D**.  

Answer: D
