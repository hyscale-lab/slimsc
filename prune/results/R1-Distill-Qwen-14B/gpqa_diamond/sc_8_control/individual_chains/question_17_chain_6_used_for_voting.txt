Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C.

Hmm, I remember that the formation constant (Kf) is related to the stability of the complex. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is very stable.

Wait, I think the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, EDTA is usually in different protonated forms. Oh wait, but the question says 'ideal pH', so maybe we don't have to worry about the different forms of EDTA. Or perhaps, since the pH is ideal, that implies that the EDTA is in its most appropriate form for the complex to form, maybe as Y^4-.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The formation constant is given, so I can use that.

So the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Let's denote the complex as CaEDTA^2-.

The dissociation reaction would be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-}) = 5e10.

But wait, in solution, the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are related because the complex dissociates a bit. Let's let the concentration of Ca^2+ be x. Then, since each complex dissociates into one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. Because, if the complex concentration is 0.02 M, most of it is undissociated. But wait, wait, the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2-.

So initially, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. When some of it dissociates, let's say it dissociates by an amount 's' (like in the common ion effect). Then:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02 (since s is probably very small compared to 0.02 because Kf is large).

[Ca^2+] = s

[EDTA^4-] = s

Then, the Kf expression becomes:

Kf = (0.02)/(s^2) = 5e10.

So solving for s:

s^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) 

s^2 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14

Wait, no: 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait no, 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So s^2 = 4e-13 → s = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) → 1e-6.5 is sqrt(1e-13) → which is 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13.

Wait, 6.5 is 13/2, so yes.

So sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 * 10^(-6.5). Let me calculate that exponent. 10^(-6) is 1e-6, 10^(-7) is 1e-7. So 1e-6.5 is sqrt(1e-13) = 1e-6.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

So s ≈ 6.32e-7 M. So [Ca^2+] is s, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh, wait, I think I messed up the calculation.

Wait, Kf = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]) = 5e10.

We have [complex] = 0.02 M. Let [Ca] = [EDTA] = x.

So, 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2) → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → same as before, which is 6.3e-7.

So yes, [Ca^2+] is 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation reaction is:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}.
\]

Let the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) at equilibrium be \( x \). Since the dissociation is small, the concentration of the complex remains approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \). The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}.
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Approximating \( 10^{-6.5} \) as \( 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \):

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
