Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem about molecular symmetry. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h is a type of molecular symmetry, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

Okay, first, I should probably recall what C3h symmetry implies. I remember that the 'h' in the notation stands for horizontal. So C3h symmetry would involve a three-fold rotation (like turning 120 degrees) and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also when reflected across a horizontal plane.

Looking at the options, I have four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D, each representing one of these molecules.

Let me go through each one. Maybe drawing their structures would help, but I don't have the visuals. I'll try to imagine them based on their names.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Borate usually has a boron atom connected to an oxygen and three organic groups. Triisopropyl borate would have three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Isopropyl groups are symmetric themselves. The molecule might have a trigonal planar structure around boron. Wait, trigonal planar is three-fold rotation (C3), but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not sure. Triisopropyl borate is known to be a chiral molecule, though. Because if all three substituents are the same, like all isopropyl, maybe it's not chiral. Wait, no, wait, if they're all identical, then the molecule would be symmetrical. Hmm, but wait, is it? If all three substituents are the same, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So maybe it's C3v symmetry? Or maybe C3h?

Alternatively, maybe it's a trigonal planar structure, but I'm not certain if it has a horizontal mirror plane. I'm not confident about this one yet.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a norbornane derivative. Norbornane has a bridge structure, and I think quinuclidine is similar. Wait, quinuclidine has a structure with a bridge, so it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. I remember that quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry. But does it have a three-fold rotation symmetry? I think norbornane has a sort of three-fold axis, but quinuclidine is a secondary amine. Wait, maybe quinuclidine has a C3 axis? Let me think. If you look down the bridge, perhaps there's a three-fold rotation. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think quinuclidine is a meso compound, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe it's not symmetric enough for C3h. I'm a bit stuck here.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Let me try to parse the name. Trifuran suggests three furan rings connected. The numbering might suggest how they're fused. Benzo implies a benzene ring attached. So this molecule might have a core of three fused furan rings with a benzene ring attached. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex structure. I'm not too familiar, but maybe the symmetry here is lower. If it's a benzo fused with a trifuran, perhaps it's a planar molecule with five-membered rings. Maybe it has a center of inversion or some other symmetry, but not C3h. Not sure.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So this is another trifuran, but with triphenylene groups attached. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene ring, so maybe each substituent is a triphenylene group. Wait, the name is triphenyleno, so each of the three substituents on the trifuran is a triphenylene group? That would make it highly symmetrical. If all three substituents are the same, that's a good sign for higher symmetry. So if the core is a trifuran (which is a three-fused furan), and each substituent is a triphenylene, that could create a lot of symmetry.

Wait, trifuran is a fused structure of three furan rings. So in the case of triphenyleno-substituted trifuran, each of the three positions would have a triphenylene group. So that would mean that the molecule has three identical substituents attached symmetrically. That would suggest that it might have a three-fold rotation axis (C3) because rotating the molecule 120 degrees would swap the substituents. But what about a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, then a mirror plane might exist.

So if the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry. I'm thinking that molecule A is a candidate.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me think again.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. If the central boron is surrounded by three identical isopropyl groups, the structure is trigonal planar. Trigonal planar implies a three-fold rotation axis (C3) but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Wait, in trigonal planar, the molecule is flat, so a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the molecular plane. So if the molecule is planar, then yes, it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait a second. Triisopropyl borate is B(OiPr)3. The structure of boron with three isopropyl groups. Let me think about the geometry. Boron typically has a trigonal planar structure when bonded to three identical groups. So if all three substituents are the same, the molecule is symmetrical. So yes, it would have a C3 axis (because it's trigonal) and a horizontal mirror plane (since it's flat, you can reflect across the plane of the molecule). So that would make it C3h.

But wait, I thought triisopropyl borate is a chiral compound. If that's the case, then it can't have C3h symmetry. Because if it has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. Oh, wait, this is a crucial point. If triisopropyl borate is chiral, then it cannot have a plane of symmetry. Because chiral molecules lack any plane of symmetry.

So I must have made a mistake earlier. Triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropyl groups around boron. Wait, but wait: if the three substituents are identical, then the molecule should have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So maybe triisopropyl borate is actually not chiral. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting ideas.

Wait, the isopropyl group is itself a chiral center. But when three identical groups are attached to a central atom, do they make the entire molecule chiral? Let me think. For example, trimethylamine is not chiral because it's planar. But if the substituents are all the same, like trimethylamine, it's not chiral. So perhaps triisopropyl borate is also not chiral because all substituents are the same. So that would mean it's symmetrical, and thus has a plane of symmetry. So in that case, it would have C3h symmetry.

But I'm not entirely sure. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

If all three substituents are the same, then the molecule must have some symmetry. For example, suppose the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. Then, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), and a plane of reflection (like the plane perpendicular to the C3 axis). Wait, no, the plane of reflection would be a vertical plane, not horizontal.

Wait, symmetry notation can be a bit tricky. The 'h' in C3h indicates that there's a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane, meaning if you reflect it across that plane, it looks the same.

In the case of triisopropyl borate, if the molecule is flat (trigonal planar), then the plane of the molecule is a horizontal mirror plane. So when you flip it over that plane, it's the same. So that would be a horizontal mirror plane. And it has a C3 axis (the central B with three substituents). So yes, C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, if the molecule is not flat, maybe the symmetry is different. But I think triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule, so it would have C3h.

So if that's the case, then option C has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D. So option C is triisopropyl borate. So is that the correct answer?

Wait, let me check the other options again.

Option D is quinuclidine. I think quinuclidine has a plane of symmetry but perhaps not a three-fold axis. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane amine. The structure is symmetric, but what's its symmetry? It has a plane of symmetry, but perhaps it's C2h symmetry. Quinuclidine is a secondary amine; the nitrogen is in the center of the bridge. The molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the bridge, so it's a meso compound. So its symmetry is C2h, not C3h. So D is not the answer.

Option B is the benzo-trifuran... I imagine it's a more complex structure. Maybe it's a planar molecule but with a different symmetry. Perhaps it has a C2 axis or something else, but it's probably not C3h.

Option A, triphenyleno-trifuran... So if it's a trifuran with three substituents (triphenylene groups), arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis. Each substituent is in a position that's 120 degrees apart. So that would give C3 symmetry. But what about a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, if the molecule is flat, then the plane of the molecule would be the horizontal plane. So reflecting across that would leave it unchanged. So that would add the 'h' symmetry. So that would make the overall symmetry C3h.

But wait, the substituents are triphenylene, which are bulky. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, would that allow for a horizontal mirror plane?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is non-planar, which would prevent the horizontal mirror plane. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar, so it has the horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

So both option C (triisopropyl borate) and option A could have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about whether triisopropyl borate is chiral or not. If all three substituents are identical, then the molecule can't be chiral. So it must have some symmetry.

Assuming that triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry, then option C is a candidate.

But let's think about the structures. Triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule with three identical groups around boron. So yes, it has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h symmetry. So that's one correct option.

Now, looking at option A: triphenyleno-trifuran... Each substituent is triphenylene, so each is a bulky group. If they're attached symmetrically to the trifuran core, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis (C3), and if it's planar, a horizontal mirror plane (h), making it C3h.

So both options A and C could have C3h symmetry. But wait, wait, the question says which of the following has C3h symmetry. So perhaps more than one molecule has it, but I need to check the options.

Wait, the question gives four options, labeled A to D, each being a molecule. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So the question is which one of these four has C3h symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structures again.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) is a planar molecule with three identical substituents, so it would have C3h symmetry.

Option A is a more complex molecule. The trifuran part is connected to three triphenylene groups. So if each substituent is the same and equally spaced, then it would have a three-fold rotation axis. Does it also have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule lies in a plane, then yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't planar, but I'm not certain. But given that it's a trifuran, which is a planar structure, I think the molecule would be planar, allowing for a horizontal mirror plane.

So both A and C could have C3h symmetry. But the options are four, and the answer is one of them. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, so it's flat. So yes, it has a horizontal mirror plane, which is the plane of the molecule itself. So C3h symmetry is correct.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about the chirality. If the molecule is planar and has three identical substituents, it's not chiral. So triisopropyl borate would be achiral and have C3h symmetry.

So if that's the case, then option C is correct.

Wait, but what about the other structures?

Option A: the triphenylene substituents are all the same, so the molecule would have a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, then yes. So perhaps option A is also a candidate.

Wait, but I'm not certain about that. I think I should look for which of these structures is known to have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate isn't planar. Wait, no. Boron usually has a trigonal planar structure, so triisopropyl borate would be planar, hence it has C3h symmetry. So option C is a strong candidate.

But wait, looking back at the question, the options are labeled A, B, C, D. So the correct answer is either C or A.

Wait, but I also thought that triisopropyl borate is not a chiral compound. Because if all three substituents are same, then it's symmetrical and hence achiral.

So, in that case, triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry, making option C the correct answer.

But wait, the question is multiple-choice, and the options include triphenyleno-trifuran (option A) which is more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A because it has three identical substituents, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry requires the presence of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

In triisopropyl borate, the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically around the central boron, so 120° rotation would leave it unchanged, so C3 is present. The molecule is flat, so a horizontal mirror plane (the plane of the molecule) exists. So yes, C3h symmetry.

In the triphenyleno-trifuran (option A), the three substituents are the same, so C3 is present. If the molecule is planar, the horizontal mirror plane exists. So it would also have C3h.

But wait, how about the atoms in the rings? Would that affect the symmetry? Suppose the molecule is planar, then yes.

But perhaps the substituents are in a way that the molecule is not planar, so no horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is non-planar, so no horizontal mirror plane, making it only C3 without the h.

But I'm not sure. In the absence of a clear image, I think I have to go with what I know.

Triisopropyl borate is planar, trigonal, so it has C3h. That makes option C (which is triisopropyl borate) the correct answer.

Wait, but looking back, the options for the question are as follows:

The question states the options as A to D, each being a molecule. Wait, the question is looking for which has C3h symmetry.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The 'h' in C3h refers to a horizontal mirror plane, not a vertical one. So if the molecule is planar, the plane of the molecule is the horizontal mirror plane.

So in the case of triisopropyl borate, which is planar, it has C3h.

But in the case of triphenyleno-trifuran (option A), I'm not sure if it's planar. Trifuran is a fused furan system, which is planar. If the substituents are attached in a symmetric fashion, the molecule as a whole would be planar, so it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So it would have C3h symmetry.

But now I'm stuck again. If both options A and C have C3h, but the correct answer is only one, perhaps I should think again.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is not C3h. Because... Wait, another thought: the horizontal mirror plane in C3h symmetry is the same as the principal plane. So the molecule must have a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the principal axis. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the notation.

Wait, the C3h point group has a three-fold rotation axis (C3), a horizontal mirror plane (σh), and inversion symmetry. Wait, but I'm not very confident about the exact properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that C3h symmetry is the same as the C3v symmetry in some cases, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: which of these molecules is known to have C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine (option D) is a bicyclic molecule with a plane of symmetry, but it's C2h symmetry, not C3h.

Triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, so it should have C3h symmetry.

Now, the question is, which molecule is given among the options. So option C is triisopropyl borate, which would have C3h symmetry.

Another thought: perhaps the molecule in option A is a planar structure with three identical substituents, leading to C3h.

But I'm not certain. However, given that option C is a simple molecule with C3h symmetry, it's likely the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about which molecule 'has' C3h symmetry. So my earlier reasoning suggests that C3h is present in option C.

But looking at the options, option B is a benzo-trifuran. Let me think: benzo rings are planar. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the benzo part breaks the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which has three identical substituents, making it more likely to have C3h.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual structures.

Triisopropyl borate: B with three isopropyl groups, trigonal planar. So yes, C3h.

Option A: triphenyleno-substituted trifuran. The trifuran is three fused furans. If each of the three substituents is the same, and the molecule is planar, then yes, C3h.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't flat. Alternatively, I think that the trifuran system is planar.

So if the substituents are triphenylene, which are planar (as they are benzene rings), then attaching them to a planar trifuran would make the entire molecule planar.

So then, it would have a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Thus, option A would also have C3h symmetry.

Hmm, now I'm stuck between options A and C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because triisopropyl borate might not have a horizontal mirror plane. Maybe because it's trigonal planar, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for which of these molecules are known to have C3h symmetry.

Quick research in my memory: I think that triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule and thus has C3h symmetry. So option C would be correct.

But the other option, triphenyleno-trifuran, if it's a planar molecule with threefold symmetry, would also have C3h.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to be certain.

Another approach: Let's think about the number of substituents.

Triisopropyl borate has three substituents, same, so three-fold symmetry.

Option A has three triphenylene substituents. So three same, also three-fold.

So both A and C have three same substituents. So both could have C3h.

But perhaps one of them has a different arrangement.

Wait, maybe the planarity is the key. Triisopropyl borate is definitely planar. The triphenyleno-trifuran may not be, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I think the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about other clues.

The question gives four options, and the answer is among them. Let's think about each option.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Known as a trigonal planar molecule, so yes, C3h.

Option D: quinuclidine. It's a meso compound, which is C2h, not C3h.

Options A and B are more complex. Option A has three substituents, so possibly C3h.

But I think the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but I'm now getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to find another angle.

The question is about C3h symmetry. So each molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar, so yes to both.

Option A: if the molecule is planar and has three-fold symmetry, yes.

But perhaps the substituents in option A are arranged in a way that breaks the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at different positions, leading to lower symmetry.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.

So, in conclusion, I think option C is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on the requirements of **C₃h** symmetry. **C₃h** symmetry involves a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σ). The molecule must appear identical after a 120° rotation and reflection across a horizontal plane.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a trifuran core (three fused furan rings) with three triphenylene groups attached symmetrically. The trifuran core is planar, and the triphenylene groups are identical and equally spaced. This arrangement suggests a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). If the molecule is planar, it would also have a horizontal mirror plane (σ), making it **C₃h** symmetric. However, the bulky triphenylene substituents might disrupt planarity, which could prevent the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. Without explicit confirmation of planarity, it is uncertain if this molecule has **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule features a trifuran core with a benzo group attached. The benzo group introduces asymmetry, and the overall structure is less symmetric. It is unlikely to have a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σ), so it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to the trigonal planar geometry. Since the molecule is planar, it also has a horizontal mirror plane (σ), making it **C₃h** symmetric. This molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure and a nitrogen atom. It has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound with **C₂h** symmetry. However, it does not have a three-fold rotation axis (C₃), so it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the most straightforward candidate for **C₃h** symmetry. It has a trigonal planar structure with a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. While Option A could potentially have **C₃h** symmetry, the bulky triphenylene substituents might disrupt planarity, making it uncertain. Therefore, the best answer is **triisopropyl borate**.

**Answer: C**
