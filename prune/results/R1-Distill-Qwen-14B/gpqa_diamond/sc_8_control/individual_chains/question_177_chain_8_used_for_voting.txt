Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and figure out what I need to do.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. We know a few things about them. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2, and M1 = 1.5 M2. 

The astronomers found that both stars have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, that means their temperatures must be the same because the constant b is the same for all objects. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The blackbody radiation curve depends on temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 equals T2. Got that.

The next part says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, radial velocity usually refers to the speed at which the star is moving away or towards us. If Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, it's not moving towards or away from us, so the measured wavelength of the spectral lines (like the peak) shouldn't be Doppler shifted. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Now, wait, this affects the observed wavelength. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Wait, does that mean the rest wavelength or the observed wavelength?

I think that when they say the peak wavelengths are the same, they're talking about the observed wavelengths. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its light would be blueshifted, making the observed peak shorter than its rest wavelength. Similarly, moving away would cause redshift. So if Star_2's peak is at the same observed wavelength as Star_1, which isn't moving, then Star_2 must have a temperature that when Doppler shifted, matches Star_1's temperature.

Wait, but earlier I thought T1 = T2 because their peak wavelengths (without Doppler shift) are same. But now it's getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The star emits at a certain wavelength, which depends on its temperature. But if the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted. So the observed peak wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, the formula is actually lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) for relativistic speeds, but for small velocities, we can approximate it as 1 + v_r/c. Hmm, but 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c is about 3e5 km/s, so 700 is 0.00233c, which is small, so maybe the non-relativistic approximation is okay).

But wait, if Star_2 has a radial velocity, does that mean its observed wavelength at maximum is the same as Star_1's? Let's think. Let's denote v2 as Star_2's radial velocity (700 km/s), and v1 as Star_1's (0). 

So, for Star_1: lambda1 = b / T1.

For Star_2: the rest lambda would be lambda2 = b / T2. But because of radial velocity, the observed lambda2_obs = lambda2 * (1 + v2/c) if it's moving away (redshift), or (1 - v2/c) if moving towards (blueshift). But if the observed lambda2_obs is equal to lambda1 (since both appear brightest at same observed wavelength), then:

lambda1 = lambda2_obs = lambda2 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but this would change the relationship between T1 and T2. Because lambda2_obs = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r/c). So if lambda2_obs = lambda1, then (b/T2)*(1 + v_r/c) = b/T1. The b's cancel, so (1/(T2)) (1 + v_r/c) ) = 1/T1 → T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c).

Ah, so T1 is not equal to T2. Instead, T1 is T2 divided by (1 + v_r/c). Because Star_2's observed maximum is at the same wavelength as Star_1's, which isn't moving. So the real temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1? Or lower?

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. Let me assume Star_2 is moving away (v_r positive for moving away). Then (1 + v_r/c) would be greater than 1, so T1 = T2 / (something greater than 1). So T1 < T2. So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1.

Wait, but wait. If Star_2 is moving away from us, its light is redshifted, making the observed wavelength longer. But both stars have the same observed lambda_max. So Star_1 (stationary) has lambda1 = b/T1. Star_2 (moving away) has lambda2_obs = lambda2_rest * (1 + v_r/c) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r/c). Since lambda1 = lambda2_obs, we get: b/T1 = (b/T2)(1 + v_r/c). So T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c). Since v_r is 700 km/s, which is positive (assuming moving away), so T2 is higher than T1. So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1.

Wait, but why would that be the case? Because when a star moves away, we see a longer wavelength for its light. But if both have same observed lambda_max, that must mean that Star_2's actual (rest) temperature is higher, so that when it's redshifted, it ends up at the same observed lambda as Star_1.

So, to recap: T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r/c) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c).

But wait, let's compute the exact numbers. Let me compute (1 + v_r/c). v_r is 700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 is approximately 0.002333. So 1 + 0.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333. So T2 is slightly higher than T1.

Now, the question is about the luminosity of the two stars. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4. So the luminosity depends on the radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

We need to compute the ratio L1 / L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 and T2 are related via T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r/c) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So let's plug into L1 and L2.

L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ (T1)^4 = 4π ( (1.5 R2) )^2 σ T1^4 = 4π R2² σ (2.25) T1^4.

L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ (T2)^4 = 4π R2² σ ( (T1 * 1.002333) )^4.

So the ratio L1/L2 = [2.25 T1^4 ] / [ T1^4 * (1.002333)^4 ].

The T1^4 cancels out, so it's 2.25 / (1.002333)^4.

Compute (1.002333)^4. Let's approximate this.

We can use the binomial expansion for small x. (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + n x + (n(n-1)/2) x² + ... 

Here, x = 0.002333, and n =4.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 +4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)*(0.002333)^2 + (4*3*2)/(6)*(0.002333)^3 + ... 

Compute each term:

Term 1: 1

Term2: 4 * 0.002333 = 0.009332.

Term3: (6) * (0.002333)^2 ≈ 6 * (0.00000544) ≈ 0.00003264.

Term4: (4) * (0.002333)^3 ≈ 4 * (1.28e-8) ≈ 5.12e-8, which is negligible.

So adding up terms: 1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332. Then +0.00003264 → approx 1.0093646.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / 1.009365.

Compute 2.25 / 1.009365. Let me calculate this.

2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ let's see, 2.25 / 1.009365.

Well, 1.009365 is approximately 1.009365. So 2.25 / 1.009365.

Let me compute this division.

Approximately, 2.25 ÷ 1.009365.

1.009365 × 2.23 = let's see.

1 × 2.23 = 2.23.

0.009365 × 2.23 ≈ approx 0.02092.

So 1.009365 × 2.23 ≈ 2.23 + 0.02092 ≈ 2.25092. Wait, that's very close to 2.25.

Oh wait, so 2.23 × 1.009365 ≈ 2.25.

So 2.25 / 1.009365 ≈ 2.23.

Wait, so L1/L2 ≈ 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another way: calculate 2.25 / 1.009365.

1.009365 ≈ 1.00936.

So 1.00936 * x = 2.25 → x=2.25 / 1.00936.

Calculating with a calculator-like approach:

1.00936 ≈ 1 + 0.00936.

Compute 2.25 ÷ 1.00936.

We can think of this as 2.25 × (1/(1.00936)).

1/(1.00936) ≈ 0.9907 (since 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 -x for small x. Here x is 0.00936 → 1 - 0.00936 = 0.99064.

So 2.25 × 0.99064 ≈ 2.25 × (1 - 0.00936) = 2.25 - 0.02106 → 2.22894. Approximately 2.23.

So yes, the ratio is approximately 2.23, which matches option D.

To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)
2. **Temperature**: Both stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength, implying their observed peak wavelengths are equal. Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \)), the rest temperature of Star_2 (\( T_2 \)) is slightly higher than Star_1 (\( T_1 \)) due to Star_2's radial velocity (\( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)). The relationship is:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
   \]
   where \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Substituting \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:
   \[
   1 + v_r/c = 1 + \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 1.002333
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   T_2 \approx T_1 \cdot 1.002333
   \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**: Substituting the Stefan-Boltzmann law for both stars:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
   \]
   Using \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333 \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2 T_1^4}{T_1^4 (1.002333)^4} = \frac{2.25}{(1.002333)^4}
   \]

4. **Simplify \( (1.002333)^4 \)**: Using the binomial expansion for small \( x \), where \( x = 0.002333 \):
   \[
   (1 + x)^4 \approx 1 + 4x + \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2} x^2 + \dots
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 0.002333 \):
   \[
   (1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.002333) + \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2} (0.002333)^2 \approx 1.009365
   \]

5. **Final Ratio**: Substituting back:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009365} \approx 2.23
   \]

### Conclusion:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
