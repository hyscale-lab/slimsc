Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Let me try to break it down. The researchers want to choose which planet has a higher chance of transiting so they can observe it. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different, with Planet_1 having a shorter period. Also, their host stars have different masses but the same radii.

Hmm, transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is related to the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. The formula, I think, is something like (R_planet + R_star) squared over something else... Wait, maybe it's more about the orbital plane's alignment. Oh wait, no, the formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (something else), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, actually, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us, and the probability depends on the ratio of the sizes of the planet's orbit and the star.

Wait, no, maybe that's not quite right. Let me think again. The transit probability for a given planet is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p)^2) )? Or is it the other way around? Or maybe it's (R_p / a_p)^2? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think the probability depends on how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The formula is P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but that doesn't seem right because units wouldn't match. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by (something related to the inclination). Wait, no, maybe that's the area for the transit.

Wait, I think the transit probability is P = (R_p / a)^2 * (1 / (1 - e^2))^{1/2}, but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so that's not a factor. So the probability is just (R_p / a)^2 times some geometric factor, but actually, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / a)^2. Or is that the area?

Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. The actual probability of transit is given by the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbital plane sweeps around. Or maybe it's the ratio of the area of the star to something else... Alternatively, I remember that the probability is (R_s / a)^2 times (R_p / R_s)^2, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I should look for the standard formula. Oh, right, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by the probability that the inclination is just right. The probability of the planet transiting is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on relative to our line of sight. So the probability P is (R_p / (a)) * (1 / (π)) or something like that. No, wait, that doesn't fit units.

Alternatively, the formula for transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2 * (something). Hmm, perhaps I should think about the orbital geometry.

The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes directly in front of the star from our perspective. The probability of this happening depends on the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the planet's orbit. The formula I think is P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the units don't make sense. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's angular size as seen from the planet to the planet's orbital angular size as seen from Earth. Or maybe it's the area of the star compared to the area of the orbit's circle. So the probability would be (π R_s^2) / (π a^2) ) * (some function), but that would be (R_s/a)^2. But wait, that would be the area of the star compared to the area of the planet's orbit. But that's not exactly the same as the transit probability.

Wait, actually, the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by some factor, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to look for another approach.

Another thought: the transit probability is higher when the planet is closer to its star because the orbital distance a is smaller, so the ratio (R_p / a) is larger. So Planet_1, which has a shorter orbital period, would be closer to its star, so perhaps it has a higher transit probability.

But wait, the orbital period depends on the star's mass. Kepler's third law says that the period squared is proportional to a^3/(M*), where M* is the mass of the star. So for each planet, their a can be determined based on their period and the star's mass.

Given that, let's try to model this. The period P is given, and M* is known.

Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M*)) a³. So a³ = [G M* P²]/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M* P²)^(1/3).

Wait, but since both planets are around different stars, their a will vary because P and M* are different.

Given:

- Planet_1: Period P1 = P2 / 3 (since P1 is shorter by a factor of 3).
- Host star of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 M2 (since M1 is twice M2).
- Both stars have same radius R_s (since they're evolved but same radii).

We can compute a1 and a2 in terms of M1, M2, and their periods.

Let me write the Kepler's third law for each planet.

For Planet_1:
P1² = (4π² a1³) / (G M1)
=> a1³ = (G M1 P1²) / (4π²)

For Planet_2:
P2² = (4π² a2³) / (G M2)
=> a2³ = (G M2 P2²) / (4π²)

But wait, P1 is (1/3) P2, so P1 = P2/3.

Substituting into a1³:

a1³ = (G M1 (P2/3)^2 ) / (4π²)
= (G M1 P2² )/(9 * 4π²)
= (G M2 (P2)^2 )/(9 *4 π²) ) * (M1/M2) * (M2 cancels because M1 is 2*M2)
Wait, M1 is 2 M2, so M1 = 2 M2.

So substituting M1=2 M2, a1^3 becomes:

a1³ = (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π²)
= (G * 2 M2 * P2² ) / (9 * 4 π² )
= (2 G M2 P2² ) / (36 π² )
= (G M2 P2² ) / (18 π² )

For a2^3: take the formula from Planet_2.

a2³ = (G M2 P2² ) / (4 π² )

So a1³ / a2³ = [ (G M2 P2² ) / (18 π² ) ] / [ (G M2 P2² ) / (4 π² ) ] = (1/18) / (1/4) )= 4/18 = 2/9.

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Alternatively, calculate (2/9)^(1/3):

Take logs: ln(2/9) = ln(2) - ln(9) ≈ 0.6931 - 2.1972 ≈ -1.5041. Divide by 3: -0.5014. Exponentiate: e^(-0.5014) ≈ 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

So a1 = ~0.606 a2.

Now, transit probability: the probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, assuming their planet radii are the same. But wait, the problem says both have the same minimum mass, but not same radius. Wait, the planets' masses are same, but radii are not necessarily same. But the question says: researchers are attempting to detect transits of two Earth-like planets. So perhaps we can assume same radius as Earth? Or perhaps the transit probability formula uses the planet radius, but since both are Earth-like, perhaps same R_p.

Wait, the question says both have same masses, but it's about Earth-like. So maybe their radii are similar. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume R_p1 = R_p2.

So transit probability for each planet would be (R_p / a)^2. Since R_p is same, it's proportional to 1 / a².

So transit probability P1 is proportional to 1/a1², and P2 proportional to 1/a2².

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

We know a1 ≈ 0.606 a2 → a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 ≈ (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

Wait, no, because P1 is proportional to 1/a1², and P2 proportional to 1/a2².

So P1/P2 = (a2²) / (a1²) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

Since a1 is 0.606 a2, a2/a1 is 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65. So (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

Wait, but wait. Another factor: the size of the star. Because the transit probability also depends on the star's size. Because the probability is (R_p + R_s) / a, but wait, earlier I thought it's (R_p/a)^2, but maybe it's (R_s/a)^2 * (R_p/(R_s + R_p))^2 or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me get back. The correct formula for the transit probability is: P = (R_p + R_s) / a * (1 / (something)). No, perhaps not. Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I think I remember that the transit probability is given by P = (R_p / a)^2 * (some function of the orbital inclination). Oh wait, no. Another approach: the transit probability is the relative size of the planet’s orbit compared to the star’s size. Wait, that might not be correct either.

Alternatively, the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough for the transit to occur, which is given by P = (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by (1 / (something about the star's size)). Hmm, perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, I found a source that says the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a)^2 * (R_s / a)^2 / (something). No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can pass in front of the star (from our perspective) to the total possible area. So the planet must be at a position where the line of sight intersects the star. The area where this occurs is a circle with radius R_s, and the total possible area is a circle with radius a (the semi-major axis). But that's not entirely correct because the planet's orbit is 3D, but let's proceed.

So the probability would be (R_s / a)^2. But wait, that's the same as the area of the star compared to the area of the orbit's circle. But that can't be right because if a is very large, the probability becomes very small, which makes sense. But if a is small, the probability is higher. So perhaps the transit probability P is proportional to (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, but according to this, the transit probability depends on both the planet's size and the star's size. So the formula would be P = (R_p / a)^2 * (R_s / a)^2. No, that doesn't make sense, because R_p is much smaller than R_s. So perhaps the main factor is (R_s / a)^2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the more precise formula. According to Wikipedia, the transit probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2). But for circular orbits, e=0, so P = (R_p + R_s)/a.

Wait, but that gives a dimensionless probability only if the units are consistent. Wait, no. Let me think again. The planet will transit if its orbital plane is within a certain angle relative to our line of sight. The area of the sky where this occurs is approximately π (R_s + R_p)^2, and the total possible area is π a^2. So the probability is approximately (R_s + R_p)^2 / a^2. But since R_p is much smaller than R_s, this approximates to (R_s/a)^2.

So P ≈ (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, but that would mean that the probability is higher for stars with smaller a (closer planets) and larger R_s.

In our problem, both host stars have the same radius (same R_s). So the transit probability is proportional to 1/(a^2).

So for each planet, P is proportional to (R_s / a)^2. Since R_s is same for both, it's 1/a².

So P1 is (1 / a1²) and P2 is (1 / a2²). We already found a1 ≈ 0.606 a2. So let's compute the ratio P1/P2.

P1/P2 = (1/a1²) / (1/a2²) ) = (a2²)/(a1²) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

As a1 is about 0.606 a2, a2/a1 is 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65. So (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

Thus, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option D says "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability to transit." That matches our calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the a1 and a2 calculations.

Given:

M1 = 2 M2

P1 = P2 /3.

Using Kepler's third law: a³ ∝ M * P².

For Planet_1:

a1³ ∝ (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 = 2 M2 * P2² / 9.

For Planet_2:

a2³ ∝ M2 * P2².

So a1³/a2³ = (2 /9) → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

(2/9) is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606. So yes, a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72. So approximately 2.7 times higher.

So the correct option is D.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_s}{a} \), where \( R_s \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), the probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \), with \( P \propto \frac{1}{a^2} \).

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_*} \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star, we calculate the semi-major axes of Planet_1 and Planet_2. Let:

- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period),
- \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).

For Planet_1:
\[
a_1^3 \propto M_{*,1} P_1^2 = 2M_{*,2} \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{9} M_{*,2} P_2^2.
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2^3 \propto M_{*,2} P_2^2.
\]

Taking the ratio:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{\frac{2}{9} M_{*,2} P_2^2}{M_{*,2} P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{1}{a^2} \). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{a_1^2}}{\frac{1}{a_2^2}} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} \approx (1.65)^2 \approx 2.72.
\]

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.
