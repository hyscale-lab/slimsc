Okay, so I have this problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, I guess I need to calculate the relative speed between them and the total energy of both astronauts combined.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, wait, I should double-check that.

So, astronaut A has mass 2m moving at 0.6c, astronaut B has mass 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or wait, no, the question says "relative speed", but in relativity, relative velocity depends on the frame. Wait, but the question says "relative speed and the total energy of the system". Wait, the system's total energy would be the sum of both their energies, right?

Wait no, the question is a bit ambiguous but I think it's asking for each astronaut's speed relative to the other. So from A's frame, what's B's speed, and vice versa. Oh wait no, the formula I remember gives the relative velocity between two objects when their velocities are known in another frame. So if both are moving in the same direction, but at different speeds, their relative speed isn't simply 0.6c -0.5c = 0.1c. Because relativistically, that's not correct.

So let's apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is v_rel = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²). Wait, but I'm getting confused about which is which. Let me think: if I'm in the frame of astronaut A, what is astronaut B's speed? Since both are moving in the same direction, but A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c relative to the same origin. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) or something like that. Wait, no, that's when you want to find the velocity of B as seen from A's frame.

Wait, wait, the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the moving object (B) in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the observer's frame (A) in the original frame. So here, the original frame is the one where both are moving, I think.

Wait no, perhaps it's better to think of it as the velocity of B as observed from A's rest frame. So if the lab frame has A moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then what is B's speed in A's frame? Let me set it up: In the lab frame, the speed of A is v = 0.6c and B is u = 0.5c. So from A's frame, the speed of B would be (u' ) = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² )

Wait, so u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c^2) ]

So that's (-0.1c) / [1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)] → (-0.1c)/(1-0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.142857 c. So the relative speed is about 0.1428 c, but since speed is a magnitude, it's 0.14c. But the negative sign just indicates direction. Oh wait, but in the problem, both are moving in the positive x-direction. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, from A's perspective, B is moving slower, so in the same direction but at a lower speed. So the relative speed would be 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Wait, but wait, the options are A to D. Let me check the options:

Option C) v_rel =0.14c , E=5.96 mc^2

Option D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc^2

So both have the same relative speed as 0.14c. Hmm, but wait, wait, did I do the calculation correctly? Let me recalculate.

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) → (-0.1c) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/c²) → (-0.1 c) / (0.7) → -0.142857 c ≈ -0.14c. So the magnitude is 0.14c, so the relative speed is 0.14c. So the relative speed part points to options C and D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. The system's total energy is the sum of the energies of both astronauts. But wait, in relativity, energy is not simply gamma*m*c², but each astronaut's energy is their relativistic kinetic energy plus rest energy, or is it just gamma*m*c²?

Wait, the total energy of each astronaut is gamma * m c². So I should compute the energy for each and sum them.

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for A is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) → 1/sqrt(0.64) → 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy for A: 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for B is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) → 1/sqrt(0.75) → approx 1.1547.

So energy for B: 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = 2.5 mc² + 3.464 mc² = approximately 5.964 mc². Which is about 5.96 mc². So that would match option C which has E=5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C is v=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Option D has E=5 mc², which is less. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the calculation for gamma again.

For A: 0.6c. (0.6)^2 = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. Correct.

Energy A: 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c². Correct.

For B: 0.5c. (0.5)^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)= approx 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So 1.1547 *3m c² = 3.464 m c². Correct.

So sum is 2.5 +3.464 =5.964, which is approximately 5.96. So option C is the correct one.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds. The formula is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v - u}{1 - \frac{vu}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \(v = 0.6c\) (velocity of astronaut A in the lab frame),
- \(u = 0.5c\) (velocity of astronaut B in the lab frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1429c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

#### For Astronaut A:
- Mass = \(2m\),
- Velocity = \(0.6c\).

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For Astronaut B:
- Mass = \(3m\),
- Velocity = \(0.5c\).

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching the Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(0.14c\),
- The total energy is \(5.96mc^2\).

This matches **Option C**.
