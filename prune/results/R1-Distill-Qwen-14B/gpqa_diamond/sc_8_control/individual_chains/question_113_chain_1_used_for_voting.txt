Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. The unknown compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to determine its chemical formula from the given options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

First, I'll break down the information given by each technique.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak here is at 3000. Oh, wait, maybe it's the O-H of an alcohol or maybe an -OH from something else. Alternatively, broad peaks in that region could also be from N-H stretches, but the options don't have nitrogen, so maybe it's O-H.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. A peak around 1700 is typical for a carbonyl like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl group, perhaps an conjugated one, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, but 1650 is a bit lower than a typical ketone. Maybe it's an ester or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated enone system, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid would show a broad O-H around 2500-3000, and a strong carbonyl around 1700. But the FTIR here has a very broad peak at 3000, which could be O-H, but maybe from an alcohol or a phenol.

Wait, the 1700 and 1650 peaks. Another possibility is that the 1700 is a carbonyl group, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. For example, in an aromatic ring with substituents that cause conjugation, the C=C absorption can be around 1600-1650 cm^-1. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an amide, but again, the options don't include nitrogen. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks are from two different carbonyl groups. Like an ester and a ketone. But that's less likely unless it's a complex structure.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the compound has an alkene group. So the structure likely contains an alkene, which would be consistent with a vinyl group in the NMR.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. That's interesting. The m/z 45 is a common fragment, often from a ketone (like acetone, which has a (CH3)2CO fragment giving m/z 58 if I'm not mistaken, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up). Alternatively, 45 could correspond to a different structure. Let me think about possible fragments. For instance, the tropylium ion is m/z 91, but that's not relevant here. Wait, 45 is the molecular ion for something like (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether is 45?), but wait, no, dimethyl ether is (CH3)2O, molecular weight is 45 (since 12*2 + 1*6 +16= 24+6+16=46? Wait, 12*2 is 24, 1*6 is 6, 16 is 16. 24+6=30+16=46. So 46 is dimethyl ether. So m/z 45 must be something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's the fragment from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule has an acetate group (CH3COO-). Let's see, the acetate group is C2H3O2^−. Wait, the molecular weight of CH3COO- is 60? Let me calculate: C=12*2=24, H=3*1=3, O=16*2=32. 24+3+32=59. So in positive ion mode, the fragment would be at 59, but maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 could be a CH3CO (which is 43?), but no, 12 + 16 + 12 + 1 = 41? Hmm, not matching. Wait, another approach: possible molecular formulas and their corresponding molecular weights. Let's see, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Wait, the mass spec gives a fragment peak at 45. Let me think about what fragments would give that. Another possibility is that the fragment is a ketone group. For example, if the molecule breaks off a (CH3)CO group. Wait, the molecular weight of (CH3)CO is 58 (12*3 + 1*6 +16=36+6+16=58), but that would be m/z 58, which isn't matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the fragment of a benzene ring. But benzene itself is 78. Maybe a substituted benzene ring. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a smaller group like CH2O, which is formaldehyde—its molecular weight is 30, which is lower. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from a carbonyl group. Let's think: if the main structure has a carbonyl, maybe in the mass spec, the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, losing a part. So, for example, if the structure is something like an ester or a ketone, the fragment might be a part of that.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck on the mass spec part. Let me think about the other data again to see if I can get more clues.

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. But wait, another possibility is that it's an alkene's C-H stretch, but those are usually around 3000-3100 and might not be as broad. The broadness is more indicative of O-H. So maybe the compound has an alcohol group (-OH). Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be even broader and in a different region, but the data says 3000, which is a bit lower than the typical O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids usually have O-H around 2500-3300, but the peak here is at 3000. So perhaps it's an alcohol.

So if it's an alcohol, that would imply the formula has an -OH group, hence an O. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. So the presence of an O is expected.

Looking at the NMR, the presence of vinyl protons suggests an alkene. So the structure probably has a double bond. So the formula must include a certain number of hydrogens. Let's consider each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -2*2 )/2 = (12+2-12-4)/2= (-2)/2= -1. Hmm, that can't be. Wait, let me recalculate. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

So for option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 =1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU= (12+2-10)/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2. Two degrees: could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU= (12+2-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU= (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So one degree.

In the NMR, we have vinyl protons, which suggests a double bond. So the molecule must have at least one double bond, which accounts for one DoU. So if the molecule has a double bond and an -OH group, that's two DoUs, but wait, the DoU for each option:

Option A: 1 DoU. So that could be either a ring or a double bond. But if it has a double bond (from vinyl H), then the other DoU would have to be from a ring. But wait, option A has only 1 DoU, so if it has a double bond (which is one DoU), it can't have a ring as that would require two. So that suggests that option A doesn't have a ring but a double bond. Wait, but a ring would also contribute a DoU. So if the molecule has a double bond and a ring, that's two DoUs. But option A only has one DoU. So that's a problem. Therefore, option A can't have both a ring and a double bond. So if the molecule has a vinyl group (double bond), then option A would only allow that as the one DoU, but the presence of a ring would bring the DoU to two, which A doesn't have. Therefore, option A can't have a ring, which might be possible. So perhaps the compound is an alcohol with a double bond and no ring.

Looking at the other options:

Option B: C6H10O, DoU=2. So two DoUs. If one is a double bond (from vinyl H), the other could be a ring. So a cyclic structure with a double bond, like a cyclic ether with a double bond. Or maybe a benzene ring? No, benzene is three DoUs. Wait, but if it's a six-membered ring with a double bond elsewhere, that's three DoUs, but option B only has two. So perhaps a five-membered ring with a double bond? Five-membered ring is one DoU, double bond another. So DoU=2. So that's possible.

Option C: C6H10O2, DoU=2. Same as B. So similar possibilities.

Option D: C6H12O, DoU=1. So one DoU, which would have to be a double bond or a ring. Since the NMR shows a vinyl group, the DoU is accounted for by the double bond. So the structure could be an alcohol with a double bond and no rings.

But let's think about the IR again. The FTIR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Wait, 1700 is a carbonyl. So the compound must have a carbonyl group. So that's another DoU. Because a carbonyl is a double bond (C=O), so that's another DoU.

Wait, this complicates things. Because the presence of a carbonyl group adds another DoU. So let me recalculate the DoU for each option, considering that.

If the compound has a carbonyl group (C=O), that's one DoU. If it also has a double bond (from the vinyl group), that's another. So total DoU would be two if it has both. Plus any rings.

Wait, but each option's DoU is as follows:

Option A: DoU=1. So if it has C=O (1 DoU), and a double bond (another DoU), that's two DoUs, but option A only has one. So that's impossible. Therefore, option A can't have both a carbonyl and a double bond. So either the carbonyl is not present, or the double bond isn't present. But the NMR suggests a double bond is present. So option A is out.

Option B: DoU=2. If it has C=O (1) and C=C (another 1), that's 2 DoUs. So that's possible. So it can have both.

Option C: DoU=2. Same as B, so possible.

Option D: DoU=1. So if it has a carbonyl (1 DoU), but no double bond. But the NMR says there are vinyl protons, meaning a double bond. So that's a problem. So option D is out.

So now options are B, C.

Wait, but the FTIR has two carbonyl peaks: 1700 and 1650. So that suggests two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another group nearby. Let me think. A conjugated carbonyl could have a peak at 1650, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. So maybe the 1650 is an aromatic C=C, not a carbonyl. So then, only the 1700 peak is a carbonyl.

Wait, if the 1650 is an aromatic ring, that would fit. So perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester or something like that. Then, the 1700 cm^-1 would be a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone, and the 1650 could be the aromatic C=C.

So, let's reevaluate the DoU.

If the compound has a carbonyl (1 DoU), a double bond (another), and perhaps a ring. Let's see:

For option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So if it has a carbonyl (1), and a ring (another DoU), but where's the double bond? Because the NMR shows vinyl protons, which would mean a double bond. But option B only has two DoUs, which would be carbonyl (1) and ring (1). So where's the DoU for the double bond? That would require three DoUs, but B only has two. So that's impossible. Thus, option B can't have a double bond and a ring. So option B is out.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. If it has a carbonyl (1), and a ring (1), but again, the double bond would require a third DoU. So unless the structure has a carbonyl and a double bond, but no ring, that would sum to two DoUs. Wait, no. Carbonyl (1) and double bond (1) sum to two, so that's possible. So option C can have a carbonyl and a double bond, without a ring.

Wait, but then the 1650 peak would be something else. Let me think about the structure.

Looking at the possible structures:

Option C: C6H10O2. The formula could be something like an ester or a ketone with an alcohol group, but considering O2, perhaps a diol ester or something else. Alternatively, it could be a cyclic ester, but that complicates things.

Wait, let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment peak at m/z=45. Let's see:

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114.

But the fragment is at 45. What's a fragment that would give m/z 45?

Looking at the molecular formula C6H10O2, possible fragments could be:

- If there's an ester group, perhaps the fragment could be (CH3O) which has a molecular weight of 31. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: 45 is 12*(3) + 1*(6) + 16*(0), because 3 carbons and 6 hydrogens: 36 +6=42. No, that's 42.

Alternatively, maybe a fragment with 2 carbons, like (COOCH3):

Wait, COOCH3 is (12 +16*2 +12 +3) = 12 +32 +15 = 59. No.

Wait, perhaps a fragment like (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. That would be (2*12) + (6) +16= 24+6+16=46. Close, but not 45.

Hmm. Maybe a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, another thought: perhaps the fragment is a (CH2)2O group. So (CH2)2O is (2*12) + (4*1) + 16 = 24 +4 +16=44. Close but not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a carbonyl-containing group. For example, if the molecule has a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO), but that's 56.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Suppose the structure is something like methyl cyclohex-2-enecarboxylate. Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with an ester group.

Wait, another thought: The IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group, perhaps indicating a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is much broader and in a different region (like around 2500-3300). The given peak is at 3000, so maybe it's an alcohol.

So, for option C, the formula is C6H10O2. If it's an ester, it would have the structure R-O-CO-R'. Ester groups have two oxygen atoms, which matches the formula.

If the ester is something like methyl something, the molecule would have an ester group (which has a carbonyl, so that explains the 1700 peak) and maybe another carbonyl elsewhere, but wait, the IR only shows two strong peaks in that region—1700 and 1650. So maybe the other peak is not a carbonyl but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is an aromatic ring. So the ester's carbonyl is at 1700, and the ring's C=C is at 1650. So that structure would have a benzene ring and an ester group.

In that case, the NMR would show vinyl protons, which would be the aromatic protons. Wait, aromatic protons are usually in the range of 6.5-8.5 ppm in 1H NMR. But the question says "peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens"—vinyl usually refers to alkenes, not aromatic. So that's confusing. So the vinyl protons must be from an alkene, not an aromatic ring.

Wait, that's an important point. So the NMR has vinyl protons, which are from an alkene (C=C), not an aromatic ring. So the structure must have an alkene (so, a double bond) and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but that brings us back to the degrees of unsaturation.

So, let's reevaluate. The compound has:

- O-H (from IR peak at 3000, broad)
- A carbonyl group (IR 1700)
- An alkene (from vinyl H in NMR)
- Possibly another functional group.

Let's calculate the DoU again.

If the structure has:

- O-H (no effect on DoU)
- C=O (1 DoU)
- C=C (another DoU)
- And perhaps a ring?

Wait, but the options have varying DoUs.

For option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2.

So if the structure has C=O (1) and C=C (1), that's two DoUs. So that's possible. So the O-H is from an alcohol group, and the structure has an ester (C=O) and an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (like a lactone), but that might not have an -OH. Wait, lactones are cyclic esters without an -OH group. So maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe it's a compound with both an ester group (C=O) and an alkene. So, for example, something like an allyl ester.

Now, considering the mass spec fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about what part of the molecule would fragment to give 45.

In an ester, the ester group is R-O-CO-R'. If the molecule breaks at the ester oxygen, perhaps losing the R'CO part, leaving R-O- as a fragment. Alternatively, if the molecule is (CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3), but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a smaller part. Let's consider the molecular formula of option C: C6H10O2. Let's say the molecule breaks into a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. So the fragment has a molecular formula that adds up to 45. Let's see:

Possible candidates:

- C3H6O2: 3*12=36, 6=6, 32=36+6+32=74. No.

Wait, perhaps it's C2H4O: 24 +4 +16=44. Close, but not 45.

Wait, another approach: 45= 12*2 + 1*3 +16*1=24+3+16=43. Not matching. 45-16=29. 29 could be C2H5 (12*2 +5=29). So 29 +16=45. So the fragment is C2H5O. So that's (CH2CH2O), which is ethoxy group. Molecular weight of ethoxy (OCH2CH3) is 45? Let me calculate: 12*2 (for two CH2) + 6 (for 6 H) +16 (O) = 24 +6 +16=46. Hmm, that's 46, not 45.

Wait, maybe it's OCH3 (methoxy), which is 31. No.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3CO (acetate), which is 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16*1=24+3+16=43). Close, but no.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula for the fragment could be C3H7O. Let's compute: 3*12=36,7=7,16=36+7+16=59. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is C3H6O. 36 +6 +16=58. No.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. Let's say the molecule has a (CH3)2CO group. That's (2*12 + 6 +16)=24+6+16=46. So the fragment would be 46, which isn't what we have.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let's think of other possibilities.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is C6H10O2. So the molecular weight is 6*12 +10 + 32=72+10+32=114. The mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So 45 is about 40% of 114. So it's a significant fragment.

What if the molecule breaks into a (CH2)2O group and the rest? (CH2)2O is 44, which is close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a (CH3)COO group, which is 59. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the fragment isn't from the main structure. Maybe it's from a substituent. For example, if there's an ethyl group attached somewhere, the fragment could be (CH2CH3) which is 29. No, not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring. Let's think about that. Benzene is C6H6. So the formula would be something else, but our options don't have C6H6 in them. Wait, the molecular formula is C6H10O2. So if it's a benzene ring, that's 6 C and 6 H (as C6H6), so the remaining would be O2 and 4 H. That would make 4 H, but the formula is C6H10O2, so 10 H in total. So benzene (6 C, 6 H) plus something else. So 4 more H and 2 O. So perhaps it's a substituted benzene with an ester group.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. The options are:

A) C6H12O2 (DoU=1) → can't have both a carbonyl and a double bond.

B) C6H10O (DoU=2) → can have a carbonyl and a double bond, but O is 1, so if it's an ester, that would need two O's. So B is probably not the right choice.

C) C6H10O2 (DoU=2) → possible with a carbonyl and a double bond.

D) C6H12O (DoU=1) → can't have a double bond and a carbonyl.

So the only possible options are C and B. But we've determined that B can't have a double bond and a carbonyl because that would require three DoUs, which it doesn't have. So the only option left that can have a carbonyl and a double bond is C, which is option C.

So putting it all together:

- FTIR: O-H (alcohol), C=O (ester or ketone), and possibly C=C (from the 1650, but if that's the alkene's C=C, then it's a double bond). Wait, but the 1650 cm^-1 is a bit low for a C=C in an alkene. Alkenes usually have C=C around 1650 cm^-1, but conjugated double bonds can be a bit lower. So that peak could be the alkene.

- NMR: vinyl hydrogens → double bond.

- Mass spec: fragment at 45, which I'm still not entirely sure about, but given the other data, option C seems to fit better.

So the formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the unknown compound, we analyze the provided data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry, and compare it with the given options: **C6H12O2**, **C6H10O**, **C6H10O2**, and **C6H12O**.

---

### **FTIR Analysis**
- A **broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol.
- Two **strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of carbonyl groups. The 1700 cm⁻¹ peak is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O), such as an ester or ketone, while the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or an alkene.

---

### **1H NMR Analysis**
- The presence of **peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens** indicates the compound contains an alkene group (C=C). This contributes one degree of unsaturation (DoU).

---

### **Mass Spectrometry**
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** is observed. This is consistent with a fragment containing a methyl group (CH3) and an oxygen atom, such as a methoxy group (OCH3) or a related structure.

---

### **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**
The degrees of unsaturation are calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
\]

- **Option A (C6H12O2):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 12}{2} = \frac{14 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]  
  This compound can only accommodate one degree of unsaturation (e.g., a carbonyl group or a double bond). However, the presence of both a carbonyl and a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens) requires two DoU, making this option invalid.

- **Option B (C6H10O):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 10}{2} = \frac{14 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]  
  This compound can accommodate two degrees of unsaturation. However, the presence of a carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹) and a double bond (vinyl hydrogens) requires two DoU, leaving no room for an additional unsaturation. This makes this option invalid.

- **Option C (C6H10O2):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 10}{2} = \frac{14 - 10}{2} = 2
  \]  
  This compound can accommodate two degrees of unsaturation. The carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹) accounts for one DoU, and the double bond (vinyl hydrogens) accounts for the other. This option is consistent with the data.

- **Option D (C6H12O):**  
  \[
  \text{DoU} = \frac{2(6) + 2 - 12}{2} = \frac{14 - 12}{2} = 1
  \]  
  This compound can only accommodate one degree of unsaturation. However, the presence of a carbonyl group and a double bond requires two DoU, making this option invalid.

---

### **Conclusion**
The compound must have a carbonyl group (C=O), a double bond (C=C), and an O-H group, as indicated by the FTIR and NMR data. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 further supports the presence of a methoxy group or related structure. Among the given options, **C6H10O2** is the only formula consistent with all the data.

**Answer: C**
