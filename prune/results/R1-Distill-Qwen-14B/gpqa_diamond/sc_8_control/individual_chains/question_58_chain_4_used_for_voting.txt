Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results. Regularization introduces a temporary cutoff or some other method to make the math finite, and then you remove it later (renormalization). So the question is about which theory doesn't need this process even at high energies.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate because it's a theory that attempts to unify quantum mechanics with gravity. Unlike some other theories, string theory doesn't have the same kinds of divergences because it's a background-independent theory and includes gravity. Or wait, do string theories still require regularization? I'm a bit confused here. I think superstring theory does involve some regularization steps during calculations, but maybe it's not necessary in the same way as other quantum field theories. Or perhaps because it's a theory that includes gravity, it doesn't have the same issues with renormalization as, say, QED or QCD. Hmm, not sure yet. I'll come back to this.

Option B: QCD. Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory of the strong force. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, right? And it's known for having asymptotic freedom, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. But wait, does that mean it's free from divergences? No, I think QCD still requires regularization because of loop divergences. In fact, QCD calculations often use methods like lattice regularization or others to handle these infinities before renormalization. So QCD does require regularization.

Option C: QED. Quantum Electrodynamics is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that QED has issues with divergences, especially in calculations like the electron self-energy or the Lamb shift. These require regularization techniques. Without regularization, the perturbative expansions blow up. So yes, QED definitely needs regularization. But wait, isn't QED a renormalizable theory, which means you can handle the divergences with renormalization. But regularization is a step before renormalization, so QED does require it.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right! Classical theories don't have the same divergences as quantum ones. In classical electromagnetism, you might have issues with point charges leading to infinite fields, but in reality, I don't think classical ED requires regularization because it's not a quantum theory. Quantum effects are what bring in the divergences. So classical ED doesn't need regularization because it doesn't involve the same kind of infinities that come from quantum loop corrections. So D might be the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the high-energy part? The question specifies at high energies. So which theories have issues at high energies that require regularization?

Wait, maybe I should think about whether each theory is a quantum theory because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So if the theory is classical, like option D, it doesn't require regularization because regularization is used in the quantum realm.

So the question is which of these theories never requires regularization, regardless of energy scale. Because even QED and QCD require it in their quantum versions. So the correct answer would be the classical theory, option D.

Wait, but the other options are all quantum theories except D. So D is the only one that doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum field theory.

So putting it all together: the theory that doesn't require regularization is classical electrodynamics because it's not a quantum theory and doesn't have the divergences that quantum theories have. Therefore, the answer should be D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options as follows:

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  Superstring theory is a quantum theory that attempts to unify quantum mechanics with gravity. While it is background-independent and includes gravity, it still involves divergences that require regularization during calculations. Thus, it does not fit the criterion of never requiring regularization.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is the theory of the strong interaction and is a non-abelian gauge theory. It requires regularization due to loop divergences, even though it has asymptotic freedom at high energies. Therefore, it does not meet the criterion.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is the theory of electromagnetism and is a renormalizable quantum field theory. It requires regularization to handle divergences, such as those in electron self-energy calculations. Hence, it also does not meet the criterion.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical electrodynamics is a non-quantum theory and does not involve the divergences that arise in quantum field theories. Regularization is a concept specific to quantum theories, so classical electrodynamics never requires regularization, even at high energies. This makes it the correct answer.

The theory that never requires regularization at high energies is **Classical Electrodynamics** because it is not a quantum theory and does not encounter the divergences that necessitate regularization.
