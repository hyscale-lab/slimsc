Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that the compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. That usually indicates an O-H stretch, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H peak, maybe even more so than alcohols. Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could that be a ketone or maybe an ester? The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or something else. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but I don't think that's the case here as the options don't include nitrogen.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, maybe in an aromatic ring or perhaps an isolated double bond.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that 45 corresponds to a CH3CO group (like an ethyl fragment, maybe from a ketone or ester cleavage). Wait, the molecular ion peak for CH3CO is 43, but m/z 45 would be something else. Oh, wait, maybe it's a fragment from a larger molecule. Alternatively, 45 could be from a C2H5 group with some oxygen. Hmm, I think it's more likely that the 45 comes from a carbonyl-containing fragment, like maybe an ester or ketone breaking off.

Now, let's look at the options:

A) C6H12O2: This has two oxygen atoms. Possible structures could be esters, which have O in the carbonyl and another O in the ester group. Esters would show a strong carbonyl peak around 1700 cm⁻¹. Plus, an ester group might have an O-H if it's an acid ester, but wait, no, esters are O in the carbonyl and O in the ester linkage (like R-O-CO-O-R'). Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-O-R, I think. Wait, no, esters are RCOOR', so they have two oxygen atoms. So for option A, that's plausible.

B) C6H10O: This has one oxygen. Could be an alcohol or an aldehyde or ketone. If it's a ketone, the FTIR would show a strong peak around 1700, which matches. The broad peak around 3000 might not fit an aldehyde because aldehydes have a sharp peak around 2800. But an alcohol would have a broad peak, so that fits. But wait, if it's a ketone without an O-H, then the broad peak at 3000 might not make sense. So maybe B isn't the best fit unless it's a phenol or something else.

C) C6H10O2: Two oxygen atoms. So this could be a diol, but then the O-H would be broad too. Alternatively, it could be an ester and something else. Or perhaps a carboxylic acid with another group. Wait, a carboxylic acid has a O-H that's very broad, which matches the IR. But then, the 1700 peak could be from the carboxylic acid's carbonyl. But in that case, the molecular formula would need to have at least a COOH group. Let's think about molecular formulas. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2 since COOH is -COOH. But our options are C6H10O2 which is C6H10O2. Let's see: n=6, but 2n would be 12. Oh, wait, that's H12. So C6H12O2 would be a possibility, but that's option A. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

D) C6H12O: One oxygen. Maybe a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group? Or perhaps something like a cyclohexanol derivative. Not sure yet.

Let me go back to the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000 is likely O-H. The 1700 and 1650 could be carbonyls. Wait, two carbonyls? That's unusual. Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and another is an aromatic ring with conjugation (like an aromatic ketone where the C=O is around 1700 and the ring's C=C around 1650). Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is another carbonyl, like an ester or something else. Or maybe it's an amide, but the options don't have N, so probably not.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me think about each option in terms of possible structures and their spectroscopic data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: esters, maybe a cyclic ester like a lactone. If it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1700. The broad peak at 3000 could be from an O-H in an ester? Wait, esters themselves don't have O-H groups unless it's an acid ester. Wait, no, typical esters are RCOOR'; they don't have O-H. So the broad peak would be from something else. But wait, maybe this compound has both an ester and an alcohol group? Or another O-H group, which would suggest more oxygen. Hmm, but the formula only has two oxygen atoms. So maybe a diol with an ester? No, that would need more oxygens. Alternatively, perhaps a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. Possible structures: an aromatic alcohol, like phenol derivative. Phenol has a broad O-H. The 1700 could be a carbonyl, like a benzaldehyde group attached to the ring. But then the NMR would show aromatic and aldehyde protons. But the question says the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are more like CH2=CH groups. So maybe a ring with a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought. The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation can help. For C6H10O2: Degrees of unsat (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X, it's (2*6+2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2= 2. So DoU is 2. That could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc. But the NMR has vinyl H, so there's at least one double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could this be a cyclic ester (lactone) with an aromatic ring? Or perhaps an aromatic ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ester or something else. Wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid with a double bond. Let's say it's a cyclic ester. But would that give the correct mass spec?

The mass spectrum shows a peak at m/z 45. So what fragments could give 45? The molecular ion might break into smaller fragments. Let me think about common fragments. The CH3CO+ fragment is at 43. But 45 is two more than that. Hmm. Maybe a CH2COO group? Wait, if you have an ester, like R-O-CO-O-R, but I'm not certain.

Wait another angle: the molecular formula is either C6H10O, C6H10O2, etc. Let's compute the possible molecular weights.

Option A: C6H12O2: M = (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) =72 +12 +32= 116. So the molecular ion would be around 116. If it breaks into a CH3CO group, which is 43, but 116-43=73, so maybe the main ion is 116, but the fragment would be 43. But the question says a fragment at 45. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Option B: C6H10O: M = (6*12)+(10*1)+(16) =72 +10 +16= 98. So main ion at 98. If it breaks off a group with m/z 45, that would leave 53. Not sure if that's a common fragment.

Option C: C6H10O2: molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. So the main ion would be 114. A fragment at 45 would imply splitting off a 45 part. So 114-45=69. I'm not sure what fragments would give 45. Another possibility is that the 45 comes from another part of the molecule.

Option D: C6H12O: M=6*12 +12 +16=72+12+16=100. So main ion 100. 100-45=55. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 45 could come from the loss of a CH2CH2O group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2=CHCO group? Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the mass spec peak at 45. Sometimes, in mass spectrometry, the base peak is the molecular ion, but in some cases, the most abundant fragment is the base peak. So for the compound, maybe the molecular weight is higher than 45, and the fragment is at 45. So if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is 114, the 45 fragment would imply a part is broken off, maybe a ketone group. Alternatively, maybe the 45 is from a methyl ester group or something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be an ester like methyl cyclopentanoate or something. Let's say it's methyl something. The ester would have a carbonyl at ~1700 cm⁻¹. The broad peak at 3000 might not fit since esters typically don't have O-H, unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. But if the structure has an alcohol group elsewhere, perhaps. Or maybe it's a diester? Hmm, maybe not.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's say it's an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate. Wait, phenyl acetate would be C6H5COO-C6H5, but that would be C12H10O2, which is much bigger. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester (lactone) with an aromatic ring. Or perhaps a diethyl ester of a diacid? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the FTIR has peaks at 1700 and 1650. If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700. The 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like a benzene ring with substituents. So maybe the compound is an aromatic ester with a benzene ring. But then the molecular formula would have more carbons. Wait, the formula is C6H10O2. Benzene is C6H6. So if it's a benzene ring plus another group.

Wait, benzene (C6H6) would require the other part to be O2 and some H. Let's see: C6H6 plus something.

Wait, another possibility is that it's an aromatic acid with an ester group. Wait, but that might need more oxygen.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde with an ester group. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, what about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that there's a double bond somewhere, maybe in an alkene. So perhaps the structure has a conjugated system, like an enone (a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl group).

So maybe the compound is something like cyclohexenone or a substituted version. Wait, cyclohexenone is C6H10O. That's option B. Its structure is a six-membered ring with one double bond and a ketone group. But that would have a molecular formula of C6H10O. Let's check the data:

FTIR: 3000 cm⁻¹ would be a broad peak, but cyclohexenone has a ketone (C=O) at ~1700. The 1650 peak might be from the conjugated double bond (C=C) in the ring. So the IR would have peaks at ~1700 and ~1650, which matches. The broad peak at 3000 – would that make sense? Cyclohexenone doesn't have an O-H group, so why the broad peak? Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe that's not the case. Unless the compound has another group with O-H.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an enol ester. Enol esters have a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl, but I'm not sure about the IR in that case.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a di-substituted benzene ring with a ketone group and an ester group. Wait, but the formula is C6H10O2. Let me think.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures and the mass spec. The fragment at 45. Let's calculate possible fragments based on the molecular formula.

For option C (C6H10O2), molecular weight is 114. If it breaks off a group of 45, then the remaining fragment would be 69. But 45 is 45, which is 45 g/mol. What groups have a mass of 45? Let's see:

- C3H7O: (3*12)+(7*1)+(16)=36+7+16=59 → no.

Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think: 45 is 12*3 (36) + 9 → maybe CH3COO- (59?), no. Wait, wait. Let me think of possible fragments. 

Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CO+ which is acetone, but acetone is (propan-2-one), which is C3H6O. Its molecular weight is 58. No, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's think of possible functional groups. Two oxygens, so either two hydroxyls, an ester, a ketone, etc. Or a combination.

Wait, another thought: The 45 fragment could be from a CH₂CH₂COOH group. Wait, CH₂CH₂COOH is propanoic acid, which has a molecular weight of 72. No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH₂=CHCOO group. Let me calculate: CH₂=CHCOO has a molecular weight of (2*12) + (4*1) + (16*2) = 24 +4 +32=60. No, that's 60, not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the 45 could be from a fragment like CH₂=CH-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a double bond cleavage. In mass spec, when a double bond is cleaved, the fragments can form. For example, in an ester with a double bond, the cleavage could produce a smaller fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the 45 comes from a COOCH2CH2 group. Let's see, COOCH2CH3 is an ethyl ester group. Its molecular weight is 12*2 (COO) + 12 (CH2CH3) + 1*4 (H) +16*2 (O) → wait, COOCH2CH3 is CH3COOCH2CH3? No, that's the ethyl acetate. Wait, molecular weight of ethyl acetate is 88. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, maybe the 45 is from a CH2CH2O group. No, that's 44 (CH2CH2O: 24 + 2 +16=42? No, wait, 12*2 +1*4 +16 = 24+4+16=44, but it's 45. Hmm, close.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3COO group. CH3COO is 59 (12*2 + 3*1 + 16*2=24+3+32=59), which is higher than 45.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2COO group but that's 43. 43 is less than 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, which is 44, but the peak is at 45—so that's close but not exact. Maybe there's something else involved.

Wait, perhaps the 45 is from a different structure. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's think about what structures that could make. One possibility is an aromatic ester with a substituent. For example, methyl benzoate is C6H5COOCH3. Wait, but that would be C8H8O2, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester derived from a cyclic compound. For instance, a cyclic ester with an ester group attached. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclopentanone with an ester group.

Wait, another approach: The IR data shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H stretch. Also, the 1700 and 1650 peaks. So perhaps the molecule has a ketone group (1700) and an aromatic ring (1650). So maybe it's a benzophenone derivative, but that would have more carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a carbonyl and a benzene ring. So like acetophenone, which is C6H5COCH3. Its molecular formula is C8H8O. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is not aromatic. Let me think about non-aromatic possibilities. For example, a di-substituted cyclohexenone ester.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with a ketone and an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the broad peak in IR at 3000 could be from an alcohol (O-H). So the compound might have both an alcohol and a carbonyl group, but that would require more oxygen. Wait, option C has two oxygens, so if it's an alcohol and a carbonyl group, that would fit. So, for example, a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, but then the NMR shows vinyl protons. So perhaps it's a di-substituted cyclohexanol with a ketone group. But that would need to fit the molecular formula.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like (CH2)2CO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let's consider the molecular formula and possible structures. For option C, C6H10O2: possible structures include:

1. An ester: RCOOR', where R and R' contribute to the formula. Let's say R is C3H5O and R' is C3H5O. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, R is C4H7O and R' is something else. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted succinic acid ester? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a structure with a double bond and an ester group. Let's say it's something like CH2CHCOOR, but not exactly.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: an ester with a cyclic structure or a diol with a ketone? Wait, but the IR has a broad peak, which suggests an O-H, maybe an alcohol. The 1700 peak is a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a diol with a ketone. But that would require more than two oxygen atoms. No, because C6H12O2 has two oxygens. So perhaps a cyclic ester (lactone) which has one oxygen from the ester and another from the ring? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexanol with a ketone group. Wait, but that would require more oxygens. No, because C6H12O2 would have only two oxygens.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the compound is a diethyl ester of a ketone. No, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, it's a substituted benzoic acid ester, but the molecular formula isn't matching.

Hmm.

Maybe I should look for the presence of the vinyl hydrogens. So, the structure must have a double bond. So let's think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. So if it's a ring, maybe cyclohexane with an ester group. But where would the O-H come from? Hmm. Alternatively, a double bond and an ester. So for instance, cyclohexene with an ester group.

Wait, maybe it's a structure like cyclohexene with an ester substituent. But I'm not sure about the IR.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc. The presence of vinyl H suggests a double bond. So perhaps the structure has a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible structures for each option and see which one fits the data.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be a benzene ring (3 DoU) but that's not possible here. So maybe a cyclohexene with a ketone. So, cyclohexenone is C6H10O, which fits option B. But then the IR would have a peak at ~1700 (ketone) and the 1650 might be the conjugated double bond. But the broad peak at 3000 would require an O-H, which cyclohexenone doesn't have. So that's a problem.

So maybe option B isn't the correct choice.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or a double bond. The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond. So maybe a cyclohexene with an alcohol group.

So structure could be cyclohexene with a hydroxyl group. So would that fit the IR data? The broad peak at 3000 would be the O-H. The 1700 peak? Wait, where would that come from. Oh, no, cyclohexene with an alcohol doesn't have a carbonyl group. So that's a problem. So the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 wouldn't fit. So option D is probably not correct.

So we're left with options A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of Unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2=(14-12)/2=1. So one ring or a double bond.

If it's a ring, maybe a cyclohexane ring with an ester group. But where would the O-H come from? Unless it's an alcohol as well, but that would require more oxygen. So perhaps a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Lactones have an ester group and a ring. So, the structure would be a ring with an ester functional group.

So, in that case, the FTIR would show a carbonyl at 1700 (ester) and possibly a ring (no O-H unless it's also an alcohol). But if it's a lactone, the ester would come from an intramolecular ester, which doesn't have an O-H. So that's a problem because the IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H.

Wait, unless there's another hydroxyl group. But with formula C6H12O2, that would require another O. I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester, but that would require more oxygens. Not possible with O2.

Hmm.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Degrees of Unsaturation is 2. So possibilities include a benzene ring (3 DoU) which is not possible, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Wait, maybe the structure is a substituted cyclopentanone with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the presence of two carbonyl peaks in the IR. One at 1700 (maybe ester or ketone) and another at 1650. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring. But wait, if the structure is a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, that would have a peak around 1650. But then the molecular formula would be C7H6O (for benzaldehyde, but that's just an example). Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an amide, but that's not an option here.

Wait, another thought: The 1650 peak could be an conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. So the structure might have a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl group. That would explain the peaks at 1700 and 1650.

So, if the structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, which would have a conjugated system. The IR would show a peak at 1700 (ketone) and 1650 (conjugated C=C). That makes sense.

Additionally, the presence of vinyl H in the NMR would fit with the conjugated double bond.

But then, the O-H peak at 3000 would require an -OH group. So perhaps the structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone with an alcohol group.

So the molecular formula would need to include both a ketone and an alcohol group. So, for example, something like cyclohexenone with an -OH group. But then the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

So, putting it together:

IR:

- Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹: O-H (alcohol)
- 1700 cm⁻¹: ketone (C=O)
- 1650 cm⁻¹: conjugated double bond (C=C)

NMR: vinyl hydrogens (the conjugated double bond)

Mass spec: fragment at 45. If the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone with an alcohol, perhaps the mass spec break occurs after losing a CH2 group or something else, leading to a fragment with a mass of 45.

Alternatively, the 45 could come from a cleavage of the conjugated system. For example, a cleavage between the ketone and the double bond, leading to a fragment with a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: The molecular formula is C6H10O2. If it's (CH₂=CHCO)-something. Wait, CH₂=CHCO has 3 carbons. Then the rest would be 3 carbons (to make 6), but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a structure like CH₂=CH-CO-O-R. Wait, but that would require more oxygens.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentenone derivative with an ester group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzaldehyde with an ester group. But again, the formula might not fit.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the possible molecular ion and see how the 45 comes about.

Assuming the compound is C6H10O2 (option C), molecular weight is 114. If the molecular ion breaks into two parts, one of which is 45. So 114 - 45 = 69. So the other fragment would be 69.

But what's a 45 fragment? Maybe a ketone group. Wait, acetone is 58. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the 45 comes from a CH3COO- group. CH3COO- is 59, but that's close. Or maybe a CH2=CHCO group. Let's calculate: CH2=CHCO has molecular weight of (12*3)+(2*1)+(1*4)+(16*1) → 36+2+4+16=58. Still not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH2=CH2O group. Let's calculate: (2*12) + (4*1) + 16 = 24+4+16=44. Close to 45 but not exactly. Perhaps with an additional hydrogen?

Alternatively, if it's a CH2=CH-O group attached to something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The 45 could be a fragment from the cleavage of an ester group. For example, in an ester RCOOR', the cleavage could lead to a fragment corresponding to the RCO group. So RCO would have a mass of (R's mass)+ (12+16). For example, if R is CH2CH2, then RCO would be (28) + 28=56. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if R is CH2, then RCO is (14) + (28)=42. Close to 45, but not quite.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 45 comes from an aldehyde group. The aldehyde would be CHO (29 g/mol), but that's not 45. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2CHO group, which is 59. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is from a methyl group attached to something. Not sure.

Another thought: the 45 could be from a fragment that includes the carbonyl group. For example, a fragment that's (CH3)2CO (acetone) is 58, but that's higher. So not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is from a loss of a larger fragment. For example, the molecule loses a 69 fragment, leaving 45. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Given all that, I think the best fit is option C: C6H10O2.

Because:

- The IR shows O-H (alcohol), ketone (1700), and conjugated C=C (1650).
- The NMR shows vinyl H, which fits the conjugated double bond.
- The mass spec fragment at 45 could be from a cleavage involving the carbonyl group.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is C) C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The spectroscopic data provided the following insights:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:  
   - A very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol.  
   - A strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, possibly a ketone or ester.  
   - Another strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ could correspond to a conjugated C=C bond or an aromatic ring.  

2. **1H NMR Analysis**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (protons on a double bond) indicate the presence of a double bond in the structure.  

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests the presence of a smaller fragment, possibly from a cleavage involving a carbonyl group or a conjugated system.  

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**:  
  This formula has two oxygen atoms. A plausible structure could be a cyclic ester (lactone) or an ester with a double bond. However, the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H group, which is not consistent with a typical ester. Additionally, the degrees of unsaturation (1) do not account for the presence of a double bond and a carbonyl group.  

- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**:  
  This formula has one oxygen atom. A possible structure is cyclohexenone, which has a ketone group and a double bond. However, cyclohexenone lacks an O-H group, making the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ inconsistent with this option.  

- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**:  
  This formula has two oxygen atoms. A plausible structure is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone with an alcohol group. The IR peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ (ketone) and 1650 cm⁻¹ (conjugated C=C) are consistent with this structure. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O-H group, and the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR support the presence of a double bond. The fragment at m/z = 45 in the mass spectrum could arise from a cleavage involving the carbonyl group.  

- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**:  
  This formula has one oxygen atom. A possible structure is a cyclohexene with an alcohol group. However, the IR peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ cannot be explained by this structure, as it lacks a carbonyl group.  

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data and molecular formula are most consistent with **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**, which corresponds to an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone with an alcohol group.  

Answer: C
