Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. They want the mean decay distance. The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so it's a really tiny distance, probably involving some quantum mechanics principles.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The idea is that the longer the lifetime, the further the particle can travel before decaying. But since particles are moving at relativistic speeds, especially with high energies, the distance would be speed multiplied by lifetime.

Oh right, the formula for the mean decay distance is c * τ, where c is the speed of light and τ is the mean lifetime. But how do I find τ given the width Γ?

I remember that the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (Γ) and the time uncertainty (τ) is on the order of ħ. So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Therefore, τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait. Let me get the formula straight. The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime in natural units. So yes, that makes sense.

So, first, I need to calculate τ = ħ / Γ. Then multiply by c to get the distance. But I have to make sure all the units are consistent.

But wait, the production energy E is given as 8 GeV, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. Hmm, I'm not sure if I need that. Maybe the decay width is given, so maybe the production energy isn't directly needed here. Or perhaps the velocity is involved because the decay distance depends on the particle's speed.

Ah, right, the mean decay length depends on the particle's velocity. So the formula is:

L = γ * β * c * τ

Where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is v/c, and τ is the proper lifetime. So I'll need to find the Lorentz factor and beta for the particle.

But wait, what's the particle's energy? The production energy is 8 GeV. So the particle's kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy is 8 GeV. Wait, no, in high-energy physics, E is often the total energy. So E_X = 8 GeV would be the total energy of the meson.

So, the total energy E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). Let's compute that.

But wait, m is given as 1.2 GeV/c², so m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV. Therefore, γ = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... Approximately 6.6667.

So γ is about 6.6667. Then, β can be found from γ. Because γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²), so β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Let me compute that. γ squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (6.6667)^2 ≈ 44.444. So 1/γ² is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approx 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887.

So now, L = γ * β * c * τ. But I need to compute τ first.

Tau is ħ / Γ. Let's compute the values in appropriate units.

But wait, the units: ħ is in J·s, but I'm working with GeV and MeV. I think it's easier to convert everything into compatible units.

Hmm, let me think about the units:

We can write ħ in GeV·s. Let me recall that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So 1 GeV·s is (1e9 eV) * (1 s) = 1e9 * 1.602e-19 J·s. But perhaps there's a more convenient way.

Wait, 1 GeV = 1.0e9 eV = 1.0e9 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 1.602e-10 J. And ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, let's compute ħ in GeV·s. Since 1 GeV ≈ 1.602e-10 J, then ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 1.602e-10 ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Now, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, compute the decay length L = γ * β * c * τ.

We have γ ≈ 6.6667, β ≈ 0.9887, c is the speed of light, approx 3e8 m/s. So:

L = 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 6.6667 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.596 (since 6.6667 * 0.9887 is roughly 6.6667*(1-0.0113) ≈ 6.6667 - 0.075 ≈ 6.5917. Hmm, more accurately, 6.6667 * 0.9887: 6.6667 * 0.9 = 6.0, 6.6667 *0.08=0.5333, 6.6667 *0.0087≈0.058. Add up: 6.0 +0.5333=6.5333 +0.058=6.5913. So approx 6.5913.)

So 6.5913 * 3e8 m/s = 1.9774e9 m/s.

Multiply by τ (2.056875e-24 s):

1.9774e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (1.9774 * 2.056875) * 1e9 * 1e-24 m = approx (4.065) * 1e-15 m.

Wait, let me compute 1.9774 * 2.056875:

1.9774 * 2 = 3.9548.

1.9774 * 0.056875 ≈ approx 0.1123.

So total is about 3.9548 + 0.1123 = 4.0671.

So 4.0671e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 and option C is 5.0223e-15. Hmm, so my approximate calculation gives ~4.067e-15 m, which is closest to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait calculating beta: when gamma is 6.6667, beta squared is 1 - (1/gamma^2) = 1 - 1/(44.444) ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. That seems right.

Gamma: 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6666667.

Hmm, maybe I should compute more accurately:

Gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666666667.

Gamma squared is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.44444444.

So 1/gamma² = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

Beta = sqrt(0.9775). Let's compute that more accurately.

What's sqrt(0.9775)?

Well, 0.9887^2 is 0.97756. So that's about 0.9887.

So beta is approximately 0.9887, as I had before.

So gamma * beta = 6.6666667 * 0.9887 = let's calculate this more precisely.

6.6666667 * 0.9887:

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 0.6666667 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.6666667 * (1 - 0.0113) ≈ 0.6666667 - 0.0075444 = 0.6591223.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.6591223 ≈ 6.5913223.

So 6.5913223.

Then, multiply by c (3e8 m/s):

6.5913223 * 3e8 = 1.97739669e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):

1.97739669e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.97739669 * 2.056875 = let's compute that.

1.97739669 * 2 = 3.95479338.

1.97739669 * 0.056875 = approximately 0.11223.

So 3.95479338 + 0.11223 ≈ 4.06702.

So 4.06702e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So the exact value is close to that. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me think again: Does the decay width relate to the lifetime as τ= ħ/(Γ), or is there a factor of 2pi involved?

Wait, I remember that the relation between the mean lifetime and the decay width is Γ = ħ * (1/τ). So Γ = ħ / τ → τ = ħ / Γ.

Yes, that's correct. So that part was right.

Alternatively, sometimes people use Γ = ħ * (width in energy), but I think the formula is correct because Γ has units of energy, and ħ has units of energy*time, so dividing ħ by Γ gives time. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, another thought. The decay width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime via Γ = ħ cτ. Wait, no, wait: The decay width Γ is ħ divided by the lifetime τ. So Γ = ħ / τ → so τ = ħ / Γ. So that's correct.

Wait, but sometimes people express Γ in natural units where ħ=1, and then Γ has units of inverse time, so Γ=1/tau. But when you're working in SI units, you have to include ħ.

So the formula I used should be correct.

Thus, the calculation seems to hold.

So the mean decay distance is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B, 4.0655e-15 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \),

we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \),

we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substituting:
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, compute \( \gamma \beta \):

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6667 \cdot 0.9887 \approx 6.5913.
\]

Then, compute \( \gamma \beta c \):

\[
\gamma \beta c = 6.5913 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \approx 1.9774 \times 10^9 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Finally, multiply by \( \tau \):

\[
L = 1.9774 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated mean decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).
