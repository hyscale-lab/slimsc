Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. Got it.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the conductor was initially uncharged. But when the charge +q is placed in the cavity, how does that affect things? I remember that in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor redistribute themselves, especially when there's a cavity involved.

Oh right! When you have a conductor with a cavity and you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface gets an induced charge opposite to q. But wait, the conductor itself was neutral, so the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface remains neutral because the total charge of the conductor is zero. Or wait, no— if the conductor was initially neutral, the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance? No, wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. The inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make sure the total is zero. Wait no, no. Let's think again.

Wait, the conductor is neutral (uncharged). The cavity has a charge +q. So the charges in the conductor will redistribute: the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the cavity's charge +q will attract opposite charges to the inner surface. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q, because the total inner charge is -q, so the outer is +q to balance. Hmm, no, wait. The conductor's total charge is zero, so if the inner surface is -q, the outer surface must be +q so that the sum is zero. Or wait, no. Because the conductor as a whole is uncharged, the sum of the inner and outer surface charges must be zero.

Wait, the inner surface is -q, so the outer must be +q. Right, because conductor's total charge is zero, so outer surface is +q. That makes sense.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So when considering the electric field at P, it's affected by the charges on the conductor. However, the charges on the conductor's outer surface are distributed in a way that depends on the geometry. But for a spherical conductor, the outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution if no other external fields are present. Wait, but in this case, the cavity isn't at the center, so the conductor isn't symmetric around the charge q. So the outer surface's charge distribution might not be uniform. Hmm, but wait, no. Because the conductor is a sphere, regardless of where the cavity is, the outer surface is a sphere. So any external points would see the outer surface as a point charge. Wait, but in reality, the charge distribution on the outer surface depends on the cavity's position. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the cavity is inside the conductor. The conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a sphere. The inner surface is a sphere as well (the cavity's surface). So when the charge +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface develops a charge -q, and the outer surface ends up with +q. Wait, but the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q, summing to zero. Wait, no, because the conductor's own charge is zero. Oh, no, wait! The conductor was uncharged, so when +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, leaving the conductor's remaining charge as +q on the outer surface. Because the conductor's original charge is zero. So the inner is -q, outer is +q. So the total charge on the conductor is zero.

But wait, the outer surface's charge is distributed. So when I'm looking for the electric field at a point outside the conductor, the field would be due to the outer surface's charge. But since the outer surface is a sphere, the field at any external point would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field outside is as if the charge is at the center of the sphere. But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a sphere, and any point outside would feel the field as if the charge were at the center. So the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed) / r², where r is the distance from the center of the sphere.

Wait, but in this problem, the conductor's outer surface has +q charge. So the field at P outside should be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L)^2, because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

Wait, but wait, because the charge on the outer surface is +q, that's the charge that creates the field at P. So the field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². That would correspond to option B.

But let me double-check. The charge inside the cavity is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface. The conductor itself was uncharged, so the outer surface must have +q. Then, the field outside is due to the +q, and since P is outside, the field is as if the +q is at the center. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So option B.

Wait, but why are the other options there? Let's think. Option A is (l - s cos θ)^2 in the denominator. That seems to be considering the position of the charge relative to the point P, but for a conductor, the external field is only due to the outer charges, and it's as if the charge is at the center. So the position of the cavity's center (the s and l and theta) wouldn't matter for the external field. Because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, and the field outside depends only on the total charge enclosed, which is +q.

So all the other options are probably trying to trick you into thinking about the inner cavity's charge distribution. But for a point outside, it's only the outer charge that matters, and it's treated as a point charge at the center.

So the correct answer is B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside it. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Charge Distribution on the Conductor**:  
   - Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the total charge on the conductor is zero.  
   - The charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity).  
   - To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge of $+q$.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   - For points outside the conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor.  
   - The outer surface of the conductor is a sphere, and the charge $+q$ on the outer surface is distributed uniformly due to the spherical symmetry.  
   - The electric field at any external point, such as $P$, is therefore equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the center of the conductor.  
   - The distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$ is $L$, so the magnitude of the electric field is given by:  
     \[
     E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
     \]

3. **Eliminating Other Options**:  
   - **Option A**: This expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which suggests a dependence on the geometry of the cavity and the point $P$. However, for points outside the conductor, the field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and not on the cavity's position or geometry.  
   - **Option C**: This expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ in the denominator, which is also inconsistent with the fact that the field outside the conductor is determined solely by the charge on the outer surface.  
   - **Option D**: This expression assumes the field depends on $l^2$, which is incorrect because the field at $P$ depends on $L^2$, not $l^2$.  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it correctly accounts for the field due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor.

### Final Answer:
Answer: B
