Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so its titration with a strong base like NaOH should form the acetate ion.

Alright, the problem states that we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. So first, I probably need to find the new concentration after dilution. I remember the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be M1 * V1 / V2. 

Let me calculate that. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL, and V2 is 40 mL (since 20 +20=40). So M2 = (0.05 M * 20 mL) / 40 mL = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is about the pH at 25% titration, and the second part is the pH at the equivalence point. Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially. So I need to compute the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 mL, which is 0.04 L. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. 

Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed to reach equivalence would be moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. Wait, but the question says 25% titration, so I might not need this right now, but I'll come back to it.

At equivalence, the acetic acid would have been completely neutralized to produce acetate ions. The solution would contain sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution should be basic. The pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

So, for the equivalence point pH: the concentration of acetate ions. The total volume at equivalence is 40 mL (original) + 10 mL (NaOH) =50 mL or 0.05 L. Moles of acetate is 0.001 moles. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. 

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. 

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. Oh no, wait: Kb is Kw divided by Ka. So 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10. So Kb is about 5.4e-10.

The concentration of OH- can be found using the approximation for weak bases. [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C). C is 0.02 M. So sqrt(5.4e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.08e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. pH is 14 - pOH. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH≈14-4.98=9.02. Hmm, but none of the options have 9.02 around. Wait, looking at the options, option D says 6.92 and 7.00, which doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe I used the wrong Kb. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the solution more accurately.

Another approach: The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so in solution, it will hydrolyze to produce OH- ions. The Kb is correct. Let me recompute the [OH-].

Kb = 5.405e-10. C=0.02 M.

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH-], so Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so approx 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.48. pH is 14 -5.48=8.52. Wait, that's about 8.52. Looking at the options, option A has 8.52 as the second value. So at equivalence, pH would be 8.52. But wait, let's check the options. Option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Hmm, but I thought equivalence point pH would be around 8.52.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the acetate concentration. Let me recheck. 

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added is 0.001 mol (from 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol acetic acid). The NaOH added is 10 mL of 0.1 M, which is 0.001 mol. So total volume is 40 +10=50 mL=0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That part seems correct.

So Kb is correct, and the calculation leads to pH around 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52. So looking at options, option A has 8.52 as the second value, and option D has 6.92. So if the equivalence point is 8.52, then one of the options must have that.

Wait, but none of the options except A have the second value as 8.52. So maybe the equivalence point is 8.52, and the first value (25% titration) is 4.26 (option A). But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but let me think about the 25% titration part. 25% of what? 25% of the equivalence volume. The equivalence volume is 10 mL, as computed earlier. So 25% of that is 2.5 mL. So at 2.5 mL NaOH added, what's the pH?

At 25% titration, we're at 2.5 mL NaOH added. So let's find the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So moles of acid reacted = 0.00025 mol. Remaining moles of acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 =0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L. So concentrations are:

[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

So now, the solution is a buffer solution, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253, which rounds to 4.26.

So at 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26, and at equivalence, pH is approximately 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. So that must be the correct option.

Wait but wait, I thought earlier the equivalence point calculation gave 8.52, which is in option A. So that's consistent.

But let me check the options again. Option A says 4.26; 8.52. So that would be the correct answer. But wait, let me think again about the equivalence point. Another way: the pH could be calculated using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base. So, the concentration is 0.02 M acetate. Kb = Kw / Ka = 5.405e-10. The Kb is 5.405e-10, and the concentration is 0.02 M.

Another approach is using the approximation:

OH- concentration = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. pOH is about 5.48, so pH is 8.52. So that's correct.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option A: 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, looking at the options again, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Wait, did I make a mistake in the 25% calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the 25% titration. Let's recompute the Henderson-Hasselbalch.

Moles of HA (acetic acid) = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of A^- = 0.00025 mol.

Total volume = 40 + 2.5 =42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

[HA] = 0.00075 /0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

So pH = pKa + log(0.3333) = 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253 ≈4.25, which rounds to 4.26. So that's correct.

So the two pH values are 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence. So the correct option is A.

Wait but looking at the options again, option A is '4.26;8.52' which matches. But wait, the options given are:

A)4.26;8.52

B)3.17;6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

So the correct answer is option A. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought another approach might have a different result, but I can't see where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume after adding NaOH. Let me think again. At 25% titration, the volume is 2.5 mL, so total volume is 20+20=40 mL plus 2.5 mL=42.5 mL. Correct.

Hmm, everything else seems correct. So I think the correct answer is A.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the initial concentration is \( M_1 = 0.05 \, \text{M} \), \( V_1 = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \), and \( V_2 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 \). The diluted concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1 \cdot V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \cdot 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we analyze the two parts of the question: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at the equivalence point.

---

### **1. pH at 25% Titration**

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume has been reached. The equivalence volume is calculated as:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \cdot 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]
\[
\text{Equivalence volume} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, \( 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 \) of \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \, \text{NaOH} \) has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \cdot 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with \( 0.00025 \, \text{mol} \) of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]
\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion formed} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Acetic acid}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{Acetate ion}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{Acetate ion}]}{[\text{Acetic acid}]} \right),
\]
\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73,
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \).

---

### **2. pH at the Equivalence Point**

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The total moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{Acetate ion}] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.4 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{Acetate ion}]} \implies [OH^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{Acetate ion}]} = \sqrt{(5.4 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.020} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \( 8.52 \).

---

### **Final Answer**

The pH at 25% titration is \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is \( 8.52 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
