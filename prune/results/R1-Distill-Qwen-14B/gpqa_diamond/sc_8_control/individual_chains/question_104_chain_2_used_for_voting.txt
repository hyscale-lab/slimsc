Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think through this. So, the question says that two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun, have each been found to have a planet with Neptune-like mass. The planets are in circular orbits, so that's good.

The detection is done using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect the shift in the spectral lines. The amount of shift relates to the star's velocity.

So, for Planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift (or the velocity) is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula I remember is something like v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But wait, since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are solar mass, M_p is much smaller than M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the mass of the sun. So we can approximate that as M_star.

So the formula simplifies a bit. Let me think again. The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is given by v = ( (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2π/P) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the semi-amplitude of the velocity, K. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / P ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(0.5) )

But since e is zero (circular orbit), that term drops out. Also, M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So,

K ≈ [ (G * M_p ) / (M_star^2) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3 )

Wait, wait, maybe I should get the formula correctly. Another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^2 ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(0.5) )

But again, since M_p << M_star, we can write:

K ≈ ( (G M_p) / M_star² )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3 )

So, K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) * (1 / M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but in this problem, M_p is the same for both planets, right? Because both have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is same for both.

So, K is inversely proportional to (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3). But since the stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_star is the same for both, so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait wait, let me think again. K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^2 )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3)

So, since M_p is same, M_star is same, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3). So P is proportional to (K)^(-3)

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the relationship between K and P.

If K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3)), then P ∝ (1 / K )^3. So the ratio of P2 to P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Because let's say P ∝ 1/K^3, so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases.

So, in the question, Planet #1 has K1 =5 miliangstrom, Planet #2 has K2=7 miliangstrom.

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because I think K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So substituting the values: K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

Wait, but wait. Wait, because K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so K2 = (something) * (1/P2^(1/3)), K1 = same something * 1/P1^(1/3).

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). So (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Therefore, P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3.

Wait, no. Let me write it down:

K ∝ (1/P)^(1/3), so K = C * (1/P)^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So, K = C / P^(1/3).

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3) → P1^(1/3) = C / K1 → P1 = (C/K1)^3.

Similarly, P2 = (C/K2)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (C/K2^3) / (C/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So yes, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, wait. Because:

P1 = (C / K1)^3

P2 = (C / K2)^3

So P2/P1 = (C/K2)^3 / (C/K1)^3 ) = (K1^3)/(K2^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, that makes sense. So since K1 is smaller than K2, P2 is larger than P1.

Wait, because 5 <7. So K1=5, K2=7. So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, so that's about 0.364, which is approximately 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't get the ratio reversed.

Wait, the answer is P2 is longer than P1 by a factor of (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1? No, wait, no. Because 0.36 is less than 1. That would mean P2 is shorter than P1, but K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if K is larger, the star is moving faster, which would imply a larger velocity semi-amplitude, which would imply a shorter period, because the star is moving more quickly in its orbit. Oh wait, because if a planet has a shorter period, the star's velocity would be higher because it's moving more quickly around the star.

Wait, let me think about it. The velocity K is proportional to the orbital speed of the star. The orbital speed depends on the orbital period and the size of the orbit. The more massive the planet, the larger the star's velocity. But in this case, same planet mass.

Wait, if the orbital period is shorter, say, P is small, the star has to move more quickly to complete the orbit, leading to a larger K. So higher K → shorter period.

So in our case, K2 is higher (7) than K1 (5). So P2 is shorter than P1.

But according to our earlier calculation, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So P2 is shorter.

Wait, but the question is: How many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So that would mean P2 is shorter, thus the answer is 0.36 times longer. Wait, no, because if P2 is 0.36 of P1, then it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be zero if P2 is shorter. But the options don't have zero. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, let's re-express it.

If P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1, then P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 36% as long as P1. So P2 is shorter than P1, so it's not longer. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be 0.36 times, meaning shorter.

But the options are A) ~0.36, which would imply P2 is 0.36 times the period of P1. So that would mean P2 is shorter, but the question is asking how many times longer P2 is. So the answer would be that P2 is shorter, but the options don't indicate that.

Wait, wait, perhaps I have the ratio the other way. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I have the ratio reversed.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases.

So, the ratio K2/K1 is 7/5 =1.4. So the ratio (K2/K1) is 1.4.

So P2 is proportional to (K1/K2)^3, so P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1.

Which is 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter.

So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, which means it's orbiting faster.

But the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's?

So the answer would be 0.36 times longer, which is 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter. But the way the question is phrased, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the correct factor is 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the ratio.

Wait, the formula I derived: P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then (K1/K2) is less than 1. So P2 is less than P1. So P2 is shorter than P1, so P2 is ~0.36 times P1.

Thus, how much longer is P2 than P1? It's not longer—it's shorter. So the correct answer would be 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter. But the question is phrased as "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's not longer. So the period is shorter, which would mean the answer is 0.36 times as long. But the question is asking 'how many times longer', so the answer is 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) )) )

Which, because M_p is much smaller, becomes approximately:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / M_star )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), hence P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1.

So P2 = (K1 / K2)^3 * P1.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36.

So the answer would be 0.36, which is option A.

Thus, the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). Using the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

From this relationship, the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( (K)^{-3} \). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Here, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.36 \) times the orbital period of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is \( 0.36 \).

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **A) ~0.36**: Correct, as calculated above.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as this would imply \( P_2 \) is longer than \( P_1 \), which contradicts the inverse relationship between \( K \) and \( P \).
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as this value is unrelated to the given data.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as this does not match the calculated ratio.

The correct answer is **A**, as the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1 by a factor of approximately \( 0.36 \).
