Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

And the options are A, B, C, D, each providing different reagents for A and B.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, I'll think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. When it reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and a reagent A, it forms 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, wait, but let me write the structures to make it clearer.

Butan-2-one structure:
(CH3)2CO (which is (CH3)2C=O)

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see, butanenitrile would be a four-carbon chain with a nitrile group. The substituents are hydroxy and methyl on the second carbon.

So, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Hmm, wait, no, the structure of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be: the nitrile is on carbon 1, then carbon 2 has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So, structure is CH2(C(OH)(CH3))CN. Wait, no, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so four carbons in a row with the nitrile on the last. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile: the formula would be:

(CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe not. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so the nitrile is the first carbon. So butanenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile on the end. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile: structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? Wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CH2CN. Or wait, maybe I should think about the reaction mechanism.

Butan-2-one reacting with NaCN. I remember that when ketones react with HCN (or a cyanide source like NaCN), they undergo a cyanohydrin formation. The reaction is called the Henry reaction, right? It's the addition of HCN to a ketone. So the ketone (RCO-) reacts with HCN (H-C≡N) to form an addition product where the H adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the CN adds to the oxygen, creating a new chiral center if not symmetrical.

But wait, in this case, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when HCN adds, the product would be (CH3)2CH(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So let me count the carbons.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons. The product is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. Oh, wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, not butanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CH2CN. Wait, that would be four carbons in the nitrile chain. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so the product has four carbons. Let me recount.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. So the structure is:

CH2CN-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-something? Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the reaction mechanism.

So, when a ketone like (CH3)2CO reacts with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the addition would be HCN adding to the carbonyl, making a new compound. So the product would be (CH3)2CH(OH)CN. But that's a three-carbon nitrile, right? Wait, no. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's four carbons. Let me see:

Butanenitrile: CH2CH2CH2CN. So 2-hydroxy-2-methyl would have the hydroxyl and methyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN. So four carbons in total, with the nitrile on the first, then a CH2, then a C with OH and CH3, then another CH2? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe the numbering is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is on the first carbon, then the second carbon has the hydroxy and methyl. So, structure is CH2CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-? No, that would be longer than butane.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, butanenitrile is four carbons, so the nitrile is on the first carbon. So the structure is:

CH2CH2CH2CN. But with substituents on the second carbon. So, the second carbon has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? Wait, no, because that's four carbons. So that would be: CN-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH3. Wait, that's CN-CH2-CH(OH)(CH3). That would make it 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product is butanenitrile, so four carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think about the reaction again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with HCN in acidic conditions (like with H3O+), it forms the cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin would have the nitrile group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group.

Wait, no. Wait, in the cyanohydrin formation, the HCN adds to the carbonyl group. The H adds to the carbonyl C, and the CN adds to the oxygen, but wait, perhaps it's more accurate: the H from HCN adds to the carbonyl C, and the CN- adds to the O, but wait, no—that's not right. The mechanism is that the HCN attacks the carbonyl, the carbonyl oxygen becomes O- which then grabs a proton to form the cyanohydrin.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps more than just the cyanohydrin is happening, but wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN plus A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when you add HCN (from NaCN in acidic conditions), the product would be (CH3)2CH(OH)CN. Wait, that would be a three-carbon nitrile. But the product is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reagent A is adding to the structure to make it a four-carbon chain. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution or something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first reaction is not a direct cyanohydrin formation. Maybe it's a nucleophilic addition followed by elimination or some other process. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone undergoing nucleophilic attack, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about what reagent A is. The options for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3^-.

Wait, in the first reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and a reagent A. If A is H3O+, that would provide the acidic conditions needed for the cyanohydrin formation. So NaCN in acidic conditions would supply HCN. So the product would be the cyanohydrin: (CH3)2CH(OH)CN.

Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has four carbons. So perhaps the initial product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CN, which is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile? No, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me count the carbons: butanenitrile is four carbons, so the nitrile is on carbon 1. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, meaning on carbon 2, there's OH and CH3 groups. So structure is CH2CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2... Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. So the nitrile is on the fourth carbon, but that would be pentanenitrile. Wait, no. I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.

Let me think about the second reaction. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and treats it with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid group.

How does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid? Typically, nitriles are converted to carboxylic acids via hydrolysis. The common methods are under acidic or basic conditions, or using other reagents. For example, using H2O with acid (like HCl) and heat, or using KMnO4 under acidic conditions. Alternatively, in the presence of H3O+ and heat, nitriles can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids.

Wait, but the second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O, and the product is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps B is an acid catalyst, like HCl or H3O+.

Wait, but the options for B are HCl, CH3COOH, etc. So the second reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid, which is usually done via hydrolysis. So what's the typical reagent for that?

Typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed in acidic conditions, using H2SO4 and H2O, or in the presence of a strong acid like HCl. Alternatively, in basic conditions, they form carboxylates which are then acidified.

So, in the second reaction, it's B (H2O) that's used. So perhaps the reagent B is something that provides an acidic environment. So options for B: in the given choices, option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH, etc.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is likely HCl (since H3O+ is a weak acid and might not be strong enough, especially if heating is involved), but I'm not entirely certain.

But let's go back to the first reaction. What's the role of reagent A? If the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, then A would be an acid, like H3O+.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN in acidic conditions (H3O+ as A) would form the cyanohydrin, which is (CH3)2CH(OH)CN. But wait, that's 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the product is given as 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the first reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but butan-2-one is a ketone, which is generally not reactive towards SN2. So that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first reaction is a substitution where the ketone is being converted into a nitrile. But that doesn't make sense because ketones don't typically substitute into nitriles. Alternatively, maybe it's a condensation reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is not a direct addition but involves some kind of substitution after the cyanohydrin is formed. Maybe the product is then further reacting. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent A is NaHSO3. So what happens if butan-2-one is treated with NaHSO3 and NaCN? Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of bisulfite ions. In the presence of ketones, HSO3^- can add to the carbonyl group, forming a sulfonic acid derivative. But I'm not sure how that would proceed with NaCN as well.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first reaction is a nucleophilic attack where NaCN acts as a nucleophile, but ketones are generally not substrates for SN2 reactions. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a condensation reaction, but I can't think of any that would produce that product.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. But that would be four carbons, making it butanenitrile with substituents on the second carbon. So how would that form?

If butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN, perhaps the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, but that would lead to a substitution. Wait, but the carbonyl in a ketone is not a good leaving group. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is some kind of Claisen or aldol condensation, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a hydrocyanation. Wait, hydrocyanation typically refers to the addition of HCN to alkenes to form nitriles, but butan-2-one doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the two options for A. The options are H3O+ or NaHSO3. So if A is H3O+, that's an acidic condition. If A is NaHSO3, that's a source of bisulfate ions, which can act as a bisulfite agent.

In the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then the reaction would be the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the product would be (CH3)2CH(OH)CN. But according to the question, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which suggests a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the carbons. Let me try again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add HCN, the product would be (CH3)2CH(OH)CN. So that's four carbons, right? Because butane is four, so that would make it butanenitrile. Wait, that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Wait, the nitrile is on carbon 1. So the product would be CH2CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be five carbons. Wait, no, butanenitrile would be four carbons: CN-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be pentanenitrile. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So four carbons in total: the nitrile is on the end. So the product would be:

CN-CH2-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's five carbons, which is pentanenitrile. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. So that's four carbons. Let's see: the nitrile is on the fourth carbon. Wait, no, that would be longer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the reaction isn't a cyanohydrin formation. Maybe it's a different mechanism. But I can't think of any other reaction between a ketone and NaCN that would form a nitrile with hydroxy and methyl groups on the same carbon.

Another thought: perhaps the first reaction is the formation of an imine or something else, but that doesn't fit with NaCN.

Wait, I'm stuck on this first part. Let me try to think about the second reaction again. The second reaction converts a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So the reagent B is probably a strong acid, like HCl, because H3O+ may not be strong enough. So looking at the options, let's see:

The options are:
A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the second reaction, reagent B is used in the presence of H2O to form the carboxylic acid. So B could be HCl or another acid. The reaction of nitrile to acid typically requires strong acidic conditions. So HCl would be a better choice than CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. So in that case, B would be HCl. That would suggest that the correct option is either A or C.

Now, looking at the options, options A and C have B as HCl. So which one is correct between them?

So now, for the first reaction, if in option A, reagent A is H3O+, would that produce the correct product?

But earlier, I thought that with H3O+ and NaCN, the product would be (CH3)2CH(OH)CN, which is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So unless I'm getting the numbering wrong, perhaps the product is correct.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Let me number the product correctly. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on the first carbon, and the hydroxy and methyl are on the second carbon.

So structure would be:

CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3

Wait, that's four carbons: CN (C1), C2 (OH and CH3), C3 (CH2), C4 (CH3). So the formula would be C4H7NO2? Wait, maybe, but the main point is the structure.

But wait, when butan-2-one (C3) reacts with HCN, the product would have four carbons? Because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons. Adding HCN (which is one carbon) would increase the chain by one carbon. So the product would be four carbons. So perhaps the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CN, which is four carbons.

Wait, but (CH3)2CH(OH)CN is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So how is that possible?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a direct addition but some kind of substitution or rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in the mechanism.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by the nitrile group. But that's not typical for ketones. The other possibility is that the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanide-substituted ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between NaCN and the ketone under specific conditions, but I'm not recalling the exact mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction involves the formation of a cyanide as a nucleophile attacking the carbonyl. But in ketones, the carbonyl is not a good leaving group, so that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution. But in that case, we'd need a good leaving group. Maybe the ketone doesn't have that, so it's not likely.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. If reagent A is NaHSO3, what would that do? NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which can react with ketones to form bisulfite adducts. Then, perhaps the NaCN would attack the sulfur? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the bisulfite acts as a catalyst for the reaction.

Wait, but I'm not familiar with a reaction where NaHSO3 and NaCN together would form a nitrile from a ketone. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by a nitrile. But in butan-2-one, the hydroxyl is not present. Wait, no, butan-2-one is a ketone, so it doesn't have an -OH group. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl, but I can't see how that would form a nitrile.

At this point, perhaps I should look for the options and see which makes sense. Let's consider each option.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.

So for the first reaction, with H3O+ as the acid, the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, giving (CH3)2CH(OH)CN, which is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So perhaps the product's structure is different.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me imagine the structure. If the nitrile is on C1, then the next carbon (C2) has OH and CH3. So structure is CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's four carbons: butanenitrile. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

But wait, how does this form from butan-2-one and NaCN?

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when HCN adds, the product would be (CH3)2CH(OH)CN. Which would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. So the product is 3-hydroxy, but the question says 2-hydroxy. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps this suggests that reagent A is not H3O+ but NaHSO3. Let me think.

If reagent A is NaHSO3, what would happen? NaHSO3 is a source of bisulfate ions. In the presence of ketones, it can form a bisulfite adduct, which can then undergo various reactions. But I'm not sure how that would combine with NaCN.

Another approach: perhaps NaHSO3 is a reagent that forms a more reactive species. For example, maybe it converts the ketone into something that can react with CN-.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by CN- via some mechanism, but I don't recall such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps NaHSO3 acts as a reducing agent. But I don't think it's strong enough for that.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the first reaction. Let me try to see if any of the options fit both reactions.

In the second reaction, as I thought earlier, B is likely HCl (a strong acid), so options A and C are possibilities.

Now, what about the first reaction? If the correct reagent A is H3O+, then the product would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile, not 2-hydroxy. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So perhaps that's a problem.

Alternatively, if reagent A is NaHSO3, perhaps the product is different.

Wait, perhaps using NaHSO3 as A would lead to a different regiochemistry. Let me think. If butan-2-one reacts with NaHSO3, it forms a bisulfite adduct. Then, perhaps the CN- attacks the adjacent carbon, leading to a different product.

Wait, in the formation of cyanohydrins, the HCN adds to the carbonyl, so the CN ends up on the same carbon as the OH. So butan-2-one would form a product where the CN and OH are on the same carbon, which is the central carbon (C2). So the product would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, that makes sense! Oh, wait, because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When HCN adds, the H adds to the carbonyl C, and the CN adds to the oxygen. But wait, no, the mechanism is that the H from HCN adds to the carbonyl C, making it a CH group, and the CN adds to the O, but in the cyanohydrin, the OH is added to the same carbon as the CN.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think about the cyanohydrin formation again. The ketone (RCOR') reacts with HCN to form RCH(OH)CN R'. So the product has the OH and CN on the same carbon.

So for butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's four carbons, but this product is three.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the product isn't a cyanohydrin.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a simple cyanohydrin formation but involves some elongation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by CN. But that's not typical. Wait, but in the presence of a strong nucleophile, maybe a ketone could undergo substitution. But I don't recall such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, but butan-2-one doesn't have a conjugated system.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an imine, but that would require an amine, not a cyanide.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

If the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, then the product would be the cyanohydrin, which is (CH3)2CH(OH)CN, or 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the given product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That's a difference in the position of the substituents.

So perhaps the first reaction isn't a direct cyanohydrin formation. Perhaps it's a different mechanism.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a nitrile via a different pathway, like the Stephen reduction or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by CN. But for that, the leaving group would have to be good. In ketones, the oxygen isn't a leaving group, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl, with the nitrile acting as a nucleophile. But ketones are generally not reactive towards such nucleophilic attacks unless under very specific conditions.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the first reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, but that's between two carbonyl compounds.

I'm stuck. Let me try to see which options make sense for the two reactions.

If option A is correct (A=H3O+, B=HCl), then:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → cyanohydrin → 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that's a mismatch.

If option C is correct (A=NaHSO3, B=HCl), then:

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + NaHSO3 → ?

I'm not sure what would happen here. NaHSO3 might act as a catalyst or form a different intermediate, but I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first reaction involves the formation of an imine or some intermediate that then adds the nitrile. But I can't think of a mechanism for that.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution where the ketone is converted to an alcohol, which then undergoes some reaction with CN- to form the nitrile. But I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is first converted into an enolate, which then reacts with CN-. But that would require a base, not an acid.

Hmm, maybe the correct answer is option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

But I'm not certain because I don't know the exact reaction mechanism for the first part.

Wait, another angle: the second reaction. To convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, the common reagents are H2O with HCl (strong acid) and heat. So B is HCl. So options A and C have B=HCl.

Now, let's see: if A is NaHSO3, what would that do in the first reaction?

NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- ions. In the presence of ketones, HSO3^- can add to the carbonyl group, forming a bisulfite adduct. Then, perhaps the addition of NaCN would lead to substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the HSO3^- is a better leaving group than the carbonyl oxygen, so the CN- could substitute it. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaHSO3 acts as a catalyst, but I can't think of a scenario.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the bisulfite adduct is formed first, making a better leaving group, allowing CN- to attack. But that would require the adduct to have a good leaving group, which I'm not sure of.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an example of the Henry reaction, but I thought that was the same as the cyanohydrin formation. So in that case, H3O+ would be the catalyst.

But then, why would the product be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile instead of 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure of the product. Let me imagine butan-2-one again.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When HCN adds, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That's four carbons: the nitrile is on the third carbon? No, wait, that's three carbons. So the product would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product given is butanenitrile, which is four carbons.

Hmm, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CN, which is four carbons. So:

CN-CH2-CH(CH3)OH.

Wait, that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. So the product in the reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have the nitrile on the first carbon and the OH and methyl on the second. So structure: CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But how would that form from butan-2-one and NaCN?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the mechanism wrong. Maybe the reaction is a substitution where the oxygen in the ketone is replaced by the nitrile group. But that would require the oxygen to be a good leaving group, which it isn't under normal conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl, leading to the formation of a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction involves the formation of an enamine, but that typically requires an amine and a ketone, which then undergoes condensation with another carbonyl compound.

But in this case, we have NaCN, which is a cyanide source. Maybe it's a different kind of condensation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, but butan-2-one doesn't have a conjugated system to allow that.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C, where A is NaHSO3 and B is HCl, because I'm pretty sure B is HCl for the second reaction.

But I'm not certain about the first reaction. If I choose option C, then for the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and NaHSO3 to form the desired product.

Wait, perhaps NaHSO3 is a catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. So the reaction would proceed under slightly different conditions, but the product would still be the same.

Wait, but that doesn't change the position of the substituents. So if the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is four carbons, how does that form from a three-carbon ketone?

Wait, unless the cyanide is adding in a way that elongates the carbon chain. But I don't think that's how HCN adds to ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a direct addition but involves some kind of rearrangement.

Hmm, I'm stuck, but I think the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. Because for the second reaction, B is HCl, which makes sense. But wait, in the first reaction, that would form the 3-hydroxy product, which doesn't match the given product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's name is different. Let me re-examine the product name: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butanenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile on C1. The hydroxyl and methyl are on C2. So the structure is:

CH2CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, that's five carbons. No, butanenitrile is four carbons total. So it's CN-CH2-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, no. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So the nitrile is on the end.

Wait, perhaps the product is CH2CN-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH3. That would be four carbons: the nitrile is on C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is C(OH)(CH3), and C4 is CH3. So the structure is CN-CH2-CH(CH2OH)-CH3? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)C(OH)-CH2-CN. That would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile: the nitrile is on C4, but that can't be right because butanenitrile only has four carbons.

I'm getting confused again. Maybe I should accept that the product is a cyanohydrin, which would have the OH and CN on the same carbon, making it 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, no, because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2CH(OH)CN, which is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has the substituents on the second carbon.

So perhaps the reaction isn't a cyanohydrin formation. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the oxygen is replaced by the nitrile group. For example, if the ketone were converted to a better leaving group, like a tosylate, then the nitrile could substitute. But in this case, the reagents are NaCN and A, which is either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Hmm, but I don't think that's applicable here.

At this point, I'm not making progress on the first reaction. Let me look at the options again.

Given that the second reaction requires B to be HCl, because it's a strong acid needed for nitrile hydrolysis, the options are A and C.

If I choose option C (A=NaHSO3, B=HCl), then for the first reaction, perhaps NaHSO3 is a catalyst or helps in some way to form the product correctly.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as a source of H+ ions, making it acidic, which is similar to H3O+.

Wait, but NaHSO3 in solution would provide H+ and SO3^2-? Or is it HSO3^-?

Wait, NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^- in solution. HSO3^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to form SO3^2- or as a base, accepting a proton to form H2SO3. So perhaps in the presence of NaHSO3, the solution is slightly acidic, similar to H3O+.

So if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as A, it would provide an acidic environment, just like H3O+. So perhaps in that case, the product is the same as when using H3O+.

But the product is supposed to be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would require the substituents to be on C2. If the product is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile when using H3O+, then using NaHSO3 would give the same product.

So perhaps the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But then the product of the first reaction would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile, which doesn't match the given product.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the product's structure. Let me think again.

Butan-2-one is:

O
||
C(CH3)2

Adding HCN would add H to the carbonyl C, and CN- to the O, but wait, that's not correct. Let me think about the mechanism.

The correct addition of HCN to a ketone would form a cyanohydrin, where the H adds to the carbonyl C, and the CN adds to the O. So the product would have the OH and CN on the same carbon, which is the former carbonyl carbon. So for butan-2-one, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product given is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. So that suggests that the product has four carbons, which doesn't match with the three carbons of the starting material.

Hmm, perhaps the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CN, which is four carbons, making it 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the given product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So I'm stuck again. Maybe the correct option is A, and the product's structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's name is correct, but I'm miscalculating the structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2-CN. That would be four carbons: the nitrile is on C4, but that's not possible because butanenitrile has only four carbons, with the nitrile on C1.

Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere with this. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The second reaction requires B to be a strong acid, so HCl is more likely than CH3COOH. So options A and C are possibilities.

For the first reaction, if A is H3O+, the product would be the cyanohydrin, which is 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile. But the product is 2-hydroxy, so that doesn't match. So perhaps the correct option isn't A.

If A is NaHSO3, perhaps it's a different reaction. Maybe it's a hydration followed by substitution, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution where the ketone's oxygen is replaced by CN. But I don't think that's feasible under the given conditions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution where the nitrile replaces the carbonyl group. But in that case, the product would be (CH3)2CCN, which doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Given that I can't resolve the first reaction's mechanism, I'll go with the options. Since the second reaction requires B to be HCl, options A and C are the only possibilities. Now, for the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then it should produce the correct product. But earlier, I thought it produces 3-hydroxy, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the product's name is correct, and I'm just misnumbering. Let me imagine the structure again.

The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on C1, and the hydroxyl and methyl are on C2.

Structure: CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would be four carbons. So how does that form from butan-2-one?

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When HCN adds, the product should have the nitrile and OH on the same carbon as the former carbonyl, which is C2.

So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But according to the question, it's butanenitrile, which is four carbons.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial understanding. Perhaps butan-2-one is actually butan-2-one, which is (CH3)COCH2CH3. Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the product's structure. Maybe the product is (CH3)2CH(OH)CN, which is four carbons, with the nitrile on C4.

No, that doesn't make sense.

I'm stuck, but I think I'll go with option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Because for the second reaction, B must be HCl, and for the first reaction, H3O+ is the acid needed for the cyanohydrin formation. So the product would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile, but according to the question, it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the nomenclature is different. Maybe the product is named differently. Let me think: if the nitrile is on C1 and the hydroxyl on C2, then the numbering starts from the nitrile end. So for butanenitrile, the nitrile is C1, then the next carbons are C2, C3, C4.

So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile: structure CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But how does that form from butan-2-one and NaCN?

I think I'm stuck, but I'll go with option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
Butan-2-one ((CH₃)₂CO) reacts with NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This reaction is identified as a cyanohydrin formation, where HCN (from NaCN) adds to the carbonyl group of the ketone. The product is a compound with the nitrile and hydroxyl groups on the same carbon.

- **If A = H₃O⁺**: The acidic conditions facilitate the cyanohydrin formation. The product would be (CH₃)₂C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. However, the question specifies 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which has four carbons. This suggests a mismatch in the product structure.
- **If A = NaHSO₃**: Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO₃) can act as a source of H⁺ ions, providing acidic conditions similar to H₃O⁺. The reaction mechanism and product would likely be the same as with H₃O⁺, leading to the same mismatch in the product structure.

### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid
In this reaction, the nitrile group is converted into a carboxylic acid group. This typically requires hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. Given the options, B is likely a strong acid to facilitate this transformation.

- **If B = HCl**: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid that can effectively hydrolyze the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.
- **If B = CH₃COOH**: Acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is a weak acid, which may not be strong enough for efficient hydrolysis.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl)**: For Reaction 1, H₃O⁺ provides acidic conditions for cyanohydrin formation, but the product structure does not match the given 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. For Reaction 2, HCl is a suitable reagent for nitrile hydrolysis. This option partially fits.
- **Option B (A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH)**: For Reaction 1, H₃O⁺ is suitable, but the product structure still does not match. For Reaction 2, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and less effective for hydrolysis. This option is less likely.
- **Option C (A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl)**: For Reaction 1, NaHSO₃ can provide acidic conditions similar to H₃O⁺, but the product structure still does not match. For Reaction 2, HCl is suitable. This option partially fits.
- **Option D (A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH)**: For Reaction 1, NaHSO₃ is suitable, but the product structure does not match. For Reaction 2, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and less effective for hydrolysis. This option is less likely.

### Conclusion
The second reaction strongly suggests that B = HCl, as it is the most suitable reagent for nitrile hydrolysis. Among the options, both A and C include HCl for B, but A (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl) is more consistent with the expected reaction conditions for the cyanohydrin formation in Reaction 1. Despite the uncertainty about the product structure in Reaction 1, Option A is the best choice.

**Answer: A**
