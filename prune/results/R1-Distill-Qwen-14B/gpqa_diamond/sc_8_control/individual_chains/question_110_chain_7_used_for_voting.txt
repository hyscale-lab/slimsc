Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two specific spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these are high-resolution spectrographs, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think this through.

The question gives me five stars, each with different properties. For each star, I need to determine if it's observable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. The key here is understanding the brightness requirements of each spectrograph.

So, from the question, I see that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait. Oh wait, no. Wait, the way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Brighter means lower magnitude numbers, right? Like, lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars with apparent V magnitude up to 17. So it can't see anything fainter than 17. Wait, no. If it's brighter than 17, that means apparent V mag less than 17? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V <16.

So a star that can be seen by both would have apparent V mag ≤16, because HIRES can go up to 16, and ESPRESSO can handle up to 17. Wait, no. Because if a star's apparent V is 16.5, then HIRES can't see it because HIRES only goes up to 16. So the star needs to have V ≤16 to be seen by both.

Wait, no, wait. Because the brightness limit for HIRES is brighter than 16 mag, meaning apparent V mag less than 16. So a star with V=16 is exactly at the limit. Maybe it's edge case, but perhaps for this problem, we can assume that the limit is up to and including 16. Or is it strictly brighter than? Oh, the question says "brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So that would mean V <16. Because anything with V=16 is not brighter than 16. Hmm.

Wait, but sometimes in astronomy, the magnitude scale can be a bit tricky. So, for instance, a star with V=12 is brighter than V=17. So if the limit is V <17 for ESPRESSO, it can see stars up to 17th magnitude. But for HIRES, it's V<16.

So any star that has an apparent V magnitude less than 16 can be seen by both. If a star's apparent V is 16, only ESPRESSO can see it. But if it's 17, only ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So to be detected by both, the apparent V mag must be less than 16.

So the plan is: for each star, compute its apparent V magnitude (if not already given) and see if it's less than 16. If yes, then it can be detected by both. But wait, some stars have absolute magnitudes, not apparent. So I need to calculate their apparent V mag using their distance.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: RA 15deg, DEC -75, absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

I need to calculate its apparent V magnitude. The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 log₁₀(d) -5, where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs.

So M=15.5, d=10.

log(10) is 1, so 5*1=5.

So m =15.5 +5 -5 =15.5.

So apparent V mag is 15.5. Since 15.5 <16, both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it. Because 15.5 is less than 16. So yes, Star1 is detectable by both.

Star2: RA 30, DEC 55, apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Wait, the question gives Star2's apparent V mag as 16.5. So no need to compute. So m=16.5.

Since 16.5 >16, HIRES can't see it because it requires V <16. But ESPRESSO can see it because 16.5 <17? No, wait. Wait, 16.5 is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But HIRES can't. So Star2 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3: RA 11h, DEC 48, apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, distance 15 pc.

Wait, the given apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's extinction (E(B-V)=0.6 mag). So I need to correct for extinction to get the true apparent magnitude.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the V magnitude given is the observed (apparent) magnitude, which includes extinction. So if E(B-V)=0.6, that means there's extinction. The formula for extinction in V band is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag.

So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m0 = m_observed - A_V.

Wait, no. Because extinction makes stars appear fainter. So if the observed magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So to get the actual m_intrinsic, it's m_observed - A_V.

So Star3's observed V is 15.5. So m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, the question is about the apparent magnitude as observed. So if the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, that's already including extinction. So do I need to correct for it?

Wait, in the context of whether the spectrograph can detect it, it's the apparent magnitude that matters, right? Because the spectrograph observes the star as it appears. So if Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is below 16, then both spectrographs can see it. Because 15.5 <16.

Wait, but wait. Because the star is at 15 pc, the distance modulus is 5 log(15/10) =5*(1.176)=5.88. So m= M +5.88. But wait, Star3's absolute magnitude is given? Wait, no, Star3's apparent V is given as 15.5, so I'm not sure. Wait, Star3's data says: apparent V mag of 15.5, E(B-V) =0.6. So the 15.5 is the observed V mag. So we can calculate the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) as m0 = m - A_V. So A_V=3.1 *0.6=1.86. So m0 =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But wait, is that relevant? Because the spectrograph observes the star's apparent magnitude as 15.5. So when considering whether it can be observed, the apparent magnitude (which is 15.5) is the value we should use. Because that's what the telescope measures. So for the purpose of determining detectability, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is less than 16, so it can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem says that for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but perhaps that's before extinction? Or after? Because the question says it's located at 15 pc. Hmm. Let me read the question again.

The question says for Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) =0.6 mag. So the apparent magnitude they provide is the observed one, including extinction. So the actual m is 15.5, which is what the telescope would see.

So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, so it's <16, so both spectrographs can see it.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, sometimes apparent magnitude is given without considering extinction. So perhaps the given 15.5 is the intrinsic magnitude, and we need to calculate the observed. Hmm, that's a point of confusion.

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag" for Star2, but Star3 has "apparent V mag of 15.5 mag and E(B-V)=0.6". Hmm. So Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction. So when you observe it, it's dimmer, but wait no. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which tells us that there's more extinction in B than V. But the V band extinction is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V) =1.86.

So the observed (apparent) V magnitude is m_obs = m_true + A_V.

Wait, but if the question says the apparent V is 15.5, that includes the extinction. So m_true = m_obs - A_V =15.5 -1.86=13.64. But wait, that's the intrinsic apparent magnitude if there were no extinction. So the star's true brightness is 13.64, but due to extinction, it's observed as 15.5.

Wait, but when determining whether a spectrograph can detect it, the key is the apparent magnitude as observed. Because the spectrograph would see the star at 15.5, which is within the limit for both (since 15.5 <16 and <17). So yes, Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that without correcting for extinction, the star's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is acceptable. So the fact that extinction makes it appear dimmer doesn't matter because the given apparent magnitude (already including extinction) is what the spectrographs see.

So Star3's apparent V is 15.5, so it's observable by both.

Star4: RA 85, DEC -48, absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4. Distance 10 pc.

So to find apparent V, I'll calculate m = M +5 log(d/10) -5. M=15.5, d=10. So log(10/10)=0. So m=15.5 +0 -5=10.5.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log d -5. So d=10, log(10)=1.

So m=15.5 +5(1) -5=15.5+5-5=15.5. So apparent V mag is 15.5.

But wait, we need to also consider extinction because E(B-V)=0.4. So A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So the observed apparent V mag would be m_obs = m + A_V =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, no. Because the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

So the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude is 15.5, but because of extinction, m_observed is 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So when observed, the star's V mag is 16.74.

Wait, but that's after considering extinction. So the observed V is 16.74. So which spectrograph can see this?

HIRES requires V <16. So 16.74 is above that. So HIRES cannot see it. But ESPRESSO can, since 16.74 <17.

So Star4's apparent V mag is 16.74, so only ESPRESSO can detect it, not both.

Wait, but this is confusing. Because the intrinsic apparent magnitude is 15.5. But the observed is 16.74 because of extinction.

So the star's true brightness is 15.5, but because of dust, it appears dimmer. So when the question says, which stars can be detected with both, we need to use the observed apparent magnitude. So Star4's observed V is 16.74, so it's not observable by HIRES (since it's above 16), but is observable by ESPRESSO (since 16.74 <17).

So Star4 can't be detected by both.

Star5: RA 10h, DEC 60, absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

So compute apparent V mag. M=16.5, d=5.

m = M +5 log(d/10) -5.

log(5/10)=log(0.5)=approx -0.301.

So m=16.5 +5*(-0.301) -5.

Wait, 5*(-0.301)= -1.505.

So m =16.5 -1.505 -5=10. So m=10, approximately.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

log(5) is approximately 0.69897, and log(10)=1. So log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.3010.

So m =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) -5.

5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m=16.5 -1.505 -5=10. So 16.5 -6.505=9.995, so m≈10.0.

So apparent V is 10.0.

So Star5's apparent V is 10.0, which is less than 16. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, but wait, does Star5 have any extinction? The question says Star5's properties are absolute V mag 16.5, located at 5 pc. No mention of E(B-V), so I think we can assume no extinction. So no need to add A_V. So Star5's apparent V is 10.0.

So it's within the limits of both. So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but looking back at Star5's data: "absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us." So no E(B-V), so no extinction, so apparent V is 10. So both can detect it.

Wait, but let me summarize all the stars:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect (15.5<16)

Star2: m=16.5 → ESPRESSO only (16.5 <17)

Star3: m=15.5 → but with E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V=1.86. So observed m is 15.5. Wait, no. Wait, no: the observed m is 15.5, which includes the extinction. So yes, can be detected by both.

Wait, wait. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which includes extinction. So that's the magnitude the spectrographs would see. So 15.5 is less than 16. So both can detect it.

Star4: apparent V is 15.5 before extinction. After extinction, observed m is 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So 16.74>16, so HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can.

Star5: apparent V is 10 → both can detect.

So which stars can be detected by both? Let's see:

Star1: yes.

Star3: yes.

Star5: yes.

Wait, so which options include any of these?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by both, but Star5 can. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both, so this is correct.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't, but Star3 can. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't, so D is incorrect.

Wait, but let me double-check each star.

Star1: absolute V=15.5, distance 10 pc. m=15.5. So yes, both can see.

Star3: m=15.5, which includes extinction. So yes.

Star5: m=10, so yes.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options, only option B includes Star3 and Star5. Option D includes Star1 and Star4, but Star4 cannot be detected by both.

So the correct answer should be the option that includes Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but Star1 can also be detected by both. So why isn't it in any option?

Looking at the options:

Option D is Star1 and Star4. But Star4 can't be detected by both, so D is incorrect.

So which options include Star3 and Star5? Option B is "Star3 and Star5", so that's the correct option.

Wait, but wait—am I missing something? Let me check Star3 again.

Star3's apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 16, so both can detect. So yes.

Star5's apparent V is 10, so yes.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. The key criteria are:

- **ESPRESSO** can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( V < 17 \)).
- **HIRES** can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( V < 16 \)).

Thus, a star must have an apparent V magnitude \( V < 16 \) to be detectable by both spectrographs. For stars where the apparent V magnitude is not directly given, we calculate it using the distance and absolute magnitude formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

Additionally, extinction (if provided) is accounted for using the relation \( A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) \), where \( A_V \) is the extinction in the V band. The observed apparent magnitude is then:

\[
m_{\text{observed}} = m_{\text{intrinsic}} + A_V
\]

### Analysis of Each Star:

#### **Star1**:
- **Given**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).
- **Calculation**: 
  \[
  m = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.5 < 16 \), so Star1 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

#### **Star2**:
- **Given**: Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES, but it can be detected by ESPRESSO.

#### **Star3**:
- **Given**: Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), extinction \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).
- **Extinction Correction**: 
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
  \]
  \[
  m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m_{\text{observed}} = 17.36 > 17 \), so Star3 cannot be detected by ESPRESSO. However, the question explicitly states that the apparent V magnitude provided already includes extinction, so \( m = 15.5 < 16 \). Thus, Star3 can be detected by both spectrographs.

#### **Star4**:
- **Given**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), extinction \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).
- **Intrinsic Apparent Magnitude**:
  \[
  m = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15.5 + 5(1) - 5 = 15.5
  \]
- **Extinction Correction**:
  \[
  A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
  \]
  \[
  m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES, but it can be detected by ESPRESSO.

#### **Star5**:
- **Given**: Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).
- **Calculation**:
  \[
  m = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5
  \]
  \[
  \log_{10}(5) \approx 0.69897, \quad m = 16.5 + 5(0.69897) - 5 \approx 16.5 - 5 + 3.495 = 15.0
  \]
- **Conclusion**: \( m = 15.0 < 16 \), so Star5 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Final Answer:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** (\( V = 15.5 \)) and **Star5** (\( V = 15.0 \)). 

**Correct Option**: **B) Star3 and Star5**

Answer: B
