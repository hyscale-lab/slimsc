Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that look like those caused by an exoplanet transit.

The question is asking: If the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve? So, basically, the brightness dip when the planet transits the star should match the dip caused by the spots.

Hmm. I remember that the brightness change due to a planet transit is given by the formula (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a decrease in brightness too. So I need to calculate the dip caused by the spots and set it equal to the dip caused by the planet.

Wait, the star's brightness isn't uniform because of the spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer. But how much exactly?

Let's think about the star's total brightness when the spots are visible. The star emits according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT^4. But since part of the star is cooler, the total flux would be the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The star's radius is R_star. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface area. So the spots are 20% of half the surface, so 0.2 * (π R² / 2) ) ? Wait, no. Wait, wait, the filling factor is 20%, but it's per hemisphere. So the entire spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) ), but wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the star is a sphere, so the surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². The filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Wait, no, wait. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere is 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So that's the area of the spots.

Now, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the variation in brightness would depend on how much of the spotted area is visible as the star rotates.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness variations are due to rotational modulation. So as the star spins, the spotted part comes into view and then goes out of view, causing a dip in brightness when the spots are facing us.

But wait, how does that compare to a planet transit? When a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light. So the dip in brightness is due to the blocked light. For the spots, the dip is because the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the total flux is less.

So perhaps I need to calculate the relative change in brightness when the spots are facing us versus when they're not.

Wait, the star's total flux when the spots are visible would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted area and the spotted area.

The flux from the entire star without spots is L = 4π R² σ T^4. When the spots are visible, the flux is:

L_unspotted = (area_unspotted) * σ T^4 + (area_spotted) * σ (T - ΔT)^4

Wait, no. Because each part of the star emits as a blackbody. The unspotted part is at 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K.

But wait, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So their temperature is 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

Flux_total = ( (1 - filling factor) * (hemisphere) ) * σ T^4 + (filling factor * hemisphere) * σ (T - ΔT)^4 )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The star's surface has two regions: the unspotted and the spotted. The unspotted region is at 6000K, and the spotted is at 5000K.

The area of the spotted region is 20% of a hemisphere. Wait, no: wait, the entire star is a sphere. So the total area is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the spotted area is 0.4 π R². The unspotted area is 4π R² - 0.4 π R² = 3.6 π R².

Wait, no. Wait, when the star is viewed from a certain angle, only one hemisphere is facing us. But when the star rotates, we see different parts. Wait no, in this case, the star's rotation causes the spots to come into and out of view. So when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, and when it's the other hemisphere, we don't. Hmm, is that correct?

Wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, and when it's on the other side, it's not visible.

Wait, but the star is a sphere. So the maximum amount of spots we can see is when the center of the spotted hemisphere is directly facing us. As the star rotates, the amount of spots we see changes. But wait, no, I think the star's rotation would cause the spots to come into and out of view as the star spins. So when the spot is on the limb, perhaps only part is visible, but as it rotates, the maximum coverage is when the spot is directly facing us. So the variation in brightness would be maximum when the spot is in front, and minimum when it's on the back.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's model the brightness when the star is not rotating. But since it's rotating, the spots' visibility changes, causing the brightness to vary.

Wait, perhaps the maximum dip in brightness occurs when the spot is entirely in front of the star. But since it's a hemisphere covered with spots, the maximum area blocked would be the entire spotted hemisphere. Wait, but that's when the star is first showing the spotted side. But that can't be, because when you have a hemisphere covered, you don't see more than one hemisphere at a time. So perhaps the maximum dip is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. But wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so when a hemisphere is facing us, the other is not. So the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is visible, which is when the hemisphere with the spots is facing us. If the star is rotating, then as it turns, the spots come into view, reach maximum coverage (full hemisphere), and then go out of view as the star continues to rotate.

Wait, but in reality, the brightness variation due to spots is more complicated. The spots are on one side, so as the star rotates, the spots sweep across our line of sight. So the brightness dip would start as the spots start to come into view, reach a minimum when the spot is centered, and then come back as the spot moves away. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can model the maximum brightness dip as when the entire spotted area is blocking the light, but that may not be correct because the star's rotation would cause the spots to pass in front, but not all at once. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the amplitude of the brightness variation as the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness as the star rotates, and the observed dip in brightness is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the relative change in flux when the spots are present and compare that to the change when a planet transits.

Let me think. The star's total flux when the spots are visible is lower because part of the surface is emitting less. The change in flux would be the difference between the star's flux without spots and with spots.

Wait, when the star is not spotted, its flux is F0 = σ T^4 * 4π R² / (4π D²), where D is the distance. But since we're dealing with relative changes, D will cancel out.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 - (spotted area * (T^4 - T_spot^4)).

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The star's total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions.

So F = (A_unspotted * σ T^4) + (A_spotted * σ T_spot^4)

Where A_unspotted = 4π R² - A_spotted.

Wait, no, because when the star is viewed, the unspotted area is (4π R² - A_spotted), but when the star is rotating, only the hemisphere that's facing us is visible. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, and regardless of rotation, we see exactly half the star at any time. Oh wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if the star is rotating, and a hemisphere is spotty, then as it rotates, the spots come into view. But for a star viewed from Earth, the entire surface is visible because of limb darkening and the fact that the star is a sphere. Wait, no, when you look at a star, you see all its surface except for the part that's on the far side. Wait, no, no, you can't see the far side of a star. So when a star rotates, you can see exactly half of it at any given time (assuming it's a perfect sphere and no limb darkening). But since the star has spots on one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. When the other hemisphere is facing us, we don't see any spots.

Wait, that's a key point. If the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres, one with spots and the other without, then when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are fully visible. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side and not visible. So the maximum change in brightness occurs when the spotted hemisphere is turned towards us, leading to the maximum dip in brightness because the spots are blocking (or in this case, lowering the flux) a large area.

Wait, but in reality, when a star rotates, we don't see the entire hemisphere. We see a circular region that's less than a hemisphere due to the star's rotation and our viewing angle. But perhaps, for simplicity, the problem assumes that when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire spotted area is visible, leading to a maximum dip.

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

F_spotted = (A_unspotted * σ T^4) + (A_spotted * σ T_spot^4 )

But wait, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the unspotted area visible is the unspotted part of that hemisphere. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one with spots (let's say the front hemisphere) and the other without (the back hemisphere). When the star is viewed from Earth, we see the front hemisphere. So the front hemisphere has 20% of its area covered in spots (filling factor of 20%).

So the area of the front hemisphere is 2π R². The area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². The unspotted area on the front hemisphere is 2π R² - 0.4π R² = 1.6π R².

The back hemisphere has no spots, so its entire area is 2π R², all at 6000K.

When the front hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_front = (1.6π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4π R²) * σ (5000)^4

When the back hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

F_back = (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (2π R²) * σ (5000)^4? No, wait, no. Wait, the back hemisphere is not spotty. So when the back hemisphere is facing us, the front hemisphere (which is spotty) is on the far side and not visible. So the flux is just from the back hemisphere.

Wait, no, no. When the back hemisphere is facing us, the far side is the front hemisphere. So the flux comes only from the back hemisphere, which has no spots. So F_back = (2π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but the star's total surface is 4π R². So when the front is facing us, the visible area is 2π R². When the back is facing us, same.

So the maximum and minimum fluxes would be when the front and back are facing us, respectively.

So the maximum flux is when the back hemisphere is visible (since it's all at 6000K), and the minimum flux is when the front hemisphere is visible (with spots).

So the change in flux, ΔF, would be F_back - F_front.

Wait, no. Because F_back is higher than F_front. So when the front is visible, the flux is lower. So the dip is F_back - F_front, but we're looking for the amplitude of the brightness variation, which is the difference between maximum and minimum.

Wait, let me compute both F_front and F_back.

F_front = (area_unspotted_front) * σ T^4 + (area_spotted_front) * σ T_spot^4

Area_unspotted_front = 2π R² * 0.8 = 1.6 π R².

Area_spotted_front = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So F_front = (1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4) + (0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4)

F_back = (2π R² σ (6000)^4)

The difference when front is visible (F_front) compared to when back is visible (F_back):

ΔF = F_back - F_front = 2π R² σ (6000)^4 - [1.6π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4]

Simplify:

ΔF = [2π R² σ (6^4) ] - [1.6 π R² σ (6^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5^4) ]

= (2 - 1.6) π R² σ (6^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5^4)

= 0.4 π R² σ 6^4 - 0.4 π R² σ 5^4

= 0.4 π R² σ (6^4 - 5^4)

Factor out 0.4 π R² σ.

Compute 6^4: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296. 6^4=1296.

5^4: 5*5=25, 25*5=125, 125*5=625. 5^4=625.

So 1296 - 625 = 671.

So ΔF = 0.4 π R² σ * 671.

But the star's total flux when back is visible is F_back = 2 π R² σ (6^4) = 2 π R² σ * 1296.

So the relative change in flux is ΔF / F_back.

Which is [0.4 π R² σ * 671 ] / [ 2 π R² σ * 1296 ].

Simplify:

0.4 * 671 / (2 * 1296) = (0.4 * 671) / 2592.

0.4 is 2/5, so (2/5 * 671) = (2*671)/5 = 1342/5 = 268.4.

So 268.4 / 2592 ≈ let's compute that.

2592 is 2592.

268.4 / 2592 ≈ 0.1035 or about 10.35%.

Wait, that's the change in flux when the front hemisphere is visible. So the dip is about 10.35% of the star's maximum flux.

Now, when a planet transits the star, the dip in brightness is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So we need to find R_planet such that (R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.1035.

Taking square roots:

R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait a second: when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip of (R_p / R_s)^2. But in the case of the spots, the dip is about 10.35%. So we set (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.1035.

So R_p ≈ sqrt(0.1035) * R_s ≈ 0.3217 R_s.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ~0.32, which is close to 0.3217. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me check again. Because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recompute 6^4 and 5^4.

6^4 = 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296. Yes.

5^4=625.

So 1296-625=671.

Then ΔF = 0.4 * π R² σ *671.

F_back = 2 * π R² σ * 1296.

ΔF/F_back = (0.4 *671) / (2 * 1296) = (268.4) / 2592 ≈ 0.1035.

So the dip is about 10.35%.

So (Rp/Rs)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rs ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So the closest option is D, 0.32.

Wait, but wait another thing. When the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rs)^2, but in this case, the dip is 10.35% of the star's flux. So the planet would need to cause the same dip.

Therefore, the radius of the planet should be about 0.32 times the star's radius.

So option D is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Star Properties and Spots**:  
   The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius, \( R_{\text{star}} \), and an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \). One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%, meaning the spotted area on the hemisphere is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). The spots are cooler, with a temperature of \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Variation Due to Spots**:  
   The total flux from the star depends on the contributions from the unspotted and spotted regions. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:  
   \[
   F_{\text{front}} = (A_{\text{unspotted}} \cdot \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (A_{\text{spotted}} \cdot \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4)
   \]  
   where \( A_{\text{unspotted}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 - 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) and \( A_{\text{spotted}} = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).  

   When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:  
   \[
   F_{\text{back}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4
   \]  

   The change in flux (\( \Delta F \)) between these two states is:  
   \[
   \Delta F = F_{\text{back}} - F_{\text{front}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta F = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4 - \left[ 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (5000)^4 \right]
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \Delta F = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \left( (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 \right)
   \]  
   Using \( (6000)^4 = 1296 \times 10^{12} \, \text{K}^4 \) and \( (5000)^4 = 625 \times 10^{12} \, \text{K}^4 \):  
   \[
   \Delta F = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (1296 - 625) \times 10^{12}
   \]  
   \[
   \Delta F = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (671) \times 10^{12}
   \]  

3. **Relative Flux Change**:  
   The relative change in flux is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{back}}} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (671) \times 10^{12}}{2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma (1296) \times 10^{12}}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{back}}} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 671}{2 \cdot 1296}
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{back}}} = \frac{268.4}{2592} \approx 0.1035
   \]  
   Thus, the relative flux change is approximately \( 10.35\% \).

4. **Exoplanet Radius**:  
   The brightness variation caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is given by:  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{back}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{back}}} = 0.1035 \):  
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
   \]  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The radius of the exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
