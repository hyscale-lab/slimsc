Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives four options, and I need to pick which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The choices are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The options are combinations of these, so I need to figure out which ones are mandatory.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dim-6, dim-7, etc. But regardless of the dimension, they have to respect certain symmetries.

Wait, what's Lorentz symmetry? Oh right, it's the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. All physical laws should be the same regardless of the observer's orientation or velocity. So any operator in the theory must respect this, right? Because if it didn't, the physics would change based on the frame, which isn't possible for a fundamental theory.

Then there's Poincaré symmetry. Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like moving from one point in space to another). So if Lorentz is required, does that automatically mean Poincaré? Well, the SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. But wait, Poincaré symmetry includes not just Lorentz but also momentum conservation via translations. I think that in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that respects the Poincaré algebra. Because if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, and also translation-invariant, then Poincaré is satisfied. So I think both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries must be respected.

Next, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation (switching particles with their antiparticles) and Parity (spatial inversion). The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in some cases, like in the CKM mechanism for CP violation. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are built from the SM fields. So if the SM doesn't respect CP, does SMEFT have to? No, I think the SM's CP violation is already part of the theory, so the SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to preserve CP. Some operators might violate CP, depending on their structure. So maybe CP symmetry isn't a must for all SMEFT operators. But wait, what's the actual rule? I think that in SMEFT, the operators must respect the symmetries of the SM. Wait, the SM is CP-violating, so the SMEFT operators don't have to preserve CP. So option 3, CP symmetry, isn't a required symmetry.

Then there's CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. It states that for any interaction, the combination of C, P, and T transformations must leave the physics invariant. So any operator in the theory must respect CPT. So all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 must be correct.

Putting this together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4). Wait, does that mean all three? Because Poincaré includes Lorentz, but in the options, they're listed as 1 and 2. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So that would mean all three. But wait, I thought that Poincaré includes Lorentz, but is it a separate symmetry? Or are they considered together? Because if Poincaré includes Lorentz, then perhaps the correct symmetries are Poincaré and CPT. But the question lists them as separate options.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. So they must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is a must. Poincaré includes Lorentz and translation, but the SMEFT is a theory with local Lorentz symmetry but maybe not necessarily Poincaré? Or is it that Poincaré is automatically satisfied because the theory is built upon it?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. Poincaré symmetry implies the existence of a Minkowski space and that the theory is invariant under translations and Lorentz transformations. SMEFT is constructed in such a framework, so it must respect Poincaré symmetry. So options 1 and 2 must be true. But I thought that Lorentz and Poincaré are separate aspects. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering Lorentz symmetry and Poincaré symmetry as separate. Because Poincaré is more than just Lorentz; it also includes the generators for translations. But in any case, the SMEFT operators must be invariant under both, I think. So both 1 and 2 must be correct.

So, from the options, which include 1 and 2? Let's look at the options. Option A is 1 and 2. Option C is 1,2,4. Option D is 1,3,4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that CPT symmetry (4) is a must. So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So that would make option C: 1,2,4.

But wait, the question says "which must be respected by all operators." So do all operators have to respect all three symmetries?

Wait, I'm a bit shaky on whether Poincaré is a separate symmetry or just the combination of Lorentz and translations. Because in the effective theory, the operators are written in a way that they are Lorentz-invariant (i.e., they form Lorentz scalars), and the theory is also Poincaré-invariant. So both 1 and 2 are required.

So then the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but some sources say that in SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars. So they must be invariant under Lorentz transformations. So 1 is correct. Poincaré includes Lorentz, but maybe in the SMEFT framework, it's automatically satisfied if the operators are Lorentz scalars and the theory is translationally invariant. Because SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so Poincaré is respected.

So that would mean 1,2,4 are correct. So the answer is option C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry ensures that physical laws are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective field theory, all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is mandatory.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry combines Lorentz symmetry with translational invariance. Since SMEFT is built in a framework that respects both Lorentz and translational invariance, it inherently satisfies Poincaré symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves the combined operations of charge conjugation (C) and parity inversion (P). The Standard Model (SM) already includes CP-violating interactions, such as in the CKM mechanism. Since SMEFT extends the SM, it does not need to enforce CP symmetry for all operators. Thus, CP symmetry is not a mandatory symmetry for SMEFT operators.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry combines charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T). This is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and SMEFT operators must respect it. Therefore, CPT symmetry is mandatory.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are **Lorentz symmetry (1)**, **Poincaré symmetry (2)**, and **CPT symmetry (4)**. The correct combination of these symmetries is provided in option **C**.
