Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, so I'm guessing activity coefficients aren't too far off from their ideal values, but maybe that's not super important here.

First, I need to recall what I know about phosphate buffer solutions. Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. Its dissociation occurs in three steps, each with their own Ka values. The given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. 

The salts given in the problem are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think KH2PO4 is the potassium salt of H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion), and Na2HPO4 is the disodium salt of HPO4^2- (the hydrogen phosphate ion). Wait, but the second salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O, so it's the dihydrate. 

So when these salts dissolve in water, they release their respective ions. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of crystallization, but that probably contributes to the solution's volume, not the ions we're considering.

Wait, but I'm asked about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Because phosphate can exist in different forms: H3PO4 (orthophosphoric acid), H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (phosphate). So the problem is asking for [HPO4^2-].

But wait, in solution, these species can interconvert based on the pH. So the presence of both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 should set up a buffer system. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

Wait, but the given salts are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So, when these are in solution, they'll contribute to the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively. But in solution, depending on the pH, some of these might shift between their forms.

Hmm, but wait, if I have both a weak acid and its conjugate base, that should form a buffer. So the buffer here is H2PO4^- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). So the pH of the solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, considering the pKa2 of H3PO4, because the second dissociation is H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+.

Wait, but wait a second, the buffer's pKa would be the second one, because that's the relevant one for the species we're dealing with. So pKa2 is the relevant one. Let's calculate that. pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. So Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) is about 7.21.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Log(6.2) is about 0.79, and log(1e-7) is 7, so 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 1e-8, so log is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 + (-8) = -7.2076, so the pKa is 7.2076, approximately 7.21.

Now, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). The base in this case is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.

But wait, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So the [H2PO4^-] comes from KH2PO4, and [HPO4^2-] comes from Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the ratio of these two concentrations would influence the pH.

Wait, but I'm being asked about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. So perhaps I can first calculate the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and then find [HPO4^2-] based on that pH and the [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] ratio.

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler to first find the concentrations of each salt, then apply the buffer equation to find the pH, and then calculate the actual [HPO4^2-] considering how the pH affects the ratio.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt.
2. Convert moles into concentrations in the solution (volume is 0.2 L).
3. Determine the ratio of [HPO4^2-] (from Na2HPO4) to [H2PO4^-] (from KH2PO4).
4. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.
5. Determine the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, considering any possible shifts due to pH.

Wait, but let's do it step by step.

First, moles of KH2PO4. Mw is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / Mw = 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol. So that's 7.345e-3 mol.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O. Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005615 mol. Approximately 5.615e-3 mol.

The solution volume is 0.2 L, so concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 7.345e-3 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 5.615e-3 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028075 M.

So if these were the only species, the ratio [base]/[acid] would be 0.028075 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.765. So the log of that is log(0.765) ≈ -0.114.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch, pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]) → pH = 7.21 + (-0.114) ≈ 7.096.

Wait, but wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). So if the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-, then that's correct.

So pH ≈7.096.

Now, what is the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution? Well, in the buffer, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 10^(pH - pKa2). Let me check that again.

Wait, the Henderson equation can also be written as [base]/[acid] = 10^(pH - pKa). So here, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(7.096 -7.21) = 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.765. Wait, but that's the same ratio as before, so I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, but the problem is that both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can exist in solution, but when you have a solution with these ions, depending on the pH, they can shift. But in this case, we have a fixed amount of each from the salts. So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the salts, but the pH is determined by their ratio and the pKa.

Wait, but perhaps the actual concentration of HPO4^2- is not just the moles from the Na2HPO4, because some of it might convert into H2PO4^- or PO4^3-.

Wait, no, because PO4^3- is formed from HPO4^2- via the third dissociation, which has a very small Ka3 (1.8e-12), so at pH 7.09, which is near neutral, the HPO4^2- is much more stable than PO4^3-. So we can probably neglect any PO4^3- in solution. Similarly, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (the buffer reaction), but the reverse is also possible.

Wait, but if we have a buffer, the concentrations of the base and acid are in a certain ratio determined by the pH. So perhaps I can model the solution as:

At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = initial [H2PO4^-] - [H+]

[HPO4^2-] = initial [HPO4^2-] + [H+]

But since K is small (Ka2 is 6.2e-8), the change might be negligible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentrations are a good approximation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should model it using the charge balance and the equilibria. Let's think.

The main ions in solution come from the salts:

- From KH2PO4: K+ and H2PO4^-.
- From Na2HPO4·2H2O: 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

The solution is neutral overall, so the sum of positive charges equals the sum of negative charges.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe the concentration of HPO4^2- is not affected by the equilibria, because the buffer system maintains a ratio between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, let me think again. The total concentration of phosphate species is [H3PO4] + [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-]. But in solution, most of the phosphate is in the form of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the pH is around 7.1, which is between pKa1 (~2.12) and pKa2 (7.21). Wait, pKa1 is log(7.5e-3) which is approximately 2.12. So at pH 7.1, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the dominant species, with HPO4^2- being a bit more than H2PO4^- because the pH is just below pKa2.

Wait, but in our case, the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.028075 M. The ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.028075/0.036725 ≈ 0.765, so log(0.765) is about -0.114, which leads to pH = 7.21 -0.114 ≈7.096, which is about 7.1.

So the pH is around 7.1. Now, considering the buffer solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are related by the Henderson equation.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-. So what is [HPO4^2-]?

Well, according to the buffer equation, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2). So pH is 7.096, pKa2 is 7.21. So 7.096-7.21 = -0.114. 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.765.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.765 * [H2PO4^-].

Wait, but [H2PO4^-] is from the KH2PO4, which is 0.036725 M. So [HPO4^2-] would be 0.765 * 0.036725 ≈ 0.02807 M. Which is exactly the same as the initial value we had from Na2HPO4. So that suggests that the initial assumption holds, and the actual [HPO4^2-] is 0.028075 M.

Wait, but that can't be the case because the Henderson equation should account for the actual concentrations. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation states that pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]). So [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(pH - pKa2).

In this case, pH is 7.096, pKa2 is7.21, so 10^(7.096-7.21) = 10^(-0.114) ≈0.765. So [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] *0.765.

But the problem is that the [H2PO4^-] is from KH2PO4, which is 0.036725 M, and the [HPO4^2-] from Na2HPO4 is 0.028075 M. So according to this, [HPO4^2-] should be 0.036725 *0.765≈0.02807 M, which matches the initial value. So that suggests that the concentrations are consistent with the buffer equation.

Wait, that might mean that the actual concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are as given by the salts, without any significant shift. So perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028075 M.

But wait, the options don't have 0.028 M. Let's check the options:

Options:

A) 6.24x10^-7 M

B)5.48x10^-7 M

C)2.81x10^-7 M

D)3.97x10^-7 M

Hmm, those are all in the 1e-7 range. But according to my initial calculation, [HPO4^2-] is about 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, or 2.8e-2 M, which is much larger than any of the options. So that's a problem.

Wait, that suggests I'm making a mistake in my approach. Where did I go wrong?

Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm not considering the fact that HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3- and H+. Because the solution's pH is around 7.1, which is just below pKa2 (7.21), so some HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, but PO4^3- has a very low concentration because Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Let me calculate the contribution of PO4^3-.

So for HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. At pH 7.1, which is much higher than pKa3 (pKa3 = log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74). So at pH 7.1, which is below pKa3, the reverse reaction is favored. So HPO4^2- is more stable than PO4^3- in this solution. So [PO4^3-] would be negligible.

But wait, I'm not sure if that affects the [HPO4^2-] directly, but perhaps I should consider the exact equilibria.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the phosphate species can act as both acid and base, leading to multiple equilibria. But maybe the initial approach is too simplistic.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the pH is determined by their concentrations. The main point is that the concentration of HPO4^2- is what's being asked, and perhaps the given options are much lower than my initial calculation. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the moles. Let me recheck the moles.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007345 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005615 mol. Correct.

Volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 L. So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 /0.2 = 0.036725 M. [HPO4^2-] = 0.005615 /0.2 = 0.028075 M.

So these are correct. So why are the options so much lower?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm not considering the dissociation of H2PO4^- into H+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the reaction is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

So, the H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-. So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts, but the presence of H2PO4^- will cause some of it to dissociate into HPO4^2-.

Wait, but if I have an initial concentration of [H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 M and [HPO4^2-] =0.028075 M, the system will adjust to reach equilibrium.

So the change in [H2PO4^-] will be -x, and the change in [HPO4^2-] will be +x.

Wait, but considering that the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.028075 M and [H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 M, the ratio is [base]/[acid] = 0.028075/0.036725≈0.765. So the Henderson equation says pH = pKa2 + log(0.765) ≈7.21 -0.114≈7.096.

But the actual concentration of HPO4^2- is higher than what I initially thought because some H2PO4^- dissociates into HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, because the initial solution already contains HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4, and H2PO4^- from KH2PO4. So perhaps the actual [HPO4^2-] is higher than 0.028075 M because some H2PO4^- is converting to HPO4^2-.

Let me model this using the equilibrium expression.

The reaction is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =6.2e-8.

We know the pH is approximately 7.096, so [H+] =10^-7.096 ≈8.59e-8 M.

So, plugging into the Ka2 expression:

6.2e-8 = (8.59e-8) * [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-].

So [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * [H2PO4^-]) / (8.59e-8).

= (6.2/8.59) * [H2PO4^-].

6.2 /8.59 ≈0.722.

So [HPO4^2-] ≈0.722 * [H2PO4^-].

But what is [H2PO4^-]? It's the initial concentration from KH2PO4, which is 0.036725 M, but some of it dissociates into HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me denote the initial concentrations as:

[H2PO4^-]_initial = 0.036725 M (from KH2PO4).

[HPO4^2-]_initial = 0.028075 M (from Na2HPO4).

At equilibrium:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 - x.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028075 + x.

But wait, considering that H2PO4^- can donate a proton to form HPO4^2-, the change is x.

So the expression is:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (8.59e-8)(0.028075 + x) / (0.036725 - x) =6.2e-8.

Hmm, let's set up the equation:

(8.59e-8)(0.028075 + x) = 6.2e-8 (0.036725 - x).

Divide both sides by 1e-8:

8.59*(0.028075 + x) =6.2*(0.036725 -x).

Multiply out:

8.59*0.028075 + 8.59 x = 6.2 *0.036725 -6.2 x.

Calculate each term:

8.59 *0.028075 ≈ 0.2413.

6.2 *0.036725 ≈0.2283.

So:

0.2413 +8.59 x = 0.2283 -6.2 x.

Bring like terms together:

8.59x +6.2x = 0.2283 -0.2413.

14.79 x = -0.013.

x ≈ (-0.013)/14.79 ≈ -0.00088 M.

Wait, that's negative, which doesn't make sense. So x is approximately -0.00088 M.

That suggests that our assumption that x is positive (H2PO4^- dissociates into HPO4^2-) is incorrect. So perhaps x is negative, meaning that HPO4^2- is converting back into H2PO4^-.

Wait, but how can that be? Because the ratio [base]/[acid] is 0.765, which is less than 1. So according to the Henderson equation, the pH should be less than pKa2, which it is (7.096 <7.21). So the system is such that [HPO4^2-] < [H2PO4^-], so the solution is on the acid side of the buffer, favoring H2PO4^-.

So in this case, HPO4^2- is converting into H2PO4^-.

Wait, so perhaps the x is negative, meaning that [H2PO4^-] increases and [HPO4^2-] decreases.

So let's let x be negative. So:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 - x.

[HPO4^2-] =0.028075 + x.

But x is negative, so:

[H2PO4^-] =0.036725 - (-|x|) =0.036725 + |x|.

[HPO4^2-] =0.028075 - |x|.

So substituting into the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = (8.59e-8)(0.028075 - |x|) / (0.036725 + |x|) =6.2e-8.

So,

(8.59e-8)(0.028075 -x) =6.2e-8 (0.036725 +x).

Divide both sides by 1e-8:

8.59*(0.028075 -x) =6.2*(0.036725 +x).

Expand:

8.59*0.028075 -8.59 x =6.2*0.036725 +6.2 x.

Calculate:

8.59 *0.028075 ≈0.2413.

6.2 *0.036725≈0.2283.

So:

0.2413 -8.59 x =0.2283 +6.2 x.

Bring variables to one side:

-8.59x -6.2x =0.2283 -0.2413.

-14.79x = -0.013.

x = (-0.013)/(-14.79) ≈0.00088 M.

So x is 0.00088 M, which is positive. Wait, that's confusing because I thought x would be negative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me start over.

The problem arises because when we have a buffer solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in a certain ratio dictated by the pH and the pKa.

Alternatively, perhaps the moles of HPO4^2- are not just from Na2HPO4, but also some from the dissociation of KH2PO4.

Wait, but the initial moles are 0.007345 mol of H2PO4^- and 0.005615 mol of HPO4^2-.

The solution's pH is determined by the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2) = 10^(7.096-7.21) ≈0.765.

So [HPO4^2-] =0.765 * [H2PO4^-].

But the sum of the initial H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- plus the changes from dissociation equals the total phosphate.

Wait, maybe I should consider the total concentration of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Let me denote:

Let [H2PO4^-] = a.

[HPO4^2-] = b.

We know that the ratio b/a =0.765.

Also, the total concentration from both salts is a + b = (0.036725 +0.028075) =0.0648 M.

So a + b =0.0648.

And b =0.765 a.

Substituting into a +0.765a = 0.0648.

1.765 a =0.0648 → a=0.0648 /1.765 ≈0.03667 M.

Then, b=0.0648 -0.03667 =0.02813 M.

Wait, but this calculation suggests that [H2PO4^-] is approximately 0.03667 M and [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02813 M. Which is very close to the initial values. So perhaps the changes are negligible, and the initial concentrations are a good approximation.

But this brings us back to the original problem. According to this, [HPO4^2-] is about 0.028 M, but the options are all in the 1e-7 M range.

This suggests that I'm missing something fundamental here. What else could be the issue?

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the buffer but about the solubility of phosphate ions. Wait, but the salts are fully soluble, so their ions should dissociate completely.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the total concentration but only about the free [HPO4^2-], considering the equilibria. But that seems unlikely given the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is related to the solubility of phosphate in solution, but I don't think that's the case here because both salts are highly soluble.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the orthophosphate ion. Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, but sometimes it's called the conjugate base. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the free ion concentration, considering that some of the phosphate might form complexes or precipitate, but that's not indicated in the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the concentration using the dissociation constants more accurately. Let's think about the exact equilibrium.

The reaction is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

The Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

We have [H+] = 10^-7.096 ≈8.59e-8 M.

So using the Ka expression:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =6.2e-8.

So [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-])/ [H+] .

Plugging in the numbers:

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.036725) /8.59e-8.

Calculate numerator: 6.2e-8 *0.036725≈2.285e-9.

Divide by 8.59e-8: (2.285e-9)/(8.59e-8) ≈0.0266 M.

Wait, that's about 0.0266 M, which is still much higher than the options provided.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering that HPO4^2- can further dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

But since the pH is 7.09, which is below pKa3 of 11.74, the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that the given masses include water of crystallization, which affects the actual number of moles of HPO4^2-.

Wait, the salt Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So for each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O, we get one mole of HPO4^2-.

So when I calculate the moles of HPO4^2- from 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O, it's 1.00 /177.99 =0.005615 mol, which is correct. So no issue there.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I have to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, considering that some of it comes from the dissociation of KH2PO4 and some from the Na2HPO4. But according to the Henderson equation, the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] is determined by the pH, so perhaps the initial concentrations are adjusted by the buffer.

Wait, but according to the Henderson equation, [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * (Ka2 / [H+]).

Wait, no, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). So [base]/[acid] = 10^(pH -pKa).

Which is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

Which is [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(pH - pKa2).

Given that pH is 7.096, pKa2 is7.21, so 10^(7.096-7.21)=10^(-0.114)≈0.765.

So [HPO4^2-] =0.765 * [H2PO4^-].

But [H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 M, so [HPO4^2-] =0.765 *0.036725≈0.02807 M.

Which again is 0.028 M, but the options are way lower. So I'm definitely missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about [HPO4^2-], but about [PO4^3-], but that seems unlikely given the wording.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check the volume again. The solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. Correct.

Wait, the problem states that the solution contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So I calculated moles correctly.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is not in pure water, and the total concentration of phosphate species is less due to some other factor, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in the solution, but considering that some of them form complexes with the cations (K+ and Na+), which would lower the free ion concentration. But I don't think that's expected for this problem.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact [HPO4^2-] using the exact Ka2 and the concentrations.

Let me try that. From the previous calculation, [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.036725) / 8.59e-8.

Calculating step by step:

6.2e-8 *0.036725 = (6.2 *0.036725)e-8 = approx 0.228155e-8 = 2.28155e-9.

Divide by 8.59e-8:

2.28155e-9 /8.59e-8 = (2.28155 /85.9) * 1e-1 ≈ (0.02656) *0.1 ≈0.002656 M.

Wait, that's 2.656e-3 M, which is 2.656 mM. Still way higher than the options.

Wait, but wait—no, wait a minute. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-])/ [H+].

Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 M.

[H+] is 8.59e-8 M.

So,

(6.2e-8 * 0.036725) = 6.2e-8 * 3.6725e-2 = 6.2 *3.6725e-10 = approx 22.81e-10 = 2.281e-9.

Divide by [H+] =8.59e-8.

So, 2.281e-9 /8.59e-8 = (2.281 /85.9) )e-1 = approx 0.02656e-1 = 0.002656 M.

Wait, 0.002656 M is 2.656e-3 M, which is 2.656 mM. Still not matching any options.

Wait, but the options are all about 1e-7 M. What if I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+]? Let me double-check.

pH is 7.096, so [H+] =10^-7.096.

10^-7 = 1e-7.

10^0.096 ≈1.245.

So 10^-7.096 = 1e-7 /1.245 ≈8.03e-8 M.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 8.59e-8, but using exact calculation: 10^0.096.

Wait, 10^0.096 → natural log of 10 is 2.3026.

0.096 * ln(10) ≈0.096 *2.3026≈0.221.

e^0.221 ≈1.246.

So 10^0.096 ≈1.246.

Thus, [H+] =1e-7 /1.246 ≈8.02e-8 M.

So back to [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 *0.036725) /8.02e-8.

Calculating numerator: 6.2e-8 *0.036725= 2.28155e-9.

Divide by 8.02e-8 → 2.28155e-9 /8.02e-8 = approx 0.02845 M.

Hmm, that's about 0.02845 M, which is 2.845e-2 M, still not matching the options.

Wait, but this doesn't make sense because the options are much lower. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the problem says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution." Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, but perhaps in solution, it's actually the sum of all phosphate species, including those that have lost a proton (like H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I've confused the buffer equation. Let me think again. The buffer equation is [base]/[acid] = 10^(pH - pKa), so [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(pH - pKa2).

With pH=7.096, pKa2=7.21 → 10^(7.096-7.21)=10^(-0.114)=approx 0.765.

So [HPO4^2-] =0.036725 *0.765 ≈0.02807 M, which is 2.8e-2 M.

This is way higher than any options, so perhaps I'm missing a key point here.

Wait, perhaps the given solution isn't a buffer but a solution where the phosphate is in a different form.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the exact equilibrium expression, considering that both salts contribute.

Let me denote:

n_total = n_H2PO4^- + n_HPO4^2- = (0.007345 mol) + (0.005615 mol) = 0.01296 mol.

But wait, no. The total moles of phosphate would be the sum of all phosphate species. Wait, but each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, and each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So total moles of phosphate species is 0.007345 +0.005615=0.01296 mol.

But in solution, some of these can interconvert.

Wait, but the buffer system would keep the ratio of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- according to the Henderson equation. So perhaps the concentrations are as follows:

[H2PO4^-] = (n_total * [H2PO4^-]) / (n_total).

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right approach. I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution is a buffer where [HPO4^2-] is much higher than [H2PO4^-], but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires using the exact expression for the buffer, including the contributions from both salts.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the concentration of HPO4^2- is not simply the moles from Na2HPO4 divided by volume, but also includes some from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but according to the Ka2, which is 6.2e-8, the dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2- is not negligible. So perhaps the actual [HPO4^2-] is higher than the initial 0.028075 M.

Wait, let me model this with the exact expression.

Let me denote:

Total moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007345 mol.

Total moles of HPO4^2- =0.005615 mol.

But in solution, some H2PO4^- dissociates into HPO4^2- and H+, and some HPO4^2- dissociates back into H2PO4^- and OH- (but that may not be relevant here).

Let me let x be the moles of H2PO4^- that dissociate into HPO4^2-.

So:

[H2PO4^-] =0.007345 -x.

[HPO4^2-] =0.005615 +x.

The concentration of H+ is determined by the pH, which is 7.096, so [H+] =8.59e-8 M.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] =6.2e-8.

Substituting:

6.2e-8 = (8.59e-8) * (0.005615 +x) / (0.007345 -x).

Multiply both sides by (0.007345 -x):

6.2e-8 (0.007345 -x) = 8.59e-8 (0.005615 +x).

Divide both sides by 1e-8:

6.2 (0.007345 -x) =8.59 (0.005615 +x).

Calculate each term:

6.2 *0.007345≈0.04547.

6.2 *(-x) = -6.2x.

8.59 *0.005615≈0.04827.

8.59 x =8.59 x.

So:

0.04547 -6.2x = 0.04827 +8.59x.

Bring like terms together:

-6.2x -8.59x = 0.04827 -0.04547.

-14.79x = 0.0028.

x= 0.0028 / (-14.79) ≈-0.000189 mol.

Negative x suggests that HPO4^2- is converting back into H2PO4^-.

So:

[H2PO4^-] =0.007345 - (-0.000189) =0.007534 mol.

[HPO4^2-] =0.005615 + (-0.000189) =0.005426 mol.

So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] =0.007534 /0.2 =0.03767 M.

[HPO4^2-] =0.005426 /0.2 =0.02713 M.

Now, using these concentrations in the buffer equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pH =7.21 + log(0.02713/0.03767) =7.21 + log(0.72) ≈7.21 -0.143=7.067.

Which is close to our initial pH of 7.096. So this seems consistent.

So the [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02713 M, which is 2.713e-2 M. Still, this is way higher than the options provided.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e-7 M. So I must be missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the buffer solution, but about the solubility of phosphate in water. But both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are very soluble, so that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem involves the exact calculation using the third dissociation constant, but that's unlikely because Ka3 is so small.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong Ka value. Let me double-check the problem statement:

The Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12, respectively.

No, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the solution requires considering the hydrolysis of the phosphate ions. For example, HPO4^2- can react with water to form PO4^3- and H+.

But the Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2, so it's negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- after considering the hydrolysis of the salts, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH affects the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But given that the buffer keeps the pH around 7.1, and HPO4^2- is the dominant species in that pH range, I don't see why the concentration would be so low.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution where the phosphate comes only from the dissociation of H3PO4, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the buffer and is instead about the solubility of a sparingly soluble phosphate, but that's not indicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that HPO4^2- can hydrolyze further into PO4^3- and H+.

But as I mentioned earlier, the contribution from that would be negligible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the solution is a buffer. Let me think again.

The solution contains both a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), so it should form a buffer solution. Therefore, the pH is determined by their concentrations.

But according to all my calculations, the [HPO4^2-] is around 0.027 M, which is 2.7e-2 M, but the options are all around 1e-7 M. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the exact dissociation equation, but considering that the solution is a buffer, and that the [HPO4^2-] is given by the buffer equation.

Wait, let me think differently. The total phosphate concentration is the sum of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts plus any from dissociation. But that's already considered.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the buffer equation, but I'm not sure how that leads to the options given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually about the concentration of orthophosphate ions in terms of their activity, but that's not indicated.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the correct answer is the concentration of HPO4^2- from the Na2HPO4 salt alone, without considering the buffer.

So, [HPO4^2-] = moles / volume = 0.005615 mol /0.2 L =0.028075 M.

Which is 2.8075e-2 M, but the options are way lower. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the solution is not a buffer and that the phosphate species are determined by the pH of pure water, which is 7. But that's not the case because the solution is a buffer with a pH around 7.1.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B)5.48e-7 M

C)2.81e-7 M

D)3.97e-7 M

Wait, all of these are about 1e-7 M. Wait, but if the pH is 7.096, which is close to neutral, the [H+] is about 1e-7.

Wait, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the hydrolysis of the phosphate ions.

Wait, HPO4^2- is an amphiprotic ion. It can act as an acid (donating a proton to become PO4^3-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-).

But in this case, the pH is around 7.1, which is just below pKa2 of 7.21, so the HPO4^2- is more stable than H2PO4^-.

But the concentration of HPO4^2- would be determined by the buffer solution, which is why I'm getting 0.028 M.

So I'm back to square one. I don't see how the concentration of HPO4^2- could be as low as 1e-7 M in this setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of HPO4^2- as the product of [H+] and the concentration of phosphate species, but that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the exact expression, considering that the buffer may not be ideal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where the total phosphate concentration is determined by the salts, but the exact concentration depends on the pH.

But I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should try to see if any of the options make sense with the given data.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where the total phosphate is from both salts, but the HPO4^2- comes only from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is 0.028075 M, and the options don't match, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution after considering that some of it has dissociated into PO4^3- and H+.

But as I calculated earlier, the contribution of PO4^3- is negligible.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact concentration using the third dissociation constant.

Wait, HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3=1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

[H+] =8.59e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]) / 8.59e-8.

= (1.8/8.59) * [HPO4^2-] *1e-4.

≈0.2095 * [HPO4^2-] *1e-4.

If [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M, then [PO4^3-] ≈0.2095 *0.028 *1e-4 ≈5.866e-7 M.

That's about 5.87e-7 M, which is close to option B (5.48e-7) or option A (6.24e-7).

But this is the concentration of PO4^3-, not HPO4^2-. The problem asks for HPO4^2-, which is much higher.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- instead of HPO4^2-. But the question clearly states orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the concentration of PO4^3- as part of the orthophosphate, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that some of it dissociates into PO4^3-.

But in that case, the [HPO4^2-] would be slightly less than 0.028 M, but not by much. For example, if [HPO4^2-] =0.028 M, and [PO4^3-] is 5.87e-7 M, then [HPO4^2-] remains approximately 0.028 M.

This isn't helping me.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the Ka3 expression, but I don't see how that would apply.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the buffer. Let me think about the buffer again.

The buffer is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The pH is determined by their ratio. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the Henderson equation.

But according to the Henderson equation, [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] *10^(pH-pKa2).

Which gives us [HPO4^2-] =0.036725 *0.765≈0.02807 M.

But the options don't have anything close to that. So perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in a different way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is not a buffer because the concentrations of the two salts are not in the right ratio to form a buffer. Let me check.

For a buffer, the ratio of the concentrations should be such that the pH is around the pKa. In this case, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028075/0.036725≈0.765, which is close to 1, so the pH should be near pKa2, which it is (7.096 vs 7.21). So it is a valid buffer.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I've tried all possible approaches, but none are leading me to the options provided. Perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not to consider the buffer but to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the solubility of the phosphate salts, but that doesn't make sense because both salts are soluble.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that both salts contribute to the same ion, but that's not the case because KH2PO4 contributes H2PO4^- and Na2HPO4 contributes HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, considering that some of the H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 dissociates into HPO4^2-.

So the total [HPO4^2-] would be the moles from Na2HPO4 plus the moles from the dissociation of KH2PO4.

But according to the calculation earlier, the dissociation is minimal, contributing only about 0.000189 mol, which is negligible compared to the 0.005615 mol from Na2HPO4.

So the contribution is small, but perhaps the problem expects me to calculate it.

Wait, let me try that.

Moles from Na2HPO4: 0.005615 mol.

Moles from KH2PO4 dissociation: x (which we found to be approximately 0.000189 mol).

So total moles of HPO4^2- =0.005615 +0.000189≈0.005804 mol.

Concentration =0.005804 /0.2 =0.02902 M. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm at a loss. Perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the common ion effect or something else, but I can't see it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that both salts contribute to the same ion, but that's not correct because they contribute different species.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exact expression.

The exact expression for the buffer is:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

We can write [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/ [H+].

Given that [H2PO4^-] is from both KH2PO4 and the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But given that the dissociation is minimal, perhaps [H2PO4^-] ≈0.036725 M.

So [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.036725) /8.59e-8.

Which is (6.2e-8 *3.6725e-2) /8.59e-8.

= (2.28155e-9) /8.59e-8 ≈0.02656 M.

Still, this doesn't align with the options.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

[H+] =10^-7.096.

7.096 =7 +0.096.

10^0.096 = antilog(0.096).

As earlier, 10^0.096 ≈1.2457.

So [H+] =1e-7 /1.2457 ≈8.024e-8 M.

Then, [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 *0.036725) /8.024e-8.

= (6.2 *0.036725) /8.024 * (1e-8 /1e-8).

= (0.228155) /8.024 ≈0.02843 M.

Again, 0.02843 M is 2.84e-2 M, which is way higher than any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of PO4^3- which is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, but the options are of the order 1e-7, which would make sense if PO4^3- is considered.

Using the Ka3 expression:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3=1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-]=0.028 M.

[H+]=8.024e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 *0.028) /8.024e-8.

= (5.04e-14)/8.024e-8 ≈6.28e-7 M.

Which is about 6.28e-7 M, close to option A (6.24e-7).

But the question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-. So this can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- instead, but the question clearly states orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

I'm stuck. I think the intended answer must be option D)3.97e-7 M, but I can't see how to get there.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the exact formula considering both the buffer and the autoionization of water.

But I can't see how that would lead to such a low concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the third dissociation constant, which would give a very low concentration.

Wait, let me try that.

If I consider HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+.

The concentration of PO4^3- would be (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

But since the question is about HPO4^2-, this approach doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- based on the solubility of the phosphate salts, but that doesn't make sense because both are highly soluble.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration from the initial moles without considering any dissociation, but that gives 0.028 M, which isn't an option.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the intended answer is option D)3.97e-7 M, but I can't see how to derive it.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires using the exact Ka expression without assuming the buffer, which would give a much lower concentration.

Let me try that approach.

Assume that the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts, but not as a buffer. Then, calculate [HPO4^2-] using the Ka2 expression.

So:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

We can rearrange to find [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/ [H+].

But what is [H2PO4^-] in this case?

Wait, without considering the buffer, [H2PO4^-] would be 0.036725 M, and [H+] is 1e-7 (approx).

So [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 *0.036725) /1e-7.

= (2.28e-9) /1e-7 =0.0228 M.

Still, this is much higher than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps [H2PO4^-] is not 0.036725 M, but is reduced by some factor.

Wait, but without the buffer assumption, I can't see how [H2PO4^-] would change.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where the only source is the dissociation of H3PO4, but that's not the case as the solution contains the salts.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, considering that some of it may not dissociate completely.

But both salts are strong electrolytes and should dissociate completely, so this probably isn't the case.

I'm sorry, but I can't figure out how to arrive at any of the provided options. I think I'm missing a key point in the problem setup. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, looking at option D)3.97e-7 M, perhaps it's derived from the Ka3 expression. Let me see:

Ka3 =1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

If [PO4^3-] is to be found, then [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 [HPO4^2-])/ [H+].

But without knowing [HPO4^2-], this doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is found using the formula:

[HPO4^2-] = (n) / (V + V_water_added).

But I don't think that's relevant.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to compute the concentration using the exact formula considering that the two salts contribute to the same ion, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration by considering that the solution is not a buffer, and thus the pH is determined by the autoionization of water, which is pH 7. Then, using pH=7, calculate [HPO4^2-].

So, [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/ [H+].

With [H+] =1e-7.

[H2PO4^-] =0.036725 M.

Ka2=6.2e-8.

So [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 *0.036725) /1e-7.

= (2.28155e-9)/1e-7 = 2.28155e-2 M ≈0.0228 M.

Still not matching the options.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a way to reach the provided options. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the intended answer is option D)3.97e-7 M, but I'm not certain how to arrive there.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻) in the solution, the following analysis was conducted:

### Problem Setup
The solution contains:
- **1.00 g of KH₂PO₄** (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and  
- **1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O** (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol).  

The solution volume is **200.00 cm³ (0.2 L)**, and the dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are:
- \( K_a1 = 7.5 \times 10^{-3} \),  
- \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \),  
- \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \).  

The goal is to calculate the concentration of HPO₄²⁻.

### Key Analysis

1. **Moles of Salts**  
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol}.
     \]  
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
     \[
     \text{Moles} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005615 \, \text{mol}.
     \]

2. **Initial Concentrations**  
   - KH₂PO₄ dissociates into H₂PO₄⁻ and K⁺.  
     \[
     [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007345 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M}.
     \]  
   - Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into HPO₄²⁻ and Na⁺.  
     \[
     [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005615 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028075 \, \text{M}.
     \]

3. **Buffer System and Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**  
   The solution forms a buffer with H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base). The relevant \( K_a \) is \( K_a2 \), with:  
   \[
   pK_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21.
   \]  
   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = pK_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right).
   \]  
   Substituting the ratio of concentrations:  
   \[
   \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.028075}{0.036725} \approx 0.765.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.21 - 0.114 = 7.096.
   \]

4. **Refining [HPO₄²⁻]**  
   Using the equilibrium expression for \( K_a2 \):  
   \[
   K_a2 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}.
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] \):  
   \[
   [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{K_a2 \cdot [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   - \( [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = 0.036725 \, \text{M} \),  
   - \( [\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.096} \approx 8.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \),  
   - \( K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \):  
     \[
     [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{(6.2 \times 10^{-8})(0.036725)}{8.59 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 0.02656 \, \text{M}.
     \]

5. **Final Considerations**  
   The calculated concentration of HPO₄²⁻ is approximately \( 0.02656 \, \text{M} \), which is much higher than the options provided. This discrepancy suggests a misunderstanding of the problem setup or an alternative interpretation of the question. Given the options, the closest match appears to be **Option D: 3.97 × 10⁻⁷ M**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.
