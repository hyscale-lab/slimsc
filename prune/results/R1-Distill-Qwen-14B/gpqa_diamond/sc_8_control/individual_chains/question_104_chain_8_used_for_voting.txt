Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines to detect planets. When a planet orbits a star, it causes the star to wobble, and this wobble shifts the spectral lines. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbital period.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet similar in mass to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the stars are identical, and the planets have similar masses. The RV method detected these planets.

Planet #1 caused a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift was 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D.

Wait, I think the RV method detects the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is something like K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1-e²)^(1/2) )) * ( (sin i) / ( (1 + (M_planet/M_star))^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1/(1 day)) ) * (other terms maybe). But wait, if the planet is much less massive than the star, M_planet << M_star, then M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, so the formula simplifies.

Since both stars are similar to the Sun, M_star is the same for both. The planets have similar Neptune masses, so M_planet is similar for both. So, the main thing affecting the velocity semi-amplitude K is the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and semi-major axis. Wait, another way to think about it: the RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass, the distance of the planet's orbit (semi-major axis), and the inclination of the orbit (sin i). But since the orbits are circular and both are detected, the inclination must be such that sin i is close to 1 for both, so I can ignore that, perhaps.

Wait, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c ) )^(1/3) * ( (M_planet sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * ( M_planet sin i ) / M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently.

Another approach: The RV method's measured velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance (semi-major axis) of the planet. The formula is:

K = (v * sin i) = [ (G * P) / (2 * π * c) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe not exactly, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ (1-e²)^(1/2)) ) * (1/( (1 + (M_p/M_*))^(2/3) )) ) * (1/(1 day)) ) * (sin i) )

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Alternatively, I remember that for a circular orbit, the semi-amplitude K can be written as:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * ( P^(1/3) ) / (2 * π * c )

Wait, maybe it's easier to recall the formula in terms that relate K and P.

Wait, the formula I think is:

K = (v_star) = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2 * π) / P )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ [ (G * M_p ) / M_* ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) * sin i / sqrt(1 - e²)

Since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term goes away. So:

K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3) * sin i

But since the planets are detected, sin i must be close to 1 (so the orbits are edge-on). So sin i ≈ 1.

So, K ≈ ( ( G * M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3 )

Wait, that can be rearranged to:

K^3 ≈ ( G * M_p / M_* ) * (2π / P )

So, solving for P:

P ≈ (2 π) / ( (K^3 * M_* ) / (G M_p) ) )

Wait, maybe we can write it another way. Let's cube both sides of the equation.

Wait, let me think again. Let's write it as K ∝ ( (G M_p / M_*) )^(1/3) * (1/P )^(1/3 )

So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1/P )^(1/3 )

Alternatively, K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1/P )^(1/3 )

Which can be written as K ∝ ( M_p )^(1/3) / ( M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

Therefore, K = constant * ( M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * P^(-1/3 )

But wait, since M_* is the same for both stars, and M_p is similar for both planets, their ( M_p / M_* )^(1/3) terms are roughly the same. So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Or wait, because P^(-1/3) is 1/(P^(1/3)), so if K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then P is proportional to (1/K )^3.

Wait, let me write:

K ∝ (1 / P^(1/3) )

So, P^(1/3) ∝ 1/K

Therefore, P ∝ (1/K )^3

Which would mean P is inversely proportional to K^3.

But wait, let me think again. If K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), then K = A * (1 / P^(1/3) ), where A is a constant (including M_p and M_* terms, which are the same for both planets). So,

K1 = A / ( P1^(1/3) )

K2 = A / ( P2^(1/3) )

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Because K = A / P^(1/3 ), so K1/K2 = (A/P1^(1/3)) / (A/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

We can rearrange this to find (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute this correctly.

If K1 = A / (P1)^(1/3 )

And K2 = A / (P2)^(1/3 )

Then, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So,

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3 ?? Wait no, rearrange:

(K1/K2) = [ (P2 / P1) ]^(1/3 )

So, cubing both sides,

(K1/K2)^3 = (P2 / P1 )

Then, P2/P1 = ( K1 / K2 )^3

Wait, no, wait, that would make P2 proportional to (K1/K2)^3. Let me double-check.

Suppose K1 is larger than K2.

If K1 > K2, then since P is proportional to (1/K )^3, then P would be larger when K is smaller.

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2 is larger. So, K2 > K1 → K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, our K's are K1=5, K2=7 (milliangstroms). So K2 is bigger than K1.

So, K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Then, (P2 / P1 ) = ( K1 / K2 )^3 = (5/7 )^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of Planet #1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1. So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the ratio would be 0.36. So, the period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1. So, P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of approximately 0.36.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So, the answer would be A) ~0.36. So the period of planet 2 is ~0.36 times that of planet 1. So, planet 2's period is shorter. So, the question asks how many times longer Planet #2's period is than Planet #1's. So, since 0.36 is less than 1, it's shorter. So the ratio is 0.36 times, meaning it's 0.36 as long as Planet #1's period. Thus, Planet #2's period is shorter, so the question's answer would be ~0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't get the ratio wrong. Let me recheck the equations.

We have K = (A) / (P^(1/3) )

So, P = (A / K )^3

So for each planet,

P1 = (A / K1 )^3

P2 = (A / K2 )^3

So,

P2 / P1 = (A/K2 )^3 / (A/K1 )^3 = (K1/K2 )^3

Because A cancels out.

So,

P2/P1 = (K1/K2 )^3 = (5/7 )^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So yes, P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. Therefore, planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, which is shorter. So, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. Since it's shorter, the factor is less than 1. So, 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) of the star is proportional to \( (1/P)^{1/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. This relationship implies that \( P \propto (1/K)^3 \), meaning the orbital period is inversely proportional to the cube of the velocity semi-amplitude.

For Planet #1 and Planet #2, the velocity semi-amplitudes are \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), respectively. Since the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the ratio of the orbital periods can be determined using the relationship:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
