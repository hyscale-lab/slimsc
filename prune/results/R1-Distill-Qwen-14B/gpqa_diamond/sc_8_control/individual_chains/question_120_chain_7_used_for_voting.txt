Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, or something like that. So when plx is smaller, the star is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Oh, probably uniformly in terms of volume. So the number density of stars is the same throughout space. So if I imagine a sphere with radius R, the number of stars inside it would be proportional to the volume, which is (4/3)πR³.

But wait, how does parallax come into play here? Since plx is 1/d (where d is distance), for a given parallax range, like from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Let me think. If plx is small, d is large. So for a small change in plx, dplx, the change in distance dd would be dplx * d², because plx = 1/d, so dplx = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dplx. But since plx is small, d is large, so dd is a small change in d when plx changes a bit.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx. The volume of such a shell would be the surface area times the thickness. The surface area at distance d is 4π d². The thickness in terms of distance is dd. But how does that relate to dplx?

Hmm, plx is 1/d, so when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by a small amount. Let's express dd in terms of dplx. From plx = 1/d, taking differentials, we have dplx = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = -d² dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

The number of stars in this shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars is n * 4π d² dd.

But we want the number per unit plx, so we're integrating over a range in plx. Since plx = 1/d, let's substitute d in terms of plx. d = 1/plx. So d² is (1/plx)^2, and dd is - (1/plx²) dplx.

Putting it all together: number of stars in dplx is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, let's compute that.

n * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = n * 4π (1/plx⁴) dplx.

So the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx⁴. Because as plx increases, the number of stars per unit plx drops off quickly.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d² (since volume element is 4π d² dd). But since d is 1/plx, that's (1/plx)^2. And the thickness in plx terms is dplx, which, when converted to dd, is proportional to 1/plx² dplx.

So when you multiply d² by dd, you get (1/plx²) * (1/plx² dplx) ) = 1/plx⁴ dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx⁴. So the answer should be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when things are uniform in space, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n dV. So for a thin shell in space, dV is 4π d² dd. So number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dd. Now, in terms of parallax, d = 1/plx. So d² is 1/plx², and dd is (from plx = 1/d), so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign is about direction, but since we're considering a small positive dplx, the actual number is positive.

So substituting, number of stars = n * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π n (1/(plx^4)) dplx.

Which means the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the answer is A.

But wait, another way to think about it is considering that in 3D space, the number of stars in a thin shell is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the number per unit plx is 1/plx⁴.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. The question assumes a uniform distribution of stars in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 \, dd \), where \( dd \) is the thickness of the shell in distance. Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \). Taking the differential of \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we find \( d\text{plx} = -\frac{1}{d^2} \, dd \), or equivalently, \( dd = -d^2 \, d\text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we get \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \).

The number of stars in the shell is then proportional to \( d^2 \, dd \), which becomes:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto d^2 \, dd = \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change, but the magnitude shows that the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
