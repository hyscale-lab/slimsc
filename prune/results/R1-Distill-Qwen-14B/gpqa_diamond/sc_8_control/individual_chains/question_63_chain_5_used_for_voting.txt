Okay, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule transitioning between states using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. They're asking for the momentum of that photon. The options are A, B, C, D with various p values.

Wait, the molecule uses the non-rigid rotor model, but I think for the fundamental state, it's the lowest vibrational state, which is the ground state. So the initial state is v=0 (vibrational ground state) and probably some rotational state, but for the fundamental state, the rotational quantum number is the lowest possible. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the combination of the lowest vibrational (v=0) and rotational (J=0) states.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state. So the next state would have the next possible energy, which would be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But I think in terms of energy levels, the vibrational transitions are usually higher in energy than rotational ones. Wait, but wait, the question is about the lowest possible energy increase, so maybe it's the first possible transition, which depends on which transition is allowed.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the quantum rotation-vibration model. So I think it's a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. The energy levels might be quantized with both factors.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by E_rot = (ℏ² / 2I) J(J+1) where I is the moment of inertia. But since this is a non-rigid rotor, maybe the bond length can change, so perhaps the moment of inertia isn't constant. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe we can treat it as a rigid rotor for the rotational part.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (1/2) hν + hν v, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0,1,...). For the fundamental state, v=0, so the vibrational energy is (1/2) hν.

So the initial state is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But which transition requires less energy? Because the question is asking for the photon with the lowest possible energy, which would correspond to the smallest momentum since p = h/λ and E=pc, so lower E means lower p.

Wait, actually, the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states. So to find the required photon energy, we need to find the energy difference between the initial (v=0, J=0) state and the next state, which would be the first possible higher energy state.

Let me calculate the energies of the possible next states.

First, the initial state's energy is E_initial = E_rot_initial + E_vib_initial.

E_rot_initial = (ℏ² / 2I) * J(J+1) with J=0, so E_rot_initial = 0.

E_vib_initial = (1/2) h ν.

Now, the next possible states are when either J increases (to J=1) or v increases (to v=1).

Let's calculate the energy for J=1, v=0.

E_rot_next1 = (ℏ² / 2I) * 1*(1+1) = (ℏ² / 2I) * 2 = (ℏ² * 2) / (2I) )= ℏ²/(I).

E_vib_next1 = (1/2) h ν.

So E_next_rot = E_rot_next1 + E_vib_next1 = (ℏ²/(I)) + (1/2 h ν).

Wait, but the initial state is E_initial = (1/2) h ν. So the energy difference for this transition would be (ℏ²/I). Because E_next_rot - E_initial = (ℏ²/I) + (1/2 h ν) - (1/2 h ν) ) = ℏ²/I.

Alternatively, if the molecule transitions to v=1, J=0, then:

E_rot_next2 = 0 (since J=0).

E_vib_next2 = (1/2 h ν) + h ν (since v=1) = (3/2 h ν).

So E_next_vib = 3/2 h ν.

The energy difference between E_next_vib and E_initial (which is 1/2 h ν) is (3/2 - 1/2) h ν = h ν.

So which transition requires less energy? That is, which photon has lower energy.

Compare the two energy differences:

ΔE1 = ℏ²/I.

ΔE2 = h ν.

We need to compute both and see which is smaller.

Wait, what's the given data?

Masses: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

Bond length R=2 angstroms. Oh wait, but for the moment of inertia, I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) amu.

Mx=20, My=2.

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ℏ²/(I).

ℏ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ℏ² ≈ (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So ℏ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2064e-46 ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up the exponents. Let me recheck:

ℏ² is (1.05e-34)^2 = approximately 1.1e-68.

I is about 1.2e-46 kg m².

So 1.1e-68 / 1.2e-46 = (1.1/1.2) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.9167e-22 J.

Wait, that's about 9.167e-23 J.

But let's express this in terms of hν, the vibrational energy.

Given ν = 4e14 rad/s.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

hν = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 ≈ 2.65e-19 J.

So compare ΔE1 = ~9.167e-23 J and ΔE2 = 2.65e-19 J.

Which is smaller? ΔE1 is 9e-23, which is much smaller than 2.65e-19. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

So the photon needed would be for the rotational transition, which is from J=0 to J=1, with v=0. So the energy difference is ΔE = ℏ²/I = approximately 9.167e-23 J.

But wait, the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So the initial state is (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be (v=0, J=1), which requires the photon with ΔE = ℏ²/I.

So the photon's energy is E_photon = ΔE = ℏ²/I ≈ 9.167e-23 J.

But wait, the question asks for the momentum of the photon. Since E = pc for a photon, p = E/c.

So p = (ℏ²/I) / c.

Wait, let me compute that.

c is the speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.167e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.167e-23) / (3e8) = 3.056e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, they are around 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns.

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s. So 3.056e-31 kg m/s is 3.056e-31 Ns, which is way smaller than any of the options.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, let me recalculate the moment of inertia. Because I think I might have messed up the units.

Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

The reduced mass μ is (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) = (40/22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

But 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.206e-46 kg m².

That's correct.

Then ℏ² is (1.0545718e-34 J s)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Hmm, but wait, J is kg m²/s². So J² is kg² m^4/s^4. So ℏ² has units of (J s)^2 → (kg m²/s² * s)^2 → (kg m²/s)^2 → kg² m^4/s².

Wait, perhaps I should compute ℏ² in terms of J·s squared? Maybe better to compute ℏ² in J² s² and I in kg m².

But perhaps a better approach is to compute ℏ²/(I) in terms of energy.

Wait, maybe I should compute using the formula E_rot = (ℏ² / 2I) J(J+1). Since J changes from 0 to 1, ΔE_rot is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = (ℏ²/(2I)) * 2 = ℏ²/(I).

Wait, yes, that's correct. So E_photon = ℏ²/(I).

So let me compute that again.

ℏ = 1.0545718e-34 J s.

ℏ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = about 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

I is 1.206e-46 kg m².

So E_photon = 1.112e-68 / 1.206e-46 → 1.112/1.206 is approximately 0.922, so 0.922e-22 J.

Wait, because 1e-68 / 1e-46 = 1e-22.

So E_photon ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Then, since E = pc, p = E/c.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

J is kg m²/s². So J/(m/s) = kg m²/s² * s/m = kg m/s.

Which is the unit of momentum (kg m/s).

So 9.22e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.073e-31 kg m/s.

But 3.073e-31 kg m/s is 3.073e-31 N s, since 1 N s = 1 kg m/s.

Looking at the options:

Options are A) 1.9e-28, B) 2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, none of these are near 3e-31. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy difference. Maybe the next state isn't just J=1, but a combination of J and v? Or perhaps the vibrational and rotational transitions are considered together.

Wait, but the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energies. So transitions can involve both. But I'm trying to find the smallest possible energy jump, which would be the first overtone or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition. Let me recalculate using the vibrational energy.

E_photon for vibrational transition (v=0→v=1) would be h ν. Because ΔE = (3/2 h ν) - (1/2 h ν) = h ν.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

ν is 4e14 Hz (since 1 rad/s is 1 Hz, right? Or wait, in the question, w is given in rad/s. So ν (frequency) is w/(2π). Because w = 2π ν.

So ν = w/(2π) = (4e14 rad/s) / (2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

Wait, that's important. I think I might have used the wrong frequency earlier.

Because the given w is 4e14 rad/s, so frequency f = ν = w/(2π) ≈ 4e14/(6.283) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So the vibrational energy ΔE_vib = h ν = 6.626e-34 J s * 6.366e13 Hz.

Calculating that:

6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = Let's compute 6.626 * 6.366 ≈ 42.23. So 42.23e-34+13 = 42.23e-21 → 4.223e-20 J.

So E_photon_vib is approximately 4.223e-20 J.

Then, the momentum p = E/c = 4.223e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 kg m/s → 1.407e-28 Ns.

That's option D) 1.4e-28 N*s.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition would require a photon of lower energy, but maybe I messed up the calculation because I used the wrong frequency.

Wait, let me re-examine the rotational energy calculation. Because the vibrational frequency is different from the rotational frequency. Oh wait, perhaps the vibrational transition is higher in energy than the rotational, but in this case, maybe the rotational transition is possible.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the rotational energy as 9.22e-23 J, that's way smaller than the vibrational transition's 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires a lower energy photon, so that would be the next possible state.

But why isn't the answer matching any of the options? Because 9e-23 J leads to a momentum of 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the rotational energy transition. Let me recheck.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can change both rotational and vibrational states. But the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy increment would be the smallest possible ΔE.

So which is smaller: the rotational transition ΔE_rot or the vibrational ΔE_vib?

ΔE_rot = ℏ²/(I) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

ΔE_vib = h ν ≈ 4.2e-20 J.

So the rotational transition is much lower energy, so the photon needed is for that transition. But then the momentum p is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me go through that again.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating that: 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.016. So μ ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.016e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Correct.

Now, ℏ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

ℏ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05)^2 = 1.1025; so 1.1025e-68 (J s)^2.

Now, ℏ² / I = 1.1025e-68 / 1.2064e-46 → Let me compute that.

1e-68 / 1e-46 = 1e-22. So 1.1025 / 1.2064 ≈ 0.914.

So 0.914e-22 J = 9.14e-23 J.

So E_photon_rot = 9.14e-23 J.

p = E/c = 9.14e-23 / 3e8 = 3.047e-31 kg m/s = 3.047e-31 N s.

But none of the options are this small. So perhaps the photon's energy isn't for the rotational transition but a combination of rotational and vibrational.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy might be a vibrational transition to v=1, but not necessarily. That would be a higher energy than the rotational transition, but perhaps in some models, the vibrational transitions are not allowed unless certain conditions are met, like dipole moment changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy levels are such that the rotational transition is not possible, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the vibrational transition, not the rotational, perhaps because the rotational energy is much lower and the photon's momentum is calculated based on the vibrational energy.

Wait, but the question says the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, so both are considered. So perhaps the minimal energy transition is the vibrational one.

Wait, but why is the calculated rotational photon's momentum so much smaller than any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let's recheck that.

Wait, the moment of inertia I for a diatomic molecule is μ R², correct. So μ is in kg, R in meters, so I has units kg m².

Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency. Because the given angular frequency is for the vibration, not rotation.

Wait, the problem gives w (angular frequency) for vibration as 4e14 rad/s.

But the rotational energy uses the rotational angular frequency, which is different. So perhaps I should calculate the rotational frequency using the moment of inertia.

The rotational frequency (angular) is given by ω_rot = sqrt( (ℏ²/(I)) ) / (h/(2π)) )? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ℏ² / 2I) J(J+1). The spacing between levels (for J and J+1) is E_rot (J+1) - E_rot (J) ) = (ℏ²/(2I) ) [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ].

Which simplifies to (ℏ²/(2I)) [ ( (J² + 3J + 2 ) - (J² + J) ) ] = (ℏ²/(2I)) ( 2J + 2 ) ) = (ℏ²/(2I)) * 2 (J+1) ) = (ℏ² (J+1) ) / I.

Wait, but when J=0, the transition to J=1 would be ΔE_rot = (ℏ²/(I)) * (1).

Which is the same as before.

So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let me think again about the photon's energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy, regardless of whether it's rotational or vibrational. So if the rotational transition is possible, that's the lower energy. But perhaps the rotational transition isn't allowed because the molecule is in a certain state, or perhaps the selection rules don't allow it.

Wait, for rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So J can go from 0 to 1. So that's allowed.

Ah, but wait, the vibrational and rotational transitions can happen in combination. So a photon can cause a simultaneous change in both. But the problem is, what's the minimal energy needed.

So the minimal photon energy is the smallest possible ΔE between the initial (v=0, J=0) and any higher state.

So the possible next states are:

1. (v=0, J=1) → requires ΔE_rot = ℏ²/I ≈ 9.14e-23 J.

2. (v=1, J=0) → requires ΔE_vib = h ν ≈ 4.2e-20 J.

3. (v=1, J=1) → ΔE = h ν + ℏ²/I.

Which is bigger than 4.2e-20 J, so not the minimal.

So the minimal ΔE is the rotational transition. But the photon's momentum for that is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, maybe the question is considering only the vibrational transition because it's a diatomic molecule modeled as a non-rigid rotor. Hmm, no, the non-rigid rotor would have a varying bond length, but the energy calculation would still involve the same formula for rotation, but with a variable I. But for the transition, perhaps the change in bond length affects the rotational inertia, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering rotation but just vibration. Or perhaps I should be considering the energy in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the transition is a combination of the first rotational and first vibrational levels, but that would lead to a higher energy, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the given angular frequency w is for rotation, not vibration. No, the question says the angular frequency w is for vibration. Because it's given as vibration.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator, and the vibrational frequency is given by w = sqrt(k/μ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy is so small compared to the vibrational that the problem is actually looking for the vibrational transition. Because the options are all around 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns.

Wait, let's compute the momentum for the vibrational transition again.

E_photon_vib = h ν = 6.626e-34 J s * (4e14 rad/s)/(2π) → because ν = w/(2π).

So ν = 4e14 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 4e14 /6.283 ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So E_photon_vib = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = Let me compute that.

6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = (6.626 *6.366) * 1e-34+13.

6.626 *6.366 ≈ 42.2.

So 42.2e-21 → 4.22e-20 J.

Momentum p = E/c = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.407e-28 kg m/s → 1.407e-28 Ns.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N*s.

But wait, earlier I thought the rotational transition's photon is much lower. So why isn't that the case?

Maybe the rotational transition isn't allowed. Wait, dipole selection rules for rotation allow ΔJ=±1, but for vibration, Δv=±1.

But in this problem, the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0). So the next state can be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1).

But perhaps in the rotation-vibration model, the allowed transitions are those where both rotational and vibrational can change, but the minimal energy would come from the rotational change.

But according to the calculations, the rotational transition requires a much lower energy photon.

But the answer options don't have that. So perhaps the question is actually considering the vibrational transition as the next state.

Is there any possibility that the problem expects the use of the vibrational photon? Because that would give the answer in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the rotation-vibration coupling, and the energy levels are such that the minimal transition is a combination of rotation and vibration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use the moment of inertia with the reduced mass, but I think I did that.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the next state with the lowest possible energy, which is the first excited state, but perhaps the first excited state is a vibrational state.

Wait, the energy of the fundamental state is E_initial = (1/2) h ν.

The next state would be the first excited state, which could be either a rotational or vibrational state.

But if the rotational transition is allowed, which requires a lower energy photon, but the options don't have that, perhaps the problem is expecting the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy and the actual value is larger.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that I is μ R², and I should express it in terms of the given bond length.

Wait, let me recompute I.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 = 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx 3.016e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = μ R² = 3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Yes, that's correct.

So ℏ²/I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.2064e-46.

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 1.2064e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 1.2064e-46 = 9.22e-23 J.

p = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are much larger, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's model.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and an isotropic harmonic oscillator, but when combining the two, perhaps the energy levels are quantized with both factors.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels are E = E_rot + E_vib.

E_rot = (ℏ²/(2I)) J(J+1).

E_vib = (1/2) h ν + h ν v.

So the initial state is (v=0, J=0) → E_initial = 0 + (1/2) h ν.

The next possible states are:

1. (v=1, J=0) → E = (1/2) h ν + h ν + 0 = (3/2) h ν.

ΔE = (3/2 h ν) - (1/2 h ν) ) = h ν.

2. (v=0, J=1) → E = (ℏ²/(2I)) * 2 * (1/2) ) + (1/2) h ν. Wait, no.

Wait, E_rot for J=1 is (ℏ²/(2I)) * 1*(1+1) )= (ℏ²/(2I)) * 2 )= ℏ²/(I).

So E_rot(1) = ℏ²/(I).

E_vib(0) is (1/2) h ν.

So ΔE_rot = ℏ²/(I) = 9.22e-23 J.

So the possible energy differences are h ν = 4.2e-20 J and 9.22e-23 J.

The smaller one is the rotational transition. But the options don't have that. So maybe the problem is considering only the vibrational transition.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N s, which is what we get for the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be based on the vibrational transition, assuming that rotational transitions aren't considered. Or perhaps the mistake is in the calculation.

But why would the rotational transition's photon momentum be so small and not match any option? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the photon's momentum.

Wait, let me re-calculate the rotational photon's momentum.

E_photon_rot = 9.22e-23 J.

p = E_photon_rot / c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

That's 3.07e-31 Ns. None of the options match this.

The only option close to 1e-28 is option D (1.4e-28) and option C (1.1e-27), which are larger by factors of about 4e7 and 3e6, respectively.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the rotational energy in terms of the given frequency.

Wait, another approach: the rotational energy is given by E_rot = (1/2) I ω_rot^2.

Wait, but that's the classical expression. In quantum mechanics, the energy levels are quantized.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy can be written in terms of the vibrational frequency. But I don't see a direct relation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next state in terms of the quantum number, not the energy. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the rotational and vibrational frequencies.

Wait, the given w is the vibrational angular frequency, 4e14 rad/s. So ν_vib = w/(2π) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

The rotational angular frequency ω_rot can be found from the moment of inertia as ω_rot = sqrt( (k_rot)/I ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, ω_rot can be estimated from the rotational energy levels, but perhaps this isn't necessary.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem requires the use of the non-rigid rotor model, which implies that the bond length can change, thus varying I. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the bond length is fixed, so the rigid rotor model is used.

Given all that, but the calculated rotational photon momentum isn't among the options, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, which gives 1.4e-28 Ns (option D).

But why would the rotational transition not be considered? Perhaps because the photon's momentum is based on the vibrational energy, which is higher, but perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me check the units again.

Wait, in calculating the rotational energy, I have:

E_rot = (ℏ²/(2I)) J(J+1).

For J=0, E_rot = 0.

For J=1, E_rot = (ℏ²/(2I)) * 2 = ℏ²/(I).

So this part is correct.

Alternative idea: perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a three-dimensional rotor, but diatomic molecules are considered as planar rotors, which is 2D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is a bit ambiguous, and the intended answer is based on the vibrational transition, which leads to option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next possible states are either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). The goal is to identify the transition with the smallest energy difference and compute the corresponding photon momentum.

### Key Data:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  \( \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} \)  
  \( \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)

- **Bond length**:  
  \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)  
  Moment of inertia:  
  \( I = \mu R^2 = 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \)

- **Vibrational angular frequency**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)  
  Vibrational frequency:  
  \( \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz} \)

### Energy Transitions:
1. **Rotational Transition (J=0 → J=1, v=0)**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)
   \]  
   For \( J=0 \), \( E_{\text{rot}} = 0 \). For \( J=1 \),  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{\text{rot}}(J=1) - E_{\text{rot}}(J=0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2064 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
   \]  
   This value is much smaller than any of the provided options and is therefore not considered.

2. **Vibrational Transition (v=0 → v=1, J=0)**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{1}{2} h \nu + h \nu v
   \]  
   For \( v=0 \), \( E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{1}{2} h \nu \). For \( v=1 \),  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = E_{\text{vib}}(v=1) - E_{\text{vib}}(v=0) = h \nu
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 6.366 \times 10^{13} \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
   \]  
   This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires a much smaller photon energy than the vibrational transition, but the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) does not match any of the provided options. Therefore, the problem likely expects the answer to be based on the vibrational transition, which corresponds to option **D**.
