Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry. Wait, but let me think step by step.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So it looks like a 2D metric because there are dx and dy terms. I think this is a 2-dimensional space, maybe with some curvature.

Wait, what's a pseudosphere? I recall it's a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric might be describing such a space. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form, but I think the metric for hyperbolic space in polar coordinates is something like dr² + (a²/(1 - (r²/a²)))² dθ², where a is the radius. But the given metric is in terms of x and y, so maybe it's in Cartesian coordinates.

Alternatively, the metric given has a denominator of (4 - x² - y²), which I can rewrite as 4 - (x² + y²). So if x² + y² is r², then the denominator is 4 - r². The numerator is 32, so the metric becomes ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), but wait, no, the original is in dx² and dy², which would be dr² and r² dθ² in polar coordinates. Hmm, maybe I should switch to polar coordinates to analyze this better.

Let me convert x² + y² to r². So the metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). That makes sense because it's a conformally flat metric. The line element is scaled by a function of r.

Wait, for a hyperbolic space, the metric is usually written as (a^2/(1 - (r^2/a^2))) (dr² + r² dθ²), right? Comparing that to what we have: 32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4 - r²) = 32/(4(1 - (r²/4))) )= 8/(1 - (r²/4)). So that would look like a^2/(1 - (r²/a²)) when a^2 is 8 times (1 - (r²/4))... Wait, maybe a^2 is 8, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a^2 is 4, but in any case, the scaling factor is 32/(4 - r²) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)), so the denominator is of the form 1 - (r²/a²) with a²=4, so a=2, but the scaling factor is 8/(1 - (r^2/4)).

Wait, maybe I should think about the area. The area of a pseudosphere (which, I think, refers to a hyperbolic plane in this context) would be infinite because hyperbolic space is non-compact and has infinite area. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up terms. Pseudosphere is a surface, but here maybe the metric represents a hyperbolic plane, which is an unbounded space with finite curvature.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere (the tractricoid) is finite. Wait, no, wait. The tractricoid is a surface of revolution with infinite extent but finite area? Or is it the other way around? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given describes a hyperbolic plane. The area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite. So if the question is asking about the total area, the answer would be infinite, which is option D. But the question specifically mentions a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but a pseudosphere is a finite surface, isn't it? Or perhaps it's a model of hyperbolic space of a certain radius.

Wait, the metric given is in 2D, so it's a surface. Let's compute the area of a sphere in this metric. For that, I need to compute the volume enclosed by a constant r, but wait, since it's 2D, it's the area. Alternatively, perhaps it's the whole space, so the area is infinite. But let's compute what's the proper area.

The area element in 2D is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. Wait, no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The metric is diagonal, so det g is (32/(4 - r²))^2. Wait, no, wait, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So in terms of r and θ, the metric tensor g has components (32/(4 - r²)) for dr² and (32 r²/(4 - r²)) for r² dθ². So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) )= (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2. So the square root is (32 r)/(4 - r²). Therefore, the area element dA is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Wait, but integrating this from r=0 up to some maximum r. Wait, the denominator (4 - r²) would go to zero when r²=4, so r=2. So the maximum r is 2, because beyond that, the denominator becomes zero or negative, which would make the metric singular or even spacelike, which doesn't make sense for a spatial metric. So the space is only defined for r² <4, that is, r<2. So the space is a disk of radius 2.

Wait, then the area can be calculated by integrating dA from r=0 to r=2, and θ from 0 to 2π. So let's compute the integral.

Area = ∫∫ dA = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the radial integral first. Let u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr ]/(4 - r²) ) = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) ) = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (du/u) = -16 ln |u| + C.

Wait, but when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral from 0 to 2 is [ -16 ln(4 - r²) ] evaluated from 0 to 2. At r=2, 4 - r²=0, so ln(0) is negative infinity. At r=0, it's ln(4) = ln(4). So the integral becomes (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → (-16) [ (-∞) - ln(4) ] → (-16)(-∞) → positive infinity.

So the integral diverges. That means the area is infinite. So the area of the entire space is infinite. Therefore, the answer would be D) +infinite.

Wait, but the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2". Oh wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the pseudosphere is a specific surface, and the question is about its area. But a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is a finite surface. Wait, no, the tractricoid is a surface of infinite extent but finite area. Because it's constructed as a surface of revolution of a tractrix, which has infinite length but finite area. So the area would be finite.

Wait, but in this metric, the maximum r is 2. So if the pseudosphere is parameterized by r up to 2, then perhaps the area is finite. Hmm, but in the metric, the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. If I integrate up to r=2, would that give a finite area?

Wait, let me calculate the integral properly. The integral from 0 to 2 of [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make the substitution u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) ) → 32 ∫ [ (r dr)/ (4 - r²) ) ]

=32 ∫ [ ( - du/2 ) / u ) ]

=32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u du )

= -16 ∫ (1/u) du 

= -16 ln |u| + C.

Evaluated from u=4 (when r=0) to u=0 (when r=2).

So it's [ -16 ln(0) ) + 16 ln(4) )

But ln(0) is -infinity, so ln(0) is negative infinity. So -16 * (-infty ) = +infty. So the integral is infinite.

So that means the area is infinite. But wait, the pseudosphere (tractricoid) has finite area. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the model.

Wait, the metric given might not be the standard hyperbolic metric. Let me think about the standard hyperbolic metric. In Poincaré coordinates, the metric is (ds)^2 = (a^2/(z^2)) (dx^2 + dy^2), but that's for a different model. Alternatively, the metric in terms of x and y could be another representation.

Wait, but the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). For the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space, the metric is usually (ds)^2 = (a^2/(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2) (dx² + dy²). But in our case, it's 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 - r², which is similar to 1 - (r²/4). So perhaps a^2 is 4, making the denominator 1 - (r²/4). So the scaling factor would be 32/(4(1 - (r²/4))) )= 8/(1 - (r²/4)).

Wait, but in the standard hyperbolic metric, the scaling factor is (a^2)/(1 - (r^2/a^2)) which is (a^2)/(1 - (r^2/a^2)) = (a^2) * [1/(1 - (r^2/a^2))] = a^2 * [sum_{n=0}^\infty (r²/a²)^n ] for |r| <a. So the area would be the integral of sqrt(det g) dx dy, which in this case is the scaling factor squared? Wait, no, because the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2, so sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, so the area element is 32/(4 - r²) dx dy. But in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ, so dA = [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the total area would be ∫∫ [32 r / (4 - r²) ] dr dθ. The limits for r are 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the integral over θ is 2π. The integral over r is ∫(0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

As before, substitution u=4 - r² → du= -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ) ] = 32 ∫ ( (-du/2 ) / u ) )= 32*(-1/2) ∫ (du/u) )= -16 ln |u| + C.

Evaluated from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0). So it becomes (-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → (-16) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → (-16)(-infty) → +infty.

So the area is infinite. So the answer would be D) +infinite.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, maybe pseudosphere refers to a hyperbolic plane with curvature such that the radius is 2. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere in question refers to the tractricoid, which has finite area. But in that case, the metric might not be the one given here.

Wait, perhaps I got the model wrong. Maybe the given metric is that of a sphere, not a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sphere with an infinite area.

Wait, but a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The given metric's Gaussian curvature can be calculated to check.

Wait, for a metric in 2D, the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 r^2)) [ (g_rr - g_θθ)/ (g_{θθ}) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use another formula. Alternatively, the Gaussian curvature can be found from the metric component.

Alternatively, for a metric ds² = E dr² + G r² dθ², the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = [ - (1/(2 r)) ] * [ d/d r (E / r) ].

Wait, maybe another approach is better. Let me remember that for conformally flat metrics, the curvature can be computed from the conformal factor.

The given metric is conformally flat, so it's ds² = ω² (dx² + dy²), where ω is the conformal factor.

The formula for the Gaussian curvature K in such a case is K = - (1/(2)) Δ ln ω, where Δ is the flat-space Laplacian.

So ω = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) → because ds² = ω² (dx² + dy²), so ω² = 32/(4 - r²), so ω = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, perhaps to compute K, I can compute Δ (ln ω):

ln ω = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

The Laplacian in polar coordinates for a radially symmetric function is (1/r) d/dr (r d(f/dr)).

So f = ln ω = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

df/dr = [ 0 - (1/2) * ( -2r )/(4 - r²) ) ] = ( r )/(4 - r²).

Then,

d/dr (r df/dr) = d/dr [ r * ( r/(4 - r²) ) ] = d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ) ].

Let me compute that:

d/dr [ r²/(4 - r²) ] = [ 2r (4 - r²) + r² (2r) ] / (4 - r²)^2

= [ 8r - 2 r^3 + 2 r^3 ] / (4 - r²)^2

= 8 r / (4 - r²)^2.

Then,

(1/r) d/dr (r df/dr) ) = (1/r) * [8 r / (4 - r²)^2 ] = 8 / (4 - r²)^2.

So Δ (ln ω) = 8/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, K = - (1/2) * (8)/(4 - r²)^2 ) = -4/(4 - r²)^2.

So the Gaussian curvature is negative everywhere, which is consistent with hyperbolic space. But the magnitude depends on r.

Wait, but a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So this metric doesn't have constant curvature. So maybe this isn't a pseudosphere, but some other space.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, I computed K as -4/(4 - r²)^2. That's varying with r, so it's not constant. So this is not a space of constant curvature. Therefore, the given metric is not that of a pseudosphere (tractricoid), which has constant negative curvature. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface, but the metric given is for a 2D space, perhaps a portion of hyperbolic plane. But the area of a hyperbolic plane is infinite, so the total area would be infinite. So the answer would be D.

But the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2". Wait, maybe the pseudosphere here refers to the model where the radius is such that the curvature is -1/(r^2). So if r=2, then curvature is -1/(4). Let me think about the standard hyperbolic metric.

The standard hyperbolic metric in Poincaré disk coordinates with curvature -k is:

ds² = (a^2/(a^2 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where a is related to the curvature. Wait, for curvature K=-k², the metric is (1/(a^2 (1 - (r^2/a^2))^2 )) (dr² + r² dθ²), where a^2 = 1/k².

In our case, the metric is (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Which can be rewritten as (32/(4 (1 - (r²/4))) ) (dr² + r² dθ²) )= 8/(1 - (r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So that's similar to (a^2/(1 - (r²/a^2))) (dr² + r² dθ²), which would imply a^2=8, but that doesn't fit exactly.

But wait, perhaps if a²=4, then 32/(4 - r²) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)), which is 8/(1 - (r²/a^2)) with a=2. So the scaling factor is 8/(1 - (r²/4)).

In the standard hyperbolic metric, the scaling factor is a²/(1 - (r²/a²))². Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic space with curvature K=-1 is:

ds² = (1/(1 - (r²))^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). So for curvature K=-k², the metric is (1/(1 - (r²)/a² )^2 ) (dr² + r² dθ²), where a is the radius of curvature. So in our case, the metric is (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²) )= (32)/(4 (1 - (r²/4))) ) (dr² + r² dθ² )= 8/(1 - (r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²). So that's similar to a model where a²=4, but with an extra factor of 8. Hmm.

Well, regardless of the model, the area is determined by integrating the area element. As I computed earlier, the integral diverges, so the area is infinite. Therefore, the answer must be D) +infty.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. So maybe the area is finite. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the given metric as representing a sphere rather than a pseudosphere. But no, the Gaussian curvature is negative, so it's hyperbolic.

Wait, another approach: the area of a sphere in 2D is 4π r². But this is a hyperbolic metric, so the area would be different. Wait, but the area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite.

So putting it all together, the area of the given space is infinite. So the answer is D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This describes a 2D space with a conformally flat metric. To analyze the area, the metric is rewritten in polar coordinates as:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right),
\]

where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\). The area element in polar coordinates is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta,
\]

and for this metric, \(\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \(dA\) over the entire space. The limits of integration are \(r = 0\) to \(r = 2\) (since the metric becomes singular at \(r = 2\)) and \(\theta = 0\) to \(\theta = 2\pi\). The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) gives \(2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{-du/2}{u} = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
-16 \left[\ln|u|\right]_4^0 = -16 \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, indicating that the total area is infinite. This result aligns with the fact that the space described by the metric is a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite extent and thus infinite area.

The question asks for the "area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\)." However, the given metric does not describe a pseudosphere (tractricoid), which is a finite surface of constant negative curvature. Instead, it describes a hyperbolic plane, whose total area is infinite. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
