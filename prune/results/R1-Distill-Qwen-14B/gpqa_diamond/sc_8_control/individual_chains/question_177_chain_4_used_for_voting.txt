Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key information given is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Then, through spectroscopy, the stars' brightest emission wavelengths are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They're assuming the stars are black bodies and want to find out by how much Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, so I remember that luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature through the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula, I think, is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature. So if I can find the temperatures of both stars, I can compute their luminosities and find the ratio.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So both stars have the same temperature? That's interesting because sometimes when stars are moving, their observed wavelengths shift due to Doppler effect, but the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same—so maybe that's the rest wavelength?

Wait, but the radial velocities are given. Oh, right! The Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelength. So the star moving towards us (negative velocity) or away (positive) would have their wavelengths shifted. So the observed λ_max is different from the rest λ_max. But in the question, they must have determined the actual λ_max by correcting for the radial velocity. Because if you don't correct for that, the observed λ_max would differ, but the problem states that the λ_max they determined are the same. So maybe they accounted for the Doppler shift.

Let me think. The observed wavelength is λ = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s (assuming v_r is positive when moving away, or is it the other way around?), but wait, the exact sign depends on the convention. Let's clarify: if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so λ increases. So the formula is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards.

But in this problem, the determined λ_max is the same for both stars. So perhaps after correcting for their velocities, both stars have the same effective temperature. Let me model this.

So for each star, their rest wavelength is λ_max = b / T. But the observed λ_max would be λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c). So Star_1 has v_r = 0, so λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 = b / T1.

Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. So λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + (700,000 m/s) / c). Wait, but c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. So the relative velocity is 7e5 / 3e8 = approx 0.002333. So 1 + 700e3/(3e8) = approx 1.002333. So λ_obs,2 ≈ λ_rest,2 * 1.002333.

But the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2. Therefore:

λ_rest,1 = λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ_rest,1 = b / T1 and λ_rest,2 = b / T2.

So substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Simplify:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Rearranged:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, that would mean that T2 is higher than T1 if v_r2 is positive (assuming v_r2 is moving away). Alternatively, if v_r2 is moving towards us, which would make the observed wavelength shorter, but the problem states that the observed wavelengths are same. Let me double-check the Doppler formula.

Alternatively, the Doppler shift formula is sometimes written as λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but that's for relativistic speeds. However, 700 km/s is about 0.23% of the speed of light, so non-relativistic approximation should suffice.

In the non-relativistic case, λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity (positive when moving away). So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer. But since both stars have the same observed λ_max, Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter to compensate. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ would be longer. So to have the same observed λ as Star_1, which has v_r=0, Star_2 must have a shorter rest wavelength. Since λ_rest is inversely proportional to T, that would mean Star_2 has a higher temperature than Star_1.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose Star_2 is moving away (v_r positive), so the observed wavelength is longer. But since the observed λ is the same as Star_1, which is at rest, Star_2's rest wavelength must be shorter. So λ_rest,2 = λ_rest,1 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Because λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c ) = λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.

So,

λ_rest,2 = λ_obs,1 / (1 + v_r2 / c ) = λ_rest,1 / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Which implies that λ_rest,2 < λ_rest,1.

Since λ_rest = b / T, lower λ_rest means higher temperature. So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, let's plug it in.

We have λ_rest,2 = (λ_rest,1) / (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ_rest,1 = b / T1 and λ_rest,2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T2 = (b / T1) / (1 + v_r2 / c )

Cancel b,

1/T2 = (1/T1) / (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

1/T2 = (1)/(T1 (1 + v_r2 / c )) )

Which implies T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2 / c )

So, T2 is higher than T1 by a factor of (1 + 700e3 / (3e5e3) )

Wait, 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s.

So v_r2 / c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333...

Wait, wait no, 700,000 is 7e5, 3e8 is 300 million. 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.023333... So 1 + 0.023333 is 1.023333.

So T2 = T1 * 1.023333.

So Star_2 has a temperature higher than Star_1 by approximately 2.33%.

Now, the luminosity of a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴.

We can write the ratio of luminosities L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T2 = 1.023333 T1.

Wait, let me clarify R and T:

Star_1 has R1 = 1.5 R2.

Star_2 has T2 = 1.023333 T1.

So, L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Substituting R1 = 1.5 R2 and T2 = 1.023333 T1:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (1.023333 T1)^4 )

Simplify:

= (2.25 R2² T1^4 ) / ( R2² (1.023333^4 T1^4) )

Cancel R2² and T1^4:

= 2.25 / (1.023333^4 )

Compute 1.023333^4.

Let me calculate that.

First, 1.023333^1 = 1.023333.

1.023333^2 ≈ 1.023333 * 1.023333.

Let me compute 1.023333 * 1.023333.

1.023333 * 1.023333 = approx 1.023333^2.

Let me compute 1.023333 squared:

(1 + 0.023333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.023333 + (0.023333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.046666 + 0.000544 = approx 1.04721.

Then, 1.04721 squared is (1.023333^4).

Wait, no, wait. 1.023333^4 = (1.023333^2)^2 → (1.04721)^2.

Compute 1.04721 * 1.04721.

Let me calculate that:

Approximate:

1.04721 * 1.04721 ≈ (1 + 0.04721)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.04721 + 0.04721^2.

Which is 1 + 0.09442 + 0.00223 ≈ 1.09665.

Wait, 0.04721 squared is about 0.00223. So total is about 1.09665.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the earlier step. Let's compute it more accurately:

1.04721 * 1.04721 = ?

Let me do 1.04721 multiplied by 1.04721.

1.04721 × 1.04721:

Let me compute 1.04721 * 1.04721.

Breaking it down:

1.04721 * 1 = 1.04721.

1.04721 * 0.04 = 0.04189.

1.04721 * 0.007 = 0.00733.

1.04721 * 0.00021 = approx 0.0002199.

Adding them up:

1.04721 + 0.04189 = 1.0891

Plus 0.00733 → 1.09643

Plus 0.0002199 → approx 1.09665.

So 1.04721 squared is approximately 1.09665.

So 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.09665.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ ?

Calculating 2.25 / 1.09665.

Let me compute this division.

2.25 ÷ 1.09665 ≈ ?

1.09665 × 2 = 2.1933.

That's less than 2.25, so 2.25 - 2.1933 = 0.0567.

So 2.25 ≈ 2.1933 (which is 2 × 1.09665) + 0.0567.

So, 0.0567 / 1.09665 ≈ 0.0517.

So total is approximately 2.0517.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 1.09665 is about 1.09665, and 2.25 divided by that is roughly:

2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.0517.

Wait, but wait, 1.09665 is about 1.0967, so 1.0967 * 2 is 2.1934, which is less than 2.25. So 2.25 / 1.0967 would be about 2.05 or so.

Wait, but let me compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach: 1.09665 * 2.05 = ?

1.09665 × 2 = 2.1933.

1.09665 × 0.05 = 0.05483.

So total 2.1933 + 0.05483 = 2.24813.

Which is very close to 2.25. So 2.05 * 1.09665 ≈ 2.24813, which is about 2.25.

So 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ approximately 2.05.

Wait, but wait, the options are around 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35.

Hmm, that suggests that my calculation might be wrong somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1.023333)^4.

Let me re-calculate 1.023333^4 more accurately.

Let me compute (1.023333)^2 first.

1.023333^2 = ?

1.023333 × 1.023333.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

1.023333 × 1.023333:

Break it down into (1 + 0.023333) × (1 + 0.023333).

= 1^2 + 2×1×0.023333 + (0.023333)^2.

= 1 + 0.046666 + 0.0005444.

So 1 + 0.046666 = 1.046666; plus 0.0005444 gives 1.0472104.

So 1.0472104.

Now, square that to get 1.023333^4.

So 1.0472104^2.

Again, breaking it down:

= (1 + 0.0472104)^2.

= 1 + 2*(0.0472104) + (0.0472104)^2.

= 1 + 0.0944208 + 0.0022292.

Adding up: 1 + 0.0944208 = 1.0944208; plus 0.0022292 → 1.09665.

So 1.023333^4 is approximately 1.09665.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

But the options don't have 2.05. The options are A) ~2.25, which is the square of 1.5, but perhaps that's before considering temperature. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Because when the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted. But the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. So perhaps they measured the same observed wavelength, but each star's actual, intrinsic wavelength is different.

Wait, but I thought that the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c). So for each star, λ_obs is the same.

So, λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1 * (1 + v_r1/c )

v_r1 is zero, so λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.

Similarly, λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Set them equal: λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ_rest is b / T. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Which is what I had earlier.

So, T2 is 1.023333 times T1.

So the ratio of luminosities is (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, T2 = 1.023333 T1.

So R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

T1^4 / T2^4 = [ T1/(1.023333 T1) ]^4 = (1/1.023333)^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1/1.09665) ≈ 2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

But none of the options are near 2.05. The options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D) 2.23.

Hmm. That suggests I might have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the Doppler shift formula wrong. Maybe I should consider that the observed wavelength is the same, so the intrinsic temperature is different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correction is that the observed wavelength's max is the same for both stars. So, the observed λ_max is same, which is λ_obs,1 = λ_obs,2.

But for Star_1, since it's not moving, λ_obs,1 = λ_rest,1.

For Star_2, λ_obs,2 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

So equate:

λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which gives λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * (1 + 700e3 / 3e5e3 )

Wait, 700e3 is 7e5 m/s. 3e5e3 is 3e8 m/s.

7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

λ_rest,1 = λ_rest,2 * 1.023333

But λ_rest is b / T, so:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * 1.023333

→ 1/T1 = 1.023333 / T2 → T2 = 1.023333 T1.

So that part seems correct.

So now, compute L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1²/R2² = 2.25.

T2 = 1.023333 T1 → T2^4 = (1.023333)^4 T1^4.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (T1^4) / ( (1.023333)^4 T1^4 )

Which simplifies to 2.25 / (1.023333)^4.

We found 1.023333^4 ≈ 1.09665.

So,

2.25 / 1.09665 ≈ 2.05.

Hmm, but the options are all around 2.2 to 2.35. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1.023333^4.

Wait, perhaps my approximation for 1.023333^4 was too rough. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 1.023333^4 precisely.

First, compute 1.023333^2.

1.023333 * 1.023333.

Let me compute it more accurately:

1.023333 × 1.023333.

Let me use the formula (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=1, b=0.023333.

a² =1.

2ab = 2 * 1 * 0.023333 = 0.046666.

b² = (0.023333)^2 = approx 0.0005444.

So sum: 1 + 0.046666 = 1.046666 + 0.0005444 = 1.0472104.

So 1.0472104.

Now compute (1.0472104)^2:

(1.0472104)^2 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

1.0472104 × 1.0472104:

Let me compute 1.0472104 × 1.0472104.

Break it down:

= (1 + 0.0472104) × (1 + 0.0472104)

= 1 + 2*0.0472104 + (0.0472104)^2.

Compute each term:

2 * 0.0472104 = 0.0944208.

(0.0472104)^2 = 0.0472104 * 0.0472104.

Let me compute 0.0472104^2:

= (4.72104e-2)^2 = (4.72104)^2 × 1e-4.

4.72104^2 = approximately 22.285 (since 4.7^2=22.09, 4.72^2=22.2784, 4.721^2= approx 22.285).

So 22.285e-4 = 0.0022285.

So, summing the terms:

1 + 0.0944208 = 1.0944208.

Plus 0.0022285 gives 1.0966493.

So, 1.0472104^2 ≈ 1.0966493.

So 1.023333^4 is approximately 1.0966493.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.0966493 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 ÷ 1.0966493.

Let me think: 1.0966493 × 2 = 2.1932986.

Subtract that from 2.25: 2.25 - 2.1932986 = 0.0567014.

So, 0.0567014 / 1.0966493 ≈ 0.0517.

So, the total is 2 + 0.0517 = 2.0517.

So approximately 2.05.

But the options don't have 2.05. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Doppler shift. Let me think again. Are the velocities given in km/s or m/s? The question says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s.

So, v_r2 = 700,000 m/s.

c is approximately 299,792,458 m/s. Let me use c≈3e8 m/s for approximation.

v_r2 / c = 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So, 1 + v_r2/c = 1.023333.

So, that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1 + (v_r2)/(c) ) more accurately.

700,000 / 299,792,458 = ?

Let me compute that.

700,000 ÷ 299,792,458 ≈ 0.002337.

Ah, wait! Earlier, I used c=3e8 m/s, which is 300,000,000 m/s. But the actual c is about 299,792,458 m/s.

So 700,000 / 299,792,458 = approx 0.002337.

Which is 0.2337%, not 0.2333% as I thought earlier.

So, 1 + v_r2/c = 1.002337.

So, T2 = T1 * 1.002337.

Now, let's recompute T2^4.

T2 = 1.002337 T1 → T2^4 = (1.002337)^4 T1^4.

Compute (1.002337)^4.

First, compute (1.002337)^2.

1.002337^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.002337 + (0.002337)^2.

= 1 + 0.004674 + 0.00000546.

= 1.00467946.

Then, square that to get (1.002337)^4.

(1.00467946)^2.

Again, using (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², with a=1, b=0.00467946.

a²=1.

2ab= 2 * 1 * 0.00467946 = 0.00935892.

b²= (0.00467946)^2 ≈ 0.0000219.

So,

1.00467946^2 ≈ 1 + 0.00935892 + 0.0000219 ≈ 1.00938082.

So, (1.002337)^4 ≈ 1.00938082.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.00938082 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.00938082.

1.00938082 × 2.23 = ? Let's check.

Alternatively, let me compute 2.25 / 1.00938082.

1.00938082 × 2 = 2.01876164.

2.01876164 → which is less than 2.25.

So, 2.25 - 2.01876164 = 0.23123836.

So, 0.23123836 / 1.00938082 ≈ 0.2292.

So the total is 2 + 0.2292 ≈ 2.2292.

Wait, that would be approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Radii and Temperatures
- Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so \( \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).
- The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, implying that the intrinsic rest wavelengths are related by the Doppler effect. Using the Doppler shift formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

For Star_1 (\(v_r = 0\)) and Star_2 (\(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{700}{300,000}\right)
\]

\[
\frac{\lambda_{\text{rest,1}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest,2}}} = 1 + \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 1.002333
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto \frac{1}{T}\), we find:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

### Step 2: Compute the Temperature Ratio
The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = \frac{1}{(1.002333)^4}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( (1.002333)^4 \)
Using the binomial expansion:

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.002333) + 6(0.002333)^2 + 4(0.002333)^3 + (0.002333)^4
\]

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1.00938
\]

### Step 4: Compute the Luminosity Ratio
Substitute into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{1.00938}
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx \frac{2.25}{1.00938} \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
