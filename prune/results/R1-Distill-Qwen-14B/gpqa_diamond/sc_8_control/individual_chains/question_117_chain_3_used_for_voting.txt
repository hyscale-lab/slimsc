Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I remember from my notes that optical isomerism has to do with chirality, which is when a molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral centers are key hereâ€”those are carbons attached to four different groups. Also, sometimes molecules can have other forms of stereoisomerism, like geometric isomerism, but optical isomerism specifically refers to the presence of chiral centers.

Looking at the options given, there are four moieties to consider. Let's take them one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings linked with substituents. The positions are at 6 and 2 on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate esters. I think that biphenyls can have configurations where the rings are either cis or trans. Wait, but does that create a chiral center? Oh wait, biphenyls themselves can't be chiral unless there's a substituent on each ring that creates a chiral center. Wait, in this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Do these substituents lead to any chiral carbons? Wait, the molecule is a dimethyl ester, so each ester is attached to the benzene ring. So each ester group is OMe. So each benzene has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, maybe the biphenyl has the two rings connected at positions 1 and 1', so the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each. I'm not sure if that makes a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the central single bond between the two benzene rings can rotate, but if there are substituents on opposite sides, could the molecule be chiral? Wait, no, because the rings can rotate around the single bond. So unless the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, it won't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that make the molecule have a plane of symmetry. Let me think: the molecule is symmetrical. If both rings have nitro and ester groups in the same positions, perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. So probably, this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. Let me imagine the structure. The biphenyl has two rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So, nitro is at 6, and ester at 2. Wait, but in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to each other when the ring is numbered with 1 at a certain point. Oh wait, actually, position 2 is adjacent to 1, and 6 is two positions away from 1 in the other direction. So if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, that's para to each other? No, because 2 and 6 are ortho positions relative to each other. Wait, no. For a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So position 2 is next to 1 and 3. Position 6 is next to 5 and 1. So substituents at 2 and 6 are adjacent to the point where the two benzene rings are connected (position 1 and 1'). So each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So each ring has two substituents, but in such a way that the molecule is symmetric. So the overall structure might have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism here. So option 1 likely doesn't show it.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is CH2(COOH2)CH(OH)CH3? Wait, wait. Wait, propanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. But wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure would be:

O
||O
O
      |
CH2-C-O-Me
      |
      OH

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me. Wait, no, wait. The propanoate ester would be CH2CH2COO-Me. But if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me.

So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-Me.

Wait, but the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to what? Let's see: the carbon with OH is the second carbon. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COO-Me.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is three carbons. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that can't be right because the chain would have three carbons. Let me number it:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH(OH).

Carbon 3: CH3.

No, wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the chain is CH2CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-Me. So the molecule is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COO-Me.

Wait, but that would make the structure HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in that case, the hydroxyl is on the CH2 group adjacent to the COO group.

So the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's a straight-chain molecule. Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbon with the hydroxyl is the second carbon. Let's see what groups are attached:

On the second carbon (the one with OH), the groups are:

- OH

- CH2COOCH3 group

- two CH2 groups?

Wait, wait, in the structure HOCH2CH2COOCH3, the second carbon is CH2. So each CH2 has two hydrogens. So the four groups attached to the second carbon would be:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (but wait, it's connected to the first carbon and the third).

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it:

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-Me
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The ester is CH2CH2COOCH3. So the parent chain is three carbons: COOCH3 is at the end, then two CH2 groups. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Now, the second carbon (the one with OH) has:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups? Or maybe the two CH2s are actually two methyl groups? Wait, no, because it's propanoate, the chain is three carbons. So carbon positions:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH(OH).

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, that makes sense. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, because that would be carbon 2. So the second carbon has:

- CH3 (from carbon 3),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (from carbon 1),

- and another CH2 group? Wait, no, because carbon 2 is in the middle. So carbon 2 is attached to:

- COOCH3 (carbon 1),

- CH3 (carbon 3),

- two hydrogens?

Wait, no. Let me think: Carbon 1 is the COOCH3 group (so O-C-O attached to methyl). Carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3. So carbon 2 has:

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- two hydrogens?

Wait, but if that's the case, the four substituents on carbon 2 would be:

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- H,

- H.

So two Hs. So that carbon wouldn't have four different groups. So it's not a chiral center.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the substituents are COOCH3, CH3, and two Hs, then it's not chiral.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm misrepresenting the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. The correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The propanoate ester is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Let's look at carbon 2 in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2(OH) connected to carbon 1 (which is CH2-) and carbon 3 (another CH2).

Wait, so carbon 2 has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from each side),

- and a CH2COOCH3 group.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm mixing up the structure. Alternatively, perhaps I should draw it as:

H2C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to OH and to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

Wait, but Carbon 3 would be a CH3.

Wait, so Carbon 2 is CH2 connected to Carbon 1 (COOCH3), Carbon 3 (CH3), and two Hs. No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe I should write it as:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

In this case, the central CH2 (carbon 2) has:

- HO-,

- two CH2 groups (one attached to COOCH3 and one attached to another CH2),

Wait, no, each CH2 has two CH2 groups? Wait, no, in HOCH2CH2COOCH3, each CH2 is a methylene group. So for the carbon in the middle (carbon 2), the groups are:

- HO-,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups (but wait, that's not possible).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the substituents on each carbon.

The molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So, the chain is H-O-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (attached to C3).

Carbon 2: CH2 (attached to O from HO and to C1 and C3).

Carbon 3: CH2 (attached to O from HO and to C2 and C4 (which is the COOCH3 group)).

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than necessary. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-O-Me
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-

But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. For that, the carbon must be attached to four different groups.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait.

Wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester is CH2CH2COOCH3.

2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups? Or more accurately, the substituents are:

The second carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

Carbon 1: CH2- (from COOCH3),

Carbon 3: CH2- (from COOCH3),

Wait, no. Let me number the carbons:

1: COOCH3,

2: CH2,

3: CH2,

4: OH.

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would make the molecule:

H-O-CH2-CH2-C-O-O-CH3.

In this case, the central CH2 is carbon 2, which is attached to:

- OCH2 (from the OH),

- CH2COOCH3,

and two H's.

Wait, no. Each CH2 in the chain has two H's.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH2. So it's attached to:

- HO-,

- CH2COOCH3,

- and two H's.

Wait, but that would mean three substituents: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two Hs. No, wait, each CH2 has two H's, but in the molecule, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

So that's four substituents: OH, two H, and another CH2. Wait, no, that's three substituents. Wait, each CH2 has two H's, so the four substituents are:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- H,

- H.

So two H's, so the substituent groups are OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H.

That's two Hs and two other groups. So the four groups are not all different. Therefore, there's no chiral center here. So this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because I remember that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is a chiral molecule. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the structure. Perhaps I should consider that the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's attached to other different groups.

Wait, let me think of another way. If the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3, then the carbon bearing the OH is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- two CH's (maybe?), but no, that might not be right.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH2CH(OH)COO-)Me. Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe I should draw it as:

The propanoate ester is R-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing it with another structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula. The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is C4H6O3.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the possibility of the molecule having a chiral center regardless of the exact structure. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is known as a chiral compound. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, another approach: think of the molecule as (R)- or (S)-configured. For that, there must be four different substituents on the carbon.

If the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3, then the central CH2 is the second carbon, which has:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two Hs.

So that's three substituents, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the OH is on a carbon that has four different groups.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Maybe it's not a straight chain but a branched one.

Wait, wait. Another approach: 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate, making the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the chain is:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2(OH) - ?

Wait, no, it's O

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH2 group (wait, no, because it's CH3 on one side, the COOCH3 on the other, and two H's? No, wait, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH group? No, because the CH is connected to the next carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3 is on the first carbon. The second carbon is CH(OH), connected to the first carbon and the third carbon (which is maybe a CH3).

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should accept that I might have made a mistake and move on, then come back to this one.

3. Benzophenone. That's the compound where two benzene rings are connected by a ketone group. Structure is Ar-CO-Ar, where Ar is aryl groups. Benzophenone itself is (Ph)2CO. Now, benzophenone is symmetrical because both aryl groups are the same. For it to have optical isomerism, there must be a chiral center. But in benzophenone, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl group. So the substituents on the central carbon are:

- two phenyl groups (same),

- a carbonyl group (O double bond C),

- and another phenyl group? Wait, no, wait. The structure is Ph-CO-Ph. So the carbonyl is C=O. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the carbonyl). Wait, no, because the carbonyl is O double bond C, so the central carbon is connected to:

- two phenyl groups,

- a double-bonded O,

- and a single-bonded O (from the ketone group).

Wait, no, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (one double-bonded, one single-bonded). So the groups are: two Ph, O (double), and O (single). So, three substituents, but that's not possible. Wait, no, the central carbon has four bonds: two to phenyl, one double bond to O, and one single bond to O. So that's four substituents.

Wait, the substituents are:

1. Phenyl (Ph),

2. Phenyl (Ph),

3. O (double bond),

4. O (single bond).

So two of the substituents are the same (two Ph groups). So the central carbon is attached to two identical groups (Ph), making it impossible for the molecule to be chiral. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So dimethyl fumarate would be the di-ester of fumaric acid, which has a trans configuration across the double bond. The structure is (Z)- or (E)-? Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure would be (E)-dimethyl fumarate. So the structure is:

CH2CH2(COOCH3)2, with the double bond in the trans configuration.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. Its structure is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, but in the trans configuration. The dimethyl ester would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me.

So the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

Now, this molecule has a double bond with two ester groups on either end. The groups on each end of the double bond are COOCH3 and H (from the CH groups). Wait, no, each end has COOCH3 and a CH group.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-Me
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-O-Me

No, that's not right. Fumarate has a double bond. So the structure is:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe? No, no. Wait, no: fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, so it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, with the substituents on opposite sides.

In this molecule, does the central double bond have geometric isomerism? Yes, but that's E/Z isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism, but not optical isomerism. Wait, but can geometric isomerism (cis-trans) also lead to optical isomerism? Only if the molecule is chiral. So for a molecule to exhibit both, it needs to have a chiral center or another form of chirality.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-Me
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-O-Me

No, wait, no, that's not correct. It's:

O
||
O-C-O-Me
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-O-Me

Wait, that's actually a single bond. No, no. Fumarate is an unsaturated diacid. So the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's the cis (which is maleic acid), but fumarate is the trans, so it's HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but as an ester, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, with the substituents across the double bond.

So the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe with a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, the correct structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

Now, in this molecule, the groups on either end are the same: two COOCH3 groups on each end of the double bond.

But wait, in the case of fumarate, the two ester groups are across from each other (trans configuration). So, the molecule is:

MeOOC
    \
     C=C
    /
MeOOC

Wait, no, because each side of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH group. Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, no, the structure is:

The double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to a COOCH3 group.

So it's MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOMe? No, wait, no double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but regardless, the key point is whether the molecule has a chiral center. For optical isomerism, the molecule must be chiral, which can happen either through a chiral center or another form of asymmetry.

Looking at dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a double bond with two ester groups across. The groups on either side of the double bond are identical (two COOCH3 groups). So, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center and isn't chiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's achiral. In the case of dimethyl fumarate, because the two substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, the molecule is symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. Therefore, it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism here either.

Wait, but I thought that some esters with double bonds can show optical activity if there's a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center because the groups on each end of the double bond are the same. So no, it won't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait! Another thought: perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, each COOCH3 group is across the double bond, so the molecule is symmetrical. So, when you reflect it, it remains the same. So it's not chiral.

So, putting it all together:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: No optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: I'm a bit unsure, but I think it's not chiral, but I'm not confident.

3. Benzophenone: No.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No.

Wait, so the only option where any of these could have optical isomerism is option 2. But earlier I thought option 2's compound doesn't have a chiral center. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about option 2. Let me think again. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

So, four substituents: OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So two H's, so not a chiral center.

Wait, so in that case, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe the structure is different. What if it's a cyclic ester or something else? No, the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is a linear ester.

Hmm. So, that would mean none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But looking at the options, the possible answers are A) 1,2,4; B)3,4; C)2,3; D)1,2.

Wait, but that's not possible because the options suggest some of them do.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Dimethyl fumarate: maybe I was wrong about that. If the molecule is asymmetrical, perhaps it has a chiral center. Wait, but no, because the groups on either side are the same.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, but that's not about optical isomerism. It's about geometric isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about each option again.

Option 1: Is there any possibility of a chiral center in that biphenyl structure? The substituents are nitro and ester groups. If the biphenyl is connected in a way that the substituents are not symmetrical, could that create a chiral center? Wait, each ring has a nitro at position 6 and an ester at 2. So each ring has two substituents, and the connection is at position 1. Let me imagine the structure: two benzene rings connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So the substituents are in positions that are symmetric. So if I rotate the molecule, would it have a plane of symmetry? I think so, so it's not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Option 2: No chiral center, as discussed.

Option 3: No.

Option 4: No.

Wait, but that's impossible because the options don't allow for that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds have a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that only option 2 has a chiral center, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps option 4 has a chiral center. Wait, no, because the substituents on the double bond are the same on both ends.

Wait, maybe I should think of another way. Which of these compounds have a center with four different groups?

Let's think:

1. Can the central carbon (the one connecting the benzene rings) be a chiral center? No, because each benzene ring has identical substituents, so the groups are the same on each side.

2. The second carbon in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no, because two substituents are H.

3. Benzophenone: no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: no.

So, none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I missed something in the analysis. Let me reevaluate each compound.

Option 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Each substituent is a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. The structure is:

Ph-(1)-(Ph)

Each Ph has substituents at 2 and 6:

Ph-2-OOCR, Ph-6-NO2.

Wait, so each ring has two substituents: at 2 and 6. The substituents are OOCR (ester) and NO2.

So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to position 1 (the point of connection between the two rings). So, each ring has a nitro and an ester group in the same positions relative to the connection point.

Would this make the molecule chiral? Let me imagine the structure. If each substituent is in the same relative position on both rings, then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates no symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral. For example, if the ester and nitro groups are on opposite sides of the biphenyl rings, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Option 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The second carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

So, substituents are OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So, two H's. Not four different groups. So, no chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the molecule is (R)- or (S)-configured elsewhere.

Wait, another perspective: perhaps the molecule is a cyclic ester or lactone, but no, it's a methyl ester.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)COOCH2CH2OH. No, that would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, but that's different. Let me think of the structure again.

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure as:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that case, the second carbon is CH2, attached to:

- OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

So, substituents are OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. Two Hs, so no chiral center.

So, no optical isomerism.

Option 3: Benzophenone. No chiral center.

Option 4: Dimethyl fumarate. No chiral center.

So, none of the compounds show optical isomerism. But wait, the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option 2. Let me think again. Maybe the structure is different. Let's consider the possibility that the molecule is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3.

In this case, the structure would be:

CH3

|

CH(OH)

|

COOCH3.

Now, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH group (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think:

If the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps it's a central carbon attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another carbon (from the adjacent CH).

Wait, that makes four different substituents. So in that case, the molecule would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate has three carbons. So, methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon.

So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain: COOCH3, CH2, CH2(OH).

So, the middle carbon (CH2) has two H's, so not a chiral center.

Alternatively, if the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3, that would be a four-carbon chain, but that's not propanoate.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing propanoate with another acid. If the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, its structure is CH3CH(OH)COOH. The ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH group (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, but adjacent to that is another CH3 group? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH2 group? No, because in this structure, the CH(OH) is connected to CH3 and COOCH3, and the OH.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

The carbon chain is as follows: COOCH3 is on carbon 1, CH(OH) is carbon 2, and CH3 is carbon 3.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3 - CH(OH) - CH3.

In that case, the central carbon (carbon 2) has substituents:

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- OH,

- and another CH2 group? No, it's connected to:

- COOCH3,

- CH3,

- OH,

- and the adjacent carbon (carbon 1), which is connected to COOCH3.

Wait, no, each carbon is connected to the next. So, carbon 2 is attached to:

- COOCH3 (carbon 1),

- OH,

- CH3 (carbon 3),

- and another CH2 group?

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure has no other substituents, but I'm getting stuck.

In any case, if the central carbon has four different substituents, it's chiral. So, if the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is such that the hydroxyl is on a carbon attached to four different groups, then it's chiral.

Wait, but in the structure I thought earlier (CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3), the central carbon is CH2 with two H's, so not chiral.

But if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon is CH(OH), attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, but that would make four different groups. So, that carbon would be a chiral center.

But the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would correspond to the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is a three-carbon chain with the ester on the first carbon and the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, the second carbon is CH2, with two H's.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the nomenclature. Maybe the correct structure is (R)- or (S)-methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would have a chiral center.

But I'm getting too confused. Let's try to think of another angle. Which of these compounds are known to have optical isomerism?

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as methyl 2-hydroxybutanoate? No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's known as a chiral compound. Alternatively, maybe it is a beta-hydroxy ester, which can be chiral.

Wait, another example: methyl glycolate has a chiral center. Glycolic acid is CH2(OH)COOH. Its ester would be CH2(OH)COOCH3. The structure is CH2(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, because it's CH2(OH), which is connected to the COOCH3 and two H's. So substituents are OH, COOCH3, H, H. So, no chiral center.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because in that case, it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the structure of glycolic acid and another compound.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, but that would require a four-carbon chain, which would be butanoate, not propanoate. So, this is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which options are correct. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 1,2,4. Option D is 1 and 2.

But from earlier analysis, I thought that none of the options have optical isomerism, but that can't be correct as the options don't include that possibility.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about option 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe (E configuration). Now, if the substituents on both ends are same (two MeOOC groups), then no. But what if the substituents are different?

Wait, no, in fumarate, both ends have MeOOC groups. So, symmetric.

Now, another approach: perhaps the compound has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a center of inversion, making it achiral.

So, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. Which options could have optical isomerism?

From the analysis, only option 2 might, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct structure is (R)- or (S)-configured, so the molecule is chiral.

In that case, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then option 2 has optical isomerism.

Now, looking at the options:

The question is which of the four moieties show optical isomerism.

If 2 is correct, then which options include 2? Options A and D.

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4

D) 1, 2

But earlier, I thought 1 didn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 1.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, perhaps it has a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl itself is chiral.

Wait, biphenyls can have axial chirality. That is, the way the two rings are connected can lead to a chiral axis, making the molecule chiral if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

Ah! I think that's the key. The biphenyl group can have axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are not symmetrical.

In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. Let's imagine the two rings connected at position 1.

If each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2, then the substituents are in the same positions on both rings. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

But wait, both rings have the same substituents, so perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro groups are on opposite sides, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, axial chirality occurs when the two substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in a trans configuration across the central bond.

In this case, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side (cis), the molecule might be symmetrical, but if they're on opposite sides (trans), it might be chiral.

But the question states the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are on adjacent positions relative to the central bond. So, perhaps the nitro and ester groups are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks symmetry.

Therefore, the biphenyl could have axial chirality, leading to optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, now, if option 1 has optical isomerism, and option 2 if it's chiral.

Earlier, I thought option 2 doesn't, but perhaps it does.

Alternatively, perhaps both option 1 and option 2 have optical isomerism, making the correct answer D) 1 and 2.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recap.

Which compounds have axial chirality or a chiral center.

Option1: If the biphenyl has substituents arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral, and exhibits optical isomerism. If substituents are symmetrical, then it's not.

In this case, substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, for each ring, the nitro is at 6 and ester at 2. So, if the two rings are connected such that the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides.

If the substituents are on opposite sides, then the molecule might be chiral.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the question assumes that the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is chiral.

Assuming that, then option 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, option 1 and 2 have optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that option 2 doesn't, but perhaps I was wrong.

In that case, the correct answer would be D) 1 and 2.

But I'm not entirely confident about option 2.

Alternatively, perhaps only option 4 has optical isomerism.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: no, because substituents are same.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer. Does that have a chiral center? No, because the substituents are same on both ends.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no.

So, perhaps options 1 and 2 are correct.

Thus, the correct answer would be D) 1 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires a molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1, with substituents (nitro and ester groups) at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The arrangement of the substituents can lead to axial chirality if the substituents on the two rings are not symmetrical. This axial chirality arises when the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (the second carbon) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two identical phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is bonded to two identical phenyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a hydrogen atom. Since two substituents are identical, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) ester of fumaric acid, with the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. The two ester groups are identical, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond. Since the molecule is symmetrical, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to the presence of chirality, while compounds 3 and 4 do not.
