Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let me try to think through it step by step.

So the problem states there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. Since e is approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs, each charge here is 3.2 x 10^-19 C.

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at point P. So I guess the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are arranged in some way around it, each at 2 meters away. But wait, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, which is where the 13th charge is fixed. So each of the 12 is 2 meters away from P.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, I think the system's electric potential energy would come from the interactions between all the charges. Since potential energy depends on the configuration of the charges, I need to figure out how all these charges contribute to the total potential energy.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed, so I'm guessing it's fixed at P, so it's stationary and probably doesn't move. The other 12 are at 2 m from P. But are they arranged in a particular way? Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe they're all at the same point, but that would complicate things because the potential energy would be very high due to like charges being close. But the problem says "constrained to stay at 2 m from P." Oh, perhaps all 12 are at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't specified. Hmm, but that might not be possible because if all 12 are at the same point, then each would be very close to others, which might not make sense. Maybe they're arranged symmetrically on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m. That would make sense, perhaps like the vertices of a polyhedron or something, but the exact arrangement isn't given. But wait, I think in such problems, when multiple charges are placed symmetrically at the same distance from a central charge, you can model them as being on a sphere. So, perhaps the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere of radius 2 m around the 13th charge.

Wait, but the problem says it's the minimum energy. So perhaps the configuration with the least potential energy would be when the charges are placed as far apart as possible. Wait, but in this case, the charges are constrained to be at 2 m from P, so their positions relative to P are fixed. But their mutual distances can vary. But wait, wait, the problem says the system is isolated, so it's probably about the potential energy between each pair of charges.

Wait, but the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So we have to calculate all the pairwise interactions.

Let me think: each of the 12 charges at 2 m from P will have an electric potential due to the fixed charge at P, and also due to the other 11 charges.

Wait, but the fixed charge is at P. Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P. So the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 would be something. Plus, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but perhaps the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P, but are they all at the same location? That can't be right because then their mutual distances would be zero, leading to infinite potential energy. So that's impossible. So probably, the 12 are placed on a sphere of radius 2 m, each at the same distance from P but spaced apart from each other.

But the problem doesn't specify the arrangement of the 12 charges, so maybe it's assuming that only the potential due to the fixed charge and the other 12 are considered, but perhaps the potential between the 12 charges themselves is negligible? Or perhaps it's considering the case where all the 12 are at the same point, but that would cause their mutual potential energy to be very high. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the other 12, but that seems unlikely because the system's total potential energy would include all interactions.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the question again. It says "What is the minimum energy of this system correct to three decimals?" The options are all positive, but I'm not sure if the energy is potential or something else. Oh, the question says "minimum energy" so perhaps it's the minimum potential energy.

Wait, but the potential energy can be negative or positive, depending on the configuration. For charges of the same sign, the potential energy is positive when they're close, negative when they're far apart. Wait, no, actually, for two positive charges, when they are brought together, the potential energy is positive because you have to do work against their mutual repulsion.

Wait, perhaps I should model this step by step. Let's break it down.

The system has 13 charges. Charge Q is at point P, fixed. The other 12 charges, each with charge 2e, are at 2 m from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 m away from Q.

The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of U between Q and each of the 12 charges, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but the 12 charges are identical and placed symmetrically, so maybe the potential energy between them can be calculated using a formula for multiple charges on a sphere.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between Q and the other 12, but that doesn't make sense because the 12 charges also interact with each other, which would contribute a significant amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy due to the fixed charge and the 12, but not the mutual interactions between the 12. But that seems unlikely because the mutual interactions would be part of the system's potential energy.

Wait, but let me think about the formula. The potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

So for the fixed charge Q at P, which is 2e, each of the 12 charges is 2e and at a distance of 2 m. So each pair (Q and a charge) contributes U = k * (2e)(2e)/(2) = k * (4e²)/(2) = 2k e².

Since there are 12 such charges, the total contribution from Q and the 12 charges is 12 * 2k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, that's only the potential energy between Q and each of the 12. Now, what about the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges?

Each of the 12 charges is 2e, and each pair is separated by some distance. Wait, but if all 12 are placed at 2 m from P, what is the distance between any two of them? Oh, that depends on the arrangement. For example, if they're all on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m, the distance between any two would be 2 * 2 m * sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them as seen from the center. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they form a regular icosahedron or some other symmetric shape, but it's not specified. So maybe the problem is simplified by considering that the mutual distances between the 12 charges are all the same, but that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between Q and the 12 charges, and neglecting the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. But that seems odd because that mutual energy would be a significant part, especially with 12 charges. Let me think: the number of pairs in the 12 charges is C(12,2) = 66 pairs. So each contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r, where r is the distance between them. But without knowing r, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem is only asking about the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, not including their mutual interactions. But why would that be the case? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that can't be because their mutual potential energy would be extremely high. So probably, the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and perhaps assuming that the 12 are placed in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero or minimal. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps in the minimum energy state, the 12 charges are arranged as far apart as possible, which would be on a sphere, each as far as possible from each other. But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to compute their mutual potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and not the mutual interactions. Let me check the options. The options are A) 5.645e-26 J, B) 2.822e-26, C) 7.056e-27, D) 122.330. Well, D is much larger, so perhaps it's not the right unit. The others are on the order of 1e-26 J, which makes sense for electric potential energies between elementary charges.

So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, not their mutual interactions. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me proceed with that assumption and see if it leads me to one of the answers.

So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

Wait, wait, let's compute that correctly. The formula is U = k * q1 q2 / r. So for each of the 12 charges, their charge is 2e, and the fixed charge is 2e as well. So each pair (fixed and a moving charge) contributes U = (8.988e9) * (2e) * (2e) / (2).

Wait, let me compute that.

First, e is 1.6e-19 C. So 2e is 3.2e-19 C.

So U per pair is (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, wait, the distance r is 2 m between the fixed charge and each of the 12.

So compute each term step by step.

First, (3.2e-19)^2 = (10.24e-38) C².

Multiply by 8.988e9 N·m²/C²: 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 is approx 9e9, 10.24e-38 is approx 1e-37, so 9e9 * 1e-37 = 9e-28. But let me compute more accurately.

8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = (8.988 * 10.24) * 1e9 * 1e-38.

8.988 * 10.24 ≈ let's compute: 8 * 10 = 80, 8 * 0.24=1.92, 0.988 *10=9.88, 0.988 *0.24≈0.237. So adding up: 80 + 1.92 =81.92; 9.88 +0.237≈10.117. So total is approx 81.92 +10.117=92.037. So approximately 92.04e-29.

Wait, but wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 *10^9, and 10.24e-38 is 10.24 *10^-38. Multiply them together: 8.988 *10.24 = about 92.0352, and 10^9 *10^-38=10^-29. So 92.0352e-29, which is 9.20352e-28.

Then, divide by the distance, which is 2 m: 9.20352e-28 / 2 = 4.60176e-28 J per pair.

Each of the 12 charges contributes this, so total U is 12 * 4.60176e-28 = 5.522112e-27 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is higher than this. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 3.2e-19 C. So 3.2e-19 squared is (3.2)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

Then, k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So U for one pair is (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / 2.

Let me compute 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38:

8.988e9 is 8.988 * 10^9.

10.24e-38 is 10.24 *10^-38.

Multiplying these together: 8.988 *10.24 = let me compute that.

10.24 * 8 = 81.92, 10.24 * 0.988 = approximately 10.24 *0.9=9.216, 10.24*0.088=0.90592. So 9.216 +0.90592=10.12192. So total is 81.92 +10.12192=92.04192.

So 92.04192 * 10^(9-38) =92.04192e-29 = 9.204192e-28.

Then, divide by 2: 9.204192e-28 /2 =4.602096e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.602096e-28 *12 =5.5225152e-27 J.

Hmm, so about 5.523e-27 J.

But none of the options match this exactly. The closest is option B) 2.822e-26, option C is 7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the exponent. Let me compute it with exact steps.

(3.2e-19)^2 = (3.2)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 10.24 * 1e-38 = 1.024e-37.

Then, 8.988e9 * 1.024e-37 = let's compute:

8.988e9 = 8.988 x1e9.

1.024e-37 =1.024 x1e-37.

Multiplying the coefficients:8.988 *1.024. Let's compute that.

1.024 * 8 = 8.192.

1.024 * 0.988 = let's compute:

0.988 *1 =0.988.

0.988 *0.024=0.023712.

So 0.988 +0.023712=1.011712.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 1.024 *8.988.

Let me compute 1.024 *8 =8.192.

1.024 *0.988 = compute 1.024 *988e-3.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 1.024 *8.988.

Let me compute:

1.024 *8 =8.192.

1.024 *0.988 = ?

Wait, 0.988 = 1 - 0.012.

So 1.024 *1 =1.024.

1.024 *0.012 =0.012288.

So 1.024*0.988 =1.024 -0.012288=1.011712.

Adding to 8.192: 8.192 +1.011712=9.203712.

So 8.988e9 *1.024e-37 =9.203712e-28.

Then, divide by 2: 9.203712e-28 /2=4.601856e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.601856e-28 *12=5.5222272e-27 J.

So U ≈5.522e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 7.056e-27, but that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's check.

Alternative approach: Compute each step precisely.

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Each charge is 2e, so 2 * 1.6e-19 C =3.2e-19 C.

So each charge's charge is 3.2e-19 C.

So U between the fixed charge and each other charge is:

U = k * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, so (3.2e-19)^2 =10.24e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = let's compute 8.988 *10.24 first.

10.24 *8=81.92.

10.24 *0.988 = let's compute:

0.988 *10=9.88.

0.988 *0.24=0.23712.

So 9.88 +0.23712=10.11712.

So 8.988 *10.24=81.92 +10.11712=92.03712.

So 92.03712e-29 (because 10^9 *10^-38=10^-29).

So 92.03712e-29 = 9.203712e-28.

Divide by 2:4.601856e-28.

Multiply by 12: 4.601856e-28 *12=5.5222272e-27 J.

So that's about 5.522e-27 J.

But looking at the options, none of them match this. The closest is option C)7.056e-27, and option B is 2.822e-26, which is larger.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Because the potential energy between two point charges is k q1 q2 / r. But in this case, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from Q. So each contributes U =k*(2e)^2/(2 m). So each is 8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, but I've done that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the 12 charges as well. So I need to compute that as well.

But then, how? Because the distance between each pair of the 12 charges depends on their arrangement. If they're arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, the distance between any two adjacent charges could be calculated based on the number of charges. For example, with 12 charges, perhaps they form an icosahedron on the sphere, and the distance between two adjacent charges would be around 2 m * something.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, this is difficult. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges as if they were all at the same point, but that would result in a very high potential energy, which doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, and not the 12's mutual interactions. Then the total energy would be 5.522e-27 J, which isn't exactly any of the options but closest to option C)7.056e-27. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each charge's potential energy due to the fixed charge and all other charges, but I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the system's potential energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials. So for the 13 charges, all possible pairs are considered.

But the 13th is fixed, and the other 12 are each at 2 m from it. We have to compute the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12.

So fixed charge is q_fixed =2e.

Each of the 12 is q_i=2e, located at 2 m from q_fixed.

The potential energy between q_fixed and each q_i is U_i =k * q_fixed * q_i / r =k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m) = (k*4e²)/2 =2k e².

So for 12 charges, that's 12 * 2k e² =24 k e².

Now, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Let's denote each pair as (q_i, q_j), i < j.

The number of such pairs is C(12,2)=66.

Each pair contributes U_ij =k * q_i q_j / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between q_i and q_j.

But since all the q_i are at a distance of 2 m from q_fixed, the distance between any two q_i and q_j depends on their positions. If all the q_i are placed on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 m around q_fixed, then the distance between any two q_i and q_j would be 2 m * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between their positions as seen from q_fixed.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that all the 12 charges are equally spaced on the sphere, and their mutual distance r_ij is the same for all pairs. But with 12 charges, the regular arrangement would be an icosahedron, where each pair is equidistant. Let's compute that.

In an icosahedron, the distance between two adjacent vertices (on a sphere of radius R) is 2R * sin(pi/5) ≈ 2R * 0.5878 ≈1.1756 R.

Wait, but wait, for a regular icosahedron, the distance between two adjacent vertices on a sphere of radius R would be R multiplied by 2 * sin(π/(5)) ≈ R * 1.902, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the chord length between two points on a sphere is 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the angular separation.

Wait, perhaps I should find the average distance or make a simplifying assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is neglecting the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges and only considering their potential with the fixed charge. But that would make the total potential energy about 5.5e-27 J, which is not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves, not including the fixed charge. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 J, which is exactly twice 1.411e-26, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. Let me think: each of the 12 charges contributes a potential with the fixed charge, but maybe the formula counts each pair twice, so I should only multiply by 12/2? No, that's not right because each charge contributes once.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me compute the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, then compute the potential energy between each pair of the 12.

So the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is 2k e², as calculated before. So 12 * 2k e² =24 k e².

Now, for the 12 charges, each pair contributes U =k * (2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two charges.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem is assuming that all 12 charges are at the same point, which would mean r_ij=0, but that would make the potential energy infinite, which is not possible. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2 m from each other, but that would require a very specific arrangement. For example, if all 12 are placed on a circle (but in 3D, perhaps on a sphere) such that each is 2 m from the others. But that's only possible for a certain number of charges, like for a tetrahedron (4), octahedron (6), etc. 12 charges may not all be equidistant on a sphere, but perhaps the problem is assuming that.

Wait, but 12 charges on a sphere can't all be equidistant from each other. The maximum number of equidistant points on a sphere is 20, in the case of an icosahedron. So for 12 charges, perhaps the mutual distances vary, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy, which would be the case when the mutual potential energies are minimized.

Wait, but for like charges, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. So arranging them on a sphere of radius 2 m around the fixed charge would maximize the distances between them, thus minimizing the potential energy between the 12 charges. But without knowing the exact distances, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are all 2 m, which would make U_ij =k*(2e)^2/(2) = same as the fixed charge's contribution.

But that would be an assumption, and perhaps incorrect, but let's proceed with that for the sake of calculation.

So each pair of the 12 charges would contribute U_ij =k*(2e)^2/(2) = same as before, 2 k e^2.

Number of such pairs is 66.

So total mutual potential energy for the 12 charges would be 66 * 2k e^2 =132 k e^2.

Then, adding the potential energy from the fixed charge and the 12 charges: 24 k e^2.

So total U =24 k e^2 +132 k e^2=156 k e^2.

But wait, this would make U =156 k e^2, which is way larger than the previous calculation. Let me compute that.

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.6e-19 C.

So e^2 = (1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38 C².

So 156 * k * e^2 =156 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38.

Compute step by step:

156 *8.988e9 = let's compute 156 *8.988.

156 * 8 =1248.

156 *0.988= approximately 156 *1=156, minus 156 *0.012=1.872 → 156 -1.872=154.128.

So 1248 +154.128=1402.128.

So 1402.128e9 =1.402128e12.

Multiply by 2.56e-38: 1.402128e12 *2.56e-38 = (1.402128 *2.56) *1e(12-38)= (3.5936) *1e-26=3.5936e-26 J.

That's about 3.594e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, option A is 5.645e-26.

Hmm, so 3.59e-26 isn't exactly matching any option, but perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered as zero, but that doesn't make sense because they are charged particles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking about the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 charges, not including their mutual interactions. Then the total would be 5.522e-27 J, which doesn't match any option directly. But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges.

Each U_i =k*(2e)^2/(2 m) = (8.988e9)*(3.2e-19)^2/(2*2).

Wait, wait a second! I think I made a mistake in the distance. Earlier, I used 2 m as the distance, but wait: the fixed charge is at P, and each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, so the distance r is 2 m. So the denominator is 2 m.

Wait, earlier, I wrote U_i = (k*(2e)^2 ) / (2 m), which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate (2e)^2 as (2e)^2=4e².

So U_i =k*(4e²)/(2 m) = (8.988e9)*(4*(1.6e-19)^2)/(2*2).

Let me compute that correctly.

Compute numerator: 4*(1.6e-19)^2 =4*(2.56e-38)=10.24e-38.

Multiply by k:8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = let's compute 8.988 *10.24 =92.0352, as before.

So 92.0352e-29 =9.20352e-28.

Divide by (2*2)=4: 9.20352e-28 /4 =2.30088e-28.

Multiply by 12:2.30088e-28 *12=2.761056e-27 J.

Now that's about 2.761e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is larger by a factor of about 10. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation again. Let me re-calculate.

Each U_i =k*(2e)^2/(2 m) = (8.988e9)*(4e²)/(4).

Because (2e)^2 is 4e², and the distance is 2 m, so denominator is 2 m.

So U_i = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2).

Wait, wait, 2 m is the denominator, so it's 8.988e9 *4e² /2.

Which is (8.988e9 *4)/(2) *e².

(8.988e9 *4)=35.952e9.

Divide by 2: 17.976e9.

So U_i =17.976e9 * e².

Each U_i is 17.976e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute (1.6e-19)^2:2.56e-38.

So U_i =17.976e9 *2.56e-38 =17.976 *2.56e-29.

17.976 *2.56 = let's compute 18 *2.56=46.08. But 17.976 is 18-0.024.

So 18*2.56=46.08.

Minus 0.024 *2.56=0.06144.

So 46.08 -0.06144=46.01856.

So U_i =46.01856e-29 =4.601856e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12:4.601856e-28 *12=5.522227e-27 J.

So that's about 5.522e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all interactions, including the fixed charge and all others, but perhaps I forgot that the 12 charges are each 2e, so their product with the fixed charge is 2e *2e=4e². So perhaps each U_i is k*(4e²)/(2), which is 2k e².

Wait, but 2k e² would be 2*8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Wait, (1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

So 2*8.988e9 =17.976e9.

17.976e9 *2.56e-38 = let's compute 17.976 *2.56 =46.01856, as before.

46.01856e(9-38)=46.01856e-29 =4.601856e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12:5.522e-27 J.

Still, no matching option. So perhaps the problem is considering the fixed charge as just one charge, and the other 12 are each at 2 m from it, but the mutual potential energy between the 12 is zero, which is not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, but each charge is a different type, but no, they're all 2e.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions, which would include the potential due to all other charges already in place.

In that case, the first charge (say, the first of the 12) would have a potential energy due to the fixed charge, but when placing the second charge, it would also experience the potential due to the first charge, and so on.

So the total potential energy would be the sum of bringing each charge one by one, each time considering the potential due to all previously placed charges plus the fixed charge.

But this complicates the calculation a lot. Let me see.

The process would be:

1. Place the fixed charge at P. No energy required as it's already fixed.

2. Bring the first of the 12 charges from infinity to 2 m from P. The potential at that point is due to the fixed charge only. So energy is U1 = (k*(2e)^2)/(2).

3. Bring the second charge to 2 m from P. Now, the potential at that point is due to the fixed charge and the first charge. So the energy required is U2 = (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2) [from fixed] + (k*(2e)*(2e))/(r12), where r12 is the distance between charge 1 and 2.

If all the 12 charges are placed on a sphere such that each is equally distant from each other, then r12 would be the same for all pairs. But without knowing r12, it's difficult to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2 m from each other, but that's only possible if they're placed at the vertices of a regular icosahedron, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge is placed such that when it's placed, only the fixed charge contributes to the potential, and the other 11 are not yet there, thus each charge's potential is only due to the fixed charge. But that would make the total energy 12 * U, which is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2).

But that approach would ignore the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges. So let's compute that.

Each U = (8.988e9)*(3.2e-19)^2 / 2.

Which is, as before, 5.522e-27 J.

But again, the options don't have this number.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy only between the fixed charge and the 12, and each charge is 2e. So let's compute it again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the number of pairs. The fixed charge interacts with each of the 12, so 12 pairs. Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2/(2 m).

Which is 12 * (k*(4e²)/(2)) =12 * (2k e²) =24 k e².

Compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

(1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9.

215.712e9 *2.56e-38 = 215.712 *2.56 =552.22.

Wait, 215.712e9 *2.56e-38 =215.712 *2.56e(9-38)=552.22e-29=5.5222e-27 J.

Hmm, that's the same as before.

So the total potential energy would be approximately 5.522e-27 J, but the options don't have this.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger than our result. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.28 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 in the calculation. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2)/r. So for each pair, fixed charge (2e) and a moving charge (2e), distance is 2 m. So U= (8.988e9)*(3.2e-19)^2/(2).

Wait, (3.2e-19)^2 is 10.24e-38.

So 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =9.20352e-28.

Divide by 2:4.60176e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.522112e-27.

Yes, that's correct.

So this is about 5.522e-27 J.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the 12 charges, ignoring the fixed charge.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between all 13 charges, which includes the fixed charge and the 12. But the way I calculated earlier, including the mutual potential between the 12, I got approx 3.59e-26, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a simplified model where all 12 charges are brought into place, each only considering the fixed charge, and not the others. So total U =12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) =24 k e².

Compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9.

(1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

215.712e9 *2.56e-38 = 215.712 *2.56=552.22 (approx).

So 552.22e(9-38)=552.22e-29 =5.5222e-27 J.

Again, same result.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is 2e, but the fixed charge is just e. Wait, no, the problem states that all 13 charges have charge 2e.

Wait, no, the problem says each has charge 2e. So no, that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of exponents. Let me recompute 8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 /2.

Compute (3.2e-19)^2=10.24e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =8.988 *10.24 =92.0352, and exponents 9-38= -29, so 92.0352e-29 =9.20352e-28.

Divide by 2:4.60176e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.522112e-27.

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the correct option is not among the given choices, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are not all at 2 m from P, but the 13th is at P, and the 12 are each at 2 meters from each other. Wait, but the problem states that 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So that can't be.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between each charge and the fixed charge, but using a different formula, perhaps including a factor that I missed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for gravitational potential energy, which is similar, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the problem again. The system is isolated, so the minimum energy would be when the potential energy is minimized. For like charges, arranging them as far apart as possible minimizes the potential energy. So the 12 charges would arrange themselves on the surface of a sphere around the fixed charge, each at maximum distance from each other.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, which is not correct, but perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the fixed charge.

But then the total would be 5.522e-27 J, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is approximately 5.13 times larger than our calculated value of 5.522e-27.

Wait, 5.522e-27 *5 is about 2.76e-26, close to option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the sum of all possible pairs, including both the fixed charge and the 12, and all pairs among the 12.

But earlier, when I considered that, I got 3.59e-26 J, which is about 3.59e-26.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distance between each pair of the 12 charges on the sphere is 2 m, which would make their potential energy U_ij =k*(2e)^2/(2 m) = same as the fixed charge's contribution.

So number of pairs is 66, each contributing 2k e².

So mutual energy would be 66 *2k e²=132 k e².

Plus the fixed charge's contribution: 24 k e².

Total U=156 k e².

Compute 156 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute 156 *8.988e9 =1.402e12.

1.402e12 * (1.6e-19)^2 =1.402e12 *2.56e-38=3.5936e-26 J.

So about 3.59e-26 J.

Which is close to option B (2.822e-26), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, but that would be 132 k e²=132 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute 132 *8.988e9 =1.188e12.

1.188e12 *2.56e-38=3.033e-26 J.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, considering the 13th charge as part of the system and the 12 charges. Maybe the formula for potential energy is (n choose 2) * k q^2 / r, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between all 13 charges, but that would include the fixed charge and the 12 others, and the mutual interactions among all 13. But that would complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an error in my calculation. Let me compute 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m).

Each U_i =k * (2e)^2/(2*2) =k*(4e²)/(4)=k e².

Wait, wait a minute! Oh, I think I made a mistake here. Because the distance between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges is 2 m, so the denominator is 2 m, not 4 m.

So U_i =k*(2e)^2/(2 m) =k*(4e²)/(2) =2 k e².

So for 12 charges, it's 12 *2 k e² =24 k e².

Ah, so my earlier calculation was correct.

Now, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between all 13 charges, which would include the mutual interactions among all 13. But that's a bit complicated.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed, so it's not moving. The other 12 are each at 2 m from it, but their mutual distances vary.

But perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, not the mutual interactions between the 12. Then the total would be 24 k e², which is 24 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Wait, 24 *8.988e9 =215.712e9.

Multiply by (1.6e-19)^2=2.56e-38.

So 215.712e9 *2.56e-38 =215.712 *2.56=552.22e-29=5.522e-27 J.

Still, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is brought into place, and each time, the potential energy is calculated considering all previously placed charges. So for the first charge, it's U1= k*(2e)^2/(2) =2 k e².

For the second charge, U2 =k*(2e)^2/(2) [due to fixed charge] + k*(2e)^2/(r12), where r12 is the distance between charge 1 and 2.

But if the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere, each at 2 m from P, then the distance between any two charges would be 2 m * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between their positions as seen from P.

Without knowing theta, perhaps the problem is assuming that all mutual distances are 2 m, which would make U_ij =k*(2e)^2/(2)=2 k e² per pair.

But with 12 charges, there are C(12,2)=66 pairs, each contributing 2 k e².

So total mutual energy is 66 *2 k e²=132 k e².

Plus the energy from the fixed charge:24 k e².

Total U=156 k e²=156 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute:

156 *8.988e9 =1.402e12.

1.402e12 * (1.6e-19)^2=1.402e12 *2.56e-38=3.5936e-26 J.

Which is about 3.59e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distances are greater than 2 m, thus reducing the potential energy. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, which is 5.522e-27 J, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from each other, but that's not possible with 12 charges on a sphere.

Hmm. It's possible that I'm overcomplicating this and the correct approach is to consider only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, which would give 5.522e-27 J. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the exponents correctly.

Let me compute 8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 / (2).

(3.2e-19)^2 =10.24e-38.

8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = (8.988 *10.24) *1e-29 =92.0352e-29=9.20352e-28.

Divide by 2:4.60176e-28.

Multiply by 12:5.522112e-27 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but looking at the options, the closest is option B)2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents when computing (3.2e-19)^2. Let me compute it again.

3.2e-19 squared is (3.2)^2 =10.24, and (e-19)^2= e-38. So 10.24e-38 C².

Yes, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for k, such as 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

Using k=9e9:

Each U_i =9e9 * (3.2e-19)^2/(2*2).

So (3.2e-19)^2=10.24e-38.

So 9e9 *10.24e-38 =92.16e-29=9.216e-28.

Divide by 4 (since 2*2=4):9.216e-28 /4=2.304e-28.

Multiply by 12:2.7648e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are placed at a distance of 2 meters from each other, not from the fixed charge. But that's not what the problem states.

Wait, the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P, which is where the 13th charge is fixed. So each of the 12 is 2 m from P. So their mutual distances vary, but the problem doesn't specify their arrangement.

Given all this, perhaps the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. The fixed charge contributes 12 pairs, each with U= k*(2e)^2/(2 m) = 2k e². So 12 *2k e²=24 k e².

The 12 charges contribute C(12,2)=66 pairs. Each pair's potential energy is k*(2e)^2/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

If the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m, then the average distance between two randomly chosen points on the sphere can be found, but I'm not sure of the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the energy of a configuration where all the 12 charges are equally spaced on a sphere, which would be a complex calculation beyond my current knowledge.

Given that, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option B)2.822e-26 J, but I can't see how to get that number from the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is placed at a distance of 2 meters from the fixed charge, but the mutual distance between any two charges is 4 meters, which would make U_ij =k*(2e)^2/(4 m) = (8.988e9)*(3.2e-19)^2/(4).

Compute that:

(3.2e-19)^2=10.24e-38.

8.988e9 *10.24e-38=92.0352e-29=9.20352e-28.

Divide by 4:2.30088e-28.

Each pair contributes that, and there are 66 pairs.

So mutual energy=66 *2.30088e-28=1.51858e-26 J.

Adding the fixed charge's contribution:24 k e²=24 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2=24 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38=24 *2.30088e-28=5.522112e-27 J.

So total U=1.51858e-26 +5.522112e-27 =2.0708e-26 J.

Still not matching any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance is 2 meters, making each U_ij =k*(2e)^2/(2 m)=2k e².

So mutual energy=66 *2k e²=132 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38=132 *2.30088e-28=3.037e-26 J.

Adding the fixed charge's 5.522e-27 J: total U=3.037e-26 +5.522e-27=3.589e-26 J.

Which is about 3.59e-26 J, which is close to option B)2.822e-26? No, that's higher.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distance is 4 meters, making U_ij=k*(2e)^2/(4 m)=0.5k e².

So 66 pairs contribute 66 *0.5k e²=33 k e².

Fixed charge contributes 24 k e².

Total U=57 k e².

Compute 57 *8.988e9 *2.56e-38=57 *2.30088e-28=1.3115e-26 J.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on the options, the closest is option B)2.822e-26 J. But I can't find a way to reach that number with the given information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the fixed charge is just e, not 2e, which would change the calculations. Let me check the problem statement again. No, the problem says all 13 charges are 2e.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, but I can't see how to get that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation, and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. Let's compute 12 charges: each has a potential with the fixed charge, so 12 pairs, each contributing 2 k e², for 24 k e².

The mutual pairs among the 12 are C(12,2)=66 pairs.

If each mutual pair contributes k*(2e)^2/(r), and assuming r=2 m, then each mutual pair contributes 2k e².

So mutual energy is 66 *2k e²=132 k e².

Total U=24 k e² +132 k e²=156 k e².

Compute 156 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

156 *8.988e9 =1.402e12.

1.402e12 * (1.6e-19)^2=1.402e12 *2.56e-38=3.5936e-26 J.

Which is approximately 3.59e-26 J, but none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is not among the options, but the closest is option B)2.822e-26 J.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12, which is 5.52e-27 J, but that's not an option either.

Given all this, I'm starting to think that perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup, and the correct answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, but I can't see how to get that number.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the minimum electric potential energy of a system consisting of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a fixed charge at point \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is determined by summing the contributions from all pairwise interactions, including the fixed charge and the 12 moving charges, as well as the mutual interactions between the 12 moving charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fixed Charge and 12 Moving Charges**:
   - The fixed charge at \( P \) interacts with each of the 12 charges. The potential energy for each pair is:
     \[
     U_{\text{pair}} = k \cdot \frac{(2e)^2}{2} = 2k e^2
     \]
     where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \).
   - For 12 such pairs, the total contribution is:
     \[
     U_{\text{fixed-12}} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
     \]

2. **Mutual Interactions Between the 12 Charges**:
   - The 12 charges are assumed to be symmetrically arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m around the fixed charge. The distance between any two charges depends on their arrangement, but the problem does not specify the exact configuration. A reasonable assumption is that the mutual potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible.
   - The number of unique pairs among the 12 charges is \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \). If the distance between each pair is approximately 2 m, the potential energy for each pair is:
     \[
     U_{\text{mutual-pair}} = k \cdot \frac{(2e)^2}{2} = 2k e^2
     \]
   - The total mutual potential energy is:
     \[
     U_{\text{mutual}} = 66 \cdot 2k e^2 = 132k e^2
     \]

3. **Total Potential Energy**:
   - The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the contributions from the fixed charge and the mutual interactions:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{fixed-12}} + U_{\text{mutual}} = 24k e^2 + 132k e^2 = 156k e^2
     \]
   - Substituting \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e^2 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = 156 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38}
     \]
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = 3.5936 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
     \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated total potential energy (\( 3.59 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)) does not exactly match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, which is slightly lower than the computed value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions about the mutual distances between the 12 charges.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the given options, the most reasonable answer is **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, though the exact match depends on the specific arrangement of the charges.

Answer: B
