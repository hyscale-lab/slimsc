Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal when visualizing the mice under the confocal microscope. Let me walk through the problem step by step.

First, let's recap the setup. There's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So, that means two genes are in one construct, right? The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element, which I remember allows internal ribosome entry, so maybe it's for co-expression or something.

Wait, the vector has loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. So, the ligand has a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor has a stop in the lox2272. Oh, right, the Cre/lox system is used here. So if Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites, allowing expression of the downstream gene.

In the experiment, they used SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So when these Cre mice are crossed with the homozygous construct mice, the Cre will recombine the lox sites. Let me think about how the vector is set up. The ligand is first, with a stop under loxP. Then the IRES, then the receptor with a stop under lox2272. So in the vector without Cre, the ligand would be expressed because its promoter is active, but the receptor would be blocked by the stop cassette. But when Cre is present, it will remove the loxP stop and the lox2272 stop.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The construct is ligand (with stop loxP) - IRES - receptor (with stop lox2272). So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed because the CBA promoter is active, but the stop after ligand prevents the receptor from being expressed. When Cre is introduced (like in the SOX10-Cre mice), it will recombine the loxP sites, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed. But wait, the first stop is between ligand and mCherry, so when Cre acts, maybe it deletes the stop, allowing the ligand to be expressed and the mCherry to be as well? Or is the loxP-stop-loxP before the ligand ORF? Wait, no. The ligand ORF is at 5', then fused to mCherry, but between ligand ORF and mCherry is the stop in a loxP cassette. Oh, so the ligand is under CBA, then comes the ligand ORF, then a stop with loxP. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are recombined, allowing the stop to be removed, so that the ligand is expressed. Similarly, the receptor is after an IRES, which is under the ligand's promoter? Or is the IRES for the second gene (receptor)?

Wait, bicistronic vectors usually have two promoters or use IRES to allow two proteins to be expressed from a single transcript. So the first gene (ligand) is under CBA promoter. The second gene (receptor) is after an IRES, which allows it to be translated from the same mRNA. So without the IRES, the receptor might not be expressed because the stop codon after the ligand would terminate translation. But with IRES, the ribosome can bind internally to the mRNA and translate the receptor.

But then, the problem is about the stop cassettes. The ligand has a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor has a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed but the receptor is not because of the stop. When Cre is present (from the SOX10-Cre mice), it should delete both stops, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed. No, wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. The stop after ligand is loxP. So the promoter is for the ligand. The receptor is after IRES, so when Cre is present, the lox2272 stop is removed, allowing the receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but the construct has ligand ORF (with a stop in loxP cassette) and then IRES and receptor (with stop in lox2272). So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the receptor is not because the stop is in place. With Cre, the loxP and lox2272 stops are removed, so both ligand and receptor are expressed.

But in the experiment, they crossed the homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre mice. So the Cre is active in neural crest cells, I think. So in the offspring, the Cre should delete both stops, allowing both ligand and receptor expression.

But in the Western blot after transfection, they saw signals proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are expressed. So the mCherry and eGFP fusions are being expressed, as detected by antibodies.

Wait, but the problem says that when they use the construct in primary astrocyte culture, they did a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin. So the expression is confirmed by Western blot. So the construct is working, as the proteins are being expressed.

Now, the mice are homozygous for the construct, which is on the wt background. They are crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10-Cre is a transgene that is active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre should be active in neural crest cells, leading to deletion of the lox sites and hence expression of both ligand and receptor.

But when they look under the confocal, they don't see a green signal. The receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So if the receptor is expressed, the eGFP should fluoresce green.

Possible reasons why they don't see green:

1. The receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed. But the Western blot suggested that the proteins are expressed. Wait, but that's in primary astrocyte culture, which might be different from in vivo expression in the mouse. Or perhaps the expression in the mouse is not in the right cells?

Wait, but the construct is designed to be expressed where? The CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter, so it should drive expression in many cells, but maybe the Cre is only active in specific cells, like neural crest.

Wait, the SOX10-Cre mice are used to drive recombination in neural crest-derived cells. So the ligand and receptor would be expressed in neural crest cells, which in the mouse would be places like the skin, maybe the peripheral nervous system, perhaps the glial cells.

So when they look under the confocal, perhaps the green signal (from the receptor-eGFP) isn't present. So why?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct expresses both in the same cells. Unless the ligand is secreted and acts on other cells. But the question is about the receptor's expression and eGFP not showing up, not about function.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So it's not transported to the cell surface. But if it's stuck, you might not see surface expression, but maybe the Western blot shows the protein is present. But the Western blot was done on primary astrocytes, which might not be the same as the in vivo expression in the mouse. Alternatively, the eGFP might not be correctly processed. But why no signal in the mouse? Maybe the protein is expressed but not on the cell surface, hence not visible under confocal (which looks for surface expression). But the Western blot would detect the total protein, including intracellular. So if the protein is expressed but retained in the Golgi, you'd see a band on Western, but no fluorescence because the GFP isn't on the surface.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the construct uses CBA promoter for the ligand, which is a strong constitutive promoter. So I don't think an enhancer is missing. Unless the IRES is not working for the receptor, but the Western blot suggests it's expressed.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, wait, the fusion is at the C-terminus. If they are not in frame, the eGFP would be truncated or not properly expressed. So the receptor might not function, but would the Western blot detect it? If the eGFP is not in frame, the protein might be unstable or not detected by the antibody. But in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the eGFP is not present, the antibody against the receptor-eGFP would not detect it, but they did see a signal proportional to actin. Hmm.

Wait, the Western blot after transfection to primary astrocyte culture: the proteins are expressed. So the fusion proteins are made. So the eGFP is attached correctly. So the issue can't be a frame problem because the Western blot would show the protein, but perhaps the GFP isn't fluorescent because it's not correctly folded.

Wait, but the question states that in the Western blot, the signal is proportional to actin, meaning that the amount of protein is being detected correctly.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the Cre wasn't active, so the stops weren't removed, so the receptor wasn't expressed. But the question says they crossed the mice with SOX10-Cre, which should activate the Cre in the right cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector didn't work as intended. Let me think about the vector structure again.

The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs. The first is ligand under CBA, then IRES, then receptor under... no, the IRES is part of the second ORF. So the first ORF is ligand, and the second is receptor, with the IRES allowing for translation of the receptor from the same mRNA.

The loxP stop is between the ligand ORF and mCherry. So the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the stop is in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the ligand-mCherry is expressed, but the receptor is not. With Cre, the loxP sites are recombined, so the stop is removed, allowing the receptor to be expressed as well.

Wait, but the IRES is before the receptor. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed.

So in the presence of Cre, both ligand and receptor should be expressed.

In the mouse, the Cre is active in neural crest cells, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed there. The eGFP should fluoresce.

But why no green?

Another possibility is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the frame is wrong. So maybe the stop codon after the receptor is in frame, but the eGFP is not.

Wait, the question says the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP. So the receptor is at the N-terminus, then eGFP at the C-terminus. So if the fusion is in frame, then the eGFP should be expressed.

But if the stop is after the eGFP, and the eGFP is in frame, then everything's fine.

Wait, but the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. So without Cre, the receptor is not expressed. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the receptor and eGFP are expressed.

But in the mouse model, they are homozygous for the construct, and the Cre is active in neural crest cells. So the receptor and eGFP should be expressed.

Hmm. So why no green signal?

Another angle: the eGFP is expressed but not on the cell surface. Maybe the receptor is a transmembrane protein, so it's on the cell surface. But perhaps the eGFP is part of the extracellular domain. Wait, the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with 8 alpha helices, four extracellular. So the eGFP is at the C-terminus, which is intracellular? Or if it's at the C-terminus of the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein, then the eGFP would be inside the cell.

Wait, the question says the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the eGFP is probably on the cytoplasmic side. So when visualized under confocal, which looks for surface proteins, you wouldn't see it because it's inside. So they wouldn't see the green fluorescence because the eGFP is intracellular.

Ah, that's a possibility. So the eGFP is part of the receptor's C-terminus, which is inside the cell. Therefore, when they look under the confocal, which requires the GFP to be on the cell surface, they don't see any signal.

So that would explain why there's no green signal. Because the eGFP is not on the surface but inside the cell, so it doesn't fluoresce when imaged.

Wait, but what about the mCherry? The ligand is fused to mCherry. Since the ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices, probably extracellular. So the mCherry would be on the outside. So they would see red fluorescence if the ligand is expressed.

But the question is about the green signal (receptor-eGFP), which isn't observed.

So the problem is that the eGFP is not on the surface. So the reason could be that the eGFP is intracellular because it's at the C-terminus of the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein.

So which option matches that reasoning?

Looking at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would cause eGFP not to be expressed, but the Western blot would not detect it. Alternatively, if it's in frame but the eGFP is intracellular, then it's expressed but not fluorescent.

Wait, the options don't mention the subcellular location. Let me look.

The options:

A) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship.

That's about the function, not the expression.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.

So if it's stuck in the Golgi, it's not on the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But the protein would be present in the cell, detected in Western blot.

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

If they're out of frame, the eGFP isn't expressed, so no Western signal. But the Western blot did show a signal, so this might not be the case.

Wait, the question says the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture showed signals proportional to actin. So presumably, the proteins are being expressed. So the eGFP is present but maybe not on the surface, so no fluorescence.

So the issue is about the eGFP's location, not its presence.

But none of the options directly address the subcellular location. Looking again at the options.

Option B says the receptor is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck there, it can't reach the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But the Western blot would detect it, as total proteins are extracted.

But why would the receptor be stuck in the Golgi? Maybe a processing issue, perhaps the protein isn't correctly folded, so it's retained in the ER/Golgi.

So option B could be a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working, or other expression issues.

Wait, the vector uses an IRES for the receptor. If the IRES isn't functional, the receptor might not be expressed. But the Western blot after transfection showed expression, so that probably isn't the issue.

Another angle: the ligand and receptor are being expressed, but in a paracrine manner, so each is expressed in different cells. So the ligand is expressed in some cells, the receptor in others, but the construct is designed to have both in the same cells.

Wait, no, the construct has both under the same promoter, but the SOX10-Cre is only active in neural crest cells. So the ligand and receptor would be co-expressed in neural crest-derived cells.

But if the ligand is secreted, then the ligand could act on nearby cells expressing the receptor. But the question is about the expression of the receptor-eGFP, not the function.

Wait, the question states that the construct is bicistronic, so both ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cells. So the eGFP should be present in the same cells as the ligand. So why isn't it showing up?

Another thought: perhaps the eGFP is not being properly processed. Maybe the fusion is causing the GFP not to fold correctly, so it doesn't fluoresce. But the Western blot would still detect the protein, so the antibody against the receptor would pick up the fusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the frame is wrong, but then the Western wouldn't detect it. But the Western blot did show a signal, so that's not the case.

Another possibility is that the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But again, the Western blot would show it if it's expressed.

Wait, but the Western blot was done in primary astrocytes, which may not have the same expression levels as in the mouse's neural crest cells. But the problem states that the mouse model was homozygous, so the construct should be present and Cre should be active.

Hmm. Let me go back to the options.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would cause the eGFP to not be expressed, so no Western signal. But the Western blot showed the eGFP was expressed, so D is unlikely.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So in the mouse's cells, the receptor-eGFP is not transported to the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But the Western blot would detect the protein, because it's present in the cell. So why is the Western blot showing the correct expression?

Wait, the Western blot was done on transfected primary astrocytes, not on the mouse tissues. So perhaps the issue is with the mouse construct's expression.

Wait, but the question is about why the mouse doesn't show green. The Western was a preliminary test showing that the construct works in vitro.

So perhaps in the mouse, the Cre is not active, so the stops aren't removed, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, which should lead to Cre activity in neural crest cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not expressed because the IRES isn't working in the specific cell types. But the IRES should drive expression regardless of the cell type.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the eGFP is part of the same reading frame, but in the wrong orientation. If the eGFP is in the same frame, it's expressed, but if it's in the opposite direction, then perhaps it's not visible.

Wait, more accurately, if the eGFP is in the same frame, it's expressed as a fusion. If not, then the eGFP may not be translated.

But the Western blot would detect the receptor only if the eGFP is in frame. Because if the eGFP is out of frame, the receptor might still be expressed, but the eGFP might not be, or the entire construct might be terminated.

Wait, but the question says the eGFP is fused to the C-terminus of the receptor. So the receptor's C-terminus is followed by eGFP. So if the eGFP is not in frame, the entire construct might produce a truncated receptor without eGFP. So the anti-receptor antibody would detect the receptor, but not the eGFP. However, the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so if the eGFP is not present, you wouldn't see a signal for it. But the question says the signal is proportional to actin, meaning that the proteins are expressed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think again.

The vector is ligand (CBA promoter) with stop loxP, then IRES, then receptor (stop lox2272), then eGFP. Wait, no. The receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the construct is ligand (with stop loxP) - IRES - receptor-eGFP (with stop lox2272). So when Cre is active, the loxP and lox2272 stops are removed, allowing both ligand and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

In the mouse, Cre is active, so both are expressed. The Western blot in vitro (astrocytes) showed that the proteins are expressed. So in the mouse, the proteins should be expressed as well.

But then when they look under the confocal, they don't see green. Why?

If the eGFP is expressed but not on the cell surface, then no fluorescence. So the eGFP could be in the cytoplasm. But why?

Wait, the receptor is a transmembrane protein. So the eGFP is either in the extracellular or intracellular part of the receptor. If the eGFP is at the C-terminus, which is the intracellular part, then the eGFP would be inside the cell, not on the surface. So when you image with confocal, which requires the GFP to be on the cell surface, you wouldn't see any green.

Therefore, the reason for no green signal is that the eGFP is not on the cell surface because it's part of the intracellular domain of the receptor.

But none of the options directly state this. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

If they're not in frame, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the Western blot shows the protein is expressed, so that's not it.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi.

If it's stuck, it wouldn't reach the cell surface. But the Western blot would detect it, so that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the frame is wrong, but the Western blot would not detect it. But the question states the Western blot did detect it.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't working, but that seems unlikely as the Western blot suggests it's expressed.

Wait, the initial setup says that the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So the ligand and eGFP are both expressed, but perhaps the eGFP is not fluorescent because it's not exposed on the cell surface.

In that case, the correct answer would be that the eGFP is intracellular, so no green signal. But none of the options state that.

Wait, looking back, the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. So they're expressed in different cells. But the construct is bicistronic, so they should be expressed in the same cells.

B) receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So not on the surface.

C) enhancer for expression is missing. Unlikely because the CBA promoter is strong.

D) receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

The most probable reason is B or D.

But the Western blot shows that the eGFP is expressed. So if the eGFP is expressed but not on the surface, the Western would detect it, but the confocal wouldn't see it. So why is it stuck in the Golgi?

Maybe the eGFP is part of a protein that's retained in the Golgi for some reason. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is correctly expressed but not properly folded, so it doesn't fluoresce. But then, the Western would detect the protein, but the GFP wouldn't light up. But the question is about the construct, not the functionality of GFP.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the eGFP is expressed, but without the signal peptide, it isn't secreted. But eGFP is a reporter, not a secreted protein. So in this case, the eGFP is part of the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein. So the eGFP is in the cell.

Wait, the question says the ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. So perhaps the ligand is a secreted protein, as coiled-coil proteins can be extracellular. The receptor is a transmembrane protein, so the eGFP is inside the cell.

Therefore, when the mouse is visualized under confocal, the eGFP isn't on the surface, so no fluorescence. But the Western blot detects the presence of the protein.

But none of the options directly address this. The closest option is B, but that's about being stuck in the Golgi, which would prevent surface expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES is not working. But again, the Western blot would show that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship, but that's about their function, not their expression. So the eGFP would still be expressed in the same cells as the ligand, but perhaps the ligand is secreted and acts on other cells. But that wouldn't affect the expression of eGFP in those cells.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible technical reasons for the eGFP not fluorescing.

If the eGFP is correctly expressed but not on the surface, the confocal wouldn't see it. So the receptor might be expressed, but the eGFP is in the cytoplasm or stuck in the Golgi.

So the possible reasons are:

1. eGFP is in the cytoplasm (because it's part of an intracellular domain of the receptor) → No surface signal.

2. eGFP is retained in the Golgi → Same as above.

3. eGFP is not expressed → But Western blot shows it is.

So the likely answer is B or D.

But the Western blot detects the eGFP receptor construct. So if the eGFP is in the cytoplasm, then the Western blot would detect it, but the confocal wouldn't.

So the reason is that the eGFP is not on the surface. But the options don't directly state this.

Looking again at the options, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed, but the Western blot would not detect it. But the question says the Western blot did detect it, so D is not correct.

So the other option is B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. But why would that happen? Maybe the fusion protein is misfolded, leading to retention in the ER or Golgi.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is causing the protein to misfold, leading to retention.

But why would that happen in the mouse and not in the astrocytes? The Western blot was done on astrocytes, which did show the eGFP's presence, but maybe in the mouse, the expression is lower or the protein isn't processed correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression in the mouse leads to the protein being retained, but in the astrocytes, the fusion is expressed properly.

But without more info, the most plausible option is B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi.

Wait, but the question is about why there's no green signal. If the protein is stuck in the Golgi, it's not on the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But the Western blot would detect it because it's present in the cell.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with the receptor fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. The construct was designed to be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, activated by SOX10-Cre. Despite confirming protein expression via Western blot in primary astrocytes, no green fluorescence was observed in the mouse model under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for the lack of fluorescence.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the construct is bicistronic, meaning both the ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cells. While the ligand might be secreted and act on neighboring cells, this does not explain the lack of eGFP fluorescence in the same cells where the receptor is expressed. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP fusion protein is retained in the Golgi apparatus, it would not reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence under confocal microscopy. However, the Western blot confirmed the presence of the protein, indicating that it is expressed and detected in the cell. This explanation aligns with the observation of no surface fluorescence, as the eGFP would remain intracellular.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. There is no indication that an enhancer is missing, and the Western blot confirmed expression of both proteins. This option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP were not in the same reading frame, the eGFP would not be expressed, and the Western blot would not detect the receptor-eGFP fusion. However, the Western blot confirmed the presence of the protein, ruling out this option.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the receptor-eGFP construct is retained in the Golgi apparatus, preventing its transport to the cell surface and resulting in no green fluorescence under confocal microscopy. This aligns with the Western blot data, which confirmed the presence of the protein but did not indicate surface expression.

Answer: B
