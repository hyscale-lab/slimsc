Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Okay, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels.

Wait, I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle is involved here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time should be on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Right, so ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

The lifetimes given are the uncertainties in time, Δt. For each state, the lifetime is the time uncertainty. But wait, in this case, each state has a different lifetime. So for each, the minimum energy uncertainty would be different. But the problem is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Hmm, so I think the idea is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, so that they can be resolved.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties from each state? Or maybe each state's uncertainty contributes, so we take the larger uncertainty? Let me think.

Wait, no. The energy difference ΔE between the two states has to be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each, so that the two levels don't blur into each other. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart. So each state's energy uncertainty is based on their own lifetime.

So for the first state, Δt1 is 1e-9 seconds. The uncertainty in energy ΔE1 would be ħ/(2*Δt1). Similarly, for ΔE2, it's ħ/(2*Δt2). But wait, the energy difference between E1 and E2 is ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or just each of their individual uncertainties?

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step.

The uncertainty principle for energy and time is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE = ħ/(2Δt).

So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9 s). And for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8 s).

Wait, wait. Let's compute these. Let me remember the value of ħ. I think ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Calculating ΔE1: ħ/(2 * 1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J.

Wait, but that's in Joules. We need to convert that to eV because the options are in eV.

Remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 5.27e-26 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is approximately 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, let me compute that. 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 = (5.27/1.602) * 1e-7 ≈ 3.29 * 1e-7 = 3.29e-7 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV.

Now for ΔE2: ħ/(2 * 1e-8 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) ≈ 5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 = (5.27/1.602) * 1e-8 ≈ 3.29 * 1e-8 = 3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or just larger than the uncertainty of each?

Wait, no, because each state's energy has an uncertainty. The energy difference must be greater than each of their uncertainties so that the two levels don't overlap. So the larger of the two uncertainties would be ΔE1 (3.29e-7 eV). So the energy difference ΔE needs to be larger than that.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.29e-7 eV. Option A is 1e-9 eV, which is smaller than ΔE1. Option B is 1e-11 eV, also smaller. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about 0.329 times 3.29e-8, but wait, wait, 1e-8 is 1e-8, and 3.29e-8 is about 3.29e-8. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.29e-8.

So the energy difference needs to be bigger than 3.29e-7 eV. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way bigger than 3.29e-7 eV, so it's definitely larger. So option C is a candidate.

Wait, but the problem is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state, but which one's uncertainty is bigger? Because the first state has a shorter lifetime, so a larger uncertainty. So the energy difference must be larger than the larger uncertainty.

So ΔE needs to be greater than 3.29e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 3.29e-7 eV. The other options are either equal or smaller, so they wouldn't allow a clear distinction.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, when I calculated ΔE1: 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt1) = 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-9) = approximately 5.25e-26 J.

Converting to eV: 5.25e-26 / 1.6e-19 = (5.25 / 1.6) * 1e-7 ≈ 3.28e-7 eV. That's correct.

Similarly, ΔE2 is 1e-8 seconds.

ΔE2 = 1.05e-34/(2e-8) = ~5.25e-27 J.

In eV: 5.25e-27/1.6e-19 = (5.25/1.6) * 1e-8 ≈ 3.28e-8 eV.

So, the uncertainties are 3.28e-7 and 3.28e-8 eV for E1 and E2 respectively.

So the larger uncertainty is for E1. So the energy difference must be larger than 3.28e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than that. So, the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the energy difference that allows the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly distinguished, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy. For each state, the minimum energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
The lifetimes of the two states are \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), we compute the energy uncertainties:

1. For \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{5.27 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be larger than the larger uncertainty, \( \Delta E_1 \), which is \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is also smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is much larger than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it can resolve the two states.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( \Delta E_1 \), so it cannot resolve the two states.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition is **Option C**.
