Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information given is that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Also, the energy difference between these energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. We're supposed to find the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds.

Hmm, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative number of particles in two energy states. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, let's denote the energy levels as E_upper and E_lower. For star_1, the population in E_upper is twice that of star_2. Or wait, actually, the question says that the excitation is twice as excited. So maybe the excitation state refers to the number of atoms in an excited state compared to the lower state. But the exact wording is "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the number of excited atoms to unexcited ones. Let me think. Let's consider the excited state as E_upper and the lower state as E_lower. The excitation ratio is (n_upper)/(n_lower). For star 1, this ratio is twice that of star 2. Or wait, maybe the excitation is the same as the population in the upper level. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So, perhaps the ratio of n_upper_1 to n_lower_1 is twice the ratio of n_upper_2 to n_lower_2. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, it could be that the excitation state is measured as the fraction of atoms in the excited state. So, perhaps for star_1, the fraction f1 is twice that of star_2, f2. So f1 = 2 f2.

Wait, no. The question says "twice as excited." So perhaps the excitation refers to the number of atoms in the higher energy level. So the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor gives the ratio of populations. So for each star, the ratio of n_upper to n_lower would be e^(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, no. The Boltzmann distribution is n_i/n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So for the excited state (higher energy), E_upper is higher than E_lower. So, for each star, the ratio would be n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_upper - E_lower.

Wait, but wait, if E_upper is higher, then (E_upper - E_lower) is positive. So the exponent is negative, making the ratio n_upper/n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, that would mean that as temperature increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So higher temperature would mean more excitation, which makes sense.

In this problem, the question states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2. Or wait, maybe the number of excited atoms is twice as much. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation potential is twice. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the problem says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So that suggests that the excitation in star_1 is higher. So, maybe (n_upper)_1 is higher than (n_upper)_2, but the ratio isn't necessarily given. But the way the question is phrased, it's the excitation that's twice as much. So perhaps the ratio of (n_upper)/(n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, no. Wait, the exact wording is that the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation is the fraction in the upper state. So, for star_1, f1 = 2 * f2, where f is the fraction in the upper state. Or perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. But since we don't know their total number, the ratio would be more appropriate.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the populations is given. Let me think.

Let me model this. Let me denote for star 1: ratio r1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1.

Similarly, for star 2: ratio r2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2.

The question says that "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps r1 = 2 r2.

Alternatively, maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, but without knowing their total number of atoms, the ratio would be the only thing that makes sense.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think that for each star, the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, for star 1, r1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, r2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

The problem says that the excitation level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, perhaps r1 = 2 r2.

So putting that together:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, but wait, let me think about the ratio again. Because, in reality, the ratio of n_upper to n_lower in each star is given by the exponentials. So if for star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2, then:

n_upper1/n_lower1 = 2 (n_upper2/n_lower2)

Which would imply:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So taking the natural log of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, that's:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, not sure. Let me compute step by step.

Starting from:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearrange:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So the equation becomes:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Hmm. But wait, the options don't include ΔE. So perhaps we can eliminate it. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not dependent on the actual value of ΔE, given that it's provided. Alternatively, maybe it's not needed for the form of the equation.

Wait, the problem mentions that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. But that might not be necessary for the equation form, as the options are in terms of T1 and T2 only. So we can perhaps ignore the ΔE for the purposes of selecting the correct equation form.

So from earlier:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 )

But without knowing ΔE or k, perhaps the equation can be manipulated to get an expression in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but the question is about which equation is correct for the effective temperatures. Let's look at the options.

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1 → not sure.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) → doesn't look right.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2 → Hmm, denominator is T1^2 T2^2. Not sure.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) → This looks similar to what we have. Let me see.

Wait, our equation is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But without knowing ΔE, I can't see it, unless the equation is in terms of (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), which is Option D.

Wait, but suppose that the energy difference ΔE is given, but the problem states to assume that the photospheres are in LTE, so perhaps the equation could be rearranged without ΔE. But in the given options, the equations don't include any constants like ΔE or k, so perhaps the form is correct if it's proportional to ln(2).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So:

n_upper1/n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2/n_lower2 )

But according to the Boltzmann distribution:

n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Move the terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

But the problem gives us ΔE as 1.38e-23 J, but I don't see this being used in the options, which are all in terms of T1 and T2. Therefore, perhaps the correct equation is the one that matches the structure.

But looking at the options, only option D has (T1 - T2) in the numerator and T1*T2 in the denominator.

So, the equation would be:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2) ) × (ΔE/(k))

But since none of the options include ΔE or k, perhaps the correct form is the right-hand side of the equation where the structure is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), which is option D.

Wait, but the equation in option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) without any other factors. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the setup was incorrect.

Wait, another way: perhaps the ratio is the other way around. Suppose that for star_1, the ratio is n_upper1/n_lower1 = 2 * n_upper2/n_lower2.

Which leads to the equation I wrote earlier. But perhaps I should have used the reciprocal. Let me think: if star_1 has higher excitation (more in the upper level), then n_upper1/n_lower1 is larger than n_upper2/n_lower2. So, if star_1 is more excited, then r1 > r2. So r1 = 2 r2.

So the equation is correct.

But in the equation from the Boltzmann factor, r1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), r2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So r1 = 2 r2 → exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which leads to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Rearranged:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k:

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2)

Wait, that's the same as earlier.

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

So, even after rechecking, the equation is as before. But the options don't include ΔE, so perhaps the correct equation is the one where ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2. Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), which is the same as what we have except for the factor of ΔE/(k), which is not present.

Wait, but maybe in the equation, the factor (ΔE/(k)) is a constant, and the equation is expressed as ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2) multiplied by (ΔE/k). But the given options don't include any such multiplicative terms. Therefore, perhaps the correct option is the one that has (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) as the argument, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the problem. Maybe the ratio is the inverse. Let me think again.

Suppose that star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state as star_2. So, for star_1, n_upper is twice that of star_2. But wait, that's not exactly what the problem states. The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So perhaps the excitation level is the number of atoms in the upper state, so n_upper for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

But wait, that would require knowing the total number of atoms, which isn't given. So the ratio would be more appropriate. Thus, the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is higher for star_1.

So, the setup is correct.

Another approach: perhaps the excitation is given by the Boltzmann factor. So, the excitation parameter is often the ratio of the number in the upper state to the lower state. So, the ratio is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So, for star_1, this ratio is twice that of star_2. So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which as before leads to:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE/(k)) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

So, the equation is ln(2) equals (ΔE/(k)) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

But the options don't have ΔE or k. So perhaps the correct equation is one where the right-hand side is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), which would be option D.

Wait, but in that case, the equation would be ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) multiplied by (ΔE/k). Without knowing ΔE and k, we can't say, but the question asks which equation is correct. So perhaps the correct option is D.

Alternatively, maybe the setup is that the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2, but perhaps the ratio is the reverse. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n_lower / n_upper. Because sometimes, the excitation is expressed as the lower level being more populated. Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor gives n_upper/n_lower as exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so higher temperature gives higher n_upper/n_lower ratio.

Wait, if star_1 has higher excitation, then n_upper1 / n_lower1 is higher than star_2. So, r1 = 2 r2.

Thus, the equation is correct.

So, looking at the options, the correct equation would be option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

Wait, but the equation we have is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

But in the options, option D is ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 ). So unless (ΔE/k) is 1, which it isn't, because ΔE is 1.38e-23 J and k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, wait a minute.

Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k. Because k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = k.

So then,

ln(2) = [ (k) / k ) ] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

That's exactly option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that's the correct equation.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the relative populations of particles in different energy states under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The distribution is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_{\text{upper}}\) and \(n_{\text{lower}}\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. The excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. This means:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
   \]

2. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratios for the two stars are:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
   \]
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
   \]

3. Substituting the given relationship between the excitation levels:
   \[
   \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
   \]

4. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
   \[
   -\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
   \]

5. Rearranging terms:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]

6. Simplifying further:
   \[
   \ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
   \]

### Simplification Using Constants:
The problem states that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equal to the value of \(k\) (Boltzmann's constant). Substituting \(\Delta E = k\) into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{k}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

### Matching with Options:
The equation matches **Option D**, which is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

### Conclusion:
The correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
