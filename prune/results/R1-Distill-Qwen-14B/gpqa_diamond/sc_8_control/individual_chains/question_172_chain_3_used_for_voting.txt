Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures, and I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I should probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution equation relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula, as I remember, is something like the ratio of populations in two states. Oh right, the equation is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, for star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, let's say the higher energy level is level i and the lower is level j. So n_i (star 1) is twice n_j (star 2)? Wait, no, wait. The question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the excitation in star_1 is double that of star_2. So maybe n_i1 / n_j1 = 2, where i is the excited state and j is the lower state. But wait, actually, the ratio would be n_i / n_j for each star.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, for star 1, the ratio of excited atoms in level i to the lower level j is higher than in star 2. Let's denote the ratio for star 1 as R1 and for star 2 as R2. So R1 is n_i1 / n_j1, and R2 is n_i2 / n_j2.

The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2. Because the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy difference. Wait, but the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is E_i - E_j. So perhaps the energy difference is the same for both stars, because the same energy level is being considered.

So the energy difference ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J for both stars. So the ratio for star 1 is R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star 2, R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Boltzmann factor is for the probability of being in a higher energy state. So the population ratio is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ). So the ratio of the excited level to the lower level is given by that exponential.

So for star 1: R1 = n_i1 / n_j1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: R2 = n_i2 / n_j2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2. Because the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So the number of excited atoms per iron atom in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

So substituting, we have:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides. That should help.

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Simplify the left side: ln(exp(x)) is x, so we get:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Wait, because ln(a*b) = ln a + ln b. So the right side becomes ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

So:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Let's rearrange:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE and 1/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Hmm, wait, because [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ] is the same as (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Let me write it as:

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Wait, I can rearrange this as:

(1/T2 -1/T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Alternatively, that's equal to (k ln(2))/(ΔE)

I'm given that ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which I think is 1.38 times 1e-23. Wait, 1.38 is kind of close to the Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! Because k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * (1) J? Let me check: 1.38e-23 J is k * 1 K, since k is about 1.38e-23 J/(K).

So, k = 1.38e-23 J/K, so if ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, then ΔE = k * T where T is 1 K. Wait, but in our case, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly equal to k * 1 K. So ΔE = k * 1 K. Therefore, when we compute (k ln(2)) / ΔE, it becomes (k ln(2)) / (k * 1) ) = ln(2) / 1 = ln(2). So:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me plug in the numbers:

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = 1.38e-23 J = k * (1 K), since k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So yes, ΔE = k*(1 K). So the substitution is correct.

So:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Hmm, that gives 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2), which can be rewritten as 1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2). But this seems a bit counterintuitive because if star_1 has higher excitation (R1=2 R2), does that mean higher or lower temperature?

Wait, higher excitation implies more atoms in the higher energy state. From the Boltzmann equation, higher temperature would increase the population of higher energy states. So if star_1 has higher excitation (R1 is higher than R2), then T1 must be higher than T2. Because R = exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so higher T makes R larger, which makes sense.

Wait, but in our equation, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2). Let's see: since T1 is larger than T2, 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive, which matches ln(2) being positive. So that checks out.

So let's write this as:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

We can factor this as:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) 

Wait, because (1/T2 -1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me verify:

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, correct because 1/T2 is T1/(T1 T2), minus T2/(T1 T2), so (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the equation becomes:

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Looking at the options, the options are in terms of ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Which matches our equation, because (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2).

Wait, but in our equation, we have (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2), which we rewrote as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2). Wait, no, because 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), so the equation is (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). So the equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2). So in the options, we're looking for an equation where ln(2) equals (T1-T2)/(T1 T2).

Looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). That's exactly what we have. So that's the correct equation.

Let me double-check the steps:

1. R1 = 2 R2. Because the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2.

2. R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

3. So exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

4. Take ln of both sides: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

5. Rearrange to get (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (k T1 T2)/(ΔE), but wait, no, when I rearrange the equation:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

So, ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) -1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

But since ΔE = k * 1 (because ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is k * 1 K), so:

(1/(T2) -1/(T1)) = ln(2) * (k) ) / (ΔE) ) → which is ln(2) * (k)/(k*1) ) → ln(2).

So, 1/T2 -1/T1 = ln(2). Then, (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2), which is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the population ratios of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Boltzmann Distribution**: The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

   \[
   \frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
   \]

   where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

2. **Given Information**: The excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, i.e., \(R_1 = 2R_2\), where \(R_1 = \frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}}\) and \(R_2 = \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}\). Substituting the Boltzmann distribution for each star:

   \[
   \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation**: Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

   \[
   -\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
   \]

   Rearranging terms:

   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]

4. **Substitute \(\Delta E\)**: The energy difference is given as \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equal to \(k \cdot 1 \, \text{K}\) since \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Substituting \(\Delta E = k \cdot 1\):

   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
   \]

5. **Rewrite in Terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\)**: Combining the fractions:

   \[
   \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
   \]

6. **Match with Options**: The equation \(\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\) matches **Option D**.

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
