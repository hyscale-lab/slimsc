Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5. I'm supposed to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Wait, no, wait. Wait, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if r is the distance in parsecs, then plx = 1/r. So if r increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, the question is about how N (number of stars) changes with distance. So N is proportional to 1/plx^5. But since plx = 1/r, let's substitute that in.

So 1/plx is r. So plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So 1/(plx^5) would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, that's because N = k*(1/plx^5) = k*r^5. So that would mean that as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because I thought that as you go further, there are fewer stars in a given volume. Wait, maybe I got the equation wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the setup. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. And since plx is inversely proportional to r (r = distance in parsecs), then plx = 1/r. So plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So 1/plx^5 would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as distance r increases, the number of stars N increases with r^5.

Wait, that can't be right because I thought that the number of stars we observe decreases with distance because stars are more spread out. But maybe in this specific region, the distribution is such that the number somehow increases. Hmm. Or perhaps I'm getting the proportionalities flipped.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it more carefully.

Let me write down the relationships.

We have N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But plx is inversely proportional to r: plx = 1/(r), since r is in parsecs. So substituting that in:

N ∝ 1/((1/r))^5 = r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5.

Wait, but that would mean that in more distant regions, we see more stars. Which doesn't make sense because stars are spread out more as you go further. Unless there are more stars at larger distances, but that's not typically the case in our galaxy. But perhaps this is a hypothetical scenario where the number of stars increases with distance.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So dN/dr is the change in number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, no. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. So the number of stars increases rapidly as you go further. But wait, wait. Let me think again about the units.

Wait, the number of stars in a region of the sky is related to the volume, perhaps. Because in a larger volume, you'd expect more stars, but the distribution might not be uniform.

Wait, but the problem gives N as varying with parallax, not distance. So maybe the way the stars are distributed isn't following a typical 3D volume scaling. Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance.

Since plx = 1/(r), and if we think about the number of stars as a function of parallax, but we need to relate it to distance.

So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5 = r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5.

Wait, but the options given are about how N changes with distance, per unit distance range. So the question is asking about the density or the rate at which number increases with distance.

Wait, no, the question says "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So maybe it's asking for the differential, like dN/dr, the rate of change of number of stars with distance. Or maybe just the functional dependence of N on r.

Wait, let's think again. N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to the fifth power of the distance. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So for each unit increase in r, N increases by r^5. But wait, that can't be correct because r^5 is a function, not a rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit volume or something else.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the number of stars in a given volume depends on the density. But in this case, the problem gives N as a function of parallax, so perhaps it's a projection effect. Let me think.

Another approach: Parallax is a measure of distance. Lower parallax means farther away. So if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, then as plx decreases (so r increases), N increases.

If plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. So the number of stars in that region of the sky increases with r^5.

But wait, that seems very high. Typically, the number of stars in a volume might scale with r^3 (since volume is proportional to r^3). But this is a different scenario.

So the options given are about how N changes with distance. So the correct answer would be N is proportional to r^5, which would correspond to option B.

Wait, looking at the options:

Options:
A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

So the answer should be B) ~ r^5.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), with \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this relationship into the given proportionality, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5.
\]

This means that the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to \( r^5 \), where \( r \) is the distance. As \( r \) increases, \( N \) increases with the fifth power of \( r \). This result suggests that, in this specific scenario, the number of stars grows rapidly with distance, contrary to typical expectations where stars become more spread out at larger distances. However, the problem explicitly provides this relationship, so the answer must align with the given proportionality.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** This would correspond to a volume-based scaling, but the problem specifies \( N \propto r^5 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** This matches the derived relationship \( N \propto r^5 \), making it the correct choice.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** This does not match the given proportionality.
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** This also does not match the given proportionality.

Thus, the number of stars in the region of the sky increases with distance as \( r^5 \).
