Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many products are formed when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, let's start by breaking this down.

Wait, wait. First, I should probably draw the structure of the compound in question. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Or is it 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Oh, wait, the 'd' probably refers to a substituent. Maybe it's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2. So the numbering would be 1 and 2 positions on the benzene ring. So the structure would have Br at position 1 and (CH3)2NH at position 2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Oh right, that's a strong base. So I'm recalling that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, it's used for dehydrohalogenation or for elimination reactions, perhaps forming rings or alkenes. Alternatively, it might be involved in nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, but in what conditions does that happen? Nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically requires activated rings, like those with electron-withdrawing groups. The (CH3)2NH group is a strong electron-donating group because it's a strong activating group (since it's an amino group). Wait, but in this case, the amino group is a dimethylamino, which is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group. Hmm, but wait, in the case of a deactivating group, like nitro, nucleophilic substitution is possible. So, if the ring is activated, maybe nucleophilic substitution isn't favored. Alternatively, maybe elimination is more likely.

Wait, the starting compound is a bromobenzene derivative. So benzene rings with substituents. Let me think about possible reactions. Oh, wait, NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base. So perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, leading to elimination. If we have a benzyl bromide, for example, we'd get a triple bond, but in this case, it's a benzene ring. So maybe it's a ring expansion or forming a new ring.

Alternatively, maybe this is an aromatic substitution. If the ring has a substituent that can be displaced, like a bromine, and the base is strong enough to deprotonate something else to form a good leaving group.

Wait, another possibility: the bromide could be removed in an elimination reaction. But to eliminate, you need a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine. Wait, in benzene, the adjacent positions are ortho and para. So if the Br is at position 1, the adjacent positions would be 2 and 6. Now, position 2 is already occupied by the (CH3)2NH group. So perhaps the H is at position 6.

Wait, but wait—if the Br is at position 1, and the dimethylamino is at position 2, then the structure would be a benzene ring with Br at 1 and (CH3)2NH at 2. So the positions adjacent to Br are 2 and 6. Position 2 is already taken, so maybe the H to eliminate would be at position 6.

Elimination would lead to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2? Or wait, elimination typically forms a double bond by removing H from adjacent to the leaving group. So in benzene, if the Br is at position 1, and H is removed from position 2, then elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2. But position 2 is already substituted with (CH3)2NH, so that's not possible. So maybe the H is at position 6, which is adjacent to Br.

Wait, but wait, the benzene ring is symmetric. So maybe the H is at position 6, which is adjacent to Br (position 1), so elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, which would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6, and the substituents as Br and (CH3)2NH.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. The benzene ring is fully conjugated, so forming a triple bond would require a ring expansion. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe this reaction is a benzene ring undergoing some kind of dehydrohalogenation to form a ring with more double bonds, but I don't think that's feasible because benzene is already a fully conjugated ring of double bonds.

Another angle: NaNH2 is a strong base. It could deprotonate a position on the benzene ring. But where? The (CH3)2NH group is a strong activating group, so it would direct incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions. But in this case, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the benzene ring, making it more susceptible to some kind of substitution.

Wait, maybe the bromide is leaving. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. The (CH3)2NH group is an electron-donating group, which makes the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic.

So perhaps instead, the reaction is elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to the Br. Wait, but in benzene, that would lead to a more conjugated system, but I'm not sure if that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the Br leaves, and a new ring is formed. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so removing a Br and adding a double bond elsewhere would not change the ring size.

Alternatively, perhaps a ring expansion is happening, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzyn intermediate. Benzyne is a triple bond in the benzene ring, which is very reactive. So if the Br is at position 1, and the base removes a proton from position 2 (but position 2 has the (CH3)2NH group), or position 6, then elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, and the (CH3)2NH group would be at position 2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the structure. Structure is benzene with Br at position 1 and (CH3)2NH at position 2. So positions are numbered as 1 (Br), 2 (N(CH3)2), 3, 4, 5, 6.

The base NaNH2 would abstract a proton that's beta to the Br. So the Br is at position 1; the beta hydrogens are at positions 2 and 6. But position 2 is already substituted with the N(CH3)2 group, so the hydrogen is only available at position 6. So the base would abstract the hydrogen at position 6, leading to the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

Wait, but wait, in benzene, each carbon is already sp2 hybridized, so forming a double bond adjacent to the existing ones might not change much. Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond (benzyne).

Wait, but benzyne is a high-energy intermediate. So if the Br leaves and the adjacent H is abstracted, you can form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, leading to a benzene ring with a triple bond between 1 and 6, and substituents at 2 and 6.

Wait, but wait, if the Br is at 1 and the substituent is at 2, then after elimination, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6. So the structure would have the N(CH3)2 group at position 2, and the triple bond between positions 1 and 6. So the benzene ring would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, and substituents at 2 and the rest would be CH groups.

Then, benzyn (triple bond) is a very reactive species. It can undergo various cycloadditions or other reactions. But the original question is about the products formed in this reaction. So perhaps the question is about the possible products formed directly from the elimination, without considering further reactions.

Wait, but the question says how many possible organic products are there. If the reaction leads to a single product, then the answer would be 1. But I'm not so sure.

Alternatively, maybe the base can abstract a proton from either position 6 or position 3 or another position, leading to different products. Wait, but the substituents are at positions 1 and 2. So the H that's abstracted must be adjacent to Br, which is at 1. So the possible H's are at 2 and 6. But position 2 is occupied, so H is only at 6. So elimination would occur between Br (1) and H (6), forming a triple bond between 1 and 6.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the structure after elimination. So, after eliminating H and Br, the benzene ring would become a triple bond between 1 and 6, making a benzyn structure. Then, the substituents would be at position 2. So the product would be benzyne with substituents at 2 and 6? No, because the triple bond is between 1 and 6, so position 6 is now part of the triple bond, not a substituent.

Wait, no. The starting material has Br at 1 and N(CH3)2 at 2. When the base abstracts the H at 6, the Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between 1 and 6. So the substituent at 2 remains, and the triple bond is between 1 and 6. So the product would be a benzene ring where positions 1 and 6 are connected by a triple bond, and position 2 has the N(CH3)2 group.

But wait, if the triple bond is between 1 and 6, that's a six-membered ring with a triple bond, which is a very strained structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a smaller ring. Wait, no, benzyn is a six-membered ring with a triple bond, but it's a very unstable compound and tends to dimerize or react quickly.

But the question is about the possible products in the reaction. So perhaps the reaction forms benzyn, which is one product, but perhaps there are multiple ways to form it? Or maybe the position of the substituents leads to different products.

Wait, let's go back. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-(dimethylamino)benzene. So when NaNH2 is added, the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to the bromine. The possible positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is already occupied, so the only possible H is at position 6. So elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, leading to a single product. So the product would be 1,6-didehydrobenzene (benzyn) with substituents at 2 and 6? Wait, no. Wait, when the Br leaves and the H is abstracted, the triple bond forms between 1 and 6, so the substituent at 2 remains, but the substituent at 1 (Br) is gone, and position 6 is now part of the triple bond.

Wait, but in the initial structure, the substituents are Br at 1 and N(CH3)2 at 2. After elimination, the Br is gone, and the H at 6 is removed, so positions 1 and 6 are now triple bonded. So the substituent is only at position 2. So the product is 2-(dimethylamino)benzyn. But wait, the triple bond is between 1 and 6, so the positions are 1 and 6. So the substituent at 2 is in the same position as before.

Wait, but benzyn is a diradical or a triple bond? I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,6-didehydrobenzene (benzyne), which is a six-membered ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, and a substituent at position 2.

But wait, would that be a single product or multiple products? Since the starting material has substituents only at positions 1 and 2, the elimination can only happen in one way. So the product is a single compound.

Wait, but wait another angle. Maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a benzyn intermediate, which can then undergo further reactions, but the question is about the products from this reaction. If the reaction stops at the elimination step, then only one product is formed. But perhaps the benzyn can dimerize or react in different ways, but that's beyond the current reaction conditions, which are just treatment with NaNH2 in ammonia.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyn but instead undergoes some kind of substitution. But I'm not sure because the ring isn't activated for nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the base could deprotonate the dimethylamino group. Wait, the (CH3)2NH group is a strong base, but NaNH2 is even stronger. So maybe the base abstracts a proton from the dimethylamino group, making it a stronger nucleophile.

Wait, but the dimethylamino group is already a strong activating group. If it loses a proton, it becomes a stronger base, maybe. So perhaps the (CH3)2NH group is deprotonated to form (CH3)2N−. But in that case, the negative charge would make it a better nucleophile. But in the presence of Br, perhaps the (CH3)2N− could attack the adjacent carbon, leading to an elimination or substitution.

Wait, but substitution would require the Br to leave, but for SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) to occur, the ring needs to be strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack. Which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. The (CH3)2NH is an activating group, which is bad for SNAr. So perhaps substitution isn't favorable here.

Alternatively, maybe the (CH3)2N− could attack a position on the ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe after deprotonation, the (CH3)2N− could act as a base, abstracting another proton, leading to elimination. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think again about the options.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2-(dimethylamino)benzene. When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, the most likely reaction is elimination to form benzyn. Because the conditions are strongly basic and NaNH2 is a strong base, leading to dehydrohalogenation.

In this elimination, the Br at position 1 and a beta hydrogen (position 6) are removed, forming a triple bond between 1 and 6. Since the substituent (NMe2) is at position 2, which is not involved in the elimination, the product would have the triple bond between 1 and 6 and the substituent at 2.

But wait, how many substituents or products could form? If the elimination leads to only one possible structure, then the number of products is one. But perhaps there's another possibility. For example, could the base abstract a proton from position 3 or 4, leading to different products?

Wait, position 3 is meta to the Br. The base usually abstracts a proton that's adjacent (beta) to the leaving group. So in this case, the leaving group is Br at position 1, so the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is occupied, so only position 6 is available. So elimination would have to occur between 1 and 6, leading to a single product.

So the product would be 2-dimethylaminobenzyne (with the triple bond between 1 and 6). So that's one product.

Wait, but wait another thing. Could the base abstract a proton from another position, leading to a different elimination product? For example, maybe the base could abstract a proton from position 4, which is across from the Br (para position). But I don't think that's possible. Because for elimination, the H must be on a carbon adjacent to the leaving group.

Because the Br is at 1, the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6. So the only possible H's to abstract are from 2 and 6.

Position 2 is substituted, so the only H available is at 6. So elimination can only happen in one way. So the product is a single compound.

Therefore, the number of possible products is 1. So the answer would be option B) 1.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2) with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction conditions favor elimination. 

In this case, the bromine atom at position 1 is the leaving group, and the base abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to the bromine. The adjacent positions to the bromine are 2 and 6. However, position 2 is already occupied by the dimethylamino group, leaving only position 6 as the available site for proton abstraction. This leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, resulting in a benzyn intermediate.

Since the dimethylamino group at position 2 does not interfere with the elimination process, the reaction produces a single product: 2-dimethylaminobenzyne (a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 and a dimethylamino group at position 2). There are no other possible products because the elimination can only occur in one way under the given conditions.

Thus, the number of possible organic products is **1**.
