Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how dark spots affect certain ratios of atoms in the photosphere. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that a star has 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. So the star is cooler overall when it has spots.

Then, the problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. Oh, and the transition between these levels is about 1448 Å. They also mention that LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) applies, which I think means we can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels. The equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy. So the ratio depends on temperature and the energies of the levels.

But in this problem, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Which implies that without spots, n1/n2 is higher than when it has spots.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So that would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me think about how the ratio changes with temperature. The exponent in the Boltzmann factor is (E1 - E2)/(k T). Since E1 and E2 are the energy levels, and if level 1 is higher than level 2, then E1 > E2. So E1 - E2 is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, meaning the exponential term gets smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease as T decreases.

So when the star has spots (Teff=5500), the ratio is lower than when it doesn't (6000 K). So the ratio when no spots is higher.

Wait, but the question states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So that aligns with what I thought. So the ratio is higher without spots.

Now, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots. Let's compute this.

Let me denote T1 as 6000 K (no spots), T2 as 5500 K (with spots). So the factor is [ (n1/n2)_T1 ] / [ (n1/n2)_T2 ]

Using the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

Assuming g1 and g2 are the same? Or does the problem give them? Oh, wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two levels. It doesn't mention anything about their statistical weights. But since the transition is given, perhaps the energy difference is calculated from the wavelength.

So the transition between the two energy levels is at 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet, I think. The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ.

E_photon = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ the wavelength. So E_photon corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels, assuming that the transition is allowed.

So, E1 - E2 = hc / λ.

So let me compute this energy. Then, I can plug it into the Boltzmann factor.

Calculating E_photon:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Let me calculate this:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

Hmm, but we usually express energy in terms of eV for such purposes. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So:

1.372e-18 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a lot. So E_photon ≈ 8.56 eV.

But wait, that's the energy of the photon emitted when an electron transitions from level 1 to level 2. So E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.

Wait, but when an electron jumps from higher to lower energy, it emits a photon, so E1 > E2. So E_photon = E1 - E2.

So the energy difference between the two levels is 8.56 eV.

But in the Boltzmann equation, we'll need this energy difference divided by k*T, where k is the Boltzmann constant.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K. So let's compute (E1-E2)/(k T) for both T1 and T2.

Wait, for T1 = 6000 K:

(E1-E2) = 8.56 eV.

k*T1 = 8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K ≈ 0.517 eV.

So (8.56) / (0.517) ≈ 16.55.

Similarly for T2 = 5500 K:

k*T2 = 8.617e-5 * 5500 ≈ 0.4739 eV.

So (8.56)/0.4739 ≈ 18.07.

So the exponents in the Boltzmann equation are -(E1-E2)/(k T). So for T1, it's -16.55, which is a big negative number, and for T2, it's -18.07.

So the Boltzmann factors are exp(-16.55) and exp(-18.07).

Calculating these:

exp(-16.55) is a very small number. Let me think. exp(16) is about 8.88e6, so exp(16.55) is about 8.88e6 * exp(0.55). Exp(0.55) is about 1.733. So exp(16.55) ≈ 8.88e6 * 1.733 ≈ 1.533e7. So exp(-16.55)=1/1.533e7 ≈ 6.52e-8.

Similarly, exp(-18.07) is even smaller. exp(18) is about 6.56e7. But 18.07 is a bit more than 18. So exp(18.07)=exp(18)*exp(0.07). exp(0.07)≈1.0725. So exp(18.07)=6.56e7 *1.0725≈7.03e7. So exp(-18.07)=1/(7.03e7)≈1.422e-8.

But wait, the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ), right? Because the formula is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

Assuming g1/g2 is the same for both cases, so when we take the ratio (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2, the g factors would cancel.

So the ratio is [exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) )] / [exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T2) )] 

Which is exp( [ -(E1-E2)/(k T1) + (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ]) 

Which is exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because ( -(a/b) + a/c ) = a ( -1/b + 1/c ) = a ( (c - b)/(b c) ) = a ( (1/c - 1/b) )

So substituting, let me compute (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, no, wait: the exponents are -(E1-E2)/(k T1) and -(E1-E2)/(k T2). So when you take the ratio, it's [exp(-x) / exp(-y)] = exp(y -x) = exp( (y -x) )

But y is -(E1-E2)/(k T2), x is -(E...).

So y - x = [ -(E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ] - [ -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ) ] 
= (E1-E2)/(k) [ (1/T1 ) - (1/T2) ) ]

So the exponent is (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

So back to the numbers.

E1-E2 = 8.56 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

T1=6000 K, T2=5500 K.

Compute (1/T1 - 1/T2 ) = (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -500 /3.3e7 = approx -1.515e-5.

Wait, wait: 1/6000 is approx 1.6667e-4, and 1/5500 is approx 1.8182e-4. So 1.6667e-4 minus 1.8182e-4 is approximately -1.515e-5.

So (1/T1 - 1/T2 )= -1.515e-5 1/K.

Multiply by (E1-E2)/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) = 8.56 /8.617e-5 ≈ 100,000 (approx). Let me compute it more accurately.

8.56 / 8.617e-5 is 8.56 ÷ 0.00008617 ≈ 8.56 / 8.617e-5.

Well, 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617. So 1/0.00008617 ≈ 11604. So 8.56 * 11604 ≈ 99, 359 ≈ 99,360 K.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, (E1-E2)/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) = 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ let's compute 8.56 / 0.00008617.

Calculate 8.56 / 0.00008617:

Dividing 8.56 by 0.00008617. 

Well, 0.00008617 is approximately 8.617e-5. So 8.56 / (8.617e-5) = (8.56 /8.617) * 1e5.

8.56 /8.617 ≈ approximately 0.993.

So 0.993 * 1e5 = 99,300.

So (E1-E2)/k ≈ 99,300 K.

Now multiply this by (1/T1 -1/T2 )= -1.515e-5 1/K.

So 99,300 * (-1.515e-5) = 99,300 * (-0.00001515) 

Calculating that: 99,300 * 1.515e-5.

99,300 * 1.515e-5 = (99,300) * (0.00001515) = 0.15045...

So approximately 0.15045.

But since it's multiplied by negative, it becomes -0.15045.

So the exponent is -0.15045.

So exp(-0.15045) ≈ e^(-0.15) ≈ 0.8607.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the signs.

Wait, the exponent in the ratio is (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 ), which is 99,300 K * (-1.515e-5 1/K ) = approximately -1.5045.

Wait, no, wait. 99,300 * (-1.515e-5 )= 99,300 * (-0.00001515 ) = 

99,300 * 0.00001515 = let's compute:

99,300 * 0.00001515 = (99,300 * 1515e-8) = (99,300 * 1.515e-5 ) = 

99,300 * 1.515e-5 = (99,300 * 1.515 ) * 1e-5.

99,300 *1.515 = approximately 99,300 * 1.5 = 148,950 and 99,300 *0.015=1,489.5. So total 150,439.5.

Multiply by 1e-5: 150,439.5e-5 = 15.04395.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the decimal places. Let me compute 99,300*1.515e-5.

Alternatively, 99,300 = 9.93e4.

So 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.93 *1.515) ) * 1e-1.

9.93 * 1.515 ≈ approx 15.04.

So 15.04 * 0.1 = 1.504.

So 99,300 * (-1.515e-5 ) = -1.504.

So the exponent is -1.504.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the calculation gives (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 ) = 99,300 K * (-1.515e-5 1/K ) = (99,300 * -1.515e-5 ) = -1.504 (no K units, as they cancel).

So the exponent is -1.504.

So exp(-1.504) ≈ e^-1.504.

What's e^-1.504? e^1.5 is about 4.4817, so 1/4.4817 ≈ 0.223. But 1.504 is a bit more than 1.5, so e^-1.504 ≈ 0.221.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Using a calculator, e^-1.504 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value. Let me compute 1.504.

e^1.504 is e^1.5 * e^0.004. e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817, e^0.004≈1.004008. So e^1.504 ≈4.4817 *1.004≈4.500. So e^-1.504≈1/4.500≈0.2222.

So approximately 0.2222.

Wait, but wait. The ratio (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 is equal to exp( (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ) = exp(-1.504)≈0.2222.

Wait, but that would mean that when the star doesn't have spots (T1), the ratio is 0.2222 times the ratio when it has spots (T2). But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.

Wait, no. The problem says when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So (n1/n2)_T2 < (n1/n2)_T1.

Wait, but according to our calculation, the ratio (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2 = 0.2222. So (n1/n2)_T1 is 0.2222 times (n1/n2)_T2. Which would mean that (n1/n2)_T1 is smaller than (n1/n2)_T2. But that contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, this can't be right. Because when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 should decrease. So when T is 6000 (no spots), the ratio is higher than when T is 5500 (with spots).

Wait, so the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots should be greater than 1. But according to the calculation, it's approximately 0.2222, which is less than 1. So that would imply that the ratio decreases, which is what the problem says. Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So if (n1/n2)_no_spots = 0.2222 * (n1/n2)_with_spots, that would mean that the ratio without spots is smaller than with, which is opposite to what the problem says.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go back.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (spots), the ratio is lower. So (n1/n2)_T1 (no spots, higher T) is higher than (n1/n2)_T2 (spots, lower T). So their ratio (n1/n2)_T1/(n1/n2)_T2 should be greater than 1.

But according to our calculation, it's about 0.2222, which is less than 1, implying the opposite. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Ah! I think I messed up the exponent sign. Let me re-examine:

The factor is (n1/n2)_T1 / (n1/n2)_T2.

Each (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

So the ratio is exp( [ -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ -(E1-E2)/(k T2) ] ) 

Which is exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) + (E1-E2)/(k T2) )

Which is exp( (E1-E2)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because ( - (1/T1) + (1/T2) ) = (1/T2 -1/T1 )

So the exponent is (E1-E2)/k (1/T2 -1/T1 )

Which is (E1-E2)/k * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Wait, going back: (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the exponent is (E1-E2)/k * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Given T1=6000, T2=5500. So T1-T2=500.

So (E1-E2)/k = 99,300 K.

So (99300 K) * (500 K) / (6000 K *5500 K )

Wait, let me compute this.

Denominator: 6000 *5500 = 33,000,000 K².

Numerator: 99,300 *500 = 49,650,000 K².

So the exponent is (49,650,000 ) / (33,000,000 ) = approx 1.5045.

So exponent is 1.5045.

So exp(1.5045 ) ≈ e^1.5045 ≈ approx 4.505.

Wait, that's about 4.5. So the ratio is approximately 4.5.

Ah, that makes sense because when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases because the higher energy level is more populated. So the factor is about 4.5.

So the factor by which this ratio changes is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(E_1 - E_2\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor we seek is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (with spots). The energy difference \(E_1 - E_2\) corresponds to the wavelength of the transition, \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), and is calculated as:

\[
E_1 - E_2 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values:

\[
E_1 - E_2 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
E_1 - E_2 \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant is \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). Substituting into the factor equation:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\):

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Next, calculate \(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k}\):

\[
\frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,300 \, \text{K}.
\]

Now, multiply:

\[
99,300 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.504.
\]

Thus, the factor becomes:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.504) \approx 4.5.
\]

This means the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star does not have spots compared to when it does.
