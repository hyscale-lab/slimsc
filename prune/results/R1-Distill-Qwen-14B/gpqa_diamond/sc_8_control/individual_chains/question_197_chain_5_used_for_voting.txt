Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. They've given me the IR and NMR data for Compound X, and there are four options to choose from.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, possibly indicating an O-H stretch. The peaks at 1720 cm-1 suggest a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But wait, 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid; they usually are around 1700. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are in the range for aromatic C=C stretches, so I can infer that the compound has an aromatic ring.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet. High ppm like that usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are around 9-10, but sometimes deshielded protons can be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids typically show a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. Let me think—maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Then there's a peak at 8.0 ppm, doublet, integrating to 2H. That's in the aromatic region. Doublets suggest coupling with one neighboring proton. So perhaps two protons in a para-substituted benzene ring? Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and each would couple with two others, but wait, actually, no, in a para-disubstituted benzene, each proton would be adjacent to two others. Hmm, maybe it's a meta substitution? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, in para substitution, each proton is next to two others, but not directly across. Wait no, in a para-substituted ring, the two protons are across from each other. So if the substituents are in para positions, the ring protons would be in two sets of doublets. Wait, actually, I'm not entirely sure about this. Let me think.

The NMR also has 7.2 ppm as a doublet with 2H. So two doublets in the aromatic region. That suggests maybe a 1,4-disubstituted benzene—para substitution. So the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. So the two doublets would correspond to the protons next to each substituent.

Then moving down, there's a peak at 2.9 ppm as a multiplet, 1H. That's around where a methylene group next to an oxygen or a carbonyl might be. Wait, or perhaps it's a CH adjacent to an aromatic ring. Hmm. Then 1.7 ppm, multiplet, 2H—this might be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH or something. Then 1.4 ppm as a doublet, 3H—this looks like a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps. And finally, 0.9 ppm as a triplet, 3H, which is probably a CH2CH3 group, maybe an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with some substituents. Let me sketch this out. If it's para-substituted, then two substituents opposite each other. One substituent might be a group with a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester, and another substituent could be an ethyl group or something.

The IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is likely a carbonyl. Let's think: if it's a ketone, that would make sense. The 10.5 ppm peak could be a carbonyl, but wait, ketones don't have protons. Oh wait, that's in the NMR, so the 10.5 ppm is a proton. So maybe it's a carbonyl with an adjacent proton, like an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But then the 1720 cm-1 would be more like an ester or ketone. Hmm, maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, if the IR has 3400–2500, which could be an O-H stretch, but that's a broad region. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3300. But the 10.5 ppm in NMR is a singlet, which would be consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. So, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, considering that, the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which could be a carboxylic acid proton. Then, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, the substituents are on the benzene ring in para positions.

So, substituents are a carboxylic acid group and another group. Looking at the NMR, the other substituent would have the peaks at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9.

Looking at those peaks: 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H). Let me think about this. The 0.9 triplet suggests a CH2CH3 group, right? So maybe a CH2CH3 attached to something else. The 1.4 doublet is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the group is -CH(CH2CH3)-something.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Wait, but the peaks don't quite add up. Let me see: the 2.9 is a multiplet for 1H, 1.7 is a multiplet for 2H, 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, and 0.9 is a triplet for 3H. So maybe it's a butyl group?

Wait, maybe it's an isobutyl group. Let me see: iso-butyl has a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). But the NMR doesn't show a CH2 for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let me think about the structure.

So the benzene would have two substituents: a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group. Let me draw this. The benzene ring has a COOH group on one carbon and a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group? Wait, no, that's not sec-butyl. Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH2) but no, wait: butyl groups. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, butyl groups can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. Sec-butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, I think. Or is it -(CH2)2CHCH3? No, wait, I think the structure of sec-butyl is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the structure of isobutyl is -CH2-C(CH3)2. No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, butyl groups: primary is -CH2CH2CH2CH2-. secondary is -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but no, that's not right. Let me correct. For a butyl group, the structure can be:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-

- iso-butyl (sec-butyl): CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the NMR signals. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a -CH2CH3 group, which is a methyl attached to a CH2. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that would have a CH2 next to a CH with a methyl group.

Wait, the 0.9 triplet is likely a terminal CH2CH3. So perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to another CH. Let me think: the 2.9 multiplet (1H) could be a CH that's connected to a CH2 and a CH3. The 1.7 multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 connected to the CH and another CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a pentyl group? Or maybe a propyl group.

Alternatively, let me consider the integration. The substituent group would have the signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9. Let's try to build it step by step.

The 0.9 triplet (3H) is a CH2CH3 group. So the last two carbons are CH2-CH3. The adjacent group would be a CH2, which would be split into a quartet if next to a CH2CH3. But in our NMR, the 1.7 is a multiplet for 2H, which could be a CH2 next to another CH2. The 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, so a CH3 attached to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)-CH2- group. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group. Let me think: if it's a propyl group, the CH2 groups would have certain splits. But the triplet at 0.9 is the end CH3, so the next would be CH2, which would be a quartet. Then the next CH would be a triplet. But in our NMR, the 2.9 is a multiplet, 1H, perhaps that's the CH. The 1.7 is 2H, which would be the middle CH2. But wait, the 1.7 is a multiplet, which is more complex than a simple quartet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group. Let's see: for a butyl group, the structure could be -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-, but that's a primary butyl, which would have a triplet for the last CH2, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me think about that. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, then the CH2-CH(CH2CH3) would have the CH2 next to the benzene would be split into a triplet, but in our NMR, the 2.9 is a multiplet for 1H, which doesn't fit that.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the entire molecule. Let me try to build the structure.

The benzene ring has two substituents: let's say, group A and group B. Group A is a carboxylic acid, COOH, based on the IR and NMR. Group B is likely an alkyl group, as per the NMR.

The substituents are in para positions because the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So each substituent is in a para position, so they are across from each other.

So, on the benzene ring, there's a COOH group and an R group. The R group has the signals in the NMR at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the R group is a propyl group with a branching. Let me think: the R group could be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Let me try to see.

Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group. Let me think about the signals. The 1.4 (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- but that doesn't fit the NMR. Wait, the 0.9 triplet is the end CH2CH3, so perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-. No, but that's a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. No, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propan-2-yl group (isopropyl). So, the substituent is -CH(CH3)2. But then the NMR wouldn't show the 0.9 triplet. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let me try to figure out what the R group is based on the NMR. The R group has:

- 1H at 2.9 ppm (m), which is around where a CH next to an electronegative group would be.

- 2H at 1.7 ppm (m), perhaps a CH2.

- 3H at 1.4 ppm (d), which is a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 3H at 0.9 ppm (t), which is a CH2CH3.

So, putting this together, maybe the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. Wait, no, that's a butyl group. Let me see:

The chain would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. Wait, that's a butyl group attached as a substituent. But the structure would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2-C(CH3)2. No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Like, isobutyl group.

Wait, the isobutyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then, the NMR wouldn't have a triplet for the CH2CH3, unless it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. No, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible reaction. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. That's a typical reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile, but wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is used to convert nitriles to amines via the Stephen reduction, but wait, that's not right. Alternatively, it's more likely for the hydrolysis of an ester or a ketone? Or perhaps for the elimination of a halide.

Wait, wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI is used for the dehydrohalogenation, but perhaps more importantly, it's used for the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Alternatively, when an alkyne is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it forms a dihalide. But in this case, the compound doesn't seem to have a triple bond.

Wait, another possibility: Compound X has a carbonyl group, which under certain conditions can react. But with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a Wittig reaction. Wait, no, the Wittig reagent is made from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are often used to effect the hydrolysis of nitriles, converting them into amines (maybe via the Stephen reduction). But the IR data doesn't show a peak around 2200 cm-1, which would be a nitrile.

Wait, the IR does show a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone or ester. So if Compound X has a ketone group, what would happen when it's treated with red phosphorus and HI? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another reaction: the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction uses aluminum isobutyl to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols, but that's not the same as red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation. For example, if the compound has a double bond, red phosphorus and HI can add across the double bond. But earlier, the IR suggested an aromatic ring, so maybe an aromatic substitution.

Wait, but the IR data doesn't show a strong peak for a C=C double bond in the 1600s. Oh wait, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C, so the compound doesn't have an isolated double bond but rather an aromatic ring.

Hmm. Another thought: if the compound is a benzophenone derivative, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might lead to some kind of elimination or substitution.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should focus on the possible structures based on the NMR and IR and see what the reaction would do.

So, from the NMR, the substituent on the benzene is a carboxylic acid group and another group. Let's think about the substituent group.

If the substituent is a secondary butyl group, perhaps a sec-butyl group. The NMR would then have:

- The sec-butyl group's CH2 next to the benzene would be split into a quartet, but in our NMR, the 2.9 is a multiplet (1H), which might correspond to the CH in the sec-butyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should look at the options to see which structure fits.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the original compound X. Let me think about each option.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a benzoic acid group (COOH) and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

The structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4.

So, the substituent group would be:

-sec-butyl is (CH2)2CH(CH3)

Wait, no, sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me think: The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So in the benzene ring, it's attached as a substituent.

So, in the NMR of compound X, the substituent's protons would be as follows:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (let's call it CH2A) would be split into a triplet if attached to a CH (CH2B), which is attached to a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the multiplet at 2.9 ppm is the CH in the middle of the substituent. Then, the CH2 next to it would be at 1.7 ppm, and the CH3 attached to that CH would be at 1.4 ppm, and the CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm.

So, the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Wait, but the NMR doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the structure would be benzene ring with COOH and iso-butyl groups para to each other.

In that case, the iso-butyl group would have a CH(CH3)2 group attached to the benzene. But then, in the NMR, would the CH(CH3)2 group show as a triplet?

Wait, the iso-butyl group's structure is CH2CH(CH3)2. So the CH2 attached to the benzene would be split into a triplet if next to a CH. But in the NMR, the 2.9 is a multiplet (1H). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see what each option's structure looks like.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the structure is:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent is attached as a branch. The sec-butyl group would have the structure CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, so the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene (let's say position 4) would have two protons. These would couple with the adjacent CH, which has two protons? Or maybe only one proton in the CH.

Wait, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So, the CH2 next to the benzene (CH2A) is connected to a CH (CHB) which is connected to a CH2CH3.

So, the CH2A (CH2 connected to benzene) would be attached to CHB. The CHB has a CH2CH3 group attached.

So, the CHB has one CH2CH3 group and is attached to CH2A. So, CH2A is CH2-CHB-CH2CH3.

Wait, that makes the substituent a propyl group with a branch.

But I'm not sure about the splitting. Let me think about the NMR signals.

In the NMR, the substituent's protons would be:

- CH2A (attached to benzene): this is a CH2 group. Its protons would be next to a CH, which has two substituents (another CH2 and the CH2CH3). So, the protons on CH2A would couple with the protons on CHB. So, the CH2A would be a quartet due to coupling with the two protons on CHB.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which doesn't fit with a quartet. So maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group. The iso-butyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the substituent would have a CH(CH3) attached to a CH2.

In that case, the CH2 next to the benzene (CH2A) would be attached to a CH (CHB) which has a methyl group. The CHB would have two CH3 groups attached. So, the CH2A would be a triplet if next to a CH with two equivalent protons.

Wait, but the protons on CHB would be equivalent, so the CH2A would show as a triplet.

In the NMR data, the 2.9 is a multiplet, which doesn't fit a triplet. So maybe that's not it.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the reaction again. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. What kind of reaction would that be?

Red phosphorus and HI can be used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, they can be used for the dehydrohalogenation or for elimination reactions.

Wait, another possibility: the compound has an ester group. When esters react with HI, they undergo hydrolysis to form carboxylic acids and alcohols. But that depends on the conditions.

Wait, but our IR has a peak at 1720, which could be an ester. If it's an ester, reaction with HI might cause hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But since the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's more about elimination.

Alternatively, if the compound is a ketone, treatment with HI and red phosphorus might lead to some addition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another reaction: the use of red phosphorus and HI can cause the elimination of HX (like HI) from a compound. For example, if a compound has a leaving group like bromide adjacent to a carbonyl, the red phosphorus and HI could cause an elimination, forming an alkene.

But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If compound X has a good leaving group, like a tosylate, then HI could substitute it. But again, the IR and NMR don't indicate such groups.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzyl chloride, and the reaction with HI would lead to some substitution. But again, I'm not seeing the chloride peak in the IR.

Hmm. Another approach: look at the options and see which one would result from a reaction of the starting material.

Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if the starting material were an ester, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then hydrolysis with HI would form the acid. But how does the reaction with red phosphorus and HI come into play?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is acid-catalyzed hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid.

But I'm not seeing a clear path here.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data for the starting compound X, perhaps the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the IR shows a strong carbonyl (1720 cm-1), which would fit the acid if it's not in the free -COOH form. Wait, no, because carboxylic acids typically have lower carbonyl frequencies, around 1700 cm-1. Also, the IR shows a broad peak around 3400-2500, which could be the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid.

But then, what would happen when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI? I'm not sure, because benzoic acid is fairly stable. Unless the reaction is something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let me think. If X is an ester of benzoic acid, like methyl benzoate, then reaction with HI might lead to acid catalyzed hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure about the role of red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzophenone derivative, and the reaction leads to some kind of substitution.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of a ketone with red phosphorus and HI might lead to a secondary alcohol via the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction, but I'm not certain if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, which upon hydrolysis with HI and red phosphorus becomes an amine. But I don't see a peak in the IR that suggests a nitrile.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution. Suppose X has a leaving group attached to the benzene ring, such as a nitro group. Then, under certain conditions, it could be replaced. But I don't see nitro peaks in the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps X has a bromine or iodine substituent, and the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution.

But I'm not seeing such peaks in the IR data.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alkyne. The IR data doesn't show a peak around 2100 cm-1, so that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard addition to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is a saponification to form the carboxylate, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the reaction conditions might be for the preparation of an enol. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann elimination, but that typically involves amines.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think about the possible structures of Compound X based on the NMR and IR.

The IR suggests a carboxylic acid (O-H stretch and carbonyl), but perhaps an ester. Wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids typically have lower carbonyl frequencies due to hydrogen bonding. Esters have higher frequencies, around 1720-1750 cm-1. So maybe the starting material is an ester, not a carboxylic acid.

If that's the case, then the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1 for the ester carbonyl. Then, the NMR would show the ester oxygen's effect on the neighboring protons.

So, the 10.5 ppm in the NMR might not be an O-H proton but perhaps an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehydes are generally less acidic, so their protons would be around 9-10 ppm, which fits. But then, why is there a broad peak? Aldehydes are usually sharp, but maybe it's an acidic proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. If so, the compound would have a benzaldehyde group.

But then the IR wouldn't show a broad O-H stretch, unless it's another functional group.

Wait, but if the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde, then the IR would show a peak around 2800 cm-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but the IR data given doesn't show that. Instead, the IR shows 3400–2500, which is more consistent with an O-H stretch.

Hmm, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an O-H proton, making it a carboxylic acid. So the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, with that, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure of Compound X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Then, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, but why would benzoic acid react with red phosphorus and HI? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a protection/deprotection reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But benzoic acid doesn't have a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe Compound X is an acid chloride. No, because the IR doesn't show a peak around 1800 cm-1, which is typical for acid chlorides.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. But red phosphorus and HI are more known for their role in the hydrolysis of nitriles.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, not an acid. So, let's say it's methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Then, treating with HI could lead to hydrolysis to form the carboxylic acid.

But how does red phosphorus fit into this?

Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, but perhaps in ester hydrolysis, it's not involved. Alternatively, it might act as a catalyst or participate in a different way.

But I'm not entirely sure about the reaction, so perhaps I should focus on the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the reaction converts an ester to a carboxylic acid, that would fit.

But in this case, the initial compound X is the ester, and the product is the acid. So, the reaction would be hydrolysis of the ester.

But the question is about what the product would be after the reaction. So, if X is the ester, the product would be the acid.

But looking at the options, option C is the acid. So if X is the ester, the product is C.

But how does the reaction with red phosphorus and HI lead to that?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a nitrile. When treated with red phosphorus and HI, it might be hydrolyzed to an amine. But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is known for the hydrolysis of nitriles to form amines. For example, RCN + HI (in presence of red phosphorus) → RCH2NH2.

But if X is a nitrile, then the product would be a primary amine. But none of the options seem to be amines.

Alternatively, if X is an alkyne, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus could add HI across the triple bond, forming a dihalide. But again, the options don't seem to fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. For example, if X is a benzyl bromide, it could react with HI to form benzyl iodide. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but I don't think so.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the starting material is an ester, then treating with HI would hydrolyze it to the acid.

But since red phosphorus is involved, perhaps it's part of a catalyst for the hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reaction is a reduction to a secondary alcohol. But then, the product would have an -OH group, and the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's unlikely because the starting material is already substituted.

Hmm.

At this point, I think the correct approach is to match the NMR and IR data to the structure of Compound X, then figure out the reaction.

So, let me try to build the structure of X.

IR: 3400–2500 (broad, likely O-H), 1720 (carbonyl, likely ester or acid), 1610 and 1450 (aromatic C=C).

NMR: 10.5 (bs, 1H) – likely O-H or aldehyde proton.

8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H) – aromatic, para substitution.

The remaining signals are from the substituents: 2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H).

The substituent has a CH2CH3 (0.9 t), a CH3 (1.4 d), a CH2 (1.7 m), and a CH (2.9 m).

This suggests a branching. So perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure would be benzene with COOH (from NMR and IR) and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, but benzoic acid is a strong acid. How would it react with HI and red phosphorus?

Another possibility: Perhaps X isn't the acid but an ester. For example, methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Then, the reaction with HI would hydrolyze the ester to the acid.

But why would red phosphorus be involved?

Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but in ester hydrolysis, it's typically not used. Alternatively, maybe it's used as a catalyst.

But if X is the ester, then after hydrolysis, the product would be the acid, which is option C.

But I'm not entirely sure about the reaction conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but I don't see how.

Wait, another thought: if X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a protective group, maybe the reaction removes the protective group.

But I'm not certain.

Hmm. Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the data. The IR and NMR point towards a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. So option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the reaction is hydrolyzing an ester to an acid, then that would be the product.

But wait, the question says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. If X is already the acid, then what reaction would occur? Maybe nothing, but since it's a reaction, perhaps X is an ester.

But without knowing the exact reaction, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the ester group is replaced by another group.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, and the reaction converts it into a benzyl iodide. But the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's a stretch.

Hmm.

Another angle: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI can be used to convert an alkyne to a diiodide. But I don't see any alkyne signals in the NMR.

Another possibility is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that typically requires a metal like Mg.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by iodide. But in the structure of X, I don't see a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps X is a bromide. But without a peak in the IR for C-Br stretch (~600 cm-1), which isn't present here, that's unlikely.

Hmm.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. The NMR and IR data point towards option C, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the reaction is an ester being hydrolyzed to an acid, then option C would be the product.

So, the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- The broad peak in the range **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- The peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid or an ester. However, the broad O-H stretch and the absence of a sharp peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ suggest it is more likely a carboxylic acid.
- The peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** are consistent with aromatic C=C stretching, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- The **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)** peak is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
- The **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.2 ppm (d, 2H)** peaks suggest a **para-substituted benzene ring**, with two sets of protons coupling equivalently.
- The remaining peaks (**2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**, **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**, **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**, and **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**) correspond to a **sec-butyl group**:
  - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Terminal CH₃ group of the ethyl chain.
  - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Methyl group (CH₃) attached to a CH.
  - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: CH₂ group adjacent to the CH and CH₃.
  - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: CH group connecting the aromatic ring to the CH₂ and CH₃ groups.

### Structure of Compound X:
Based on the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, where a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a sec-butyl group are attached to a benzene ring in para positions.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles or esters. However, since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, no further reaction occurs under these conditions. Thus, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
