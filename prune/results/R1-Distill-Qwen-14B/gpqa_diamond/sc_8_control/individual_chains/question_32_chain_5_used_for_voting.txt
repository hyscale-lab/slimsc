Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I remember that the notation for isotopes is usually the mass number as the superscript. So Li has atomic number 3, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A would be protons + neutrons. Li typically has 3 protons, so 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6.

So the task is to find the energy each nucleus has when moving at 0.96c. I think this is a relativistic energy problem because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light (c). At 0.96c, relativistic effects are definitely important.

I remember that relativistic energy is given by the equation E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Right, so we can calculate gamma using the given speed.

First, let's compute gamma. v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c². Let me compute that number. 0.96 squared is... 0.9216. So v²/c² is 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me think, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28² is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me get that precise. 0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25. So 1/(7/25) is 25/7, which is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass number A is 6, so the molar mass is about 6 g/mol. Wait, but converting to kg would be 6 grams per mole, which is 0.006 kg per mole. But wait, the actual mass of the nucleus is the molar mass in kilograms. So m = 6 u, where u is the atomic mass unit. Wait, I think the atomic mass unit is about 1.66e-27 kg. So, Li-6 has a mass of 6 * 1.66e-27 kg. Let me calculate that.

6 * 1.66e-27 = 9.96e-27 kg. Wait, but maybe I should look up the exact mass. Because sometimes, isotopic masses can be a bit different from just A * u due to binding energy and other factors. But I don't have exact numbers here, so perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass as A times u.

Wait, but wait, another approach. Maybe the problem expects us to use the rest energy as m*c², so E_rest is m c². So if I can find that, then multiply by gamma to get the total energy.

So E_rest = m c². The rest mass m is 6 u. So E_rest = 6 u * c². But what is the value of u in terms of energy? I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would give E_rest = 6 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. Which is 5.589 GeV. So E_rest is approximately 5.589 GeV.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c², so when you multiply by c², you get E_rest = m c² = 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. Yes.

So the rest energy is 5.589 GeV. But since gamma is about 3.5714, the total energy E is gamma times this.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.589.

Hmm, let's calculate that step by step.

5 * 3.5714 = 17.857
0.5 * 3.5714 = 1.7857
0.08 *3.5714= 0.285712
0.009 * 3.5714 ≈ 0.0321426

So adding up:

17.857 (from 5) 
+1.7857 (from 0.5) → 19.6427
+0.285712 (from 0.08) → 19.9284
+0.0321426 (from 0.009) → approximately 19.9605 GeV.

Wait, but that's 3.5714 *5.589 ≈ 19.96 GeV. So E is about 19.96 GeV. Let me compute it more accurately using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 3.5714 * 5.589.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5 =17.857, 3.5714 *0.5=1.7857, 3.5714 *0.08=0.28571, 3.5714 * 0.009=0.03214.

Adding those together: 17.857 + 1.7857 = 19.6427, plus 0.28571 =19.92841, plus 0.03214=19.96055 GeV.

So about 19.96 GeV.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Wait, none of the options is 19.96. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me recompute gamma.

v = 0.96c. So v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rest. Let me double-check that.

Wait, the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is actually about 6 atomic mass units. But wait, the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is a bit less than 6 u? Because when you combine protons and neutrons, the mass decreases due to binding energy. But for this problem, perhaps we're supposed to approximate it as 6 u. But maybe I should check. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using the exact mass from the periodic table.

Wait, let me think. The actual mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 u. Because the atomic weight of Lithium is about 6.941, but that's for the isotope with 4 neutrons (Li-7), perhaps. Wait no, Li has several isotopes. Li-6 is about 7.6% abundant, and its atomic mass is about 6.015 u.

Wait, so maybe the mass is 6.015 u. But that's more precise. So perhaps I was wrong to use 6 u.

So if m = 6.015 u, then E_rest = 6.015 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that: 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, plus 0.015 *931.5.

0.015 *931.5 = 13.9725 MeV. So E_rest is 5589 +13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV, which is 5.6029725 GeV.

So E_rest is about 5.603 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * E_rest = 3.57142857 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3 *5.603 =16.809
0.57142857 *5.603 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.5 *5.603 =2.8015
0.07142857 *5.603 ≈ 0.403.

So 2.8015 + 0.403 =3.2045.

So total E is 16.809 +3.2045 =20.0135 GeV.

So approximately 20.01 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.603.

Let me compute it more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.603:

Let me do it as (3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857) *5.603.

Alternatively, let me compute it step by step:

3 *5.603 =16.809
0.5 *5.603=2.8015
0.07142857 *5.603 ≈ 0.40307.

Adding them: 16.809 +2.8015=19.6105 +0.40307=20.01357 GeV.

So about 20.014 GeV.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603.

Another approach: Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603.

Compute 3.5 *5.603 = 19.6105.

Compute 0.07142857 *5.603.

Wait, 0.07142857 is 1/14.

So 5.603 /14 = approximately 0.4002.

So 3.5 *5.603 is 19.6105, plus 0.4002, gives 20.0107 GeV.

But again, that's about 20.01 GeV, which isn't exactly any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the exact calculation of gamma. Let's recalculate gamma using more precise steps.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 = 0.0784.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = exactly 25/7 = 3.57142857...

Wait, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is more accurately 6.015 u, and when I compute E_rest, I should be using that.

Wait, 6 u is 5589 MeV, 6.015 u is 6.015 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6.015 *931.5 = let's compute:

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.015 *931.5 =13.9725.

So total is 5589 +13.9725=5602.9725 MeV =5.6029725 GeV.

So E_rest =5.6029725 GeV.

Now, compute 3.57142857 *5.6029725 GeV.

Let me compute that precisely:

3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Hmm, perhaps I should multiply it out:

5.6029725 *3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285

0.6029725 *3.57142857 ≈ let's compute that.

0.6 *3.57142857 =2.142857142.

0.0029725 *3.57142857 ≈ approximately 0.0029725 *3.5714 ≈ 0.01058.

So adding 2.142857142 + 0.01058 ≈ 2.153437.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.153437 =20.01058 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0106 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest one is C) 20.132 GeV. But that's about 0.12 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma when v =0.96c isn't exactly 3.57142857. Let me compute it precisely.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2).

Compute 0.96^2: 0.96 *0.96 = (1 - 0.04)^2 = 1 - 0.08 + 0.0016 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the mass is not 6.015 u. Let me look up the exact mass of Li-6. Wait, I don't have exact data here, but I can recall that the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 u.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the mass as 6 u, not considering the exact isotope mass. Let's try that.

E_rest =6 u *931.5 MeV/u =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Gamma =3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.589 GeV.

Wait, 5.589 GeV is 5 +0.589.

So 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.589 = let's compute that.

0.5 *3.57142857 =1.785714285

0.08 *3.57142857 =0.2857142856

0.009 *3.57142857=0.03214285713.

Adding them together: 1.785714285 +0.2857142856 =2.07142857 +0.03214285713=2.103571427.

So total E is 17.85714285 +2.103571427 ≈19.96071428 GeV.

Which is about 19.96 GeV.

So that's 19.96 GeV, which is not exactly any of the options. The options are:

A)18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419.

Hmm. So 19.96 isn't an option. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma using more precise value.

Wait, v=0.96c, so v²/c²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately the product 3.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603 = ?

0.6 *3.57142857 =2.14285714.

0.003 *3.57142857 =0.0107142857.

So 2.14285714 +0.0107142857=2.15357142.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.15357142=20.01071427 GeV.

So about 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options again, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is higher than that.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should include more precise gamma value. Let me think about the exact calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should use more decimal places for gamma. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) accurately.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly. Because 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

Wait, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Oh, wait! Maybe I got the speed wrong. The question says speed of the nucleus is 0.96c, but maybe it's the speed of each nucleon, not the entire nucleus. That would complicate things, but I don't think so because the question is about the nucleus's speed.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the energy is per nucleon, but no, the question is about the nucleus.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the calculation should be done using the exact mass of the Li nucleus, which is 6.015 u, but perhaps I should compute E_rest more accurately.

E_rest = 6.015 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.015 *931.5 =13.9725 MeV.

So total 5589 +13.9725=5602.9725 MeV =5.6029725 GeV.

Then E = gamma * E_rest = 3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Hmm, let's compute 3.57142857 *5.6029725.

We can break it down:

3 *5.6029725 =16.8089175

0.57142857 *5.6029725.

0.5 *5.6029725 =2.80148625

0.07142857 *5.6029725 ≈ 0.4002857.

Wait, 0.07142857 is 1/14. So 5.6029725 /14 ≈0.4002123.

So 0.5 *5.6029725=2.80148625.

0.07142857 *5.6029725≈0.4002123.

So 0.57142857 *5.6029725≈2.80148625 +0.4002123=3.20169855.

So total E =16.8089175 +3.20169855=20.010616 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0106 GeV.

So about 20.01 GeV.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option C) 20.132 GeV, but it's 0.12 higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mass. Maybe the mass is not 6.015 u but 6.016 u or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the exact gamma and then use precise mass.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma.

Gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6029725 with more precision.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6029725.

Hmm, 0.6029725 =0.6 +0.0029725.

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0029725 = let's compute that.

3.57142857 *0.0029725 ≈.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.002=0.00714285714.

3.57142857 *0.0009725= approximately 3.57142857 *0.0009=0.003214285713, and 3.57142857 *0.0000725= approx 0.00025875.

So total about 0.003214285713 +0.00025875=0.003473035713.

So 0.00714285714 +0.003473035713≈0.01061589285.

So 3.57142857 *0.6029725≈2.142857142 +0.01061589285=2.153473035.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.153473035=20.01061589 GeV.

Which is 20.0106 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.01 GeV.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV. But that's 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass. Let me think again. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, looking up in my memory, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01505 u. So E_rest =6.01505 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute that:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.01505 *931.5 MeV = let's compute that.

0.01 *931.5=9.315 MeV.

0.00505 *931.5= approx 4.694 MeV.

So total 9.315 +4.694=14.009 MeV.

So E_rest=5589 +14.009=5603.009 MeV=5.603009 GeV.

So E_rest=5.603009 GeV.

Now, compute E=3.57142857 *5.603009 GeV.

Let me compute:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603009.

Again, 0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.003009 *3.57142857≈approx 0.010736.

So 0.603009 =0.6 +0.003009.

0.6 part gives 2.142857142.

0.003009 part gives 3.57142857 *0.003009 = approx 0.010736.

So 2.142857142 +0.010736=2.153593.

So E=17.85714285 +2.153593≈20.01073585 GeV.

So about 20.0107 GeV.

Still, that's about 20.01 GeV, which isn't any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the mass. Maybe the problem is using the mass number but not the exact isotope? Or perhaps the problem expects us to use the rest mass as m = A * u, where A is 6.

So let's try that approach again.

m =6 u → E_rest=6 *931.5=5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Then gamma =3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5.589.

Break it down:

5.589 =5 +0.5 +0.08 +0.009.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.5 =1.785714285.

3.57142857 *0.08 =0.2857142856.

3.57142857 *0.009=0.03214285713.

Adding all together:

17.85714285 +1.785714285=19.64285714.

+0.2857142856=19.92857142.

+0.03214285713=19.96071428.

So E≈19.9607 GeV.

So about 19.96 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is 0.17 GeV higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation leads to 20.01 GeV, which isn't an option. But perhaps the options have a typo, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using more precise gamma.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the exact formula for gamma.

Gamma = (1 - (v^2/c^2))^(-1/2).

So, v=0.96c → v²/c²=0.9216.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Wait, maybe using the exact value of 0.96 in the calculation, perhaps the exact gamma is 3.571428571428571.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done more accurately. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.603 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603.

Using a calculator approach:

3.57142857 ×5.603 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.003 =0.01071428571.

So 5.603 =5 +0.6 +0.003.

So 17.85714285 +2.142857142=19.999999992.

Plus 0.01071428571 gives 20.01071428 GeV.

So about 20.0107 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. But that's not very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the total energy using the exact formula, including gamma multiplied by the rest mass.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is calculated using the formula E = gamma * m * c², where m is the rest mass.

But perhaps the rest mass is not 6 u, but more accurately, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.015 u. Let me calculate that.

So E = 3.57142857 *6.015 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6.015 *931.5 = let's compute.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.015 *931.5=13.9725 MeV.

So 5589 +13.9725=5602.9725 MeV=5.6029725 GeV.

Now, gamma=3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6029725 GeV.

Which is 3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Hmm, let me compute this using more precise steps.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6029725.

Compute 0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.0029725 ×3.57142857=0.01058.

So 0.6029725 ×3.57142857=2.142857142 +0.01058=2.153437142.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.153437142=20.01058 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0106 GeV.

Hmm. I'm consistently getting around 20.01 GeV, which isn't one of the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm. 20.01 is closest to option C, but it's 0.12 GeV less.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6. Let me check. Oh, wait, perhaps Li-6 has a mass of 6.015 u. So E_rest =6.015 * 931.5 MeV.

Which is 6.015 *931.5=5602.9725 MeV=5.6029725 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.6029725=20.01058 GeV.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy instead of total energy. Oh! That's a possibility. Because sometimes problems ask for kinetic energy, which is E - m c².

Wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)". Typically, colliders provide kinetic energy, not rest mass energy. So perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, that changes everything. Let me re-evaluate.

Kinetic energy (K) is given by K = (gamma -1) * m c².

So in my earlier calculation, I found E=gamma * m c²=20.01 GeV.

So K =20.01 -5.603=14.407 GeV.

But that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, but the options are higher than my initial calculation for the total energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total energy, and I have to multiply gamma with the rest mass energy correctly.

Wait, but based on all calculations, I can't get any of the options. The closest is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma with more decimal places.

Wait, v=0.96c, so beta =v/c=0.96.

Compute gamma=1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that's accurate.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption of the mass. Let me check the actual mass of Li-6.

Looking up, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015050 u. So E_rest=6.015050 *931.5 = ?

Compute 6.01505 *931.5.

6 *931.5=5589.

0.01505 *931.5= let's compute.

0.01 *931.5=9.315.

0.00505 *931.5:

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.00005 *931.5=0.046575.

So 4.6575 +0.046575=4.704075.

So 0.01505 *931.5=9.315 +4.704075=14.019075 MeV.

So E_rest=5589 +14.019075=5603.019075 MeV=5.603019075 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.603019075.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.603019075.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.603019075.

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.003019075 ×3.57142857≈0.0107856.

So 0.603019075 ×3.57142857≈2.142857142 +0.0107856=2.153642742.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.153642742=20.01078559 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0108 GeV.

So again, around 20.01 GeV.

Hmm. None of the options are exactly this. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's 0.12 GeV higher. Perhaps the intended answer is C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

Wait, perhaps using more precise calculation for gamma.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the energy in a different unit, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps the mass is taken as 6.016 u.

Wait, let me check. If the mass is 6.016 u, E_rest=6.016 *931.5=?

6.016 *931.5 =6 *931.5=5589 +0.016 *931.5=14.904 →5589+14.904=5603.904 MeV=5.603904 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.603904.

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.603904.

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.003904 ×3.57142857≈0.013913.

So 0.603904 ×3.57142857≈2.142857142 +0.013913=2.156770142.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.156770142=20.01391299 GeV.

So about 20.0139 GeV.

Still, not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended the speed to be 0.99c, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate E_rest using the exact mass.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.01505 u. So E_rest=6.01505 *931.5 MeV.

Which is 6.01505 * 931.5 = 5603.0191 MeV =5.6030191 GeV.

Now, E=3.57142857 *5.6030191.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.6030191.

Let me compute it as (3 +0.5 +0.07142857) ×5.6030191.

3 ×5.6030191 =16.8090573.

0.5 ×5.6030191=2.80150955.

0.07142857 ×5.6030191=0.4002857.

Adding them up:16.8090573 +2.80150955=19.61056685 +0.4002857=20.01085255 GeV.

So approximately 20.01085 GeV.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 ×5.603.

Wait, 3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.603=?

3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.003=0.01071428571.

So 2.142857142 +0.01071428571=2.153571428.

So 17.85714285 +2.153571428=20.01071428 GeV.

Hmm. So again, about 20.01 GeV.

I'm stuck because the options don't have 20.01 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I'm using the rest mass of the nucleus, but perhaps the question is considering the kinetic energy, not the total.

Wait, if the question is about kinetic energy, K = (gamma -1) * m c².

So in that case, using E_rest=5.603019 GeV and gamma=3.57142857.

K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.603019.

Gamma -1=2.57142857.

So 2.57142857 ×5.603019=?

Compute 2 ×5.603019=11.206038.

0.5 ×5.603019=2.8015095.

0.07142857 ×5.603019≈0.4002857.

Adding them: 11.206038 +2.8015095=14.0075475 +0.4002857=14.4078332 GeV.

So K≈14.4078 GeV.

But none of the options match that either.

Given all this, perhaps the intended correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why there's a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise terms.

Wait, perhaps using more precise value for gamma.

Wait, with v=0.96c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem expects us to compute the kinetic energy, but I calculated the total energy. Let me see.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c".

RHIC accelerators typically provide the kinetic energy to the ions, but sometimes they quote the total energy. So perhaps I should re-express the energy as the total energy, which is what I've been doing.

But given that none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, which is close to my calculated 20.01 GeV, but perhaps the precise calculation gives a slightly higher value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation of gamma.

Compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 ×0.96.

Actually, 0.96² = (1 -0.04)^2 =1 - 0.08 +0.0016=0.9216. So that's correct.

So 1 -0.9216=0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use a different value for c, but I think it's standard.

Wait, perhaps the use of beta instead of gamma.

No, because gamma is used correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of E_rest.

Wait, perhaps the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015 u, which gives E_rest=6.015 *931.5=5602.9725 MeV.

Now, using gamma=3.57142857, E=3.57142857 *5.6029725=20.0107 GeV.

So about 20.01 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)23.069 GeV, but that would imply a higher gamma, which would require a higher speed.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the mass of the proton, but Li-6 has protons and neutrons.

No, wait, the nucleus's mass is what's considered.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is approximately 20.01 GeV, but since it's not an option, I have to choose the closest option, which is C)20.132 GeV. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that is closest to 20.01 GeV. The options are:

A)18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419.

So option C is the closest. So I think the intended answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest energy \( E_{\text{rest}} \)
The mass of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately \( 6.015 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
E_{\text{rest}} = m c^2 = 6.015 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} = 5602.9725 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6029725 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma E_{\text{rest}} \):

\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.6029725 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
3.57142857 \times 5 = 17.85714285 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
3.57142857 \times 0.6029725 \approx 2.15357142 \, \text{GeV}
\]
\[
E = 17.85714285 + 2.15357142 = 20.01071427 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Thus, the total energy is approximately \( 20.01 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy \( 20.01 \, \text{GeV} \) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. While there is a slight discrepancy, this is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
