Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities: Star_1 is 0 km/s, and Star_2 is 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So I remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says that the luminosity of a star is proportional to its radius squared multiplied by its temperature to the fourth power. So L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since we're comparing luminosities, the constants will cancel out, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. The peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. If the stars have the same temperature, then the L ratio becomes (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1 = T2, the (T1/T2)^4 part is 1. So L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So the factor would be 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, the question also mentions radial velocities. Oh, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect luminosity? Luminosity is an intrinsic property, not something affected by how fast the star is moving. Radial velocity affects things like the Doppler shift, but not the actual luminosity. Unless... but wait, the problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelengths. So maybe there's something else.

Wait, the problem said that the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So if they have the same λ_max, as I thought before, then their temperatures are the same. But wait, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Could that affect the observed wavelength?

Oh! Because of the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us (or away), the observed wavelength will shift. But the problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both.

Wait, so for Star_1, its RV is 0, so no Doppler shift. So its observed λ_max is equal to b/T1. For Star_2, which is moving at 700 km/s, perhaps that affects the observed λ_max. But according to the problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both.

Wait, so maybe the calculated λ_max (from their actual temperatures) is different, but due to the Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is the same. Let me think.

Let me clarify: the problem says that the peaks (λ_max) are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So, for Star_1, its emitted λ_max is b / T1. Since its velocity is zero, the observed λ is same as emitted. For Star_2, which has a velocity of 700 km/s, its emitted λ_max is b / T2. But due to Doppler shift, the observed λ is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), approximately, for non-relativistic speeds.

Wait, but which direction is Star_2 moving? If it's moving towards us, it's blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. But in the problem, Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, Star_2 has 700 km/s. So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its light would be blueshifted. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but wait, no, the Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) when moving away, or is it the other way? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler factor. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) when moving away, but wait, no. Let me get it right. If the source is moving away (positive v), the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ) when the motion is along the line of sight. Wait, no, wait: I think the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And for small velocities, z ≈ v/c.

But for a source moving towards us at speed v, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted). So the formula is λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 - v/c). But for precise calculations, I think the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (c + v)/(c - v) ) ), when the source is moving towards us. Wait, no, maybe it's (1 + v/c)/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the Doppler shift factor. Let's denote for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving towards us, so the observed λ_max is shorter. But the problem states that both stars have the same observed λ_max. So Star_2's observed λ is the same as Star_1's.

So the emitted λ_max for Star_2 would be longer (if it's moving towards us) because when a source moves towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter than the emitted. So in that case, to have same observed λ, the emitted λ of Star_2 must be larger.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose Star_2 emits at λ2_emit. Due to its velocity v (700 km/s towards us), we observe λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ), where β = v/c. Because when the source is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is smaller than emitted. Therefore, if λ2_obs = λ1_emit (since λ1_emit = λ1_obs because Star_1's v is zero), then:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So λ2_emit = λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Which would mean λ2_emit > λ1_emit, because the sqrt factor is greater than one (since v is positive). So that would imply that T2 is lower than T1, since λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Because from Wien's law, λ_max = b / T. So if λ2_emit > λ1_emit, then T2 < T1.

Wait, but that complicates things because earlier I thought T1 = T2 because their observed λ_max is same, but that's only if the stars' rest frames are considered. But if one is moving and the other is not, their emitted wavelengths may differ but the observed λ_max is the same.

So in that case, the temperatures of the stars are different.

So let's re-express this.

Let me denote:

For Star_1:

λ1_obs = λ1_emit (since v1 = 0)

For Star_2:

λ2_obs = λ2_emit * D, where D is the Doppler factor.

But according to the problem, λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * D.

Since D depends on the velocity.

Let me compute D. The relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_source * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β = v/c.

Wait, if the source is moving towards us at velocity v, then the observed wavelength is blueshifted. So λ_obs is less than λ_source. But in our case, the observed λ is same for both.

So, λ_star1_emit = λ_star2_obs = λ_star2_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Which can be rearranged as:

λ2_emit = λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Hmm.

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So:

λ1_emit = b / T1

λ2_emit = b / T2

So substituting into the previous equation:

b / T2 = (b / T1) * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T2 = (1/T1) * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

But wait, that would mean T2 is less than T1, because sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) is less than 1 when β is positive (v is towards us).

So T2 < T1.

Therefore, the temperatures are not the same. So earlier assumption that T1 = T2 was incorrect because I didn't account for the Doppler shift.

So we have to take the Doppler shift into account when determining the temperature ratio.

So in the luminosity formula, L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We have R1 = 1.5 R2.

We need to find T1 and T2.

From the above, we have T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So T1/T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ) = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So (T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2.

So L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2.

Now, we need to calculate β, which is v/c.

v is 700 km/s. Speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

So β = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000.

700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333...

So β ≈ 0.02333.

So (1 + β) ≈ 1.02333

(1 - β) ≈ 0.97667

So (1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ 1.02333 / 0.97667 ≈ 1.048.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Compute numerator: 1 + β = 1 + 0.023333333 = 1.023333333.

Denominator: 1 - β = 0.976666667.

Divide them: 1.023333333 / 0.976666667.

Let me compute this division.

Compute 1.023333333 / 0.976666667.

Approximate:

1.0233 / 0.9767 ≈ let me compute 1.0233 ÷ 0.9767.

Let me do this:

0.9767 * 1.048 ≈ ?

0.9767 * 1 = 0.9767.

0.9767 * 0.04 = 0.039068.

0.9767 * 0.008 = approx 0.0078136.

Adding these: 0.9767 + 0.039068 = 1.015768 + 0.0078136 ≈ 1.0235816.

Which is close to 1.0233. So 1.048 times 0.9767 is approximately 1.02358, which is a bit higher than 1.023333333.

So maybe the actual ratio is approximately 1.048 - let's say 1.048.

So (1 + β)/(1 - β) ≈ 1.048.

So [ (1 + β)/(1 - β) ]^2 ≈ (1.048)^2 ≈ 1.097.

So now, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.097.

1.5 squared is 2.25. 2.25 * 1.097 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25

2.25 * 0.097 = approx 0.21825.

So 2.25 + 0.21825 = 2.46825.

Wait, but wait—does this make sense? Because Doppler shift affects the temperature ratio, which in turn affects the luminosity ratio beyond just the radius.

So L1/L2 is 2.25 * (about 1.097) ≈ 2.468.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, none of these are 2.468. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I should compute the (1 + β)/(1 - β) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using the non-relativistic Doppler shift approximation. Since v is 700 km/s and c is 3e5 km/s, so beta is approx 0.002333, not 0.02333. Wait, wait, no.

Wait, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, and c is about 3e8 m/s. So beta = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7e-3 = 0.002333.

Wait, oh wait! 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s. 3e5 km/s is 3e5,000 m/s (since 1 km is 1e3 m). So 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/3e3 = approx 0.002333.

Ah! So I must have made a mistake earlier. I thought 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, but 3e5 km/s is 3e5 * 1e3 = 3e8 m/s. So beta is 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) ≈ 0.002333.

So beta is approximately 0.002333.

So (1 + beta) ≈ 1.002333.

(1 - beta) ≈ 0.997667.

So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = (1.002333)/(0.997667).

Compute this division.

Let me compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me approximate this:

0.997667 * 1.005 ≈ 0.997667 + (0.997667 * 0.005) = 0.997667 + 0.004988 ≈ 1.002655.

Which is just a bit higher than 1.002333. So 1.005 * 0.997667 ≈ 1.002655, which is a bit higher than 1.002333.

So maybe the actual ratio is approximately 1.00466.

Wait, perhaps I should do a more accurate division.

Let me compute 1.002333 ÷ 0.997667.

Let me write it as 1.002333 / 0.997667 = (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333).

Which can be approximated using the Taylor expansion for small x:

(1 + x)/(1 - x) ≈ (1 + x)(1 + x + x² + ...) ≈ 1 + 2x + 2x² + ... 

Since x is small, x ≈ 0.002333, 2x = ~0.004666, and x² is negligible (about (0.002333)^2 ≈ 5.4e-6).

So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ≈ 1 + 2*beta ≈ 1 + 2*(0.002333) = 1.004666.

So approximately 1.004666.

So [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ (1.004666)^2 ≈ 1.00934.

Because (1 + a)^2 ≈ 1 + 2a when a is small.

So 1.004666^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.004666) = 1.009332.

So (T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ 1.009332.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.009332 = 2.25 * 1.009332 ≈ 2.25 * 1.009332.

Compute 2.25 * 1.009332:

2.25 * 1 = 2.25.

2.25 * 0.009332 ≈ approximately 0.02100.

So 2.25 + 0.021 = approximately 2.271.

So the L1/L2 ratio is approximately 2.27, which is close to option D (2.23) or option C (2.35). But 2.27 is closer to 2.27. None of the options exactly match, but the options are approximate.

Wait, but the problem states that the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. But I used beta as 700 km/s divided by c (3e5 km/s). Wait, 700 / 300,000 = 0.00233333.

Wait, but wait a minute. The Doppler shift formula I used earlier was for when the star is moving towards us, which would blueshift the light. So in the problem, the observed λ_max is same for both stars. So for Star_2, which is moving towards us, its emitted λ_emit must be longer than Star_1's emitted λ_emit, because when moving towards us, the observed λ is shorter. So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed λ is λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), which is less than λ_emit. So for Star_2, observed λ = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ). And this equals Star_1's emitted λ (since Star_1's observed λ is same as its emitted). So λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which gives λ2_emit = λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which as before, leads to T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So using beta = 0.002333, as we did earlier.

Wait, let me compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) exactly with beta = 0.002333.

(1 + beta) = 1.002333.

(1 - beta) = 0.997667.

So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Let me compute this more accurately.

1.002333 ÷ 0.997667 = ?

Let me compute 1.002333 / 0.997667.

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.997667 to make it easier:

Let me compute 1.002333 = 0.997667 * (approx 1.004666) as before.

But perhaps a better way is to compute the division using a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, I can compute it as (1 + 0.002333) / (1 - 0.002333) ≈ 1.004666.

So, as earlier.

So [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ (1.004666)^2 ≈ 1.009332.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.009332 = 2.25 * 1.009332 ≈ 2.271.

Hmm, but the options don't have 2.27. The options are A) 2.25, B)2.32, C)2.35, D)2.23.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler shift. Let me double-check the Doppler shift formula.

The correct Doppler shift formula when the source is moving towards the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_source * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) )

So if the source moves towards us, the observed wavelength is smaller than emitted. So for Star 2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s towards us (assuming positive velocity is towards us), the observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But the problem states that both stars have the same observed λ_max. So:

λ1_emit = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Thus, λ2_emit = λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So the ratio λ2_emit / λ1_emit = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Since λ is inversely proportional to T, we have:

λ2_emit = (b / T2) = (b / T1) * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which we've done before.

So the ratio (T1/T2) is sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So (T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2.

So back to the luminosity calculation.

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2.

So compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) accurately.

beta = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333333.

So 1 + beta = 1.002333333

1 - beta = 0.997666667

So their ratio is approximately 1.002333333 / 0.997666667 ≈ 1.004666667.

So [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ (1.0046667)^2.

Compute 1.0046667 squared.

= (approx) (1 + 0.0046667)^2 = 1 + 2 * 0.0046667 + (0.0046667)^2

= 1 + 0.0093334 + 0.000021778 ≈ 1.009355.

So [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ 1.009355.

Then L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009355 ≈ 2.25 * 1.009355.

Compute 2.25 * 1.009355.

Well, 2.25 * 1 = 2.25

2.25 * 0.009355 ≈ 0.021046

So total L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 + 0.021046 = 2.271046.

So approximately 2.271, which is about 2.27.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) 2.23, but it's a bit lower. Hmm. Alternatively, let me check if I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact square of [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ].

Let me compute (1 + beta) = 1.0023333333.

(1 - beta) = 0.9976666667.

So (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

Let me compute this division step by step.

We can compute 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

Let me represent this as (a + b) / (a - b), where a = 1, b = beta.

Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to compute it as:

We can write this as:

(1 + beta) / (1 - beta) = ( (1 - beta) + 2 beta ) / (1 - beta) ) = 1 + (2 beta)/(1 - beta).

So,

= 1 + [ 2 * 0.0023333333 ] / (1 - 0.0023333333 )

Compute denominator: 1 - 0.0023333333 = 0.9976666667.

So numerator: 2 * 0.0023333333 = 0.0046666666.

So,

= 1 + (0.0046666666 / 0.9976666667 )

Compute 0.0046666666 / 0.9976666667.

= approx 0.004678.

So,

(1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ≈ 1 + 0.004678 = 1.004678.

Then, [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 = (1.004678)^2.

= 1 + 2*(0.004678) + (0.004678)^2.

= 1 + 0.009356 + 0.00002188.

= 1.00937788.

So, more accurately, [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ 1.00937788.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00937788 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00937788.

Compute this:

2.25 * 1.00937788 = ?

Let me compute step by step.

2 * 1.00937788 = 2.01875576.

0.25 * 1.00937788 = 0.25234447.

Adding them together: 2.01875576 + 0.25234447 = 2.27110023.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.2711.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.23, but this is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the direction of the velocity.

Wait, the problem states that the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s, but it doesn't specify the direction. If Star_2 is moving away from us, then the Doppler shift would be redshifted. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be longer than its emitted λ_emit.

But wait, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), which is larger than λ2_emit.

In that case, to have λ_obs same as Star_1's λ_emit, which is λ1_emit.

So,

λ1_emit = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which means λ2_emit = λ1_emit / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which is λ2_emit = λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, that changes things. Because earlier when Star_2 was moving towards us, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), which is lower. But if it's moving away, then T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), which would be higher.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

If the source is moving away from us, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) (assuming beta is positive for receding).

But the problem states that λ_obs for both stars is same.

So for Star_2 moving away:

λ1_emit = λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So,

λ2_emit = λ1_emit / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which is same as λ2_emit = λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which implies T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Because λ is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, because if λ2_emit is smaller than λ1_emit (because sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) < 1), then T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, no, because λ2_emit would be λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), which is less than λ1_emit. Since λ is inversely proportional to T, T2 would be higher than T1.

But earlier, when Star_2 was moving towards us, T2 was lower. Now, moving away, T2 is higher.

So depending on the direction, the temperatures could be higher or lower.

But in the problem statement, the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s. Radial velocity towards us is positive (or negative?), but the problem doesn't specify. So perhaps the sign matters.

But without knowing the direction, perhaps I should consider it as a redshift or blueshift.

Wait, because the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. But it doesn't specify direction. So it's possible that Star_2 is moving towards us (positive velocity) or away (negative). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps the correct approach is to consider the magnitude regardless of direction.

Wait, but the Doppler shift affects the observed λ_max, which depends on the direction. So without knowing whether Star_2 is moving towards or away, I might not be able to proceed, unless I assume it's moving away.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the observed λ_max is the same regardless of the direction, but that would complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the magnitude, and the direction doesn't matter because it's squared or something. Alternatively, perhaps the radial velocity is 700 km/s towards us, leading to a blueshift, and thus requiring the emitted wavelengths to be different.

Wait, but regardless of whether it's moving towards or away, the Doppler shift formula is symmetric in a way. Because moving towards causes blueshift (shorter λ), moving away causes redshift (longer λ).

But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both. Therefore, if Star_1 has zero radial velocity, its emitted and observed λ_max are same. Star_2 must have its emitted λ_max adjusted by the Doppler shift to match.

But I think I'm getting stuck in a loop here. Let me try to approach this differently.

So, to restate:

We have two stars emitting blackbody radiation. Each has a peak wavelength λ_max (emitted) determined by their temperature via Wien's law: λ_max = b / T.

Star_1's observed λ_max is the same as its emitted λ_max because its radial velocity is zero. So λ1_obs = λ1_emit.

Star_2 has a radial velocity v (700 km/s). The observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * D, where D is the Doppler factor.

But the problem states that λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * D.

So,

λ2_emit = λ1_emit / D.

But D depends on whether Star_2 is moving towards or away.

If Star_2 is moving towards us, D = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) < 1, so λ2_emit > λ1_emit. Since λ is inversely proportional to T, T2 < T1.

If Star_2 is moving away, D = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) > 1, so λ2_emit < λ1_emit. Thus, T2 > T1.

So depending on direction, the temperature ratio can be higher or lower.

But the problem doesn't specify the direction. So perhaps I should assume it's moving away, which would lead to T2 > T1, and a higher luminosity ratio.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about the luminosity of Star_1 being greater than that of Star_2. So if Star_2 is moving away, its temperature is higher (T2 > T1), then L2 would be higher, which contradicts the question statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I should go back to the problem.

Wait, the problem says, "Astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So L1 > L2. 

So, if Star_2 is moving away, and T2 > T1, then L2 would be (R2^2 T2^4) / (R1^2 T1^4) ) compared to L1? No, wait, L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4, L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

If T2 > T1, then (T1/T2)^4 is less than 1, which would make L1/L2 smaller than (R1/R2)^2. But the problem states that L1 is greater than L2 by a factor of ~2.25, 2.23, etc.

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me think again.

The problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So for Star_2, the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1's emitted λ_max.

But Star_2's emitted λ_max is either higher or lower than Star_1's, depending on whether it's moving towards or away.

If the observed λ_max for Star_2 is same as Star_1's, and if Star_2 is moving towards us, then its emitted λ_max is longer, so T2 is lower.

If Star_2 is moving away, its emitted λ_max is shorter, so T2 is higher.

But the problem says that L1 is greater than L2. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

If T2 is higher, then (T1/T2)^4 is less than 1, possibly making L1/L2 < 2.25.

But according to the problem, Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. So L1 > L2.

So, if Star_2 is moving away, T2 > T1, which would make (T1/T2)^4 < 1, so L1/L2 would be less than 2.25, but the options have higher values, like up to 2.35. Thus, perhaps Star_2 is moving towards us, making T2 < T1, leading to (T1/T2)^4 > 1, which would make L1/L2 greater than 2.25.

Wait, no. Let me recompute.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then its observed λ_max is blueshifted, so observed λ_max = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So λ2_emit = λ_obs / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So λ2_emit > λ_obs.

Since λ_max is inversely proportional to T, T2 = b / λ2_emit < b / λ_obs = T1.

So T2 < T1.

Thus, (T1/T2)^4 > 1.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

If (T1/T2)^4 is greater than 1, then L1/L2 is greater than 2.25.

So the options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, etc. So the correct calculation would give a value a bit higher than 2.25, which is what I found earlier (around 2.27).

But the options don't have 2.27. The closest is D) 2.23 and B) 2.32.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Doppler shift factor.

Let me recompute beta.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 3e5 km/s = 300,000 km/s.

So beta = v/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.0023333333.

So,

(1 + beta) = 1.0023333333

(1 - beta) = 0.9976666667

Compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.0023333333 / 0.9976666667.

Let me compute this division more accurately.

Dividing 1.0023333333 by 0.9976666667.

I can write this as (1002333.3333e-6) / (997666.6667e-6) ) = 1002333.3333 / 997666.6667.

Compute 1002333.3333 / 997666.6667.

Let me compute 997,666.6667 * 1.004678 = ?

997,666.6667 * 1 = 997,666.6667

997,666.6667 * 0.004678 ≈ 997,666.6667 * 0.004 = 3,990.6666668

Plus 997,666.6667 * 0.000678 ≈ approx 678.0666666.

So total ≈ 3,990.6666668 + 678.0666666 ≈ 4,668.7333334.

So 997,666.6667 * 1.004678 ≈ 997,666.6667 + 4,668.7333334 ≈ 1,002,335.4.

Which is very close to 1,002,333.3333.

So the ratio is approximately 1.004678.

So [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ]^2 ≈ (1.004678)^2 ≈ 1.009377.

Thus,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * (1.009377) ≈ 2.2711.

But the options don't have this. The closest is option B) 2.32, which is about 0.05 higher, but let's see if perhaps the actual calculation would be closer to 2.32.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute with more precise terms.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula for Doppler shift without the approximation.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is (1 + v/c) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) when the source is moving away. But I think I might have mixed up the formulas earlier.

Wait, the correct Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no. That's for frequency. For wavelength, it's the inverse.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, no. Let me get this right.

The relativistic Doppler effect formula is:

f_obs = f_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) )

for a source moving away (beta positive).

Since λ = c/f, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, no: When the source moves away, the observed wavelength is longer, so λ_obs / λ_emit = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Yes, that's correct.

So, for Star_2 moving away, the observed wavelength is:

λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But according to the problem, λ2_obs = λ1_emit.

So,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which implies λ2_emit = λ1_emit / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

= λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

λ2_emit = λ1_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which implies T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Since λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Thus, (T1/T2) = sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2

= 2.25 * [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2

Wait, this is the opposite of what I thought earlier. So if Star_2 is moving away, then L1/L2 is 2.25 multiplied by [ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2.

So let's compute this.

beta = 0.0023333333.

Compute (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) = (0.9976666667)/(1.0023333333) ≈ 0.9953333333.

So,

[ (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ]^2 ≈ (0.9953333333)^2 ≈ 0.9906666667.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9906666667 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9906666667 ≈ 2.22825.

So approximately 2.228, which is about 2.23.

Which matches option D) ~2.23.

So the correct answer is D) ~2.23.

But wait, earlier when I considered Star_2 moving towards us, the ratio was higher, but when moving away, it's lower. So depending on the direction, the ratio varies.

But according to the problem statement, the radial velocity of Star_2 is 700 km/s, but it doesn't specify direction. So in the absence of direction, perhaps the problem assumes it's moving away, leading to L1 being less than L2. But the problem says that L1 is greater than L2.

Wait, the problem says that L1 is computed to be greater than L2. So if Star_2 is moving away, and due to that, our calculation led to L1/L2 ≈ 2.23, which is greater than 1, meaning L1 > L2.

Wait, no. Because if Star_2 is moving away, then T2 > T1, so with radius being 1.5 times larger, the L1 may still be greater than L2.

But according to the calculation, when Star_2 is moving away, L1/L2 is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

So the correct answer is option D) ~2.23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The stars appear brightest at the same observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)), so their observed peak wavelengths are identical. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \)), the emitted wavelengths are related to their temperatures. However, the observed wavelength is affected by the Doppler shift due to the radial velocity of Star_2 (\( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)).

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

where \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \). For Star_2 moving away, the observed wavelength is redshifted, and the emitted wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{2,\text{emit}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

Since \( \lambda_{1,\text{obs}} = \lambda_{2,\text{obs}} \), we have:

\[
\lambda_{1,\text{emit}} = \lambda_{2,\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\frac{\lambda_{2,\text{emit}}}{\lambda_{1,\text{emit}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]

From Wien's law, \( \lambda \propto \frac{1}{T} \), so:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}\right)^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \beta \)
The speed of light \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
\beta = \frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \)
Using \( \beta \approx 0.002333 \):

\[
\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta} = \frac{1.002333}{0.997667} \approx 1.004667
\]

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}\right)^2 \approx 0.990667
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( \frac{L_1}{L_2} \)
Substitute into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.990667 \approx 2.228
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
