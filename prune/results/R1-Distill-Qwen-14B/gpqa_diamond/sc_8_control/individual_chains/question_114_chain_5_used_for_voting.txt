Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let's look at each part.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, which is a nucleophile, I think this is a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition. So NaCN would act as a nucleophile here. But what's the role of reagent A? Oh, wait, maybe it's about the conditions. For the addition of CN- to a ketone, I remember that the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. Because the ketone needs to be protonated to make the carbonyl more electrophilic.

So after the CN- attacks, we get a cyanohydrin. The product formed is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid, H2SO4, or another strong acid). Or maybe it's a different acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm. What's the role of NaHSO3? Oh, wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3- ions. It's used in some addition reactions, like in the reduction of aldehydes or ketones to alcohols. But wait, adding CN- to a ketone would require an acid catalyst, right? Because the acid protonates the carbonyl.

So maybe reagent A is H3O+ (like H2SO4 or another strong acid). So options A or B.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Let's think. The nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

How do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, it's usually with HCl and heat, maybe using something like H3O+ as a catalyst. Alternatively, under basic conditions, it might involve a strong base like NaOH, but then you might have to acidify it afterward.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. So the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid usually involves two steps: first, converting the nitrile to an amide or an acid under certain conditions. Let me think. Another approach is using H2O and an acid catalyst. Or maybe it's using HCl as a reagent.

Wait, the second part is reaction with B and H2O. So reagent B is either HCl or another acid, perhaps. Let me think about the steps: when a nitrile is hydrolyzed with H2O and an acid catalyst, it typically goes through the hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. So for example, using HCl (like conc. HCl) and water under reflux.

But wait, another possibility is that reagent B is a strong acid like HCl, which would provide the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group. So looking at the options, option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH.

Wait, but the second reaction is hydrolyzing the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So the reaction conditions would probably require an acid catalyst. So which is more likely, HCl or acetic acid?

Hmm, I think that for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, a strong acid is usually used. Like H2SO4 or HCl. Because the reaction might require some heat and strong acidic conditions.

But another thought: sometimes, hydrolysis of nitriles can be done using a peroxide and an acid. Or maybe I'm mixing up different reaction conditions.

Wait, let me think again. The first step in the nitrile hydrolysis is adding water across the triple bond. For that, you need a catalyst. In acidic conditions, the H+ protonates the nitrile's lone pair, making it more electrophilic. Then water attacks, leading to the formation of an imidamide intermediate, which further reacts to form the carboxylic acid.

So reagent B is probably an acid. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option C has B as HCl as well. So between A and C.

Wait, but looking back at the first reaction, reagent A: in option A, it's H3O+, and in option C, it's NaHSO3.

Wait, let me check: in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

So, the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The standard conditions for cyanohydrin formation involve an acid catalyst. So A is an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+.

So, in the first reaction, A is H3O+.

In the second reaction, reagent B is either HCl (option A and C) or something else.

So which options have A as H3O+? Options A and B.

But in the second reaction, what's the role of reagent B? It's part of the reagents along with H2O. So perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait—the product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group becomes a carboxylic acid, while the existing hydroxyl group remains.

So for the second step, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. So the reagents would be H2O with an acid catalyst, like HCl or H3O+.

Looking at the options, option A's B is HCl, option B's B is CH3COOH (acetic acid), which is a weaker acid.

Which is more suitable for hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids?

I think that for hydrolysis, especially to get the carboxylic acid directly, a strong acid like HCl is required. Using a weaker acid might not be sufficient, or perhaps the reaction would proceed but at a slower rate or under different conditions.

So in the second reaction, reagent B is HCl. So looking for an option where B is HCl. That's option A and option C.

Wait, option C's A is NaHSO3. But earlier, the first reaction required A to be an acid like H3O+. So option C would have A as NaHSO3. Is that plausible?

Wait, what's NaHSO3 used for? Sodium bisulfite is used in the reduction of ketones to alcohols. Like in the Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reductions? No, wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl. Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 and heat, then strong base.

Wait, sodium bisulfite is used in the hydroboration of alkenes? No, that's BH3. Alternatively, in the oxidation of alcohols? Wait, maybe in the hydrolysis of nitriles?

Alternatively, I think that sodium bisulfite can be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Wait, but the first reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. Let me think about that again.

Wait, the first reaction is adding NaCN to a ketone. The cyanohydrin formation requires an acid catalyst. So A must be an acid, like H2SO4 (which donates H3O+).

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+.

In the options, options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now, in the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B).

So if in the second reaction, B is HCl, then the correct option would be A, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Alternatively, if B is acetic acid, perhaps it's another condition.

Wait, what's the typical reagent for converting nitrile to carboxylic acid?

I think it's usually done under strong acidic conditions, like with concentrated HCl and heating. Or sometimes using a mercury catalyst and acid.

Wait, another approach: the nitrile group is first converted to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. Or, perhaps, using a hydrolysis with H2O and acid.

Alternatively, could it be that the second step uses an acid catalyst, like HCl?

So in the second reaction, B is HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B).

Given that, I think HCl is a stronger acid and more likely to be used for this hydrolysis.

So putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ (A is H3O+), and the second uses HCl (B is HCl).

Looking at the options, option A has A = H3O+, B = HCl.

Option A is option (A): A = H3O+, B = HCl.

So the correct answer would be option A.

The problem involves determining the correct reagents for two reactions. 

### Reaction 1:
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where NaCN acts as the nucleophile, and the ketone group in butan-2-one is attacked. For this reaction to proceed, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic. The product is a cyanohydrin, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Among the options, the acid catalyst for this reaction is **H3O+** (as in options A and B).

### Reaction 2:
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
Here, the nitrile group (-CN) is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to facilitate the addition of water across the nitrile group. Strong acids like HCl are commonly used for this purpose, as they provide the necessary acidic conditions for the hydrolysis to proceed efficiently. Among the options, **HCl** (as in options A and C) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H3O+, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions. H3O+ is the correct catalyst for the first reaction, and HCl is the correct catalyst for the second reaction.  
- **Option B:** A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH  
  While H3O+ is correct for the first reaction, CH3COOH (acetic acid) is a weaker acid and less suitable for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.  
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO3, B = HCl  
  NaHSO3 is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.  
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH  
  Neither NaHSO3 nor CH3COOH is suitable for the first reaction, and CH3COOH is also not ideal for the second reaction.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are **A = H3O+** and **B = HCl**, which correspond to **Option A**.

Answer: A
