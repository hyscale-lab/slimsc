Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting transiting planets. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says the researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets have the same mass but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits.

Wait, the host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh! Because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius. So, same size, but different masses.

I think the probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet and the star. The formula for transit probability is (Rp / R*)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and R* is the star's radius. Wait, no, wait. Actually, it's more complicated because the probability depends on the alignment—specifically, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that we see the transit. But wait, the alignment part is actually a geometric probability, which is (R*/a), where a is the orbital separation.

Wait, no, let me think again. The geometric probability for a transit is (R*/a). Because the transit happens only if the planet's orbital plane is within a certain angle relative to our line of sight. So the probability is the area where the planet's orbit would cross our line of sight, which is proportional to (R*/a). So the probability P is (R* / a).

But wait, another thought: the actual formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a), because you have to have the planet's size blocking the star's light, and the alignment. Or is it just the alignment? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to get the formula right.

The transit probability (P) is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (1/(something else?)).

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another approach: the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is (R_s / a). Because a is the semi-major axis, and the geometric probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So that's P_geo = (R_s / a).

But wait, wait no, actually, the geometric probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star to the planet—in other words, (R_s / a). Because the planet must pass within the small circle (the star's disk) when viewed edge-on. So the probability is the area of the circle divided by the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. Wait, that's not exactly right. Let me think: when the orbit is edge-on, the planet passes directly in front. The chance that it's in that orientation is determined by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So P_geo = (R_s / a).

Wait, but that can't be right because if a is much larger than R_s, the probability is small. So yeah, that makes sense. So the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), but wait, no—because the planet's size is a factor in the depth of the transit, but the probability is only about the alignment and whether the planet crosses our line of sight. So the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the geometric probability. Wait, no, the depth is (R_p / R_s)^2, but the probability of the transit occurring (i.e., whether we see it or not) is the geometric probability.

Wait, maybe I should just look it up. But I can't, so I'll try to rely on what I remember. The probability that a planet transits is given by (R* + R_p / a) but since R_p is much smaller than R*, it's approximately (R* / a). But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's (R_s / a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is correct, which is (R_s / a). Hmm.

Alternatively, the probability of a transit is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * something else? No, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Another thought: if you have a star of radius R, and a planet at distance a, the area of the star is πR², and the area of the planet's orbit (as seen edge-on) is πa². So the probability that the planet's path passes in front of the star is the ratio of areas: (R² / a²). But wait, that's the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on enough for a transit. Wait, but that's not exactly correct because the planet's orbit is a circle, and the transit occurs only when the planet's path is within a certain 'cone' of our line of sight.

Alternatively, the probability is (R*/a) because the transit occurs when the line of sight is within the angle determined by the star's size. So the probability is (R*/a). Because the transit requires the planet's orbital plane to be within an angle θ where sinθ = R*/a. The probability of that is 2θ/(π/2), since θ is small. So, approximately, P ≈ (2 R* /a) / (π/2) )= (4 R* )/(π a). Wait, no, perhaps the geometric probability is (R*/a) because that's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of the formula. The probability that a planet transits is given by:

P = (R_p + R_s) / (a) )? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, I think I saw this before. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit will produce a transit is (R_s / a), but only if the planet's orbit is such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. So yes, the geometric probability is R_s/(a), since if the semi-major axis is a, the chance the planet's orbit is edge-on enough is proportional to (R_s /a).

But wait, that formula would imply that if a is very large, the probability is very small, which makes sense. So, the transit probability is P = (R_s / a).

But wait, no, I'm mixing up some factors. Another thought: the probability that the inclination is right is (R_s / a) because the planet has to be within a cone of angle θ around our line of sight, where θ ≈ R_s / a (since tanθ ≈ R_s / a for small θ).

The number of such orbits is proportional to the solid angle they occupy. The solid angle for a cone with half-angle θ is 2π(1 - cosθ) ≈ πθ². The total possible solid angle is 4π, so the probability is (θ²) / (4π) ). But θ ≈ R_s / a, so P ≈ ( (R_s / a)^2 ) / (4) ) = (R_s²) / (4 a²).

Wait, that's different. So the probability is (R_s^2)/(4 a^2)? Hmm, that doesn't match what I thought earlier. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, another source says the geometric probability is (R_s/a) because it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way: the probability that the planet transits is the area of the star's disk relative to the area of the planet's orbital path as seen from Earth. So the area of the star is π R_s². The area of the planet's orbit (assuming edge-on) is π a². So the probability is π R_s² / π a² = (R_s/a)^2.

Wait, that makes sense. So the transit probability is (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, but that would imply that if a is 10 R_s, the probability is 1/100, which seems too low. Hmm.

Wait, but I think the correct formula is that the probability is (R_s / a) multiplied by another factor. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_s / a) because it's the fraction of the orbit where the planet could pass in front of the star.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to find a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the transit probability in terms of the orbital period and the star's radius.

But wait, the question gives us that both planets have the same mass, but their periods and host stars are different.

We need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting.

The transit probability depends on (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the geometric probability, which is (R_s / a). Wait, perhaps the total probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a). Because the transit depth is (R_p/R_s)^2, and the probability of alignment is (R_s / a).

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (2/(pi)) or something like that. I'm not sure.

But let's try to think of it as P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) = (R_p^2)/(R_s a) ).

Wait, that would be the case if transit depth is (R_p/R_s)^2 and the probability of alignment is (R_s/a), so their product is (R_p^2)/(R_s a). But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability for a planet to transit is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * (1/(something else). I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the given data.

Both planets have same mass. Same mass doesn't directly affect transit probability, since the transit method is more about size and orbital parameters.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 / 3.

But Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(M_star) = (P^2)/(4π²), so a is proportional to [ (P² M_star) ]^(1/3).

Wait, the exact formula is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) ) a³. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, M + m ≈ M. So P² ≈ (4π²/(G M)) a³.

So a³ ∝ P² M. Therefore, a = [ (P² M) ]^(1/3).

So for a given period P and star mass M, a increases with M^{1/3} P^{2/3}.

But in our case, the two planets have different periods and different M.

Planet_1 has P1 = P2 /3. Its host star has M1 = 2 M2.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

Wait, for Planet_1: a1 = [ (P1^2 * M1) / (4π²) ]^(1/3) ?

Alternatively, a is proportional to (P² M)^(1/3).

So a1 ∝ ( (P2/3)^2 * 2 M2 ) )^(1/3) = ( (P2² * 2 M2 ) / 9 ) )^(1/3) = ( (2/9) )^(1/3) * (P2² M2 )^(1/3 )

a2 ∝ (P2² M2)^(1/3 )

So a1/a2 = [ (2/9)^(1/3) ] ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.6.

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, let's compute that more accurately.

(2/9) = 0.2222...

Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6 because 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2.

Now, the transit probability depends on (R_p^2)/(R_s^2 a) ) ? Or (R_s / a) ?

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_s / a) * something.

Wait, let's think about the geometric probability. It's the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits, which is (R_s / a). So for each planet, P_geo = R_s / a.

But wait, no. Wait, the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_s + R_p) / a, but since R_p << R_s, it's approximately R_s / a.

So P_geo1 = R_s1 / a1.

P_geo2 = R_s2 / a2.

But according to the problem, both host stars have the same radii. So R_s1 = R_s2 = R.

So P_geo1 = R / a1.

P_geo2 = R / a2.

So since a1 = 0.6 a2, then P_geo1 = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) )= 1.666... * (R/a2) = 1.666 * P_geo2.

So P_geo1 is about 1.666 times P_geo2.

Wait, but wait, because a1 is smaller than a2, R_s is the same, so R/a1 is larger than R/a2.

So Planet_1 has a higher geometric probability of transiting.

But wait, no, wait: a1 is smaller, so R/a1 is larger.

Yes, that makes sense. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

But also, what about the planet's size (R_p)? The transit depth is (R_p / R_s)^2, but the probability of transit is only about the alignment, which is (R_s / a). So for the probability of transit happening (i.e., whether we can observe it), only the geometric probability matters.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of the transit. So if the alignment is better, the higher probability.

So, if Planet_1 has a higher P_geo, then they should choose to observe Planet_1.

Wait, but the options suggest that either Planet_1 or 2 is preferred, and the probabilities are given as 2.7 times, 1.65 times, etc.

Wait, earlier calculation I had a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So R/(a1) = R/(0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) ) = 5/3 ≈ 1.666 times higher.

So Planet_1's geometric probability is 5/3 ≈ 1.666 times that of Planet_2.

So the probability of transit is higher for Planet_1.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher probability.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

So according to my calculation, Planet_1's probability is about 1.666 times higher than Planet_2's, which is approximately 1.67 times. So option C says 1.65 times, which is close.

Therefore, the researchers chose to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researchers aim to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting, given limited observing time. The transit probability depends on the geometric alignment of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight, which is proportional to \( P_{\text{geo}} = \frac{R_s}{a} \), where \( R_s \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and host stars differ.

### Key Information:
1. **Orbital Periods**: Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), meaning its period is three times shorter than Planet_2's.
2. **Host Star Masses**: The host star of Planet_1 has a mass \( M_1 = 2M_2 \), while the host star of Planet_2 has mass \( M_2 \).
3. **Host Star Radii**: Both stars have the same radius \( R_s \), as stated in the problem.

### Step 1: Relationship Between Semi-Major Axis and Orbital Period
Using Kepler's Third Law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( \left( P^2 M \right)^{1/3} \). For Planet_1:
\[
a_1 \propto \left( \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \cdot 2M_2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2P_2^2 M_2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]
For Planet_2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left( P_2^2 M_2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]
Dividing \( a_1 \) by \( a_2 \):
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6.
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The geometric transit probability is \( P_{\text{geo}} = \frac{R_s}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius \( R_s \), the transit probabilities are inversely proportional to the semi-major axes:
\[
\frac{P_{\text{geo,1}}}{P_{\text{geo,2}}} = \frac{\frac{R_s}{a_1}}{\frac{R_s}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
\]
This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a higher transit probability. Among the options provided, the closest match is **1.65 times higher probability**, corresponding to Option C.
