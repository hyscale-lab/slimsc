Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The setup is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and it's smaller than R, so the conductor is hollow but not in a way that the cavity touches the conductor's outer shell. Got it.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P, which is outside the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L, and the distance from the center of the cavity to point P is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. So I need to find the electric field at point P due to the charge +q inside the cavity. Wait, but the conductor itself was initially uncharged. So how does that affect things?

I remember that when you place a charge inside a conducting cavity, the conductor's inner and outer surfaces get induced charges. But wait, the conductor was uncharged to start with. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. Let me think. The inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) must have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside the cavity. So if +q is in the cavity, the inner surface has -q. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface is -q, so the outer is +q to make the total zero.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface's induced charge is -q (because it's induced by +q). Then the outer surface must have +q to balance that, because the conductor is neutral. So the outer surface's charge is +q. But wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the charge comes from somewhere? Or maybe the charge comes from the conductor's own electrons moving. Oh right, the conductor has free electrons, so if you put a positive charge inside, electrons from the conductor's material move to the inner surface, leaving the outer surface positively charged.

So now, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. But wait, the conductor's initial charge was zero, so the net charge is zero. Wait, no: the inner surface has -q, the outer surface has +q, so the total is zero. That makes sense.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So how does the electric field at P look? I remember that for a spherical conductor with charge on the outside, the electric field outside is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for point P, the field would be due to the +q on the outer surface. But wait, the outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so any point outside would see the charge as if it's a point charge at the center.

But wait, the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, which is not at the center. The conductor's inner surface is induced with -q, and the outer surface is +q. So for the outer surface, it's a uniformly distributed charge, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform only if the inner charge distribution is symmetric. But in this case, the cavity is not at the center; it's shifted by a distance s from the center. So the inner surface of the conductor has an induced charge distribution that's not uniform.

Wait, that might complicate things. So the inner surface of the conductor has a non-uniform charge distribution because the cavity is not centered. But the outer surface's charge distribution must be uniform, because the conductor itself is a sphere, so even if the inner charge is asymmetric, the outer induced charge would arrange itself symmetrically. Hmm, is that right? Or would the outer surface also have an asymmetric distribution?

Wait, no. If the charge inside the cavity is off-center, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge arrangement that's asymmetric. But the conductor's outer surface is a shell, and the charges on it will move to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. Because the conductor is a sphere, any excess charge on the outer surface will distribute itself uniformly. Because the electric field inside the conductor's material must be zero, and any external fields would cause charges to redistribute. So the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution, regardless of the inner charge's position. So the outer surface's charge is +q, uniformly distributed.

So when calculating the electric field at point P outside the conductor, it's as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. That's because when you're outside a uniformly charged spherical shell, the field is as if all the charge is at the center.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has charge +q, so the field outside is (1/(4piε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center to point P.

But wait, the options don't all have L². Let me look at the options.

Option B is (1/(4piε₀)) q / L². Option D is q/(4piε₀ l²). Hmm.

Wait, but wait. The charge +q is in the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field outside is due to that +q on the outer surface. So at point P, which is outside, the field is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So the distance is L, which is from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but wait. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the charge in the cavity is at a distance s from the center, and point P is at a distance l from the cavity center, with an angle theta between l and s.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. The conductor's center is at point O, the cavity's center is at point O', which is a distance s from O. The charge q is inside the cavity, which is centered at O'.

Point P is a point outside the conductor, a distance L from O, and a distance l from O', with the angle between l and s being theta. So O, O', and P form a triangle, with sides s, l, and L. The angle at O' is theta between O'P (length l) and O'O (length s).

Wait, but for the field at P, it's due to the charge on the conductor's outer surface, which is uniformly distributed. So the field would be as if the charge is at O, the center of the conductor.

But wait, is that correct? Because the charge on the outer surface is uniformly distributed, so the field outside would be as if all the charge is at the center. So regardless of where the inner charge is located, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, so the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center.

So the field at P would be E = (1/(4piε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

But wait, let me think again. The charge +q is in the cavity, which is off-center. The conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q, uniformly distributed. So the field at P is due to that +q, located at the center of the conductor. So E = (1/(4piε₀)) q / L², which is option B.

But wait, what about the charge's position inside the cavity? If the charge is off-center, does that affect the field outside? No, because the conductor's outer surface charge is symmetric, so the field outside doesn't know where the charge inside is. It only depends on the total outer charge and the distance from the center.

So the correct answer should be option B: E = (1/(4piε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the answer should be B.

But wait, another thought: the charge inside the cavity is +q, but the outer surface is +q. So the field outside is as if it's a point charge +q at the center. So yes, E is (1/(4piε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but what if the charge inside the cavity is not at the center? Would that affect the field outside? No, because the outer surface is still a uniform sphere of charge, and the field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance.

So I think option B is correct.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is centered at a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor and has a radius $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (closest to the cavity) induces a charge $-q$ to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge $+q$ to balance the total charge of the system. The outer surface charge distributes itself uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity.

For a point $P$ outside the conductor, the electric field is determined by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. By the shell theorem, the field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Thus, the electric field at $P$ depends only on the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$. The field is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option **B**. The position of the charge inside the cavity and the angle $\theta$ do not affect the field outside the conductor because the outer surface charge distribution ensures that the field is determined solely by the total charge and the distance $L$.

**Analysis of Options:**
- **A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $l - s \cos\theta$, which is irrelevant for the field outside the conductor.
- **B**: Correct. The field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$.
- **C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $l + s \cos\theta$, which is not relevant for the field outside the conductor.
- **D**: Incorrect. While the form is similar to the correct expression, it uses $l$ instead of $L$, which is the correct distance to use for the field outside the conductor.

Answer: B
