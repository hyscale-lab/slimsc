Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that name sounds a bit complicated. Let's parse it. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a carbaldehyde group (like a carbonyl attached to a CH2 maybe?), and the other is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl would be a CH2OH connected to a cyclohexane, perhaps?

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Oh, ethynyl is a triple bond, so it's cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond leading to a CH2 group, maybe? Or perhaps the ethynyl is directly attached—like cyclohexane-C≡CH.

I need to figure out the reaction steps to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's think about the functional groups involved. The target has a hydroxyl group (from hydroxy), a carbonyl (aldehyde group), and a cyclohexyl substituent. So the starting material, ethynylcyclohexane, has a triple bond. Maybe I'll need to perform some hydrogenation or oxidation steps.

Looking at the options, each option lists a series of reagents. Let me consider each step one by one.

First, ethynylcyclohexane likely undergoes some kind of addition to introduce functional groups. The triple bond is a good site for reactions like hydroamination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated or epoxidized, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: maybe we need to introduce a ketone or an aldehyde group. Oh, wait, the target has an aldehyde group. How can I introduce that from a triple bond? One method is to perform a hydration of the triple bond. But wait, the aldehyde group comes from an oxidation step. Alternatively, if we have a ketone, we can reduce it to an aldehyde, but that might not fit here.

Wait, another thought: If we have ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps we can first add a methyl group. Or maybe perform a substitution. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, the first reagent in all is something with NaNH2. Sodium amide, which is a strong base. It's often used in deprotonation reactions, like in the formation of Grignard reagents or in amide synthesis. Maybe it's used here for elimination or deprotonation.

The second step in all options varies. Option A uses H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. Option B uses Li/liquid NH3, which is a strong base used in reductions, like in Birch reductions or for deprotonating. Option C uses H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, another hydrogenation catalyst. Option D uses Li/liquid NH3 again.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane could undergo deprotonation at the triple bond. In the presence of NaNH2, a strong base, perhaps the alkyne deprotonates. Wait, but acetylenes are generally not very acidic. Hmm, but maybe ethynylcyclohexane is less acidic than say, an aromatic ring. Wait, wait, maybe the first step is to add a methyl group via a substitution? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the first step is to form an alkyne into a diol or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydroamination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to perform a hydrohalogenation of the triple bond to install a functional group. Wait, but NaNH2 and methyl chloride: that's a common method for alkylation. So maybe the first step is a deprotonation to form a strong base, which then reacts with methyl chloride.

Wait, so NaNH2 is a strong base, and methyl chloride is a methylating agent. Oh wait, but the alkyne is in ethynylcyclohexane. If NaNH2 abstracts a proton from the alkyne, generating a strong base (like an acetylide), which can then react with methyl chloride (CH3Cl) in an alkylation.

So step 1: NaNH2 deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with CH3Cl to add a methyl group. So the triple bond becomes CH2CH2? No, wait, the alkyne would have a substitution. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes something else.

Wait, the structure after step 1 would be CH2CH2? No, wait, perhaps the acetylide attacks CH3Cl, adding a methyl group. So the triple bond becomes a CH2CH3 group. Wait, but that depends on where the substitution occurs. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane derivative?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. Deprotonating the alkyne (with NaNH2) would generate a cyclohexylacetylide (cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C- ? Wait, no. The structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Deprotonating the terminal H would give cyclohexane-C≡C⁻Na+. Then, adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl): the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, giving cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, that's not possible because methyl chloride is CH3Cl. The acetylide would attack as a nucleophile, leading to CH3-C≡C-cyclohexane. So after step 1, the alkyne becomes a propyne? Wait, no, adding a methyl group to the alkyne.

Wait, maybe the product after step 1 is 1-methylcyclohexyl-1-ylcyclopropane? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try drawing this mentally.

Original structure: cyclohexane with a triple bond attached as -C≡CH. Deprotonation with NaNH2 gives cyclohexane-C≡C⁻ Na⁺. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react with the acetylide to form cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So that's a substitution of H with CH3 on the triple bond. So the triple bond becomes internal.

So after step 1, we have 1-methylcyclohexylcyclopropane? No, wait, the compound would be 1-methylcyclohexenylacetylene, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution of the H on the triple bond with a methyl group, making the triple bond now between two carbons, each attached to the cyclohexane and methyl respectively.

Wait, perhaps the structure after step 1 is cyclohexane-C≡C-CH3. So an internal alkyne.

Then, step 2 varies in each option. Let's look at the options.

Option A: step 2 is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation. So the alkyne would become a single bond. So cyclohexane-C-C-CH3, but that's a single bond. So it would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of an internal alkyne (C≡C) would add two hydrogens, making it a single bond. So cyclohexane-C-CH2-CH3? Wait, perhaps it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, because the alkyne was CH2-C≡C-CH3. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, if the alkyne is CH2-C≡C-CH2- (but for cyclohexane it's attached differently). Alternatively, if the triple bond is between two cyclohexane groups, but that's not the case. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the molecule is 1-pentyne or something, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about another approach.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule is formed via a ring-opening or a Grignard reaction. Alternatively, the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps the steps involve installing both groups.

Another idea: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)CH2CHO. Wait, no, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1 which is a CH(OH)CH2 group attached to another cyclohexane, and also a carbonyl group (aldehyde) on the same carbon? Or maybe the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a CH2CHO (carbaldehyde) and the other is a CH2OH (hydroxymethyl) group, both attached to the same carbon? Or perhaps the substituents are on adjacent positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed by adding a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde group to the cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves the following steps:

1. Add a methyl group to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Oxidize the single bond to a carbonyl (like a ketone), then reduce it to an aldehyde.

But wait, how?

Alternatively, another approach: The target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to an aldehyde. But wait, aldehydes are more oxidized than ketones, so that's not straightforward.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule might be synthesized via a cyclopropane intermediate. Because with ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps forming a cyclopropane via alkyne dimerization, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that's probably not part of the initial steps.

Let me try to think about each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: as discussed, makes the triple bond into a CH2CH3 group? Or adds a methyl.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond. So the internal alkyne becomes a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Ba(OH)2: that's a strong base, maybe for elimination or epoxidation. But Ba(OH)2 is used in elimination reactions, like the formation of alkenes from diols (like in the preparation of epoxides, but no, Ba(OH)2 is more about elimination).

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is often used in the oxidation of alcohols or for elimination. Wait, maybe it's used to form a carbonyl group from a diol? Or perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's more with Li and NH3.

Wait, another possibility: Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes. For example, a secondary alcohol would oxidize to a ketone. But I thought that's more HNO3 or CrO3 in acidic conditions.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's check the next step in option A: step 3 is Ba(OH)2, and step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. H2SO4 and HgSO4 with H2O looks like an oxidation, maybe for the oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, but I'm not remembering correctly.

Wait, HgSO4 in H2SO4 is used in the Jones oxidation, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones. So maybe step 3 is something else.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2 for a different purpose, like elimination.

Wait, perhaps the target has a hydroxyl group, so maybe after hydrogenation, we have an alcohol that needs to be oxidized.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is for epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

Option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: So, similar to option A, but with ethyl instead of methyl. So the triple bond would add an ethyl group.

2. Li/liquid NH3: That's a strong reducing agent. It's used for Birch reductions, where aromatic rings are reduced to diols, but in aliphatic compounds, it might reduce triple bonds or epoxides. Alternatively, it's used in the formation of Grignard reagents, but wait, NaNH2 and Li/NH3 are different.

Wait, step 2 in option B is Li/liquid NH3. That's a strong base and a good reducing agent. It can also promote elimination reactions. So perhaps after adding an ethyl group, the alkyne is treated with Li/NH3 to induce some reaction. Maybe a reduction of the triple bond to a single bond, but that's usually done with H2 and a catalyst.

Alternatively, Li/NH3 is used in the deprotonation of compounds to form carbanions, which can then attack electrophiles.

Wait, but if the alkyne is converted to a trans-alkene via some reaction, but I'm not certain.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: same as before, adds a methyl.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: that's another hydrogenation catalyst. So the alkyne becomes a single bond.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozone followed by workup with (CH3)2S (a reductive workup) would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. So if the molecule is hydrogenated to a single bond, that's not a double bond. Wait, hydrogenation of the alkyne would make a single bond, not a double bond. So perhaps step 2 doesn't hydrogenate the alkyne but something else. Wait, no—H2/Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, not double bonds.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if step 1 makes an internal alkyne, and step 2 hydrogenates it to a single bond, then step 3, which is ozonolysis, wouldn't have a double bond to cleave. So maybe option C isn't the right path.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: So, the alkyne is treated with a strong base and methanol. Hmm, that could be a substitution. The acetylide ion could react with methanol to form an ethyl ether, but wait, methanol is a good nucleophile. So the NaNH2 would deprotonate the alkyne, forming an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol to form a substitution product. So the triple bond would become CH2-OCH3? Hmm, but then after that, step 2 is Li/liquid NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe that would induce some elimination to form a double bond?

Wait, but then step 3 would be O3 and (CH3)2S. So, if after step 2 we have a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups. Then step 4, NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent or a source of NH4+ for workup.

Hmm, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule again. It has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So, perhaps the synthesis involves installing both groups.

Another approach: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a diol via some reaction, then the diol is oxidized to a carbonyl.

Wait, but how? Let's think about possible reagents.

If the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-diol (but that's more via catalytic hydrogenation with a specific catalyst, like Raney Ni and pressure, but I'm not sure).

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne undergoes hydroboration to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the alkyne is converted to an enol ether, which is then cleaved.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me try to outline the steps needed.

Starting from ethynylcyclohexane, we need to form a molecule with a cyclohexane ring, a CH2CHO group, and a CH2OH group attached.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has a CH2CHO group and a CH2OH group attached to the same carbon (position 1). So, the substitution is on the same carbon, which suggests that perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol or a geminal diol, which is then oxidized and reduced in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-diol, then modified.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Let's think about what each option's reagents do.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, the alkyne is deprotonated, and then reacts with methanol. So, the product would have OCH3 attached to the alkyne. So, the triple bond becomes CH2-OCH3? Or perhaps it's an ether formation. Wait, in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, the acetylide would form, which would then react with methanol to form a methyl ether. So, the product would be cyclohexane-OCH2-C≡C-CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted to a methyl ether. So, after step 1, the triple bond becomes a CH2-OCH3 group. Then, step 2 is Li/liquid NH3. That's a strong base and a good reducing agent. Maybe it reduces the triple bond to a single bond, but that would require H2. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for elimination.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base like Li/NH3, maybe the ether is cleaved or some elimination occurs, forming an alkene. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would break the double bond into carbonyls.

Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent or used for workup.

But I'm not sure if this leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the target's aldehyde comes from an oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the hydroxymethyl comes from another oxidation or reduction.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which is an aldehyde attached directly to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to an aldehyde.

Wait, but ketones can't be directly reduced to aldehydes without over-reducing; usually they go to secondary alcohols. Wait, unless using a specific reducing agent that stops at the aldehyde. I don't think that's common, though.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the alkyne is first converted to a carbonyl via a hydration reaction. Hydration of an alkyne can form a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on the conditions. For example, under acidic conditions (like HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O), an alkyne can be hydrated to a ketone. If it's a terminal alkyne, it could form an aldehyde, but I think that's more for internal alkynes.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a terminal alkyne (cyclohexane-C≡CH). Hydration of a terminal alkyne under acidic conditions would typically form a ketone, but wait, that would require a catalyst like HgSO4 in H2SO4 and H2O. So, maybe that's one of the steps.

Looking back at the options, option A's step 3 is Ba(OH)2, and step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Wait, that seems like oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps the HgSO4 is used for oxidation.

Wait, maybe the steps are as follows:

- First, add a methyl group to the triple bond (using NaNH2 and CH3Cl).

- Then, hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond (using H2/Pd), giving a longer chain.

- Then, oxidize the alcohol (if any) to a ketone (using Ba(OH)2?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is for elimination, forming a double bond, which is then oxidized.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering each option's reagents and see which leads to the target.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: makes a methyl ether.

2. Li/NH3: perhaps cleaves the ether or induces elimination.

3. Ozonolysis: cleaves a double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: workup.

So, let's imagine:

After step 1: cyclohexane-OCH2-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted to CH2-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the triple bond becomes CH2-OCH3.

Then step 2: Li/NH3, which is a strong base. Maybe it deprotonates something, leading to an elimination, forming a double bond. So, CH2-OCH3 would become CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, probably not. Alternatively, maybe the Li/NH3 reduces the triple bond to a single bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Li/NH3 is used for deprotonation and forms a carbanion, which could attack an electrophilic site.

Alternatively, perhaps the ether is cleaved, but I don't see how.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group and a carbaldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclopropane ring, then opening it to form the necessary groups. Like a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's more UV light and not using the given reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, then oxidized to form a ketone, which is then reduced to an aldehyde.

Wait, but how to get the diol from the alkyne.

Another approach: think about each step's effect.

Looking at option D, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if after step 2, we have a double bond, ozonolysis would break it.

So, perhaps the reaction steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2, then methylate to form a substituted alkyne.

2. Then, hydrogenation with H2/Pd to make the triple bond into a single bond.

Wait, but that wouldn't form a double bond. Unless step 2 is a hydrogenation that stops at the double bond, but that's usually done with a poisoned catalyst like Lindlar's catalyst, which would give cis addition.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a hydrogenation catalyst. So, if the alkyne is hydrogenated, it becomes a single bond. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which needs a double bond, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the target molecule again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a CH2CHO and a CH2OH group. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol, then oxidized to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but how to get a diol from an alkyne. One way is hydroboration, but that usually applies to alkynes. Alternatively, using a dihydroxylation reaction, like with Ozone or OsO4, but that's for alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then dihydroxylated to form a diol, which can then be oxidized or reduced.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether, then cleaved, but that seems a stretch.

Wait, another idea. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group. That suggests perhaps a Grignard reaction to add a hydroxyl group. But to form a hydroxymethyl group, perhaps the Grignard is added twice.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to some kind of enolate formation and alkylation.

But perhaps I should look for the presence of Ba(OH)2 in the options. Ba(OH)2 is used for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. For example, a secondary alcohol would oxidize to a ketone. So if a step uses Ba(OH)2, maybe it's an oxidation step.

Looking at option A: step 3 is Ba(OH)2. So, after step 2, perhaps we have a secondary alcohol, which is oxidized to a ketone. Then, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which is the Jones oxidation conditions, which would oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones. But if after step 3, we have a ketone, step 4 might not change it.

Alternatively, maybe step 4 is a workup after some oxidation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and MeOH → forms an OMe group on the alkyne.

Step 2: Li/NH3 → possibly deprotonates to form a carbanion or induces elimination.

Suppose step 2 leads to the formation of an alkene via elimination. Then, step 3, ozonolysis, would break the double bond into two carbonyls. Then, step 4, NH4OH, which is a mild reductant, perhaps for the workup, but I'm not sure.

But does that lead to the target?

If the alkyne becomes an alkene after step 2, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But I'm not sure how that would form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl group.

Alternative approach: The target has a cyclohexane with a CH2CHO and a CH2OH. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a CH2CHO group, and then another step adds the CH2OH.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a CH2CH2 group, which is then oxidized to a CHO. But that would require a way to make the CH2CH2 into a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to an aldehyde.

Wait, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via hydration.

Wait, another thought: The target has a hydroxymethyl group, which suggests an alcohol that's either introduced via substitution or via oxidation from a primary alcohol.

So, perhaps the alkyne is first substituted to add a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that would happen.

Another angle: looking for the presence of an aldehyde in the target, perhaps the steps involve oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde. But primary alcohols are usually oxidized to carboxylic acids under strong oxidizing conditions, unless using a controlled oxidation like with CrO3 in a specific solvent.

Wait, but in the options, some steps involve HgSO4 and H2SO4 (like option A, step 4), which is Jones oxidation, leading to carboxylic acids from primary alcohols.

But the target has an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, so perhaps a different oxidation pathway.

Wait, maybe the aldehyde is formed via a different method, like oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, which is then reduced to an aldehyde. But that seems convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde comes from a geminal diol, but that's unclear.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, forming a 1-methylcyclohexyl substituted alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation of the alkyne to a single bond, making a cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group? Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the alkyne becomes a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule becomes a cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group, but that's not a functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation leads to a cis-alkene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps after adding methyl group (step 1), hydrogenation (step 2) makes a single bond. Then, another step oxidizes it.

Looking at the options, option C has step 3 as ozonolysis. But if step 2 is hydrogenation, then the molecule would have a single bond, not a double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything.

So perhaps option C is not the right one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Oxidize an alcohol to a ketone.

4. Reduce the ketone to a aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the target's hydroxymethyl group is formed via a Grignard reaction. So after adding a methyl group and hydrogenating, perhaps adding a Grignard reagent would introduce the hydroxymethyl.

But considering the options, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group, then hydrogenating the alkyne, then oxidizing to form an aldehyde, and then adding a hydroxyl group.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Maybe I should go back to the reagents.

Option D's step 4 is NH4OH. That's ammonium hydroxide, which is a mild acid and can be used in the workup after ozonolysis. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S as a reductant would break the ozonides into aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure.

So, if after step 3 we have an ozonolysis that produces an aldehyde and a ketone, then step 4 would be a simple workup to isolate the aldehyde.

But how would the alkyne get converted into a diene or something that, upon ozonolysis, gives the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is transformed into a diene via some steps, which upon ozonolysis gives the required groups.

Hmm, perhaps option D is the correct one.

Let me outline the steps for option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: forms a methyl ether on the alkyne, giving cyclohexane-OCH2-C≡C-CH3.

2. Li/NH3: induces elimination, perhaps converting the alkyne into a trans-alkene. So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH3 → cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, elimination would form a double bond. So after elimination, perhaps we have a double bond between the cyclohexane and the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 removes a proton, leading to a triple bond converting into a trans-alkene.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe Li/NH3 would deprotonate and form a carbanion, which could attack another part of the molecule, leading to a ring formation or an elimination. Alternatively, it might hydrogenate the alkyne, but I thought Li/NH3 isn't typically used for hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a trans-alkene via a deprotonation and elimination. So the alkyne becomes a double bond.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which breaks the double bond into carbonyl groups. So if the alkene is between the cyclohexane and a CH2 group, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls.

Wait, but the target has a CH2OH and a CH2CHO group. So perhaps ozonolysis produces those groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add methyl group to alkyne.

2. Convert alkyne into a double bond via elimination.

3. Ozonolyze to form aldehyde and ketone.

4. Reduce the ketone to an aldehyde.

But I don't see a reduction step in option D after ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis, and the hydroxymethyl comes from another step.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's possible outcome.

Option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: forms an ethyl-substituted alkyne.

2. Li/NH3: perhaps reduces the alkyne to an alkane or induces some reaction.

3. O3 and H2O: ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH: workup.

If after step 2, the alkyne is reduced to a single bond, then ozonolysis wouldn't have anything to cleave. So that's not right.

Option C:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: adds methyl.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenates alkyne to single bond.

3. O3 and (CH3)2S: ozonolysis, but no double bond, so nothing happens. So this can't be right.

Option A:

1. Add methyl.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps oxidize an alcohol to ketone.

4. Jones oxidation: oxidize primary alcohol to acid.

But target has aldehyde, not acid.

Hmm.

Option D:

1. Add OMe group.

2. Maybe elimination to form double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to make carbonyls.

4. NH4OH for workup.

So, perhaps after step 3, we have two carbonyl groups.

The target has CH2CHO and CH2OH. So, perhaps one of the carbonyls is a ketone, which is then reduced to CH2OH, but I don't see a reducing agent in the steps.

Wait, another thought: the hydroxymethyl group could come from a Grignard reaction. So, after forming an aldehyde via ozonolysis, adding a Grignard reagent would form an alcohol.

But in the options, the steps don't include Grignard reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl is formed via oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, then reduction of the ketone to a secondary alcohol again. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

But I'm not confident.

Another angle: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to adjacent carbons. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a methyl group to the alkyne, hydrogenating it to a single bond, then introducing the hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration (using HgSO4, H2SO4, H2O). Then, the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol. Then, somehow, the secondary alcohol is converted into a hydroxymethyl group and the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, thinking about option D again.

After step 1: OMe group added.

Step 2: Li/NH3 → maybe elimination to form a double bond.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps the structure after step 2 is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-OMe with a double bond? No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after step 2 is cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-OMe with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups.

Then, ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyls. The cyclohexane would have a CHO group on one end and another carbonyl group, perhaps a ketone.

Then, step 4: NH4OH. Maybe that's used to reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol, which could then be further oxidized or something.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cleavage from ozonolysis gives an aldehyde and a ketone, and then the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, which becomes the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck, but I'll make an educated guess. The target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. To form an aldehyde, perhaps an oxidation is needed, but to form a hydroxymethyl, maybe a reduction from a ketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the steps are:

1. Add methyl group to alkyne.

2. Hydrogenate alkyne to single bond, introducing a CH2CH3 group.

3. Oxidize a secondary alcohol to a ketone.

4. Reduce the ketone to an aldehyde (but how?).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

After step 1, we have a methyl ether. Step 2: Li/NH3 could induce elimination, forming a double bond adjacent to the ether. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. One would be an aldehyde, and the other a ketone. Then, step 4, NH4OH could be for workup, perhaps protonating the carbonyls.

But I'm not seeing the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from a Grignard reaction, but that's not part of the steps.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Step 1: Add methyl group → internal alkyne.

Step 2: Hydrogenate triple bond to single bond → longer chain.

Step 3: Ozonolysis → forms carbonyls.

But without a double bond, this wouldn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, but H2/Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, not a double bond. To get a double bond, you need a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, which gives cis addition.

But Lindlar's isn't in the options. So perhaps option D is the right one.

After a lot of thinking, I think option D is the correct answer.

The problem involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) and a carbaldehyde group (-CH2CHO) attached to adjacent carbons. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group, converting the terminal alkyne into an internal alkyne.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the internal alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer chain.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: Likely used for oxidation or elimination, but the exact role is unclear.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Jones oxidation conditions, which oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones. However, the target molecule has an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, making this option less likely.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Similar to Option A, but adds an ethyl group instead of a methyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong reducing agent, possibly used for elimination or reduction. However, it is unclear how this step contributes to forming the target molecule.
3. **O3/ H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but no double bond is present at this stage.
4. **NH4OH**: Likely used for workup, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Adds a methyl group to the alkyne.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond.
3. **O3/ (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the alkyne has already been hydrogenated to a single bond, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: Oxidation or elimination, but the sequence does not align with the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which reacts with methanol to form a methyl ether.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base that could induce elimination, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O3/ (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups, which could form the aldehyde and ketone precursors.
4. **NH4OH**: Likely used for workup, ensuring the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups are present in the final product.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the most plausible sequence of steps to synthesize the target molecule. The addition of a methyl ether, followed by elimination to form a double bond, ozonolysis to cleave it into carbonyl groups, and final workup align with the functional groups present in the target molecule.
