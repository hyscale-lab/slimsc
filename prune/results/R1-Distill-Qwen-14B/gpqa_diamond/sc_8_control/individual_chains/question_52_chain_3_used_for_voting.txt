Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to recall some basic concepts about stellar atmospheres and the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of different energy levels in atoms.

From what I remember, the Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the levels, E2 and E1 are their energies, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is n1/n2, because the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 increases, meaning n2/n1 decreases. So the ratio (n1/n2) increases when the star has spots. So when finding the factor, it's (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. So what's the Teff doing here? The effective temperature we usually talk about is the star's total emission, but in the photosphere, each region (spot-free or spotted) has its own temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So the star's integrated emission is lower, but each spot must be cooler than the surrounding. Wait, dark spots are cooler regions, so when the spots are present, the star's overall temperature is lower.

Wait, but how does that affect the photospheric temperature in different regions? Hmm, perhaps when the spots are present, the unspotted regions are at a higher temperature than the spots. But in this problem, the overall Teff is given as 5500 K when 40% is covered. So perhaps the unspotted regions are hotter than 5500 K.

But wait, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. So maybe the temperatures of the spotted and unspotted regions are being considered, but the overall Teff is an average. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things by considering the effective temperature as the temperature of the photosphere overall, meaning that when spots are present, the entire photosphere's temperature is 5500 K. But that doesn't make much sense because dark spots are cooler, but the surrounding areas would be hotter.

Wait, maybe I should think about this. Let's model the star as having two regions: spots at a lower temperature T_spot and the rest of the surface at T_unspot. The total effective temperature is given as 5500 K when 40% is spotted. But wait, the effective temperature is a sort of average based on the total luminosity.

The luminosity of a star is given by L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But when part of the surface is cooler, the total luminosity would be the sum of the luminosity from the spotted and unspotted areas.

So, let's say the star has radius R. The total area is 4πR². 40% (0.4) is covered by spots, so 0.4 * 4πR² is the spotted area, and 0.6 * 4πR² is unspotted.

The total luminosity L_total would be L_spots + L_unspots.

L_spots = 0.4 * 4πR² * σ * T_spot^4

L_unspots = 0.6 * 4πR² * σ * T_unspot^4

So L_total = 4πR² σ (0.4 T_spot^4 + 0.6 T_unspot^4 )

The overall Teff when spots are present is 5500 K. So,

L_total = 4πR² σ (5500)^4

Divide both sides by 4πR² σ:

0.4 T_spot^4 + 0.6 T_unspot^4 = (5500)^4

But when the star isn't spotted (no spots), the entire surface is at 6000 K. So the original Teff is 6000 K, which would mean that without spots, the surface is all 6000 K.

So, the question is, what is T_spot and T_unspot when the overall Teff is 5500 K with 40% spots?

Wait, but perhaps the problem is simplifying by taking that the effective temperature refers to the average of the two regions. But that approach might not be accurate because the effective temperature is more about the integrated flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when spots are present, the entire photosphere's temperature is 5500 K, but that can't be right because the spots are cooler and the surrounding areas are hotter. So perhaps the correct approach is to find T_spot and T_unspot such that the total luminosity corresponds to an effective temperature of 5500 K.

So let's set up the equation:

0.4 * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * T_unspot^4 = (5500)^4.

But without spots, the entire surface is 6000 K, so:

(6000)^4 = (all area) -> that's the original case.

Wait, but when spots are present, the total flux is a mix of the two regions. So we can write:

(0.4 * T_spot^4 + 0.6 * T_unspot^4) = (5500)^4.

But we can't solve for both T_spot and T_unspot without another equation. So perhaps we can make an assumption. Wait, maybe the unspotted regions have the same temperature as the original Teff of 6000 K? Because when the spots are present, the unspotted regions can't be hotter than 6000 K, because that would require some other heating. Alternatively, maybe the unspotted regions are at a higher temperature than 6000 K, but that seems unlikely. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the rest 60% is at a higher temperature, such that the average is 5500 K. But without knowing the actual temperatures of the spots and unspots, it's challenging.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about the average but about the effective temperature of the entire photosphere, but that's not how it works. Because the effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity and radius.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using Teff as the temperature of the photosphere when spots are present. But that doesn't make much sense because the photosphere would have varying temperatures. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. So perhaps each region (spot and unspot) has its own temperature, but the observed effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered. But how does that affect the ratio?

Wait, another approach. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels depends on the temperature. When the effective temperature is lower (5500 K), the ratio would change. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be accurate, but perhaps that's the assumption for this problem.

Wait, but then what happens to the ratio? The Boltzmann factor would change based on temperature. So the ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the exponent increases because E2-E1 is positive (since level 2 is higher energy than level 1), and T is in the denominator.

Wait, but let's be precise. The ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, leading to a larger value of n1/n2, because the exponential is larger.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio of n1/n2 decreases. Oh wait, no: the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spots are present, n1/n2 is lower than when there are no spots. 

Wait, wait. Let me think again. With spots, the Teff is lower. If the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K, then the ratio (n1/n2) would be higher than when it was 6000 K, because when T is lower, (E2-E1) is positive, so the exponent is bigger, so the exponential is bigger, so n1/n2 is bigger.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower Teff), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Wait, that contradicts what I thought. So that suggests that when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. But according to the Boltzmann equation, that would only happen if the energy difference E2-E1 is negative, which would imply that level 2 is lower than level 1, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, no. Let me get the ratio correct. The Boltzmann factor is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So if ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so (n2/n1) decreases. So n2/n1 is smaller when T is lower. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)). So when T decreases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases. So in this case, when the star has spots and T_eff decreases, the ratio n1/n2 would increase. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Hmm, this suggests a contradiction. Maybe I have the ratio wrong. Let me write the equation again.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2 / n1) = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Let me call E2 > E1, so (E2 - E1) is positive.

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so (n2/n1) increases. So when T decreases, (n2/n1) decreases.

So n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponential increases, so n1/n2 increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So this would imply that when the star has spots, the temperature is higher. But in the problem, when spots are present, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) than when there are no spots (6000 K). So according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 would increase when T decreases, but the problem says it decreases. So this is a contradiction. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the spots are causing the observed ratio to change because the spots are cooler. So the unspotted regions are hotter, and the spots are cooler. But how does this affect the overall ratio of Ti in the photosphere?

Wait, maybe the absorption lines we observe are coming from the unspotted regions. Because when a star has spots, the unspotted regions are hotter, so the photosphere is brighter in certain regions. So when you look at the spectrum, you might be seeing the hotter regions, which are 60% of the surface. Or perhaps the cooler spots emit less, so their contribution to the spectrum is less. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when spots are present, the average temperature of the photosphere is lower, so the ionization balance changes. But the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels depends on the local temperature. So if the average temperature is lower, the ratio would change accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the photosphere's temperature is lower when spots are present, so T drops to 5500 K. Then, according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio (n1/n2) would be higher when T is lower. But the problem states that the ratio decreases, which would imply that when T is lower, the ratio is lower. So this doesn't make sense unless the energy levels are inverted.

Wait, perhaps the transition is such that level 1 is higher than level 2. If E2 < E1, then (E2-E1) is negative. Then, (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( (E1-E2)/(k T) )

Then, when T decreases, the exponent becomes smaller, so (n2/n1) increases. Wait, no: if E1 > E2, then (E2-E1) is negative, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative.

So (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(positive number)/T )? No, wait. Let me correct:

If E2 < E1, then (E2-E1) = -ΔE, where ΔE is positive. So (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So when T decreases, the exponent increases, so (n2/n1) increases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative, so the exponential term becomes smaller. So n1/n2 would decrease if T decreases, which matches the problem statement. So perhaps E2 < E1.

Wait, that makes sense. So if level 1 is a higher energy level than level 2, then E2 - E1 is negative. So when the temperature decreases, the ratio n1/n2 would decrease.

So let me recast the equation correctly.

Let me define:

n1: number of atoms in level 1 (higher energy, E1)

n2: number of atoms in level 2 (lower energy, E2 < E1)

So E2 - E1 = -ΔE, where ΔE is positive.

The Boltzmann equation is:

(n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So when T decreases, ΔE/(k T) increases (since T is in denominator), so the exponential increases, so (n2/n1) increases. Therefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would decrease.

Yes, that's correct. So when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases. Which is what the problem states: the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

So now, the ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), since E2 < E1.

So for the original case (no spots) T1 = 6000 K. When there are spots, the effective temperature is T2 = 5500 K.

So the ratio without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

With spots, R2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

But wait, no, wait. Because (E2-E1) is negative, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative. So R1 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio R1/R2 = exp( [ ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But what's ΔE? Well, the transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the near ultraviolet. The energy difference can be found using the relation E = hc/λ.

So, E = hc/λ

h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. So ΔE = hc / λ.

Let me compute ΔE in terms of k*T, so that the exponent can be expressed in terms of T.

Compute (ΔE)/(k) = (hc)/(k λ) 

Let me compute this.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So,

ΔE/(k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.38 * 1.448 = approx 1.998e-30 J·m? Wait, let me compute:

Wait, 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = (1.38 * 1.448) * 1e-30 = approx 1.998e-30.

So numerator is 1.9878e-25.

So ratio is 1.9878e-25 / 1.998e-30 ≈ 1e5.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 1.998e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.998) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1e5.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, that's a very large number. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

k λ = 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 m = 1.38e-23 *1.448e-7 = 1.38 * 1.448 = approx 1.998e-30 J·m?

Wait, no. Units:

h (J·s) * c (m/s) = J·m.

k (J/K) * λ (m) = J·m / K.

So ΔE/(k) has units of K.

So, (ΔE)/(k) = (h c) / (k λ) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 1.448e-7 m )

Wait, wait, (k λ) = 1.38e-23 J/K * 1.448e-7 m = 1.38 *1.448e-30 J·m/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / ( (1.38e-23 J·m ) / K ) )

Which is (1.9878e-25 ) / (1.38e-23 ) * K.

Compute 1.9878e-25 / 1.38e-23 = (1.9878 / 1.38) * 1e-2 = approx 1.44 * 0.01 = 0.0144.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 0.0144 K? That can't be right because 0.0144 K is way too small.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me compute it more carefully.

Compute denominator: k * λ = (1.380649e-23 J/K) * (1.448e-7 m) = 

1.380649e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.380649 * 1.448 = approx 1.997e-30 J·m/K.

Numerator: h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.997e-30) ) = (1.9878 / 1.997) * 1e5 ≈ (approx 1) * 1e5 = 1e5 K.

Ah, that's right. So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So, the exponent in R1/R2 is ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So, 1e5 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818

1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667

Difference: 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151

Multiply by 1e5 K: 0.0000151 * 1e5 = 1.51.

So the exponent is approximately 1.51.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.51) ≈ e^1.51.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817. e^1.51 is approx 4.52.

So the factor is about 4.5. So the ratio when there are no spots is about 4.5 times the ratio when there are spots.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K). The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Boltzmann Equation**:  
   The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:  
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right)
   \]  
   Here, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. Since \(E_2 < E_1\), the energy difference is negative, and the ratio \(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\) decreases as \(T\) decreases.

2. **Energy Difference**:  
   The energy difference \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) can be calculated using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\).  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Converting to units of \(kT\):  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.38 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 10^4 \, \text{K}
   \]

3. **Temperature Dependence**:  
   The ratio \(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\) depends on the temperature \(T\). When the star has no spots (\(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\)) and when it has spots (\(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\)), the factor by which the ratio changes is:  
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right)
   \]  
   Substituting \(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx 10^4 \, \text{K}\), \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(10^4 \times 0.0000151\right) = \exp(1.51) \approx 4.5
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star transitions from having no spots to having spots.
