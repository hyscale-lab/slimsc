Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving different substances. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, first, I think I need to figure out what each of these substances A, B, C, D, etc., are. Because if I know their identities, I can determine E's structure and then its symmetry.

Let me start by looking at each reaction and see if I can deduce the possible compounds involved.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A is a solid, B is a gas, and C is bright red. What bright red compounds do I know? Maybe something like sulfur or perhaps a metal oxide? Wait, another thought: maybe it's a reaction involving lead dioxide? Oh, wait, or perhaps it's a transition metal forming a red product.

Wait, another possibility: when metals like copper react with something. Wait, but copper(II) oxide is black, not red. What about lead(IV) oxide? I think PbO2 is dark brown, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving vanadium or another transition metal.

Alternatively, let me think about the stoichiometry. A reacting with 8 equivalents of B. So maybe B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2. Because 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of B per mole of A.

If B is O2, then maybe A is a metal reacting with oxygen to form a metal oxide. But what metal oxide is bright red? Let me think, maybe it's Fe2O3? No, that's reddish but more like orange. Alternatively, maybe it's Co3O4 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitrate? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So C is the product of the first reaction, and when it reacts with D (another gas), it forms E.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is in water, it hydrolyzes into A and two acids. So perhaps C is a salt that is a strong oxidizing agent, and when it's in water, it breaks down.

Wait, let's think about what C could be. If C reacts with water to form A, F, and G, and F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. Let's think, what salts upon hydrolysis produce two acids? Maybe a nitrate and something else? Or maybe a sulfate? Wait, but what about something like a sulfite?

Wait, another thought: when a metal oxide reacts with water, if it's basic, it might form a metal hydroxide and then possibly an acid if it's a non-metal oxide. But wait, metals typically form bases, non-metals form acids. So if C is a non-metal oxide, reacting with water would give an acid. But the problem says it forms two different acids and reforms A. So A would have to be a solid, perhaps a metal? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is of a metal with a diatomic gas. Let's think of lead reacting with oxygen. Lead is a solid; oxygen is a gas. They react to form lead dioxide, PbO2, which is a dark brown solid, not bright red. Maybe that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction of vanadium with oxygen. Vanadium(V) oxide is a red crystalline solid. Oh wait, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is orange, but maybe another vanadium oxide is red. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide? No, sulfides are usually black or another color.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a nitrate of some metal. But nitrate salts are often not bright red. Wait, maybe it's a permanganate? No, those are usually dark purple.

Wait, let me think of the reaction where a solid reacts with 8 equivalents of a gas to form a red product. Maybe the gas is chlorine? But 8 equivalents would imply a lot of Cl2. Alternatively, maybe the gas is O2.

Wait, another approach: the product E is extremely hazardous. What could that be? Maybe chlorine gas? But then D would have to be something that reacts with C to produce Cl2. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like phosgene, but that's more from carbonyl reactions. Alternatively, maybe E is a nerve agent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is something like hydrogen cyanide, but that's more from reactions involving nitrates and something else. Alternatively, maybe E is a fluorine compound. Hmm, not sure.

Let me try to approach this systematically. Let's list possible candidates for each substance.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red)

Second reaction: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)

Third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G (F is strong acid, G is weak)

Fourth reaction: D + B → H (1:1 ratio), which is a solvent.

Hmm, for the fourth reaction: D and B in a 1:1 ratio form H, which is a solvent. So if B is a diatomic gas like O2, D could be another diatomic gas, maybe F2? Then H would be OF2, but I'm not sure if that's a solvent. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, then D could be another diatomic gas like F2. Then H would be ClF, but wait, ClF is not a stable compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense.

Wait, but H is a solvent. Water is a solvent, that's possible. So, if B is O2 and D is H2, then 1 mole of D reacts with 1 mole of B to form 2 moles of H2O. But wait, the reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So moles are 2:1. So the ratio is 2:1, but the question says 1:1. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, if B is F2, and D is another diatomic gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is another diatomic gas. Wait, another possibility: B is O2, D is another gas that, when combined in 1:1, forms a solvent. For example, if D is H2O (but it's a liquid), but in the problem, D is a gas. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3, but that would require B and D to be N2 and H2, but then the ratio would be 3:1 (since N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3), so not 1:1.

Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is CH4, but that's not a 1:1 ratio either. Hmm, this part is tricky.

Let me think about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces A, a strong acid, and a weak acid. So perhaps C is a sulfide or a metal oxide that reacts with water.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, then reacting with water would produce H2S (a weak acid, but actually a gas), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, which would react with water to produce NH3 (a weak acid? No, NH3 is a base.) Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal oxide. If it's acidic, like a non-metal oxide, then reacting with water would produce an acid. For example, SO3 → H2SO4. But in that case, perhaps C is SO3, which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (a strong acid) and maybe another acid? Or perhaps if C is a mixed oxide.

Wait, but the problem says C reacts with water to form A plus two different acids F and G. So, if C is something like a nitrate, but no, nitrates usually don't produce two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a carbonate. When a carbonate reacts with water, it can decompose into CO2 gas and a corresponding acid. But then, that would produce only one acid, not two.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite. Sulfites react with water to form sulfurous acid (H2SO3), which is a weak acid. But again, only one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a more complex salt. For example, maybe it's a sulfate with another anion. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is sodium bicarbonate (but that's a base, not an acid). Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Let me go back to the first reaction. If A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, maybe O2. Then, 8 equivalents of O2 would mean 8 moles per mole of A. So the product C would be a metal oxide with a high oxidation state.

Wait, for example, lead(IV) oxide: PbO2. But lead(IV) oxide is dark brown, not red. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a vanadium oxide. Vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but maybe a lower oxidation state is red?

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound. Chromium(VI) compounds are often orange or yellow. But red? Maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe C is a manganese compound. Manganese dioxide is black. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a transition metal sulfide. Wait, but sulfides are usually not bright red. Unless it's something like As2S3, which is bright red, but that's a sulfide.

Wait, but in the first reaction, A is a solid reacting with gas B. If B is Cl2, then maybe A is a metal that reacts with Cl2 in a 8:1 ratio. Wait, 8 equivalents would be a lot. For example, perhaps A is aluminum, which reacts with Cl2 in a certain ratio. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a metal reacting with O2. Let's think about lead. Lead reacts with oxygen to form lead(II) oxide (PbO) or lead(IV) oxide (PbO2). PbO is red. Oh wait! Lead(II) oxide (PbO) is actually a bright red solid. So that could be C.

So, if A is lead metal (Pb), and B is oxygen (O2), then reaction 1 is:

Pb (solid) + O2 (gas) → PbO (bright red solid).

But wait, the stoichiometry would be important. The reaction is 4Pb + 5O2 → 2Pb2O5? No, wait, let me think. The formula for lead(II) oxide is PbO. The reaction would be 2Pb + O2 → 2PbO. So that's 1 mole of O2 per 2 moles of Pb. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of B are used. So perhaps A is in a different stoichiometry.

Wait, 8 equivalents of O2 per mole of A. So for 1 mole of A, 8 moles of O2 are used. So perhaps each mole of A combines with 8 moles of O2.

If A is Pb, then the reaction would be Pb + 8O2 → PbO4? Wait, but I don't think that exists. Lead typically forms PbO, PbO2, Pb3O4, etc. PbO4 is not a common oxide. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. Let's say A is Fe. Iron reacts with O2 to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. But none of these are bright red. Wait, FeO is black, Fe3O4 is black, Fe2O3 is reddish.

Wait, but the problem states that C is bright red. So maybe it's not lead or iron.

Another thought: maybe C is a sulfide. For example, As2S3 is bright red. But then, the first reaction would have to produce a sulfide. So if A is arsenic (As) and B is H2S gas, but that's a stretch because H2S is a gas, but the reaction would probably not be 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, perhaps B is sulfur vapor? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is something else. Let's think about the third reaction again: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, C is a compound that when hydrolyzed, gives back A, a solid, and two acids.

If C is a nitride, then it could react with water to produce NH3 and another acid. But NH3 is a base, not an acid. So maybe not.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate: C could be CO3^2- in a salt. Then, hydrolysis would produce CO2 and the corresponding acid. But again, only one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. Sulfites react with water to form sulfurous acid (H2SO3), which is a weak acid. But again, only one acid.

Alternatively, if C is a mixed salt, like a nitrate and sulfate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids are like H2SO4, HCl, HNO3. Weak acids are like CH3COOH, H3PO4, H2CO3.

So, when C is hydrolyzed, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. So perhaps C is a salt that dissociates into ions that hydrolyze to form both. For example, maybe C is a sulfite nitrate, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. When it reacts with water, it produces H2SO3 (weak acid) and maybe another acid. Or maybe C is a salt that contains both nitrate and sulfate ions. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and another acid. For example, if C is (NH4)2SO4, then hydrolysis would produce NH4OH (which is weak, but actually it's NH3 in water) and H2SO4. But that doesn't fit exactly.

Alternatively, if C is a metal sulfite, like CaSO3. Then, reacting with water would produce H2SO3 and Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is a base, which would react further. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal nitrate. For example, suppose C is Pb(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Pb^2+ and NO3^- ions. But I'm not sure how that would produce two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anion salt. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, if C is Na2O2, reacting with water would produce NaOH (a strong base) and O2 gas, but that doesn't fit the acid scenario.

Alternatively, if C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. It reacts with water to form NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid, but as a gas). So that would only produce one acid, which is CO2. But the problem states two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Na+, HCO3^- which can further hydrolyze into H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). Again, only one acid.

This is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should consider another angle. Let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous.

If E is a highly toxic gas, perhaps it's something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), phosgene (COCl2), sarin gas, or something similar. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if E is a highly toxic solid, like arsenic trioxide, but that's a solid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: D could be a halogen. If D is Cl2, then reacting with C could produce something like SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride), which is a toxic liquid. But not sure.

Alternatively, E could be a highly oxidizing agent, like chlorine gas, but I think D would have to be something else in that case.

Wait, let's think about D and B reacting in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B are gases, and their reaction produces H as a solvent.

If H is water, then D and B would have to be H2 and O2, but their reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, if H is another solvent, like NH3 (which is a gas but can be a liquid under certain conditions). To make NH3, you need N2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio (N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3). So not 1:1.

Wait, perhaps H is CH4O (dimethyl ether?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps H is a different solvent like ethanol, but that would require more complicated reactions.

Alternatively, maybe H is a solvent like DMF or DMSO, but I don't think those are produced from gas reactions in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, another angle: perhaps D is a diatomic gas, and B is another diatomic gas. So when they react in a 1:1 ratio, they form H. For example, if B is O2 and D is F2, then reacting in 1:1 would give O2F2. But I'm not sure if that's a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is another diatomic gas, but not sure.

Wait, maybe H is a compound like HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should try to think of a possible C that when hydrolyzed gives two different acids, one strong and one weak.

Suppose C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3). When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But that's not two acids. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two salts that upon hydrolysis each produce an acid. But the problem says C is a product of the first reaction, so it's likely a single compound.

Wait, what if C is a metal carbonate and a metal sulfite in a single compound? Not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Si3N4, which upon reaction with water would produce NH3 (weak base) and silicic acid (H4SiO4, which is a weak acid). Hmm, but then F would be H4SiO4 (weak acid) and G would be NH3 (which is a base, not an acid). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. For example, if C is FeS, which upon reaction with water would produce H2S (a weak acid, but more of a gas) and Fe(OH)2 (a base). But that again doesn't give two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. Let's say C is Na2O2. When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2 gas. Not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a superoxide. For example, KO2 reacts with water to produce KOH (strong base) and O2. Again, not acids.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about E.

E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. E is extremely hazardous. Let me think of possible E candidates.

If E is sarin gas, then D might be something like phosphorus trichloride reacting with something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like hydrogen cyanide (HCN). So if C is a cyanide salt, then reacting with D (maybe HCl gas) would produce HCN.

Wait, but how would C be a cyanide? Let me think. If in the first reaction, A is a metal and B is a gas that introduces cyanide. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if E is chlorine gas, but that's produced by reactions involving Cl2, which may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly oxidizing gas like ozone (O3), but that's not extremely hazardous in small amounts, though it's toxic.

Wait, another possibility: E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene is produced by the reaction of CO with Cl2 under certain conditions. But how would that tie into the other reactions?

Alternatively, E could be a nerve agent like VX, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound like H2O2, but that's not extremely hazardous in small quantities.

Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic metal cyanide compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to fit the options based on the information. Let's see what the possible structures are for E and their symmetry groups.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are symmetry groups, so they depend on the molecular structure of E.

D4h has a high degree of symmetry, including a four-fold axis and horizontal mirror planes. D∞h is similar but with an infinite-fold rotation axis (like in a linear molecule with certain symmetry). C2 has a two-fold rotation axis. C2v has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

So, if E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion and certain mirror planes, it might have D∞h symmetry. For example, CO2 is linear but has D∞h symmetry. But CO2 isn't extremely hazardous. Alternatively, O3 (ozone) has C2v symmetry because it's a bent molecule.

Wait, phosgene (O=CCl2) is a toxic gas. Its structure is a planar molecule with Cl2C=O. The molecule is linear, but with two identical substituents on one side. So, its point group would be D∞h, because it has a center of inversion and mirror planes.

Wait, another possibility: HCN is a linear molecule with the structure H-C≡N. It has a linear structure, and its point group is D∞h because it's linear with a center of inversion and other symmetry elements.

HCN is a highly toxic gas, so that could fit as E.

So, if E is HCN, its symmetry group is D∞h (option C).

Wait, but let's tie this back to the reactions.

If E is HCN, then in the second reaction, C + 2 D → HCN. So D would have to be a source of CN- or something that can form HCN.

Wait, but HCN is formed from, say, cyanide salts reacting with acids. Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2 and C is a cyanide salt.

Wait, let's think again. If C is a cyanide salt, like NaCN, then reacting with HCl (if D is HCl) would produce HCN and NaCl. But the reaction would be NaCN + 2 HCl → HCN + NaCl + H2O. But in this case, D would be HCl, which is a gas. But HCl is a gas under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and C is a compound containing CN- groups. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting closer. Let me try to piece it together.

First reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). Suppose A is carbon (solid), and B is O2. Then, 8 equivalents of O2 would mean 8 moles of O2 per mole of C. So what's the reaction of carbon with 8 moles of O2? That would produce CO2, but that's a gas, not a solid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium (solid), and B is Cl2. Then, 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's 1 mole of Cl2 per 2 moles of Na. Doesn't fit the 8 equivalents.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, if A is chromium, and B is O2. The reaction would be 4 Cr + 3 O2 → 2 Cr2O3. But Cr2O3 is green, not red. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is vanadium, and B is O2. The reaction 5 V + 6 O2 → 3 V2O5. V2O5 is orange, but perhaps a different vanadium oxide is red.

Wait, I'm not getting much further with this. Let me think about the third reaction again. When C reacts with water, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid).

If C is a nitrate, like Pb(NO3)2, then hydrolysis would produce Pb(OH)2 and HNO3. But HNO3 is a strong acid, and maybe another acid if there's another anion.

Alternatively, suppose C is a sulfate. PbSO4 reacts with water to produce Pb(OH)2 and H2SO4. But that's again one acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. PbSO3 reacts with water to produce Pb(OH)2 and H2SO3. Again, only one acid.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. PbCO3 reacting with water gives Pb(OH)2 and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (in water it forms H2CO3), but again, only one acid.

Wait, maybe C is a combination of sulfite and another group. For example, if C is PbSO3·H2O, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that releases two different acids upon hydrolysis. For example, if C is a double salt like NaHSO4·Na2SO4. Then, hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and Na2SO4, but that's not two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it's an acidic oxide. For example, SO3 is an acidic oxide that reacts with water to form H2SO4 (strong acid). But how would that produce two acids?

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of two acidic oxides, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of a different approach.

The molecular symmetry group depends on E's structure. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, like CO2 (D∞h), HCN (D∞h), or O3 (C2v), then the symmetry group would be one of the options.

HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. Ozone is bent, so C2v. Phosgene (O=CCl2) is planar with D∞h.

So, if E is one of these, and the question is about its symmetry.

But I'm not entirely sure which one it is based on the reactions given.

Wait, another possibility: if E is a dimeric molecule, like Cl2, which has a symmetry group of D∞h. Cl2 is diatomic, linear, so D∞h.

But Cl2 is a gas, and in the second reaction, C reacts with D to produce E. If E is Cl2, then D would have to be something that produces Cl2 when reacting with C.

But Cl2 is a gas, and in the first reaction, C is a bright red product. Not sure.

Wait, maybe E is CO, which is a linear molecule (D∞h symmetry). But CO isn't extremely hazardous in small amounts, though it's toxic.

Alternatively, maybe E is a more complex molecule. For example, if E is SO3, which is a trigonal pyramidal structure with D3h symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought. If C is SO3, which is a bright white solid, but in the problem, C is bright red. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. If A is a metal, like lead, and B is O2, then C could be PbO (bright red). Then, when PbO reacts with water, it would produce Pb(OH)2 and H2O. Wait, but that doesn't give two acids. Hmm.

Wait, PbO is a basic oxide. Reacting with water would produce a basic solution, not acids. So that can't be right. So perhaps C isn't PbO.

Wait, another possibility: C is a transition metal sulfide. For example, CuS is black, but As2S3 is bright red. So if C is As2S3, then reacting with water would produce AsH3 (a weak acid, but actually it's a gas and a base) and H2S (a weak acid, but more of a gas). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is AsN, but not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. Let's say C is Na2O2, which is a bright white solid, not red.

Hmm.

I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to make some assumptions.

Assume that C is a nitride, which upon hydrolysis produces NH3 (weak base) and HNO3 (strong acid). But that doesn't fit because F is a strong acid and G a weak acid, and in this case, F would be HNO3 and G would be NH3, which is a base. So that doesn't fit.

Another assumption: perhaps C is a carbonate, which upon hydrolysis produces a strong acid (H2CO3, which is weak). But again, only one acid.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed carbonate and sulfite salt. For example, Na2SO3·Na2CO3. Then, hydrolysis would produce H2SO3 and H2CO3. Both are weak acids. But the problem states F is strong, G is weak. So that's not it.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a sulfate with a nitrate. For example, (NH4)2SO4·HNO3. Upon hydrolysis, it would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and HNO3 (strong acid). But both F and G would be strong acids, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a carbonate. For example, NaNO3·Na2CO3. Hydrolysis would produce HNO3 and H2CO3. Again, one strong and one weak.

Wait, that fits. So if C is a mixed salt of nitrate and carbonate, then hydrolysis would produce HNO3 (strong acid, F) and H2CO3 (weak acid, G).

So, in this case, C is NaNO3·Na2CO3. Then, when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into NaNO3 and Na2CO3, which would hydrolyze into HNO3, CO2, and NaOH. Wait, but that would produce CO2 (weak acid) and HNO3 (strong acid), along with NaOH, which is a base. But the problem says C reacts with water to form A plus two acids. So perhaps A is NaOH, but NaOH is a solid. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. If C is NaNO3·Na2CO3, then upon hydrolysis, it would produce HNO3, H2CO3, and NaOH. But the problem says it forms A, F, and G. So maybe A is NaOH (solid), F is HNO3 (strong acid), and G is H2CO3 (weak acid).

That fits. So in this scenario:

C → A (NaOH), F (HNO3), G (H2CO3).

So, that would mean that C is a mixed salt of nitrate and carbonate.

Now, back to the first reaction: A is NaOH (a solid), and B is a gas. So NaOH is a solid. B is a gas that reacts with NaOH to form C, a bright red product. But NaOH plus a gas forming a salt? Not sure. Maybe B is CO2. NaOH reacts with CO2 to form Na2CO3, which is white, not red. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps this line of thinking isn't correct. Let's try to think differently.

Perhaps C is a sulfite carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphoric acid derivative. But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what E is. If E is HCN, which has D∞h symmetry.

So, if E is HCN, then the second reaction is C + 2 D → HCN.

So, what would C and D be? HCN can be produced by the reaction of cyanide salts with strong acids. So, for example, NaCN + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + HCN↑ + H2O.

In this case, D would be H2SO4 (but H2SO4 is a liquid, not a gas). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and C is a cyanide. For example, KCN + Cl2 → 2 KCl + HCN. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry or the reaction conditions.

Wait, another way: maybe D is a gas like Cl2 and C is a compound containing H and CN, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a thiocyanate, but that's speculative.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the information.

Given that E's options are symmetry groups, and if E is a linear molecule like HCN or CO2, the symmetry group would be D∞h (option C). Ozone is C2v, which is another option.

But the question states that E is extremely hazardous. HCN is a highly toxic gas, as is phosgene. Phosgene is O=CCl2, which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.

So, if E is phosgene (O=CCl2), its symmetry group is D∞h. But how would that fit into the reactions?

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with chlorine gas in the presence of a catalyst. But that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, phosgene can be produced from carbon monoxide and chlorine gas under certain conditions. So, perhaps D is Cl2 and C is CO.

Wait, but CO is a gas, not a solid. So that might not fit.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to tie it all together.

Assuming E has D∞h symmetry, the answer would be option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which has C2v symmetry, the answer would be D.

Wait, but which one is more likely given the reactions?

If E is phosgene, then D would be Cl2, and C would be something that reacts with Cl2 to form phosgene. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. But how would that happen?

Wait, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 moles of D to form E. If E is Cl2, then perhaps C is a chloride and D is another chloride. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with HCl to produce Cl2. But that's a stretch.

At this point, I think I've exhausted my options, and the most plausible symmetry group for E is D∞h, which would correspond to option C.

The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a compound like PbO (lead(II) oxide) or a sulfide like As2S3. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear due to insufficient information.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a highly toxic gas or compound. Potential candidates include HCN (hydrogen cyanide), phosgene (COCl2), or ozone (O3). These compounds have distinct symmetry groups:
   - HCN is linear with **D∞h** symmetry.
   - Phosgene (COCl2) is planar with **D∞h** symmetry.
   - Ozone (O3) is bent with **C2v** symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This implies C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to form both acids. For example, if C is a mixed salt like NaNO3·Na2CO3, hydrolysis could yield HNO3 (strong acid) and H2CO3 (weak acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests D and B are gases that combine to form a solvent. For example, if B is O2 and D is H2, H could be H2O. However, the stoichiometry does not perfectly match a 1:1 ratio, leaving some ambiguity.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are:
   - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis.
   - **D4h**: A high-symmetry group with a four-fold axis and horizontal mirror planes.
   - **D∞h**: A linear molecule with an infinite-fold rotation axis and mirror planes.
   - **C2v**: A bent molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane.

   Based on the reactions and the hazardous nature of E, HCN (linear, **D∞h**) or phosgene (planar, **D∞h**) are plausible candidates. Ozone (bent, **C2v**) is less likely due to its weaker toxicity and different reaction context.

Given the evidence and the symmetry groups provided, the most likely symmetry group for E is **D∞h**, corresponding to a linear molecule like HCN or phosgene.
