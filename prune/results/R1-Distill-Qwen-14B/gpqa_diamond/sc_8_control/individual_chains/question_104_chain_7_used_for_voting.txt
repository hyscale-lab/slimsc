Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that astronomers found exoplanets using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

Planet #1 caused a periodic shift in the spectral line of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravity causing the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines relates to the star's velocity towards or away from us. So the larger the shift, the higher the velocity.

Wait, but how does the velocity relate to the orbital period? Oh right, the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude (K), which is the maximum velocity the star moves due to the planet. The formula for K is K = (v) where v is the velocity.

But wait, I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by: 

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) )^(1/3) ] * (sin i) / ( (1 day)^−1 * (1 year) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the more straightforward formula. Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance from the star. Alternatively, another approach is to remember Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the distance and the star's mass.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the planets have similar masses to Neptune and the stars are solar mass, M_p is much less than M_star. So, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and sin i is roughly 1 (assuming edge-on orbit, which is typical for RV method to detect). Also, since both planets have the same mass, and the stars are the same mass, perhaps the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ), or something like that. Wait, maybe the relation is K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me think again. The formula I remember is:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, the denominator simplifies to M_star^(2/3), and sqrt(1 - e²) is roughly 1 for small eccentricities. So,

K ≈ ( (G P ) / (2π c^3 ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_star^(2/3 )

Wait, but I think another approach is better. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, perhaps the ratio of K for the two planets can be used to find the ratio of their periods.

The question gives the shifts: K1 is 5 milliangstroms for planet 1, and K2 is 7 for planet 2. But wait, K is the velocity, right? Because the shift in wavelength is proportional to velocity. So if we have two stars with the same mass, and same M_p (since both are Neptune-like), then K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I should write the formula more clearly. The formula for K is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (2π G) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )

Assuming e is small and sin i ≈ 1, then:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Since both stars have same mass M_star, and both planets have same M_p, the ratio of K1/K2 would be sqrt( ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ), wait, no, let's see.

Wait, let me write the equation for K1 and K2:

K1 = ( (2π G) / (c P1 ) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )

K2 = ( (2π G) / (c P2 ) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Dividing K2 by K1 gives:

K2/K1 = [ ( (2π G)/(c P2 ) )^(1/3) / ( (2π G)/(c P1 ) )^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify that:

= [ (P1 / P2 )^(1/3) ) ]

So,

K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly.

Wait, it's ( (1/P2 ) / (1/P1) )^(1/3) )

Which is (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

So,

K2 / K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

We can rearrange this to find the ratio of periods.

We know K2 and K1:

K1 is 5 milliangstrom (but wait, are they using the same units? Actually, the units don't matter because we're taking a ratio.)

Wait, but the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but in the RV method, the velocity is proportional to the wavelength shift. So the bigger the shift (K), the higher the velocity. So, K1 is 5 and K2 is 7.

So K2 =7, K1=5 → K2/K1=7/5=1.4.

So,

1.4 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(1.4)^3 = P1 / P2

Compute 1.4^3: 1.4 * 1.4 = 1.96; 1.96 *1.4= approx 2.744.

So,

2.744 = P1 / P2 → P2 = P1 / 2.744.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So P2 / P1 = ?

From P2 = P1 / 2.744 → P2/P1 = 1/2.744 ≈ 0.364.

So approximately 0.36 times. So P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1, which means the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, from the formula:

K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So,

(7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power 3:

(7/5)^3 = P1/P2 → 343 / 125 = P1/P2 → P1 = (343/125) P2 → P2 = (125/343) P1 → P2/P1 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1 = 0.36, so it's 0.36 times longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but I thought higher K implies shorter period? Because if the star is moving more (higher K), that would mean a shorter period, as the star has to orbit faster for a tighter orbit. So if K2 is larger than K1, P2 is shorter than P1.

So the answer would be option A, approximately 0.36.

The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1 using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which is proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. The relationship between \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \) is derived from the formula:

\[
K \propto \left(\frac{P}{M_{\text{star}}^{2/3}}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Since both stars have the same mass and both planets have similar masses, the ratio of \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) can be used to find the ratio of their orbital periods. The given shifts are \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
\]

From the formula, \( \frac{K_2}{K_1} = \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{1/3} \). Rearranging:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{K_2}{K_1}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_2}{K_1} = 1.4 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = (1.4)^3 = 2.744
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{1}{2.744} \approx 0.36
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet #2 is about 0.36 times longer than that of Planet #1.
