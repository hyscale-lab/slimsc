Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. Let me see what each part is doing.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure. Heating that with excess KOH at 240°C probably leads to an elimination reaction since KOH is a strong base. So, the bromides would likely undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Wait, but adamantane is a pretty rigid structure. If I eliminate two bromides, perhaps it forms an alkyne? Or maybe a diene? No, wait. Each elimination of HBr would form a double bond. Since there are two bromines, maybe two eliminations occur, forming a diene or an alkyne.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. I'm thinking it might be a diene or an alkyne. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1. What's that? That's usually a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Oh wait, but if KOH is used in elimination, maybe it's forming an enol or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. KOH in such conditions might actually lead to the formation of a ketone. Oh, right! Because when dibromides are treated with strong base like KOH, sometimes they can undergo a double elimination, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane heating with KOH would eliminate two HBr molecules, resulting in an adamantanone structure. Because the product has a carbonyl, which would fit the IR peak at 1720 cm-1. So product 1 is likely an adamantanone, which is a ketone.

So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone maybe? Or perhaps 1,3-diketone? Wait, no: the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane would, upon elimination, form a ring with a ketone group. Adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane structure. So when two adjacent positions (1 and 3) have Br, eliminating them would create a double bond? No, wait, more accurately, each Br elimination would form a double bond, but two eliminations next to each other might form a ring contraction or expansion. Alternatively, each adjacent Br leaves, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond. Wait, but in the case of 1,3-dibromocyclohexane, elimination would form cyclohexene, but maybe in adamantane it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. Because when two vicinal bromides are eliminated with strong base, perhaps each Br is removed, and two ketones are formed. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So maybe elimination would form a conjugated diene. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here.

Wait, maybe the product is not an elimination but a substitution. KOH is a strong base, but in such conditions, it's more likely to cause elimination. Oh, but wait, maybe the product is a gem-diol? No, that doesn't fit the IR peak.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3, which are two positions apart in adamantane's structure. So maybe they're not adjacent. So perhaps a single elimination isn't possible, but maybe two separate eliminations occur, each losing HBr, but since the positions aren't adjacent, maybe it's not possible to form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton that's beta to both bromines, leading to the elimination of both Br atoms and forming a triple bond. So the product would be an alkyne.

So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, it would form an alkyne. The IR at 1720 cm-1 doesn't fit an alkyne, though. Alkyne C-H stretches are around 3300, and the C≡C stretch is around 2100-2260 cm-1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe I'm wrong again.

Wait, back to the NMR. Product 1 has an NMR with 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's see. 4.79 ppm is probably an -OH proton, but that's unusual because OH protons usually appear broader. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the product is an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, it's an ester or ketone.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic ether, but that doesn't explain the 1720 cm-1. Let me think about the reaction again. KOH is a base, but maybe it's causing a substitution. Or perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps each Br is eliminated as HBr, but the two eliminations result in the formation of a ketone. Let me imagine the structure. Adamantane has a four-ring structure. If in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Brs are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, eliminating both would form a bridge between them, creating a ketone. So perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone. But the IR shows a single strong peak at 1720, which might suggest a single carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR for product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet, perhaps. 4.79 ppm is around where an ether oxygen or a carbonyl-adjacent CH2 would appear. So maybe those 2H are next to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's a CH2 adjacent to a ketone, like in acetone. But in that case, the CH3 groups would be around 2.1 ppm. But here, product 1's NMR has 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm, which is a broad region. That could be multiple sets of CH2 groups. The 2H at 1.94 ppm are probably another set of CH2.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol. But diols would have OH protons, which usually are broad. The 4.79 ppm could be an OH, but the question says "excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent." So maybe the 4.79 is an -O-CH2-O- group? Like in a cyclic ether. Hmm, but then where's the carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, which would have a carbonyl-like peak in IR? No, epoxides have C-O-C stretching around 1250 cm-1, not 1720.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions again. KOH is heated with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Another possibility is that the bromides undergo nucleophilic substitution, but in such a case, with two Brs, perhaps a diol would form. But the IR doesn't support that because diols don't have a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the starting material isn't 1,3-dibromoadamantane but 1,3-dibromo something else. Alternatively, perhaps the heating leads to a rearrangement. Another thought: maybe the product is a cycloalkane with two ketone groups. But that doesn't fit the NMR either.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a vicinal diol, but again, the IR doesn't fit. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's think about the IR first. 1720 cm^-1 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. Then, what would cause a dihalide to form a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Maybe it's a beta-diketone formation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution, where the two bromide groups are replaced by something else. But KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution. Wait, KOH's OH- could deprotonate and then attack, but that's more for elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the product is a ketone.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, the next step is heating with excess aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid catalyst. That likely induces some kind of cyclization or ring-forming reaction. Aluminum isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone, so maybe an acylation is happening.

Wait, product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone (let's assume that). When heated with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, adamantane is a bicyclic structure; if there's a ketone, maybe the Lewis acid helps in some kind of ring expansion or forms an enol which can attack another position.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone undergoes an aldol condensation. But that typically requires a base, not a Lewis acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the ketone (product 1) reacts with Al(OiPr)3 to form an acylium ion, which could then undergo some cycloaddition or form a ring. Or perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but the starting material is a ketone, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some kind of di-ene reaction or a Diels-Alder, but without a diene, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, like cyclopentanone. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, maybe it forms a cyclic ester or undergoes some kind of ring-opening.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Fries rearrangement, but that's for aromatic esters. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about product 2. After product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, product 2 is formed. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, but product 3 is formed after ozonolysis followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds, and with dimethylsulfide (which is a mild reductant), it would break the ozonides into carbonyl compounds. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

But wait, the question is about the NMR of product 3. What's the structure after ozonolysis? Let me think step by step.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is a compound with a double bond. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene formed from product 1 via some reaction with Al(OiPr)3.

Wait, let me think about what Al(OiPr)3 does. It's a Lewis acid, so it could help in the formation of enolates or facilitate carbocation formation. So maybe product 1 (the ketone) undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but product 1's NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet perhaps. If it's a diol, the 2H could be a geminal diol, but that would be a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether. For example, an epoxide's adjacent CH2 groups would appear around 4 ppm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let me imagine that product 1 is 1,3-diketone. Then, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. If KOH is a strong base, perhaps it's causing a nucleophilic substitution, but with two bromides, that might form an epoxide. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH could form an epoxide. Epoxides typically form when a vicinal dihalide is treated with a base, but in this case, the dihalide is 1,3, not vicinal. So maybe that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think about product 3's NMR.

After ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. So in the NMR, the signals would be from protons adjacent to carbonyl groups, perhaps as aldehydes or ketones. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange with solvent).

In product 3, which is the ozonolysis product, the most deshielded proton would be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. So it would be an aldehyde proton, which is usually around 9-10 ppm. But in the options, the coupling is about neighboring protons. Wait, no, the most deshielded would be the aldehyde, but aldehydes don't have neighboring Hs because they're RCHO. So perhaps the next most deshielded would be a ketone adjacent to CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, so the protons adjacent would be CH2 groups next to the carbonyls. Those protons would be deshielded and split based on their neighbors.

Wait, but the problem says that the most deshielded H (not exchanging) is the one we're looking at. So maybe it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, or a CH2 group.

Wait, let's think about the ozonolysis of product 2. Product 2 is supposed to have a double bond. Ozonolysis of a double bond would break it into two carbonyls. If product 2's double bond is in a certain position, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups.

Assuming product 2 has a structure with a double bond between carbons that, when cleaved, gives two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes. But in our case, it's probably a bridged or more complex structure.

Wait, product 1 was 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH. I'm going to go back to that. Perhaps the product is a diol. Wait, but then the IR would show OH peaks. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is an alkene, which upon ozonolysis gives product 3 as a diketone or dialdehyde.

Wait, but product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(OiPr)3. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or another structure that has a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide. Then ozonolysis wouldn't make sense because epoxides don't have double bonds. Hmm, I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the IR and NMR of product 1. IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, likely a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

Product 1's NMR: 4.79 (2H, possibly a doublet or triplet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, which could be multiple CH2 groups), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is likely a CH2 group next to an oxygen or a carbonyl. For example, if product 1 is a ketone with a CH2 group adjacent, like cyclohexanone with a CH2 substituent.

But the NMR is a bit confusing. Let me think of an example. Adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. If two adjacent bridgehead carbons have Br, elimination would form a bridge between them, releasing HBr. Wait, but that might form a cyclopropane ring or something else. Alternatively, maybe it forms a bridge with a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl bridge. So the product is a bicyclic ketone, like bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one or something similar. The NMR would then have signals from the bridgehead CH2 and other CH2 groups.

But the exact structure is a bit unclear. Let's proceed to product 2.

Product 2 is made by heating product 1 with excess Al(OiPr)3. Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's used in forming an enol, which then can undergo some kind of cyclization or elimination.

Suppose product 1 is a ketone. The Lewis acid could coordinate to the carbonyl oxygen, making the alpha carbons more electrophilic. This could lead to an elimination, forming an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, product 3 is the ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups at the sites where the double bond was.

Now, the NMR of product 3: the most deshielded hydrogen would be next to a carbonyl group. Let's say the structure after ozonolysis has two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group.

In such a case, each CH2 group next to a carbonyl would have protons that are deshielded and split based on neighboring protons.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H. So perhaps these are the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl groups.

If each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each proton would have coupling with two sets of neighboring Hs. For example, if each CH2 is next to another CH2 group (like in a chain), each H might couple with two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets or another complex splitting.

Wait, let's imagine the structure after ozonolysis. Suppose product 2 was a simple alkene like 1,3-pentadiene. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehydes, but that's a linear structure. But in our case, product 3 is likely a cyclic diketone or something more complex.

Alternatively, if ozonolysis creates two carbonyl groups, maybe each adjacent to a CH2 group, the CH2 protons would be next to each other, causing coupling.

Wait, but in the NMR, the most deshielded H would be perhaps an aldehyde proton, but those are usually at higher ppm and may not couple with many others. Alternatively, it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe product 3 is a diketone, where each ketone is next to a CH2 group. So each CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2 group.

For example, if product 3 is something like (CH2)2(CO)2, then each CH2 is next to another CH2. Each H in the CH2 would be coupling with two Hs from adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, each H in a CH2 group is split by the neighboring CH2. For example, in a structure like CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2, but that's perhaps too long.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each H would see two neighboring Hs. So each H would be a triplet (each neighbor has two Hs, so n+1 = 3). But if there are two adjacent groups, maybe it's a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me draw a simple structure. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO-O. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups and a bridge. For example, each ketone is attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group.

So each CH2 is next to another CH2. Each H in the CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2. So each proton would be a triplet. But if each CH2 is adjacent to two different sets of Hs, perhaps each H is a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is between two other CH2 groups. Let's say the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2. But that's linear, and the middle CH2 would be next to two others. Each H would couple with two neighboring Hs on one side and two on the other, making a triplet of triplets. Or the splitting could be more complex.

But wait, the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If each H is next to two Hs on one side and two on the other, the splitting would be a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs from one neighbor and one H from another, it could be a doublet of triplets.

But how would that happen? For example, if a CH2 is between two CH groups, each with two Hs.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to two different environments. For example, if one side is a CH2 and the other is a CH. Each H would be split by the two Hs on one side and the one H on the other. That might lead to a triplet (from the two Hs) and a doublet (from the one H), resulting in a triplet of doublets or a doublet of triplets.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is next to another CH2, each with two Hs, leading to a triplet for each coupling, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a bridging structure, making each CH2 next to two different sets of Hs. For example, a bicyclic structure where each CH2 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, leading to two coupling constants, hence a triplet of triplets.

So, considering all that, the coupling pattern for the most deshielded H (which is adjacent to a carbonyl group) would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

So perhaps the correct answer is B) triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think: in the ozonolysis product, the CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyls would each be next to another CH2 group. Each H in these CH2 groups would be split by two neighboring Hs, giving a triplet. But if these CH2 groups are on either side of a carbonyl, each CH2's Hs would also be split by another set of neighboring Hs, perhaps leading to a more complex splitting like a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps in the structure, the CH2 groups are in a chain, each adjacent to two others, leading to each H seeing two neighbors on each side, hence a triplet of triplets.

So, I'm leaning towards option B) triplet of triplets.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely results in a double elimination of HBr, forming a ketone. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, confirming the formation of a ketone. The NMR data for product 1 (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and multiple CH₂ groups in the adamantane framework.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**: Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide likely facilitates the formation of an alkene (product 2). This step involves the action of a Lewis acid, which could promote an elimination reaction, resulting in a double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis of product 2**: Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. The cleavage of the double bond introduces carbonyl groups at the break points. Product 3 is expected to have carbonyl groups adjacent to CH₂ groups.

4. **NMR analysis of product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, which is also adjacent to another CH₂ group. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens from the neighboring CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet. Additionally, the coupling constants from the two neighboring hydrogens combine, leading to a triplet of triplets as the coupling pattern.

Given the structure of product 3 and the coupling interactions, the most deshielded hydrogen exhibits a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern.

Answer: B
