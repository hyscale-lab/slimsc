Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think it through.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3. The products from both are given, and I need to find the starting materials A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the products are (R) and (S) respectively. Let me check:

Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

So, the same product but with different configurations. Interesting. So the starting materials A and B must be related in a way that their configurations lead to different stereoisomers upon reduction.

Wait, so the product is a ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone. Let me draw that structure. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, like a cyclic ether. The numbering would be such that the oxygen is in position 5 (since pyran is O in position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5,6). Wait, pyran has the oxygen in the 1 position. So 2H would be the double bond position. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure. 2H-pyran-2-one would have the ketone in position 2, and a double bond elsewhere, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think about the product as a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclic hemiacetal formed from a diol or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ether with a ketone. Let me think about how the reductions would work.

The starting materials A and B are treated with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols. BH3 is also a reducing agent, but it's more selective. Wait, but when I think about the options, the starting materials are given as acids: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So that's a pentanoic acid with substituents.

Wait, so A and B are both pentanoic acids with similar substituents. Let me look at the options. Option C says A is (S) and B is (R), and so on.

So the starting materials are pentanoic acid derivatives. The product is a cyclic ketone. How would LiBH4 and BH3 act on these? Hmm, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester or a lactone? Or perhaps an acetal or hemiacetal?

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a ketone, and an ethyl group at position 4. So perhaps it's a cyclic ether with a ketone at position 2.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me imagine the structure. Pyran is a six-membered ring with oxygen as an ether. The 2H indicates that there's a double bond in the ring. So it's a tetrahydropyran, which is a cyclic ether, with a ketone at position 2. So the ring has five single bonds and one double bond, maybe between C3 and C4 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a ring-forming reaction, like a lactone or a cyclic hemiacetal. Let me think about the starting material being a pentanoic acid with certain groups that can form a ring upon reduction.

Wait, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let's parse that structure. Pentanoic acid means a 5-carbon chain with a carboxylic acid at one end. The substituents are at position 3 (ethyl) and position 5 (isobutoxy and oxo group). Wait, position 5 is the same as position 1 for a pentanoic acid? Wait, no. Let me number it properly. So the formula would be CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CO-O-R? Wait, no. Let's try to write the structure:

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid chain is: COOH-CH2-CH2-CO-O-R? Wait, perhaps it's:

The main chain is five carbons, with the carboxylic acid on the first carbon. Then, positions 3 and 5 have substituents. So:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH2 (but wait, 3-ethyl would mean a CH2CH2 group?)
Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH2CH3) [Wait, no, 3-ethyl is CH2CH2CH3 attached to C3? Or maybe it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-... Hmm, maybe the structure is:

The pentanoic acid is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu)-CH2?

Wait, not quite. Let me visualize:

The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxo-pentanoic acid.

So the main chain is 5 carbons, with the COOH at position 1.

At position 3: ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3? Or CH2CH3? Wait, ethyl is CH2CH3. So perhaps the structure is:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)
Position 5: both isobutoxy and oxo (C=O) groups.

Wait, but position 5 is the fifth carbon. Wait, wait, in pentanoic acid, the chain is COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with substituents. So, 3-ethyl would be on carbon 3. So the chain would be:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH(CH2CH3)
4: CH2
5: O-isobutyl and O (as in a carbonyl group?)

Wait, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a gamma-lactone or something similar. Or perhaps the structure is:

The starting material is a pentanoic acid where the carbonyl is at position 5, and there's an isobutoxy group there as well. Wait, but that would make the structure more like:

COOH-CH2-CH2-C-O-isobutyl with a carbonyl on the same carbon? Hmm, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu)-O?

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal that forms upon reaction.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters, esters that upon reduction would form cyclic ketones. Wait, no, esters are usually reduced to alcohols. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketals or acetals.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols, but maybe in this case, the starting material is an epoxide? No, that doesn't fit with the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones that, when reduced, form specific stereoisomers. Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so that can't be. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) which, upon reduction, form cyclic ethers with ketones. Or perhaps they're esters that form diols, which then cyclize.

Wait, another angle: LiBH4 typically reduces esters to glycols, but in some cases, it can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But in this case, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a carbonyl group that is protected in a way that allows for its conversion into a ketone through reduction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction mechanisms.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones, aldehydes, esters, and amides. Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone. So the starting material would have to be a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, becomes another carbonyl group. That seems impossible. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about forming a ring. For example, if the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar, which upon reduction with LiBH4 would form an alcohol, which then forms a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, another approach: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal. Formation of a cyclic hemiacetal usually involves a diol and a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about reducing a ketone or aldehyde to form an alcohol, which then forms a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal or acetal. Let's think: when you reduce a cyclic ketal, you'd get a diol, but that might not form the same ring. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, which upon reduction would form a diol, which then forms a ring.

Wait, another thought: The product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So maybe the starting material is a five-membered ring with some substituents that upon reduction would form a six-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps it's a lactone that upon reduction forms a diol which then cyclizes.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-diketone or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon reduction with LiBH4 would break the ester into an alcohol and then form a new ring. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reactions.

LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Wait, no, wait. BH3 is typically used in the BH3-THF (tetrahydrofuran) reagent for reductions, often for ketals. Wait, but LiBH4 is a stronger, more powerful reducing agent than BH3. So perhaps the two reactions are about the stereochemistry of the reduction.

Wait, wait! The product is a ketone, but it has an (R) or (S) configuration. So perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, which upon reduction with different agents would form different stereoisomers.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not an alcohol. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ethers with a ketone, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are aldehydes or ketones that upon reduction form secondary alcohols, which then undergo some kind of cyclization to form the cyclic ketone product. Hmm.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a cyclic diol that upon oxidation forms the ketone. No, that doesn't fit because the reactions are reductions, not oxidations.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the starting materials.

The starting materials are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and similar. So 3-ethyl and 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo.

So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu)-?

Wait, but that would be a five-carbon chain with substituents. So positions 1 (COOH), 3 (ethyl), and 5 (isobutoxy and oxo groups). Wait, but 5 would be the fifth carbon, which is the end of the chain. So maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu. Wait, that's four carbons between COOH and the ester. Wait, no, pentanoic acid is five carbons. So:

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH3)
Carbon 4: CO
Carbon 5: O-iBu

Wait, but that would be a five-carbon chain, but how does that form the cyclic product? Maybe upon treatment with LiBH4 or BH3, the ester group is reduced.

Wait, perhaps the ester (CO-O-iBu) is reduced. LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but in this case, would it form something that can cyclize?

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which upon reduction forms a diol that can form a ring. But the product is a cyclic ketone, not a diol.

Wait, another angle: the product is a pyranone, which is a cyclic ketone with an oxygen in the ring. So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or some kind of ketal that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then undergoes cyclization.

Wait, for example, if the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone, then reducing it would break the acetal into a diol, which could then form a cyclic hemiacetal. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone itself, but that doesn't make sense because the product is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction would form a diol, but I'm not seeing how that leads to a ketone.

I think I'm stuck on the reaction mechanisms. Let me try another approach. Let's think about the possible products.

The product is (R) and (S) 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the configuration at the stereocenter is determined by the starting material.

The starting materials A and B are (R) and (S) isomers of the same compound, it seems. Wait, the options given are either the same configuration for both (like option A and B), or mix (C and D).

So if A is (R) and B is (S), or vice versa, which options are those?

Looking at the options:

Option C: A is (S), B is (R)
Option D: A is (R), B is (S)

So the correct starting materials have opposite configurations, because the reactions lead to opposite stereoisomers.

Wait, but why would the configuration of the starting material affect the configuration of the product? Maybe the starting material has a chiral center that determines the approach of the reducing agent, leading to the formation of R or S in the product.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, which has a chiral center at position 4. So perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that upon reduction and cyclization leads to the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a ketone group which, when reduced, forms a secondary alcohol that then cyclizes into the ring with a specific configuration.

Wait, but in that case, the configuration of the starting material would influence the product's configuration.

So let's say the starting material is a pentanoic acid with a ketone and an ester group. Let's imagine that upon treatment with LiBH4 or BH3, those groups are reduced, leading to the formation of an alcohol which then cyclizes to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a ketone group. Let me think: the pentanoic acid derivative has a structure where, after reduction, the ester group becomes an alcohol, and the ketone becomes something else. But I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon reduction forms a diol that cyclizes into a ring with a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the stereochemistry part. When a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration depends on the starting ketone's structure.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting material's configuration affects the approach of the reducing agent, leading to different configurations in the product.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically reduces esters to alcohols, but it can also reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. BH3 is typically used in the BH3-THF complex, which is a milder reducing agent, and it's used for the reduction of ketals and acetals to alcohols, and perhaps for the reduction of esters under certain conditions.

Wait, but wait. There's a reaction where esters are reduced to alcohols with LiBH4. The ester (RCOOR') is reduced to RCH2OH and R'OH. But that would break the molecule apart, not form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone). So, for example, a five-membered lactone. Upon reduction by LiBH4, the ester would open up into a diol, which could then undergo cyclization to form a six-membered ring with a ketone.

Wait, but how would that work? Let me imagine a five-membered lactone. When reduced, the ester would become a diol, but then how would it form a six-membered ring with a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo various reductions. Let's say the starting material is a gamma-keto ester (RCOCH2COOR'), which upon reduction would become RCH2CH2COOR', but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The starting material is an acetal. If the starting material is a cyclic acetal, then reducing it with LiBH4 or BH3 would break the acetal into a diol, which could then form a cyclic hemiacetal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is formed via a pinacol rearrangement or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a bicyclic compound, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a Claisen or Aldol condensation. But that's an elimination reaction, not a reduction.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but let's think about the stereochemistry. The product is (R) or (S) at position 4. The starting materials must have a chiral center that's involved in the reaction.

Wait, looking back at the options, the starting materials are (R) or (S) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the chiral center is at position 3 (because of the ethyl group) and perhaps another at position 5. Wait, position 5 has both isobutoxy and oxo groups. Wait, oxo is a carbonyl, so position 5 would be a carbonyl, which is a double bond, not a chiral center. So the only chiral center would be at position 3.

Wait, so in the starting material, the configuration is either R or S at position 3. So when the starting material is reduced, the configuration at that center would influence the product's configuration.

So when the starting material is treated with LiBH4, the product is (R) configuration, and with BH3, it's (S). Or vice versa.

Wait, but how does the starting material's configuration lead to the product's configuration? Perhaps the reduction step creates a new chiral center, and the configuration depends on the starting material.

Wait, but the starting material's configuration is at position 3, and the product's configuration is at position 4. So perhaps the reaction involves a ring-forming step that creates the new chiral center based on the starting material's configuration.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material's configuration leads to the approach of the nucleophile (like the hydride in the reduction) from a particular face, determining the configuration of the product.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material's configuration affects the stereochemistry of the ring formation, leading to R or S in the product.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can cause syn addition. BH3, which is a weaker reducing agent, may cause different stereochemistry. Or perhaps the reducing agents affect the configuration based on the starting material.

Wait, considering that the product is a cyclic ketone, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal that, upon reduction, forms the ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an acyclic compound that forms a ring upon reduction. For example, a diethyl acetal of a ketone. Upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3, the acetal would be broken, and the ketone would form, but that doesn't fit the product description.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Upon reduction, it forms a diol, which then can undergo cyclization to form the cyclic product.

Wait, for instance, the starting material could be something like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-R

When reduced, the ester group (CO-O-R) would be converted into CH2OH, and the ketone (CO) would be converted into CH2OH as well. But that would lead to a diol, which could cyclize.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be a diol, not a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that upon reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes oxidation to form the ketone. No, because the product is a ketone, and the reactions are reductions.

Hmm, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone that upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, which then undergoes some reaction to form another product, but that doesn't fit.

I think I'm going around in circles. Let me try to approach this differently. The key is that the same product is formed from A and B, but with opposite configurations. So the difference in the reagents (LiBH4 vs BH3) leads to opposite configurations in the product. How does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group that is planar, and the approach of the hydride from LiBH4 or BH3 leads to the formation of R or S configuration based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, but the starting material's configuration is at position 3, and the product's configuration is at position 4. So perhaps during the reaction, the configuration is transferred or influences the new configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the reduction step leads to the formation of an alcohol which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring with the new configuration determined by the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration affects the way the ring forms, leading to different stereoisomers.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and may proceed through a more concerted mechanism, leading to a specific configuration. BH3, being a weaker reagent, might proceed through a different mechanism, perhaps less stereospecific, leading to a different configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration leads to the attack of the hydride from a particular face, leading to the product's configuration.

But I'm not exactly sure how the starting material's configuration at position 3 would influence the product's configuration at position 4. Maybe during the ring-closing step, the configuration is determined by the starting material's stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reducing agents cause the formation of different diastereomers.

Wait, the options show that A and B are either the same configuration or different. The correct answer would be where A and B are enantiomers, leading to R and S products, respectively, or vice versa.

Wait, looking at the product: when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives (R). When B is treated with BH3, it gives (S). So the configuration of the starting material determines which product forms.

So, the starting materials must be enantiomers. Because if A is R and B is S, then perhaps the reagents lead to opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, but the options don't have A and B as enantiomers. Looking at the options:

Option D: A is (R), B is (S)
Option C: A is (S), B is (R)

So, in options C and D, A and B are enantiomers.

So, the correct answer must be either C or D.

Now, the question is which one leads to the correct product when treated with LiBH4 and BH3.

Assuming that when the starting material is (R), the product is (R), and when it's (S), the product is (S). Wait, but in the question, A with LiBH4 gives (R), and B with BH3 gives (S). So if A is (R) and B is (S), then the product would be (R) and (S) respectively. That would make sense.

So, the correct options are those where A is R and B is S, or vice versa, but according to the reactions, A leads to R, and B leads to S.

Looking at the options:

Option D: A is (R), B is (S)
Option C: A is (S), B is (R)

If A(R) gives product (R), and B(S) gives product (S), then option D would be correct. But I need to determine which reagent leads to which configuration.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism. Let me think about the stereochemistry of the reduction.

When a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon. The configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the approach of the hydride. If the starting material is a chiral center, the hydride could approach from the same face or the opposite face, leading to different configurations.

But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so I'm not sure how the reduction leads to the configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal, and the reduction breaks the acetal into a diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone. The configuration of the starting acetal would influence the diol's configuration, which then leads to the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acyclic compound that forms a ring upon reduction, and the configuration is determined by the starting material's configuration.

I think I'm going in circles, so perhaps I should look for the answer based on the options and the given products.

The correct starting materials are enantiomers, so the options are C and D.

The product from A is (R), which is made with LiBH4. The product from B is (S), made with BH3.

LiBH4 is a stronger reductant and may prefer a certain approach, while BH3 may not.

Wait, but more accurately, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters, while BH3 is typically used for reducing ketals and esters under specific conditions. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of an ester to an alcohol. The configuration of the resulting alcohol would depend on the starting material's configuration.

If the starting material is R, the reduction would form R in the product, and vice versa.

So, if A is R and B is S, then A would produce R and B would produce S, making option D correct.

Alternatively, if A is S and B is R, then A would produce S, but the product is R, which would not fit. So option D is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that yield (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively, using different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The key is to analyze how the configurations of the starting materials influence the stereochemistry of the products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which has a chiral center at position 4. The configurations of the products are (R) and (S), indicating that the stereochemistry of the starting materials plays a critical role in determining the product configurations.

2. **Starting Materials**: The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. These compounds have a chiral center at position 3, which influences the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Reactions and Reducing Agents**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material.
   - **BH3**: A milder reducing agent that also reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols, but it may proceed through a different mechanism, leading to opposite stereochemistry compared to LiBH4.

4. **Stereochemical Relationship**:
   - If the starting material is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, treatment with LiBH4 produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - If the starting material is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, treatment with BH3 produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - This indicates that the starting materials must be enantiomers (A = (R), B = (S)) to yield the observed stereochemical outcomes.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This cannot produce both (R) and (S) products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This also cannot produce both (R) and (S) products.
   - **Option C**: A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This would produce (S) and (R) products, respectively, but it does not match the given reaction results.
   - **Option D**: A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. This correctly matches the observed products: A with LiBH4 produces (R), and B with BH3 produces (S).

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for B, as described in **Option D**.

Answer: D
