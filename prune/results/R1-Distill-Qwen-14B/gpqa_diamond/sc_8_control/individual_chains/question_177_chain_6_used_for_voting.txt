Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is about their luminosities. I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. So the factors that influence luminosity must be the star's radius and temperature, right?

Wait, the problem says they're radiating as black bodies. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law comes into play here. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L depends on R squared and temperature to the fourth power.

The given data: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, does mass directly affect luminosity? I think mass might affect temperature, especially if we consider main sequence stars where more massive stars are hotter. Or maybe not directly, but in this problem, maybe the mass isn't directly used except for something else.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, the peak wavelength. That's from Wien's law, which says λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. Wait no, wait. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ_max is same, T must be the same. So T1 equals T2?

Wait, but wait. Wien's law for black bodies says λ_max * T = constant (approximately 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is same for both stars, then T must be same for both. So T1 = T2.

So then, their temperatures are the same. But wait, the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So I think that confirms T1 = T2.

But wait, another thought. Are the stars moving towards or away from us? Because the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. But how does radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Oh right, Doppler shift. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted (shorter wavelength), and if moving away, redshifted (longer wavelength). But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same.

Wait, but that complicates things. Because the stars' actual temperatures might be different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is same. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the peak emission is at same λ as observed. So the observed λ_max1 equals observed λ_max2. But because of Doppler shift, the actual emitted λ_max (from their rest frames) may be different.

So let me model this. Let's say Star_1 has velocity v1 = 0, so its emitted wavelength λ1_emitted is same as observed λ1_observed. Star_2 has velocity v2 = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (if it's moving towards, the Doppler shift would be opposite). But to find the actual temperatures, I need to correct for the Doppler effect.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, but if the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_observed > λ_emitted. Conversely, if moving towards us, v_r is negative, so λ_observed < λ_emitted.

But in this case, Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (so v is positive). So for Star_1, v1=0, so λ1_observed = λ1_emitted. For Star_2, λ2_observed = λ2_emitted * (1 + v_r2 / c), where c is speed of light.

But the problem says λ1_observed = λ2_observed. So,

λ1_emitted = λ2_emitted * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But λ is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ_emitted is proportional to 1/T. So,

(1/T1) = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Wait, because λ1_emitted = λ2_emitted * (1 + v_r2/c ), that would mean (1/T1) = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c ). Because λ_max ∝ 1/T.

Wait, wait, let me get that straight. The emitted λ_max for each star is λ_max_emitted_1 and λ_max_emitted_2. These are related to their temperatures via Wien's law: λ_max_emitted_1 = b / T1, λ_max_emitted_2 = b / T2, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

But the observed λ_max for each is λ_max_observed_1 and λ_max_observed_2. So,

λ_max_observed_1 = λ_max_emitted_1 * (1 + v_r1 / c )

Similarly,

λ_max_observed_2 = λ_max_emitted_2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

But for Star_1, v_r1 is 0, so λ_max_obs1 = λ_max_emit1.

For Star_2, v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let's see what the approximate value of v_r2/c is. 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 ≈ 0.002333. So (1 + v_r2/c) is approximately 1.002333. But wait, 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light? No, 700 km/s is 0.0023c. So the Doppler shift is small.

But let's compute it accurately. So, 700,000 m/s / 300,000,000 m/s = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = approximately 0.023333. Wait, 700,000 is 7e5, and 3e8 is 300 million. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

Wait, wait, 7e5 is 700,000; 3e8 is 300,000,000. So 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So the factor is 1 + 0.023333 ≈ 1.023333.

So, from the observed wavelengths being the same,

λ_max_obs_1 = λ_max_obs_2,

Which is:

λ_emit_1 = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But λ_emit_1 = b / T1,

λ_emit_2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1.023333)

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * 1.023333,

Which means,

T1 = T2 / 1.023333.

So,

T1 = T2 * (1 / 1.023333) ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So, T1 is approximately 0.977 * T2.

Wait, so T1 is lower than T2. But Star_1 has a larger radius. So when we calculate luminosity, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴.

So,

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2,

T1 = 0.977 T2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )² * (0.977 T2)⁴ ) / ( R2² T2⁴ )

Simplify:

( (2.25 R2²) * (0.977^4 T2^4) ) / ( R2² T2^4 )

The R2² and T2^4 terms cancel out.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (0.977^4 )

Now, calculate 0.977^4.

Let me compute that. 0.977 is approximately 0.977.

Compute 0.977^2: 0.977 * 0.977.

0.977 * 0.977:

= (1 - 0.023)^2 = 1 - 2*0.023 + 0.023^2 ≈ 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529 = approx 0.954529.

Then, 0.977^4 = (0.977^2)^2 ≈ (0.954529)^2.

Compute 0.954529 squared.

0.954529 * 0.954529.

Approximately:

Compute 0.95^2 = 0.9025.

But let's be more precise.

(0.954529)^2 = ?

Let me approximate it step by step.

= (0.95 + 0.004529)^2

= 0.95² + 2*0.95*0.004529 + (0.004529)^2

= 0.9025 + 2*(0.00429755) + 0.0000205.

= 0.9025 + 0.0085951 + 0.0000205 ≈ 0.9111156.

Wait, 0.9025 + 0.0085951 = 0.9110951; plus 0.0000205 gives about 0.9111156.

So, 0.977^4 ≈ 0.9111.

So putting it all together,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9111 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9111.

Compute 2 * 0.9111 = 1.8222.

0.25 * 0.9111 = 0.22778.

So total is 1.8222 + 0.22778 = 2.05 approximately.

Wait, wait, that's not matching any of the options. The options are around 2.23 to 2.35. So something must be wrong in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Doppler shift assumption. Let me recheck.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. Since the observed λ_max1 = λ_max_obs2, that would mean that λ_emit1 must be shorter than λ_emit2. Because λ_emit2 is multiplied by (1 + v_r/c) which is 1.023333, making it longer. So to have the observed λ same, λ_emit1 must be λ_emit2 / (1.023333). Because λ_emit1 * 1 = λ_emit2 * 1.023333.

Wait, let me write this again:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Because for Star_2, observed λ is longer, so λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, no, if the star is moving away, the observed λ is larger than emitted. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c), assuming v is positive when moving away.

So for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

Given that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But λ_emit1 = b / T1,

λ_emit2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which gives,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Which is,

T1 = T2 * [ 1 / (1 + (v_r2/c) ) ]

v_r2 is 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So,

1 + v_r2/c = 1 + (7e5)/(3e8) = 1 + 0.002333... ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T1 = T2 * (1 / 1.002333 ) ≈ T2 * 0.9977.

Wait, that's a bit different than before. Wait, earlier I thought T1 was 0.977 T2, but now I'm getting 0.9977 T2. Hmm, which is it?

Wait, let me re-calculate v_r2/c accurately.

v_r2 is 700,000 m/s.

c is 299,792,458 m/s, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So,

700000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

Wait, wait, that's 7e5 over 3e8. 7e5 is 700,000, 3e8 is 300,000,000. So 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.023333.

So,

(1 + v_r2/c) = 1.023333.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.023333 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, T1 = T2 * [ 1 / (1 + v_r2/c) ) ]

So,

1/(1.023333 ) is approx 0.977.

Yes, so T1 is about 0.977 T2.

So that part was correct earlier.

So L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * (0.977^4 )

Compute 1.5^2 = 2.25.

0.977^4: as before, approx 0.9111.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9111 ≈ 2.05.

But wait, the options are all around 2.23 to 2.35. So my calculation is leading to 2.05, which isn't one of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me think again. Maybe I messed up the Doppler shift.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the radial velocities are to be used in calculating the luminosity ratio, but I'm not sure how. Or maybe I'm supposed to consider that the velocities affect the flux received, not the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, no, the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming black body radiation. So the observed flux is affected by the star's velocity, but the intrinsic luminosity is a function of R and T. Wait, but the problem is about their luminosities, not the observed flux. So I think the Doppler effect affects the observed wavelength, which allows us to compute their intrinsic temperatures, which in turn affects the luminosity.

Wait, perhaps I should model the actual emitted wavelengths, not the observed. Because the observed wavelength is the same, but the emitted wavelengths may not be. So perhaps I should correct for the Doppler shift to find the intrinsic temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem differently.

Wait, the problem says that the stars are observed at the same λ_max, but their actual λ_max (emitted) may differ. Because of the Doppler effect.

So, let's consider:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 = (b / T1)

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which simplifies to 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Which, as before, is T1 = T2 * 0.977.

So, that part is correct.

So, now back to L:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4

So, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2,

T1 = 0.977 T2.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (0.977^4) = 2.25 * (0.977^4 )

Earlier, I approximated 0.977^4 as about 0.911, giving L1/L2 ≈ 2.05. But the options are around 2.23-2.35.

Hmm. So perhaps my approximation of 0.977^4 is too rough. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.977^4:

First compute 0.977 squared:

0.977 * 0.977.

Let me compute this more precisely.

977 * 977.

Wait, 977 * 977 = ?

Let me calculate step by step.

= (1000 - 23) * (1000 - 23) = 1000^2 - 2*1000*23 + 23^2 = 1,000,000 - 46,000 + 529 = 954,529.

So 0.977^2 = 0.954529.

Now, square that to get 0.954529^2.

Compute 0.954529 * 0.954529.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

0.954529 * 0.954529:

Let me write it as (a + b)^2 where a=0.95, b=0.004529.

Wait, but that might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, compute 0.954529 × 0.954529.

Let me compute 0.954529 × 0.954529:

First, 0.954529 × 0.954529:

= (approx) Let me compute 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

Then, considering the 0.004529 part.

Alternatively, let me compute (0.95 + 0.004529)^2 = 0.95² + 2*(0.95)*(0.004529) + (0.004529)^2.

= 0.9025 + (2 * 0.95 * 0.004529) + (0.004529)^2.

Compute each term:

2 * 0.95 * 0.004529 = 1.9 * 0.004529 ≈ 0.0086051.

(0.004529)^2 ≈ 0.0000205.

So,

0.9025 + 0.0086051 = 0.9111051,

plus 0.0000205 gives 0.9111256.

So, 0.954529^2 ≈ 0.9111256.

So 0.977^4 ≈ 0.9111256.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9111256 = ?

Compute 2 * 0.9111256 = 1.8222512,

0.25 * 0.9111256 = 0.2277814.

Adding them together: 1.8222512 + 0.2277814 = 2.0500326.

So approximately 2.05.

But the options are all above 2.2, which suggests I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler effect formula. Let me double-check. The Doppler shift formula can be more accurately expressed as:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, no, that's for relativistic speeds, but 700 km/s is about 0.23% of c, so non-relativistic. So the approximate formula λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v/c) is valid when v is much smaller than c.

But perhaps the problem expects to use the relativistic formula, but that's unlikely given the velocities are small.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the inverse. Because when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the emitted wavelength would be shorter.

Wait, but in our earlier approach, we had λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c ), which would make λ_emit1 longer than λ_emit2. But that can't be because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, so the actual emitted wavelength must be shorter. So perhaps I messed up the equation.

Let me think again. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c ), because the star is moving away (v_r2 positive). For Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1, since v_r1=0.

Given that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But from Wien's law, λ_emit1 = b / T1,

λ_emit2 = b / T2.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

→ 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Which is same as before.

So, that part is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute v_r2/c more accurately.

v_r2 = 700 km/s = 700,000 m/s.

c ≈ 2.99792e8 m/s.

So,

v_r2/c = 700,000 / 299,792,458 ≈ 0.0023367.

So,

1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.0023367.

So,

T1 = T2 / 1.0023367 ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So,

T1 ≈ 0.99767 * T2.

So,

T1^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4 T2^4.

Compute (0.99767)^4.

Compute 0.99767^2 first.

0.99767^2 = (approx) (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99334.

Wait, more accurately:

0.99767 × 0.99767.

Compute 99767 × 99767.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 0.99767^2:

= (0.99767) × (0.99767)

= approx 0.99535.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.99767 × 0.99767:

= (1 - 0.00233) × (1 - 0.00233)

= 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2

= 1 - 0.00466 + (0.0000054289)

= 0.99534289.

Wait, 0.00233 squared is about 0.0000054289.

So, 1 - 0.00466 = 0.99534, plus 0.0000054289 gives ~0.995345.

Now, the square of that is (0.995345)^2.

Compute 0.995345^2.

= (approx) (1 - 0.004655)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2.

= 1 - 0.00931 + 0.0000216.

= 0.9906916.

So, (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.9906916.

So,

T1^4 ≈ 0.9906916 T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 ) * (0.9906916 )

= 2.25 * 0.9906916 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Ah! So approximately 2.227. Which is close to option D, which is ~2.23.

So, the correct answer would be D) ~2.23.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had 2.05. Where did I go wrong? Oh, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of T1^4 earlier, because in the initial approach I used 0.977, but that was a mistake. The correct factor is 0.99767, which is very close to 1, so when I take it to the fourth power, the reduction is smaller.

Wait, let me retrace:

Earlier, I thought T1 was 0.977 T2, but that was incorrect. The correct calculation shows T1 is approximately 0.99767 T2. So when I compute T1^4, it's (0.99767)^4 ≈ 0.99069.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.99069) = 2.25 * 0.99069 ≈ 2.227.

Which is approximately 2.23, matching option D.

So, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the radii
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
R_1 = 1.5 R_2
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Relating the temperatures
The problem also states that the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{max, obs}}\)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit}} \cdot (1 + v_r/c)
\]

where \(v_r\) is the radial velocity and \(c\) is the speed of light. For Star_1 (\(v_{r1} = 0\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 1}}
\]

For Star_2 (\(v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s}\)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 2}} \cdot (1 + v_{r2}/c)
\]

Since \(\lambda_{\text{max, obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}}\), we equate the emitted wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, emit, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit, 2}} \cdot (1 + v_{r2}/c)
\]

From Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T\), so:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + v_{r2}/c}
\]

Substituting \(v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\):

\[
\frac{v_{r2}}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \approx 0.99767
\]

Thus:

\[
T_1 \approx 0.99767 T_2
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the luminosity ratio
Substitute \(T_1 = 0.99767 T_2\) into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 (0.99767 T_2)^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

Calculate \((0.99767)^4\):

\[
(0.99767)^2 \approx 0.99535, \quad (0.99535)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227
\]

### Step 4: Matching with the options
The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately \(2.23\), which matches option **D**.
