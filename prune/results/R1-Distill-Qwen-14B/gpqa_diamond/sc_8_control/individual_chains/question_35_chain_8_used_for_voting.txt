Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by a matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, I need to construct the matrix Ay first and then find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, let me write down the matrix S. So, S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay is c multiplied by this. So, substituting c = h/(4π), then:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

But wait, wait a second. Oh wait, maybe I should consider that S itself might be related to the Pauli matrices? Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and S looks like one of them. Let me think: the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh wait, σy is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Yes! So S is equal to σy. So, S = σy. That might help because Pauli matrices have known eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

But wait, the problem is about finding the eigenvalues of Ay. So, Ay is (h/(4π)) times σy.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are the solutions to the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Alternatively, since σy is a Pauli matrix, I remember that the eigenvalues of σy are ±i. Because Pauli matrices are Hermitian? Wait, no, wait. No, wait. No, wait a second. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, σy is actually Hermitian. Wait, let me check that. The Hermitian conjugate of σy would be its transpose and complex conjugate. So σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. The transpose is [[0,i],[-i,0]], and the complex conjugate of that is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is σy itself. So yes, σy is Hermitian. So, the eigenvalues should be real. But wait, I thought the eigenvalues of σy are ±i. That can't be right because if σy is Hermitian, its eigenvalues must be real. Did I mix it up?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing σy with iσy. Because if I consider S being σy, then the eigenvalues would be ±i, which would make Ay have eigenvalues (h/(4π)) * (±i), which is imaginary. But that can't be right because the intrinsic angular momentum operators (like components of spin) are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. Wait, but wait, the problem states that Ay is c times S, and S is a matrix given. 

Wait, but wait again. Let me think. The intrinsic angular momentum components (like Sx, Sy, Sz) are Hermitian operators, so their eigenvalues are real. So if Ay is c times S, and if S is not Hermitian, then Ay might not be Hermitian. But in the problem, S is given as a matrix, and I'm supposed to just work with the matrix given.

Wait, let me check. The matrix S is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Let me compute its Hermitian conjugate. The conjugate transpose would be [[0,i],[-i,0]], which is not the same as S because the (2,1) element is -i, not i. So S is not equal to its Hermitian conjugate. So S is not Hermitian. So Ay, which is c times S, is not Hermitian. That would mean that its eigenvalues can be complex. But that's a bit confusing because angular momentum components are Hermitian. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem defines S as a different matrix. Let me re-express S. Wait, S is a 2×2 matrix given as first row [0, -i], second row [i, 0]. So S is the same as the Pauli matrix σy multiplied by i. Because σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is exactly what S is. So S = σy. So then, is σy Hermitian? Let me check again. σy's Hermitian conjugate is σy itself. Because σy^† = σy. Because:

σy = [[0, -i],[i, 0]]

The conjugate transpose (Hermitian conjugate) is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Wait, that's not the same as σy. Oh wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me compute σy^†:

The (1,1) element is 0, (1,2) is i, (2,1) is -i, (2,2) is 0. So σy^† is [[0, i], [-i,0]], which is not the same as σy. So σy is not Hermitian. Hmm, that's confusing because I thought the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, σy is actually Hermitian. Because the Hermitian condition is σy^† = σy. Let me compute σy's conjugate transpose. 

The original σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate of each element: [0*, (-i)*], [i*, 0*] → [0, i], [-i, 0]. Now, the transpose of that would be [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σy again. So σy is Hermitian because σy^† = σy. So I must have made a mistake earlier. So S is σy, which is Hermitian. Therefore, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy, which would be Hermitian. So its eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but then earlier I thought the eigenvalues of σy are ±i, which would make Ay have eigenvalues (h/(4π)) * (±i), which are purely imaginary. But that can't be right because if Ay is Hermitian, its eigenvalues must be real. So where am I going wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the matrices. Let me double-check the eigenvalues of σy. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. No, wait, no. Let me compute the eigenvalues of σy.

The matrix σy is 2x2, so to find eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation:

det(σy - λ I) = 0.

Which is:

| -λ    -i     |
|  i     -λ    | = 0.

The determinant is (λ)^2 - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ^2 - ( (-i^2) ) = λ^2 - ( (-(-1)) ) because i^2 is -1. So (-i)(i) = -i^2 = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1 = 0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1. Oh, wait, that's it! So the eigenvalues of σy are +1 and -1. So Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy, so its eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * (±1) → ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. The options are all about the eigenvalues and possible statements regarding them.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are entirely real, so their imaginary parts would be zero. So option A is incorrect.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, real ±1. But our eigenvalues have real parts ±h/(4π), which is not ±1, so B is wrong.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Hmm, wait, for angular momentum operators, the square of the operator A² (which is S² here) commutes with the components. Because in quantum mechanics, [A_x, A_y] = iħ A_z, but [A², A_x] = 0, same for A_y and A_z.

Wait, so the eigenfunctions of A_y would also be eigenfunctions of A², because A² commutes with A_y. So option C says the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. But if they are eigenfunctions of A², which is S², and since S² is the square of the spin operator, which for spin-1/2 particles is ( (1/2)(1/2+1) )ħ² → (3/4)ħ². So if Ay has eigenvalues a, then A² would have eigenvalue (3/4)ħ². So the eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? Well, A² and Ay commute, so they can have simultaneous eigenfunctions. But whether they share the same eigenfunctions as Az depends. Because [Ay, Az] = iħ Ax, so they don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az because they don't commute. So option C's statement is correct: the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So C could be correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So the process of finding the eigenvalues: I think the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π). So looking at the options, which one aligns with that.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says that Ay is c·S, and S is a 2x2 matrix. So Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it can have two eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are ±c. So c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are ±h/(4π).

Looking at the options, none of the options A or B mention this. Option A talks about imaginary parts, which are wrong. Option B's eigenvalues are ±1/2 and ±1, which don't match.

So perhaps the correct eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), real numbers. So then, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Looking at the options again:

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix Ay given. Hmm, not sure. Basis functions are typically the eigenvectors, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the matrix is 2x2, so it has two eigenvectors which form a basis.

But let's think about each option.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

As I thought earlier, A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenvectors. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², correct. And since Ay and Az don't commute (since [Ay, Az] = iħ Ax), their eigenfunctions don't coincide. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, option D: the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Well, the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of Ay, which form a basis for the vector space (since it's 2x2 and diagonalizable if the eigenvalues are distinct). So D could be correct as well.

Wait, but the statement in D is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I'm a bit confused by the wording. Basis functions are the set of vectors that form a basis. So the eigenfunctions would form a basis if they are linearly independent, which they are because the eigenvalues are distinct. So D's statement could also be correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. Let me re-examine the options.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given. So the matrix operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which is true. But the statement in D is a bit ambiguous. So which option is correct?

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are statements about which is correct during the calculation.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), which are real. So any option that talks about the eigenvalues must align with that.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az, which is correct.

Option D is correct in the sense that the eigenvectors form a basis, but I'm not sure if that's the correct statement. The question is, which statement is correct during the calculation.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but let me think again about the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so their eigenvectors can be the same. But since Az doesn't commute with Ay, the eigenvectors of Ay are not eigenvectors of Az. So C is correct.

So the answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix \( S \) and Its Properties**:  
   The matrix \( S \) matches the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \), which is Hermitian. This ensures that \( A_y \) is also Hermitian since it is a scalar multiple of a Hermitian matrix. Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues.

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)**:  
   The eigenvalues of \( S \) (or \( \sigma_y \)) are \( \pm 1 \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

3. **Eigenfunctions of \( A_y \)**:  
   The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) correspond to the eigenvectors of \( S \). Since \( A_y \) is a 2×2 matrix with distinct eigenvalues, its eigenvectors form a complete basis for the 2-dimensional space.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are entirely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).  
   - **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).  
   - **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so their eigenfunctions can coincide. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).  
   - **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) do form a basis for the 2-dimensional space, the phrasing of this option is ambiguous and less precise than Option C.

### Conclusion:  
The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).
