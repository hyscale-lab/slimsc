Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that in quantum mechanics, states and operators are represented using vectors and matrices, and probabilities are related to the square of the amplitudes. 

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin, they form an orthonormal basis. So the state is a linear combination of these two, but it's proportional, which probably means we need to normalize it.

First, I should probably write the state as a vector. Let me see, |up> is (1, 0) and |down> is (0,1) in the standard basis. So |alpha> would be proportional to [1+i, 2-i]. To make it a proper state vector, I need to normalize it. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components.

Calculating the magnitude squared of each component:
- For (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
- For (2 - i), it's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "proportional to", so we need to confirm. Right, the initial state is proportional, so we have to normalize it. So yes, the actual state is (1+i, 2 -i) multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), as the normalization factor.

Next part: the operator whose matrix elements A_ij are such that A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is 2x2 because the spin states are 2-level. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Because for i≠j, the elements are ħ/2, and the diagonal is zero.

Wait, this looks familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply by ħ/2, you get the A matrix given.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. So the operator here has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues are ħ/2 * 2 since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Wait, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli X matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when our matrix is (ħ/2) X, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2) *1 and (ħ/2)*(-1) → ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, no, no. Because the Pauli X matrix is σ_x, which has eigenvalues ±1. So if our operator is (ħ/2) σ_x, then its eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

But wait, the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix, which has two eigenvalues and two eigenstates. So when we measure the operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes when the state is expressed in the eigenbasis.

So first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of this operator. The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as I said. So I can write |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.

Once I have c1 and c2, the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

So the plan is:

1. Express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of the operator A.
2. Compute the probabilities.
3. Compute the average value of A, which is the expectation value <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, the average can be found using the eigenvalues and probabilities. Because the expectation value is the sum of probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, let me clarify. The expectation value is the sum over the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities. So if the eigenvalues are λ1 and λ2, and the probabilities are p1 and p2, then <A> = λ1 p1 + λ2 p2.

But let me think: the operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So λ1 = ħ/2, λ2 = -ħ/2.

So once I find the probabilities p1 and p2, I can compute the average.

Alternatively, since the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

But to compute that, it's the same as (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_x for the state |alpha>.

But perhaps it's easier to find the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

So let's proceed.

First, let me write |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So any state can be expressed as a linear combination of these. Let's express |alpha> in this basis.

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

So let me substitute |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

= (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ] |+x> / sqrt(2) + [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * |-x> / sqrt(2)

Let me compute the coefficients:

Coefficient of |+x>: [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) / sqrt(2) → [ (3 + 0i) ] / sqrt(7 * 2 ) → 3 / sqrt(14)

Coefficient of |-x>: [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) / sqrt(2) → [ (1+i -2 +i) ] / sqrt(14) → (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

So |alpha> = [3 / sqrt(14)] |+x> + [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ] |-x>

Wait, but wait, are these coefficients correct?

Let me double-check the computation:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1+ i +2 -i = 3 → numerator is 3.

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

Yes.

So the coefficients are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

But wait, the state must be normalized. Let me compute the norm:

|3/sqrt(14)|^2 + | (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |^2 = (9 + [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ]) /14 → (9 + 5)/14 =14/14 =1. So that's correct.

Now, the probabilities are |3/sqrt(14)|^2 and |(-1 +2i)/sqrt(14)|^2.

Compute |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.64286...

| (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |^2 is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] /14 → (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, but the options don't have 0.64 and 0.36, except option A. Hmm.

Wait, but let me compute 9/14 and 5/14.

9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places.

5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which rounds to 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So the first part of the answer would be 0.64 and 0.36.

Now for the average value. The average is the sum of each probability multiplied by its corresponding eigenvalue.

The eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = (9ħ/28) - (5ħ/28) ) = (4ħ/28) = ħ/7.

Wait, yes: 9 -5 =4, so 4/28 = 1/7. So the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that would match.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D has 2hbar/sqrt(7), which is larger than ħ/7, so probably not. Option B has 3hbar/sqrt(7), which is even larger. Option C is ħ/sqrt(7), which is about 0.377 ħ, but our average is ħ/7 about 0.142 ħ.

So based on this, the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait, I should also compute the expectation value another way to confirm.

Alternatively, the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], let's compute this.

First, |alpha> is (1+i, 2−i)/sqrt(7).

So <alpha| is [ (1−i)(2+i) , (2 +i)(1 −i) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the state is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i), (2−i) ] / sqrt(7)

So the conjugate transpose is [ (1−i), (2+i) ] / sqrt(7).

So <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1−i), (2+i) ] (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] [ (1+i), (2−i) ] /7.

Compute the product step by step.

Matrix A is [[0, 1],[1, 0]], multiplied by (ħ/2).

So compute [ (1−i) (2 +i) ] multiplied by (ħ/2) times the product of the vectors.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| A |alpha> as (ħ/2) * <alpha| σ_x |alpha>, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

The expectation value of σ_x is (alpha_x), which for a state (a, b) is a* b + a b*.

Wait, no. Wait, for σ_x, the expectation value is (a* b + a b*) where a and b are the components of the state vector.

Wait, let me think: for a general state |psi> = a |up> + b |down>, the expectation value of σ_x is (a b* + a* b).

Because σ_x is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so the expectation value is (a* b + b* a).

So in our case, a = (1 +i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7), b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = (1 -i)(2 -i) /7 → (2 -i -2i +i^2) /7 → (2 -3i -1)/7 → (1 -3i)/7.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1 +i)/7 → (2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 ) → (2 +3i -1)/7 → (1 +3i)/7.

So a* b + b* a = [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] /7 = (2)/7.

So the expectation value of σ_x is 2/7.

Thus, the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) )= ħ/7.

Which matches our earlier calculation. So that's correct.

So the average value is ħ/7.

So putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So the correct answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). Since \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) form an orthonormal basis, we normalize \( |\alpha\rangle \) by dividing by the normalization factor \( \sqrt{7} \), resulting in:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( \sigma_x \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle \), \( |-x\rangle \) basis. Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle) \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we get:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} |+x\rangle + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} |-x\rangle.
\]

The coefficients of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \) and \( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \), respectively. The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

To calculate the average value of \( A \), we use the expectation value formula:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value of \( A \) is related to the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \). For a state \( | \psi \rangle = a |\uparrow\rangle + b |\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is \( a^* b + a b^* \). Substituting \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \) and \( b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \), we compute:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} + \frac{(1+i)(2+i)}{7} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
