Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energy, we often use the formula for the potential energy between two point charges. 

So, the setup is that there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, wait, wait. Oh, right, e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 C, so 2e would be about 3.204 x 10^-19 C each.

But wait, the problem says 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Oh, so the 13th is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, the system consists of a central charge and 12 surrounding charges.

Wait, because all the charges are the same, right? So, each has charge 2e. So, the central charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e as well.

So, what's the potential energy of the system? I think potential energy in a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But since the system is isolated, and we're looking for the minimum energy, maybe we can think about the configuration that gives the lowest possible potential energy.

Wait, but in this case, the charges are arranged such that 12 are at 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So, each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th.

So each of the 12 charges is interacting with the central charge. So, the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 and the central charge.

Wait, but wait, do we need to consider the potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges themselves? Because they are identical charges and they are all at the same distance from each other? Or are they arranged in a way that they are each at 2 meters from P but possibly at different distances from each other?

Hmm, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, perhaps they're on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 meters. So, each of the 12 is on the sphere's surface, but their distances from each other depend on their positions on the sphere. But wait, in this problem, maybe we don't need to consider the potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges themselves because the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the entire system. Hmm, but wait, the minimum energy would take into account all interactions, right?

Wait, no, wait a second. Because the problem is about the energy of the entire system. So, the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. So, that includes the 12 charges at 2 meters from P each, and the central charge at P.

So, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the central charge is 2e. So, the potential energy between each pair is (k * q1 * q2) / r, where q1 and q2 are both 2e, and r is 2 meters.

So, let's break it down. There's the central charge and each of the 12. So, 12 pairs, each contributing a term.

Now, but wait, what about the potential energy between the surrounding 12 charges? Are they all at 2m, but their mutual distances are varying. Are the 12 charges arranged in a way that they are all equidistant from each other? Like, perhaps arranged as vertices of an icosahedron or something? But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe in this case, we can assume that the surrounding 12 are fixed in their positions, or perhaps they are point charges on a sphere, but don't affect each other's potential energy because of symmetry?

Wait, no. Because each charge would have potential energy interactions with every other charge. So, the total U is the sum over all pairs. So, the system has U = sum over all pairs of (k * q_i * q_j) / r_ij.

But the problem is that without knowing the exact positions of the 12 charges relative to each other, it's impossible to calculate their mutual potential energy. So, perhaps the question is only considering the energy between the central charge and the other 12, not among themselves. Because the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are not specified. So maybe the question is only considering the central charge's interactions, and the rest are fixed. But that doesn't make sense, because the potential energy of the system would include all interactions.

Wait, but wait, the problem says it's the minimum energy of the system. So, perhaps the minimal energy is achieved when the surrounding charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is minimized, perhaps when they are as far apart as possible. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the surrounding charges is zero, which isn't the case. No, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the 12 charges are so arranged that their mutual distances are so that their potential energies sum to zero, which I don't think is correct.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's read the problem again. It says, "What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system correct to three decimals?"

Wait, perhaps the system's energy is only that between the 13th charge (central) and the other 12. Because the other 12 are all at the same distance from the central charge, so each contributes the same potential energy.

So, U = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 meters)

Wait, but wait, because each pair is a central charge and a surrounding charge. So, the central charge is 2e, each surrounding is 2e, distance 2 m. So, each pair's potential energy is k*(2e)^2 / 2.

But wait, each pair. So, the total would be 12 times that.

But wait, let me think. Because each surrounding charge contributes to the potential energy of the central charge. But the formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k*q1*q2 / r. So, for each of the 12, the U is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2 m). So, 12 * [k*(4e²)/(2)] = 12 * [2 k e² ] = 24 k e².

But wait, is that correct? Because when you have a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, the central charge is interacting with each of the 12, each contributing U_i.

But when the central charge is fixed, the potential energy of each surrounding charge is U_i = (k * 2e * 2e) / 2m. So, each U_i is (k * 4e²) / (2m) = 2 k e² / m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 2 k e² / 2 = k e². So, each surrounding charge contributes U_i = k e².

Then, since there are 12 surrounding charges, the total is 12 * k e².

Wait, but wait, no. Let me double-check the calculation.

Each pair (central and surrounding) is 2e * 2e, so 4e².

r is 2 m, so U for each pair is k * 4e² / 2 = 2 k e².

Wait, no, wait: 4e² / 2 is 2e². So, U per pair is 2 k e².

Wait, no: 4e² / 2 is 2e², so U per pair is k * 2e².

So, each pair contributes 2 k e².

There are 12 such pairs, so total U is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, but that's 24 times k times e squared.

Wait, but wait, the formula for the potential energy is the sum over all pairs. So, in this case, the only pairs are the central charge and each of the 12. So, 12 pairs, each contributing k*(2e)^2 / 2 m.

So, each U is k*(4e²) / (2 m) = (4k e² )/(2m) = 2k e²/(m).

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 2k e²/(2) = k e².

So, each pair contributes k e², and 12 pairs contribute 12 * k e².

Wait, that's 12 k e².

Hmm, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Each pair is between the central charge (2e) and a surrounding charge (2e). The distance between them is 2 meters.

So, U for each pair is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m.

That's (4 e² k) / (2 m) = (2 e² k) / m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 2 e² k / 2 = e² k.

So, each pair contributes e² k.

Since there are 12 pairs, the total U is 12 * e² k.

Wait, that's correct. So U = 12 * e² * k.

Wait, but I'm forgetting that in the formula for potential energy, each pair is counted once. So, if I have 13 charges, the central one and 12 others, each of the 12 contributes a pair with the central one. So, 12 pairs.

So, yes, U = 12 * (k * (2e)^2) / 2m.

Wait, let me compute that.

e is 1.6e-19 C.

So, (2e) is 3.2e-19 C.

So, (2e)^2 is (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N m²/C².

r is 2 meters.

So, each pair's U is (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / 2.

Compute that:

8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = let's compute 8.988 *10.24 = approximately 92.14, and the exponent is 9 + (-38) = -29. So, 92.14e-29.

Divide by 2: 46.07e-29 = 4.607e-28.

So each pair is about 4.607e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 4.607e-28 = 55.284e-28 = 5.5284e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, let me do the exact calculation.

Wait, 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 8.988 * 10.24 = let me compute that:

8 * 10 is 80, 8 * 0.24 is 1.92, 0.988 * 10 is 9.88, 0.988 * 0.24 is approx 0.237. So adding them all up:

80 + 1.92 = 81.92; 9.88 + 0.237 = 10.117. So total is 81.92 +10.117 = 92.037. So the product is 92.037e(9-38)=92.037e-29.

Divide by 2: 46.0185e-29 = 4.60185e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.60185e-28 *12 = 55.2222e-28 = 5.5222e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, the options are A) 5.645e-26, B) 2.822e-26, C) 7.056e-27, D) 122.330.

Hmm, none of the options is 5.5e-27. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between all pairs, including the mutual potential energies between the 12 surrounding charges. Because so far, I only considered the central charge's interactions.

So, each of the 12 surrounding charges is 2e, and they are all at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances vary. But since the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, perhaps their mutual distances are from each other are not all the same, but perhaps in a symmetrical arrangement. But without knowing the exact positions, it's impossible to compute their mutual potential energies.

Wait, but perhaps the 12 surrounding charges are arranged in a way that each is equidistant from each other. But I don't think that's possible with 12 points on a sphere. Wait, no, because for example, in a regular icosahedron, you have 12 vertices, but each has a certain distance from others. So for each pair of surrounding charges, the distance between them would be the same as each other? Wait, no, that's not correct. Each surrounding charge would have different distances to others. For example, in an icosahedron, each vertex has a certain number of adjacent vertices at a certain distance, and others at a larger distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges are zero because they are all arranged in a way that their potentials cancel each other, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the central charge and the surrounding charges, not the mutual interactions among the surrounding charges. Because the problem says 'the minimum energy', and perhaps the mutual interactions can't be avoided, making the calculation more complicated. So, perhaps the problem expects only the interaction energy between the central charge and the surrounding 12.

In that case, the U would be 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), which we calculated as approximately 5.52e-27 J.

Looking at the options again:

A) 5.645e-26 --> 56.45e-27

B) 2.822e-26 --> 28.22e-27

C) 7.056e-27 --> 7.056e-27

D) 122.330 --> way larger.

So, my calculation gives around 5.5e-27 J. But option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 0.7 times higher. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check my steps again.

Each surrounding charge is 2e, central charge 2e, distance 2m.

Each pair's U is (k*(2e)*(2e))/2m.

So, 8.988e9 * (2e)^2 / 2.

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e². So,

U per pair = (8.988e9) * (4e²) / (2 * 2).

Wait, wait, wait. No, the denominator is just the distance, 2 meters. So, 8.988e9 * (4e²) / 2.

Wait, 4e² is (2e)^2 = 4e² = 4*(1.6e-19)^2.

So, U per pair = (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.6e-19)^2) / 2.

Wait, so 4*(1.6e-19)^2 is 4*(2.56e-38) = 10.24e-38.

So, 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 92.0e-29 (approx), then divide by 2 (because distance is 2 m, so denominator is 2).

Wait, no, wait. The denominator is 2, so 92.0e-29 / 2 = 46.0e-29 = 4.6e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 4.6e-28 *12 = 55.2e-28 =5.52e-27 J.

So that's 5.52e-27 J.

But none of the options is exactly that. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is about 30% higher.

Wait, maybe I messed up considering whether the potential is the sum of all pairs, including the central charge, or perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: when calculating the potential energy of a system of charges, each pair is counted once. So, in this case, the central charge and each surrounding charge. So, 12 pairs, each U_i is (k*(2e)^2)/2m.

So, U = 12 * (k*(4e²)/(2m)).

Wait, that's 12 * (2 k e² / m).

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 2/(2) =1. So, U = 12 * 2 k e² * (1/m) * (1/2).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused again.

Wait, another approach: U_total is the sum over all pairs. But in this scenario, all the pairs are between the central charge and the 12 surrounding. So, 12 pairs, each contributing U = (k q1 q2)/r.

So, U_total = 12 * (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m).

So, 12 * (4e² k)/(2m).

Which simplifies to 12 * (2e² k)/m.

Since m=2, it's 12 * (2e² k)/(2) )= 12 * e² k.

So, U_total = 12 e² k.

Wait, that's the same as before.

e is 1.6e-19 C.

So, e² is (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C².

So, U = 12 * (2.56e-38) * (8.988e9).

Compute that: 12 * 2.56e-38 = 30.72e-38.

30.72e-38 *8.988e9 = ?

30.72e-38 *8.988e9 = 30.72 *8.988e-29.

30.72 *8.988 is approximately:

30 *9 =270, 0.72*9=6.48, so 270 + 6.48=276.48. But let's compute more accurately.

30.72 *8.988.

30.72 *8 = 245.76.

30.72 *0.988= approx 30.72 *1=30.72 minus 30.72*0.012=0.36864 → 30.72 -0.36864=30.35136.

So total is 245.76 +30.35136=276.11136.

So, 276.11136e-29 → 2.7611136e-27 J.

Wait, but that's 2.76e-27 J. So, which option is closer?

Looking at the options:

Option B is 2.822e-26 → 28.22e-27.

Option C is 7.056e-27.

Hmm, my calculation gives about 2.76e-27, which is close to option B if I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, wait, 2.76e-27 is 0.276e-26, which is 2.76e-27, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Because when considering all the pairs in the system, each surrounding charge contributes a pair with the central charge. So, 12 pairs. So, that should be correct.

Wait, maybe I forgot that the potential energy is actually the work required to assemble the system. So, when you bring the charges into place, you have to consider each charge individually.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the already placed charges.

So, the first charge is placed at P (the central one). Then, each of the 12 surrounding charges is brought into place, each a distance of 2 m from P.

The potential at P due to the central charge is zero when the central charge is placed there. Wait, no, the central charge is fixed. So, when bringing each surrounding charge, the potential at P due to the other surrounding charges is zero because the other surrounding charges have not been placed yet.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The central charge is fixed. So, when placing the first surrounding charge, the potential at P due to the central charge is U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So, the potential energy of that charge is 2 k e².

When placing the second surrounding charge, the potential at P is still the same because the central charge is there, and the first surrounding charge is already in place.

Wait, but wait, the potential at P due to the 12 surrounding charges would be the sum of potentials from each. So, for the second surrounding charge, the potential at P is (k*(2e) )/ (2m) * 12? No, wait, no. Because when placing the second charge, only the central charge is present. The first surrounding charge is at 2m from P, so the potential at P due to the first surrounding charge is (k*(2e))/ (2m) = k e / m.

Wait, that's the potential, not the potential energy.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The potential energy of each charge when placed is the charge times the potential at the point where it's being placed.

So, the central charge is fixed. Let's say it's the first charge.

Then, when placing the first surrounding charge, the potential at its position (2 m from P) is due to the central charge.

The potential at that point is V = (k * 2e) / (2m).

So, the potential energy for this first surrounding charge is q * V = (2e) * [k (2e) / (2 m)].

Which is (2e) * [k (2e) / (2 * 2)].

Wait, wait, let me compute this.

The potential at the position of the first surrounding charge is V = (k * 2e) / (2m).

So, the potential energy is U1 = (2e) * V = (2e) * (k * 2e)/(2m) = [4 e² k ]/(2m) = (2 e² k)/(m).

Since m is 2, this is (2 e² k)/2 = e² k.

So, U1 = e² k.

Then, when placing the second surrounding charge, the potential at its position (2m from P) is due to the central charge and the first surrounding charge.

So, V = [k (2e) / (2 m)] + [k (2e) / (r)], where r is the distance between the first and second surrounding charges.

But wait, the distance between the first and second surrounding charges is not given. Oh, that's the problem again.

Wait, perhaps the 12 surrounding charges are arranged such that each is 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are all the same, perhaps in a regular dodecahedron or something. But without knowing that, it's impossible to compute their mutual potential.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are considered to be zero, which is not correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and the surrounding charges, not the mutual potential energies among the 12. Because if that's the case, then the total U is 12 * (k*(2e)^2/(2m)).

Which gives U = 12 * (k * 4 e²)/(2m) → 12 * (2 k e²/m).

With m=2, that's 12 * (2 k e²)/(2) → 12 k e².

Wait, but that would be 12 * k e².

Hmm, but earlier calculations gave 12 * (k * 4e²) / (2m) → 12 * (2 k e²)/(2) → 12 k e².

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let's compute 12 * k e².

e is 1.6e-19 C.

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C².

So, e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So, 12 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Compute:

12 * 8.988e9 = 107.856e9.

107.856e9 * 2.56e-38 = (107.856 * 2.56) e-29.

107.856 * 2.56: 100 *2.56=256; 7.856 *2.56≈20.15 → total ≈276.15.

So, 276.15e-29 → 2.7615e-27 J.

So again, that's 2.76e-27 J.

Hmm, looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26 → which is 28.22e-27. Option C is 7.056e-27.

Wait, 2.76e-27 isn't exactly any of the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all the surrounding charges are at 2 meters from P, but when considering the potential energy contributions, perhaps I should have considered that each surrounding charge contributes to the potential of the others.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating all the 12 charges as being at the same point as the central charge, but that doesn't make sense because they are constrained to be 2m away.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the central charge and one surrounding charge, but that can't be because the problem says 12 are constrained.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the exponents. Let me compute the numbers again.

Compute 12 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9.

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

So:

12 * 8.988e9 = 107.856e9.

107.856e9 * 2.56e-38 = 107.856 * 2.56 = let's compute that.

107.856 * 2 = 215.712.

107.856 * 0.56 = approx 60.32.

So total ≈ 215.712 +60.32=276.032.

So, 276.032e9 * e-38 = 276.032e-29 → 2.76032e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.76e-27 J.

Looking at the options, none match exactly. The closest option is option B: 2.822e-26, which is 28.22e-27. That's about 10 times higher than my calculation. Wait, no, 2.822e-26 is 28.22e-27, which is about 10 times 2.822e-26 is 2.822e-26 J.

Wait, but my calculation is 2.76e-27 J. So, that's about 1/10th of option B.

So, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 2 cm instead of 2 meters. Oh, but the problem says 2 meters. So that can't be.

Alternative mistake: perhaps I forgot that each pair contributes twice the energy, but no, in the calculation, each pair is counted once.

Wait, maybe the calculation should be (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) multiplied by 12, which is what I did.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check the units.

k is in N·m²/C², e is in C, so e² is C². r is in meters.

So, (k * e²) has units N·m²/C² * C² → N·m² → which is J·m.

Wait, but when divided by r, it becomes (N·m²) / m = N·m = J. So the units are correct.

Hm. So the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be approximately 2.76e-27 J.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times my result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Let me think again. When you have 12 surrounding charges, each interacting with the central charge, that's 12 pairs. So, 12 interactions each contributing U = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, but wait, each of the 12 charges is 2e. So, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 and the central charge, which is U = 12 * [ (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ].

Which is 12 * [ (4e² k) / (2m) ] = 12 * [ 2 e² k / m ].

With m=2, it's 12 * (2 e² k ) / 2 → 12 e² k.

So, that's correct.

So, 12 * e² k = 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute that:

12 * 8.988e9 = 107.856e9.

(1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

Multiply 107.856e9 * 2.56e-38:

107.856e9 = 1.07856e11.

1.07856e11 * 2.56e-38 = (1.07856 *2.56) e-27.

1.07856 *2.56 ≈ 2.762.

So, 2.762e-27 J.

So, that's 2.762e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is approximately 2.56 times that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e².

Wait, wait, e is 1.6e-19 C.

So, (2e)^2 = (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

So, k*(2e)^2 =8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = 92.14e-29.

Divided by 2m (4m?), wait, no, the distance is 2m.

So, each pair contributes 92.14e-29 / 2 =46.07e-29 J.

Multiply by 12: 46.07e-29 *12=552.84e-29=5.5284e-27 J.

So, 5.5284e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)7.056e-27, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the 12 surrounding charges are identical and their mutual potential energy is also considered.

But without knowing their arrangement, it's impossible to calculate their mutual potential energy. So perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, not their mutual interactions.

In that case, the U is approximately 5.5e-27 J, which is closest to option C)7.056e-27, but it's not exact.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the potential energy as the sum of all possible pairs. So, that includes the central charge and each of the 12, as well as all the pairs among the 12.

But since the 12 are arranged on a sphere, their mutual distances vary, but perhaps the problem is considering them to form a regular dodecahedron or some other symmetric arrangement where each pair is equidistant. But I don't know the exact distance between any two surrounding charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the central charge and each surrounding charge, so the U is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Which gives 12 * (4e² k)/(2m) → 12 * (2 e² k)/m.

With m=2, it's 12 * (2 e² k)/(2) → 12 e² k.

So, 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Wait, 1.6e-19 squared is 2.56e-38.

So, 12 *8.988e9 is 107.856e9.

107.856e9 *2.56e-38= 2.76e-27 J.

So, 2.76e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but that's 10 times higher than my calculation.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the charges are 2e each, but the central charge is 2e, and the others are -2e? No, the problem says all are 2e.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the exponents. Let me compute 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) again.

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e) =2*(1.6e-19 C) =3.2e-19 C.

So, (2e)^2= 10.24e-38 C².

Distance r=2 m.

So, U per pair: (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / 2.

Compute that:

8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = (8.988 *10.24) e^(9-38) =92.000...e-29.

Divide by 2:46.000e-29 J.

Multiply by 12:46.000e-29 *12=552e-29=5.52e-27 J.

So, 5.52e-27 J.

Which is approximately 5.52e-27 J.

Looking at the options, none match exactly.

Wait, the options are:

A)5.645e-26 →56.45e-27

B)2.822e-26→28.22e-27

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330.

Hmm, 5.52e-27 is closest to option C, but it's not exact.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge contributes to the potential of all the other charges, but since the central charge is fixed, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum of each surrounding charge's potential energy in the field of the central charge and the other surrounding charges.

But without knowing the distances between the surrounding charges, that would require knowing their arrangement, which isn't provided. So, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy between the 12 surrounding charges is zero, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered to be part of the system. But without specific information, perhaps the question expects only the central charge's contribution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem intended to have 12 charges each at 2 meters from each other, but that's not what the question says. The question says the 12 are at 2 meters from point P.

So, perhaps the mutual potential energy terms are negligible, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be zero, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. For example, when considering all pairs, including the central charge and each surrounding, that's 12 pairs. But if I considered all possible pairs, including among the 12, which is 12 choose 2 = 66 pairs, but without knowing their distances, that's impossible.

An alternative approach is to assume that the 12 surrounding charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, which is only possible in a specific arrangement, but that's not a realistic assumption.

I think the problem is only considering the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, so the energy is 12 * U per pair, which is 5.52e-27 J. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the potential energy as the sum of each charge's potential energy in the field of all other charges.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. So, the central charge and each surrounding charge is 12 pairs, and the surrounding charges among themselves are 12C2 = 66 pairs, but without knowing their mutual distances, it's impossible to calculate. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the central charge's contribution, which is 5.5e-27 J. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each charge as being placed under the potential of all other charges, leading to a higher energy.

But without knowing the arrangement, it's impossible to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the 12 charges are at a distance of 2 meters from each other as well as from the central charge, but that's not stated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 2 meters. But that's not possible for 12 charges on a sphere. 12 points can't all be 2 meters apart from each other.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I don't see how my calculation would reach that.

Wait, let me compute 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) again with exact numbers.

k =8.988e9 N·m²/C².

(2e) =3.2e-19 C.

(2e)^2=10.24e-38 C².

r=2m.

So, per pair U = (8.988e9 * 10.24e-38) / 2.

Let me compute that:

8.988e9 *10.24e-38 =8.988 *10.24 =92.096 → 92.096e-29.

Divide by 2 →46.048e-29 J.

Multiply by 12 →46.048e-29 *12= 552.576e-29=5.52576e-27 J.

Which is approximately 5.526e-27 J.

Still doesn't match any option. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy in a different unit, such as electronvolts, but the options are in Joules.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be zero, but that's not correct.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the energy per pair again.

U_per_pair = (k * (2e)^2)/(2m)

= (8.988e9) * ( (3.2e-19)^2 ) / (2 * 2)

Wait, (3.2e-19)^2 =10.24e-38.

So,

(8.988e9) * 10.24e-38 /4.

So,

(8.988e9 * 10.24e-38) = 92.096e-29.

Divide by 4 →23.024e-29.

Multiply by 12 →23.024e-29 *12=276.288e-29=2.76288e-27 J.

Ah, now that's about 2.76e-27 J.

Hmm, but that's still not matching any of the options.

Wait, wait, why did I divide by 4? Because 2m is 2 meters, so r=2. So, 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 is 92.096e-29, and then divided by 2 →46.048e-29.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Wait, I'm really confused now. Maybe I should look for any calculation mistakes again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numbers more accurately.

Compute 8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 / (2 * 2).

(3.2e-19)^2 =10.24e-38.

8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = (8.988 *10.24) *1e-(38-9).

8.988 *10.24 = let's compute:

8 *10 =80.

8*0.24=1.92 → 81.92.

0.988 *10 =9.88.

0.988 *0.24=0.23712 → total 9.88 +0.23712=10.11712.

So total 81.92 +10.11712=92.03712.

So, 92.03712e-29.

Divide by 2 (because r=2):46.01856e-29.

Multiply by 12:46.01856e-29 *12=552.2227e-29=5.522227e-27 J.

So, 5.522e-27 J.

But again, none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct option is not listed. But assuming the options are correct, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the problem is only considering the potential energy between the central charge and one surrounding charge, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all pairs, including the mutual interactions, but without knowing their arrangement, perhaps it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 surrounding charges are arranged in a way where each is equidistant from each other, but that's impossible with 12 points on a sphere.

Wait, perhaps it's a cube arrangement. On a cube, each vertex is √3 times the edge length away from the opposite vertex. But no, that's not helpful.

I'm stuck. I think the correct approach is to assume that the problem is only considering the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, leading to U =12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) =5.52e-27 J. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the exponent calculations.

Wait, 12 * (8.988e9) * (3.2e-19)^2 / (2*2).

Wait, (3.2e-19)^2 is 10.24e-38.

So,

12 * 8.988e9 =107.856e9.

107.856e9 *10.24e-38 = (107.856 *10.24) e-29.

107.856 *10.24 → Let's compute:

107 *10=1070.

107 *0.24=25.68.

0.856 *10=8.56.

0.856 *0.24=0.20544.

So, total:

1070 +25.68=1095.68 +8.56=1104.24 +0.20544=1104.44544.

So, 1104.44544e-29.

Divide by (2*2=4): 1104.44544e-29 /4 =276.11136e-29=2.7611e-27 J.

So, same as before.

So, I think the correct energy is approximately 2.76e-27 J, but the options don't have this. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, but it's about twice as high.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential of all others, leading to a higher energy. But without knowing the mutual distances, it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be calculated as (12 choose 2) pairs, but that would require knowing their mutual distances.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. Wait, no, the central charge and 12 others, each are 12 pairs.

I think I'm stuck and can't find the correct option in the given choices. But perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26 J, but I don't see how that would be correct.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs. What if the problem counts each pair twice, leading to 24 pairs instead of 12? That would give 24 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 5.52e-26 J. But that's option A)5.645e-26, which is close.

Wait, why would I double the number of pairs? Because each pair is counted once in the sum. So, for example, the central charge and charge 1 is one pair, and charge 1 and the central is the same, but in reality, each pair is considered once.

Wait, no, the calculation is correct as 12 pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each surrounding charge's self-energy, which is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy between all charges, including the central charge and the 12 others, and the 12 others among themselves. So, the total number of pairs is 13 choose 2 =78 pairs. But without knowing the mutual distances between the 12, it's impossible.

But perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual distances between the 12 are 2 meters as well, which would mean each pair among them contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2m). So, 66 pairs each contributing U= (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So, total U would be 12*U1 +66*U2, where U1 is the central and surrounding, U2 is the surrounding-surronding.

But since U2 = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), and there are 66 such pairs.

So, U_total =12 * U1 +66 * U2.

But earlier, U1 is (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (4e² k )/(2m) =2 e² k/m.

Wait, with m=2, U1= (2e² k)/2 =e² k.

So, 12 * e² k.

U2= (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = same as U1 → e² k.

So, 66 * e² k.

Thus, U_total= (12+66) e² k =78 e² k.

Which is 78 *8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute that:

78 *8.988e9 =702.744e9.

702.744e9 * (2.56e-38) =702.744 *2.56= approx 1797.7.

So, 1797.7e-29=1.7977e-26 J.

Which is approximately 1.8e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 3 times higher.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are zero, but that's unlikely.

I think I'm stuck and can't find the correct option. Based on my calculations, the correct energy is approximately 2.76e-27 J, but it's not among the options. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, but that's about twice my result. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option B:2.822e-26, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the distance. Oh, the problem says 2 m from point P, but perhaps the actual distance is 2 cm, which is 0.02 m. Let me try that.

If r=0.02 m:

U_per_pair = (8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 ) /0.02.

= (8.988e9 *10.24e-38 ) /0.02.

=92.096e-29 /0.02=4.6048e-27 J per pair.

Multiply by12 →55.2576e-27=5.52576e-26 J.

Which is about 5.526e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is5.645e-26, which is close.

Ah, so perhaps the distance is 2 cm instead of 2 meters. That would change the calculation.

But the problem states 2 meters, so that's probably incorrect.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer based on the calculations is approximately 5.52e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy of the system of charges. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The central charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Potential Energy Between Two Charges**:  
   The potential energy between two charges \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) separated by a distance \( r \) is given by:  
   \[
   U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
   \]  
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \).  
   For \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), we have:  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{k \cdot (2e)^2}{r}
   \]  
   Substituting \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (3.2 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2}
   \]  
   Compute \( (3.2 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 10.24 \times 10^{-38} \):  
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (10.24 \times 10^{-38})}{2} = 4.6048 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Total Potential Energy**:  
   There are 12 pairs of charges between the central charge and the surrounding charges. Thus, the total potential energy is:  
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot U_{\text{pair}} = 12 \cdot (4.6048 \times 10^{-28}) = 5.5258 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated energy \( U_{\text{total}} \approx 5.526 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 25% higher than the calculated value.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, the minimum energy of the system is approximately \( 5.526 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). While this value does not match any option exactly, the closest match is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**. It is possible that the discrepancy arises from rounding or assumptions in the problem setup.

**Answer: C**
