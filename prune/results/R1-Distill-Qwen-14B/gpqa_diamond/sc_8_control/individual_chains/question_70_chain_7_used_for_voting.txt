Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's see. The question gives a series of reactions, and I need to deduce the structures involved to find out the symmetry of E.

First, let's parse the reactions step by step. 

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I know that when elements react, the stoichiometry can give clues. Eight equivalents is a lot, so maybe B is something like oxygen? Because, for example, sulfur reacting with oxygen in a high ratio forms SO3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if A is a metal, maybe it's forming an oxide with a high oxidation state. Wait, A is a solid, so maybe it's a metal. 

Next, product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm, what reacts with a gas in a 1:2 ratio? Maybe if D is a halogen, like chlorine. For example, SO3 reacting with 2 Cl2 might form something? Or perhaps C is something like SO3 and D is Cl2. But I'm not sure yet.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C (maybe a trioxide like SO3 or CO3) reacts with water, it forms the original element (A) and two acids. For instance, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2SO3 (which is actually not stable, but maybe another example). Wait, but CO3 would react with water to form H2CO3 (which is weak) and something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitrate? No, because nitrates usually don't react with water to form metals. Alternatively, if C is a sulfate, but then reacting with water gives the metal and sulfuric acid. But then where does the weak acid come into play? Alternatively, maybe C is something like a sulfite? Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: when C reacts with water, it forms the original solid A and two acids. If A is a metal, maybe it's a metal oxide. For example, suppose A is CuO. Then, C could be CuO reacting further? No, wait, the first reaction is A reacting with B to form C. So perhaps A is a metal, and B is oxygen. Then C would be a metal oxide, perhaps with a higher oxidation state. So, for example, if A is Fe, B is O2, then C would be FeO? But I'm not sure about the color being bright red. Hmm, another thought: maybe C is a transition metal trioxide, which is red. Like Mn2O7 is dark purple, but maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a vanadium compound? Or perhaps a chromium compound. Wait, I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is between a metal and sulfur? Because sulfur is a bright yellow solid, but the product C is bright red. Hmm. Or maybe it's a reaction involving metals like iron or copper.

Wait, another angle: the third reaction, C with water giving back A and two acids. So, when C reacts with H2O, it produces a metal (A) and two acids. So, perhaps C is a compound that when hydrolyzed yields both a strong and a weak acid. For example, if C is a nitrate and a sulfate? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite, like SO3^2-.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride? Or maybe it's something like a peroxide. Alternatively, let's think about the products. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak ones are like H2CO3, H3PO4, etc.

Wait, let's think of a compound that when reacted with water gives two different acids. For example, maybe C is a sulfite. When sulfite reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into sulfurous acid (H2SO3, weak) and something else. But where does another acid come from? Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate and a sulfate? No, that's not likely.

Wait, another thought: when a metal oxide reacts with water, it usually forms the corresponding metal hydroxide, which then may decompose. But if it forms two acids, that suggests maybe it's a salt of two different acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. When carbonate (CO3^2-) reacts with water, it forms carbonic acid (H2CO3, weak) and the metal hydroxide. But then the metal hydroxide would have to be a strong base, which would react further. Wait, but the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. So maybe A is the metal, but that doesn't make sense because metal oxides would form hydroxides, not the pure metal.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about C. It's produced by A and 8 equivalents of B. Maybe A is S, and B is O2. Then S + 8 O2 → SO4^2- or something. But S is a solid, and SO4^2- is in solution. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A is a metal, and B is O2. The reaction could be something like 2 A (metal) + O2 → A2O. But then, how many equivalents? If it's 8 equivalents, maybe the formula is A O4 or something. For example, if A is Fe, 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. But that's 3 equivalents of O2 per 4 Fe. So 8 equivalents would be a lot. Hmm, maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is 2 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3. That's 3 equivalents of O2 for 2 Al. But in this case, it's 8 equivalents of O2. So perhaps the metal has a higher valency. Let me think, for example, if the reaction is 3 M (metal) + 8 O2 → M2O7. Or maybe it's a different stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and sulfur. Like Fe + S → FeS. But the stoichiometry is 1:1, so 8 equivalents would mean 8 S per Fe, which seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a metal oxide with a high oxidation state. For example, if A is copper, and B is oxygen, then CuO is formed. But that's only 1 O per Cu. So 8 equivalents would mean 8 O atoms per Cu, which would be CuO4^2- or something. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, 2 A + 8 B → C. Maybe A is Na and B is Cl2. Then 2 Na + 3 Cl2 → 2 NaCl + NaClO3? No, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a reaction to form a compound with multiple atoms. For example, 2 A + 8 B → C. If B is O, then 2 A + 8 O → C. Maybe C is a compound like FeO4^2-? Hmm, but I'm not certain.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's think about the possible structures of E. The question is about its molecular symmetry group, so E must have a particular molecular structure that falls into one of the given symmetry groups.

The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm. D4h is the symmetry group of molecules like SO4^2- (sulfate ion), which has a tetrahedral structure with a center of inversion and a four-fold rotation axis. D∞h is the symmetry of linear molecules like CO2 or HCN, which have an infinite symmetry around the axis. C2 is a two-fold rotation axis, and C2v has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

So, the symmetry of E must be one of these. Let's try to figure out what E is.

In the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E. So, perhaps C is a trioxide and D is a halogen. For example, if C is SO3, then reacting with Cl2 might form SOCl2 or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if C is CO3, reacting with Cl2 (maybe under certain conditions) could form something else.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is a highly toxic gas or a dangerous compound. For example, if D is Cl2, and C is SO3, then perhaps E is SOCl2? But I'm not sure about the hazards of that. Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. Phosgene is produced by reacting carbon dioxide with chlorine, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility: if C is SO3 and D is Cl2, then perhaps the reaction is SO3 + 2 Cl2 → SO2Cl2. Is that a thing? I'm not sure. Alternatively, SO3 + Cl2 might produce something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CO3^2- and D is Cl2. Then, the reaction could be CO3 + Cl2 → CCl2O2? I'm not certain about that.

Wait, but let's think about the first reaction again. If C is SO3, and it's formed from A and 8 equivalents of B. So what reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form SO3? Hmm, SO3 is formed from sulfur trioxide, which is made by the oxidation of sulfur. So perhaps A is S, and B is O2. Then, the reaction would be S + 8 O2 → ... Wait, sulfur trioxide is SO3, which is formed from S plus O2, but the stoichiometry for that is 2 S + 3 O2 → 2 SO3. So in that case, 3 equivalents of O2 per 2 S, so each S uses 1.5 O2. But the problem states that 8 equivalents of B are used, so perhaps for each mole of A, 8 moles of B are consumed.

Wait, if A is S, and B is O2, then the reaction would be S + 8 O2 → SO8? But that doesn't make sense because SO8 isn't a real compound. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between S and O2 to form something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about product E. It's formed when C reacts with D in a 1:2 ratio. D is a gas, so perhaps D is a diatomic gas like Cl2, O2, N2, etc. Suppose D is Cl2. So C + 2 D → E.

If E is a compound with Cl, like SOCl2, let's think about its structure. SOCl2 has a trigonal pyramidal structure, which would have a C3v symmetry. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2Cl2, which has a tetrahedral structure. Wait, but SO2Cl2 is a tetrahedral molecule with four substituents. The symmetry of a tetrahedral molecule without any equivalent atoms would be Td, but if it's a regular tetrahedron, it could have Td symmetry. However, none of the options match Td. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E is a linear molecule. For example, if E is COCl2, which is a linear molecule, its symmetry would be D∞h. That's option C. But wait, COCl2 is actually a bent molecule, I think. Alternatively, phosgene (COCl2) has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. The structure is linear, so the symmetry would be D∞h. Because in a linear molecule, you have a main axis (C∞), and two-fold mirror planes perpendicular to it, leading to D∞h symmetry.

So if E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), then its structure is linear, making its symmetry group D∞h, which is option C.

But wait, how does that fit into the reactions? Let's reconstruct:

- Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
- Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

If E is phosgene (COCl2), then D would be Cl2. So Reaction 2 would be C + 2 Cl2 → COCl2. What would C be? If C is CO, then CO + 2 Cl2 → COCl2? But wait, CO is a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CO3^2- or another carbon-containing compound. Wait, maybe C is COCl, but that's a gas as well.

Wait, another angle: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So perhaps C is a carbonate. For instance, CO3^2- reacting with water would form H2CO3 (weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But then A would be the metal, which doesn't make sense because in Reaction 1, A is a solid that reacts with B (O2?) to form C (CO3^2-). Alternatively, if C is SO3, then SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2SO3 (weak acid). But wait, H2SO3 is unstable and tends to disproportionate, but let's say that's what happens. Then, F would be H2SO4, G would be H2SO3.

So, in this scenario, A would be S, because S is a solid, and when it reacts with O2 (B) in the first reaction, it forms SO3 (C). Then, SO3 reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D (Cl2?) would form SOCl2 or something else. Let's think: SO3 + 2 Cl2 → SO2Cl2? Or maybe SOCl2. Hmm, the reaction of SO3 with Cl2 might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different D.

Wait, another thought: if D is a diatomic gas like Cl2, and the reaction is C + 2 D → E. If C is SO3, and D is Cl2, then E could be SOCl2 or another chlorinated compound.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: Let's think about H's definition. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H. H is a solvent, so possible candidates are water, ethanol, etc. But since D and B are gases, H must be a liquid solvent. For instance, if B is H2O (but it's a gas in the first reaction?), but that's conflicting.

Wait, the first reaction is A (solid) + gas B → C. So B must be a gas at reaction conditions. If D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let's think: if B is O2, and D is H2, then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. But O2 is a gas, H2 is a gas, and H2O is a liquid. That fits. So Reaction: D (H2) + B (O2) → H (H2O).

If that's the case, then in Reaction 2, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (H2) to form E. But wait, in this scenario, D is H2. So C + 2 H2 → E. What would that form? Maybe a reduction reaction. For example, if C is CuO, then CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But that's not forming a new product E, just A (Cu) and water. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something else. Let's re-examine. If H is H2O, then B is O2 and D is H2. So in Reaction 1, solid A reacts with O2 in 8 equivalents to form C. So A could be a metal that forms an oxide with O2. For example, if A is Fe, then Fe + O2 → FeO (but FeO isn't bright red). Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur (S), which reacts with O2 to form SO3. Wait, but S is a solid, and SO3 is a gas. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high-valent oxide, which is red in color. Like MnO4^- is purple, but in solid form it's a dark solid. Alternatively, perhaps A is vanadium, but I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another thought: the bright red color. Maybe C is something like Mn2O7, which is dark brown, but perhaps another compound. Alternatively, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium trioxide is orange-red, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be a sulfide, but that's usually not red as a product of oxygen reaction.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to E's symmetry. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is O=C(Cl)2 (phosgene), then symmetry is D∞h, which is option C. So perhaps E is phosgene. Then, what is C? Phosgene is formed from CO2 and Cl2. Wait, but CO2 is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another reaction: if C is CO2, and it reacts with Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst, maybe it forms phosgene (O=CCl2). So, in that case, Reaction 2 is CO2 + 2 Cl2 → CCl2O (phosgene). But then, what is C? It's CO2, which is a gas, but the first reaction states that C is formed from solid A and gas B. So if C is CO2, then A must be a solid that reacts with B (maybe O2) to produce CO2. For example, A is carbon (solid), B is O2. Then, 2 C (solid) + O2 → 2 CO2. But in the problem, the stoichiometry is 8 equivalents of B. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of B are used. That would imply, for example, a reaction like A + 8 B → C. If A is C (solid), and B is O2, then the reaction would be C + 8 O2 → ... Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because carbon burning in O2 produces CO2 with a 1:1 ratio per C atom.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about option C, D∞h symmetry. That symmetry is for linear molecules, like CO2 or HCN. So if E is CO2, what would that imply? But CO2 isn't extremely hazardous. Alternatively, if E is another linear molecule.

Wait, another thought: if E is Cl2O7, which is chlorine heptoxide. Cl2O7 has a linear structure, O-Cl-Cl-O perhaps? No, wait, Cl2O7 is a dimer of ClO4^- ions. Or maybe Cl2O7 is a different structure. Alternatively, ClO3^- is trigonal pyramidal, ClO4^- is tetrahedral. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is something else. Let's think about the possible reactions again.

Let me try to build the reactions step by step.

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent)

From reaction 4: D and B form H, which is a solvent. So D and B are gases that react to form a solvent. Common solvents are H2O, ethanol, etc. But if both D and B are gases, then their reaction product H must be a liquid. So possible pairs: H2 (D) and O2 (B) → H2O (H). Or maybe D is CO2 and B is something else, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, D is H2 and B is O2 → H2O.

So let's suppose D is H2 and B is O2. Then, Reaction 4 is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O.

Now, Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. So C is a compound that when reacted with water gives back A (the original solid), and two acids, one strong (F) and one weak (G).

If B is O2, then Reaction 1 is A + O2 → C. So A is probably a metal or a non-metal that reacts with O2 to form C.

If C reacts with H2O to form A and two acids, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Al, then C could be Al2O3. Al2O3 + H2O → Al(OH)3, which doesn't produce acids. Hmm, but Al(OH)3 is amphoteric. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. For example, if C is Na2CO3, then Na2CO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (H2CO3), NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate. Suppose C is CuSO4. Then CuSO4 + H2O → CuSO4·5H2O, but that doesn't produce two acids. Alternatively, if C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3, then Na2SO3 + H2O → 2 NaOH + H2SO3. H2SO3 is a weak acid. But NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a trioxide. For example, if C is SO3, then SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid) and H2SO3 (weak acid). Wait, but H2SO3 is unstable and tends to decompose into H+ and SO3^2- or something else. But if we consider it as an acid, then F is H2SO4 (strong), G is H2SO3 (weak). So that would fit Reaction 3.

So in this scenario:

- Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (O2) → C (SO3)
- Reaction 2: C (SO3) + 2 D (H2) → E
- Reaction 3: SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (F) + H2SO3 (G)
- Reaction 4: H2 (D) + O2 (B) → H2O (H)

So, what is E in Reaction 2? SO3 + 2 H2 → what? Well, SO3 is a strong oxidizing agent. It could react with H2 to form H2SO4, but that's under specific conditions. Or perhaps it forms H2S and O2, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: SO3 reacting with H2 might form S and H2O. But it's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps E is H2S, but that's a colorless gas. Hmm.

Wait, but in Reaction 2, E is extremely hazardous. If E is H2S, that's toxic, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, another possibility: maybe E is SO2, which is toxic. How would that form?

Wait, perhaps in Reaction 2, SO3 reacts with H2 in the presence of a catalyst to form S and H2O. So, SO3 + H2 → S + H2O. But that doesn't fit the 2 equivalents H2. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2, not H2. Let me re-examine. If D is Cl2, then Reaction 4 would be Cl2 + B → H. But B is O2, then Cl2 + O2 would form ClO2 or ClO3, which are not common solvents. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. Let's think again about Reaction 4: D and B form H, a solvent. Another possible pair: CO2 (D) and NaOH (but NaOH is solid, not gas). Alternatively, D is SO3 and B is H2O, but I don't think that's likely.

Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl, but NH3 is a gas, HCl is a gas, and their reaction forms NH4Cl, which is a solid. Not a solvent.

Wait, maybe I should think of D and B as O2 and H2, forming H2O as H. Then Reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → E.

If C is SO3, then SO3 + 2 H2 → S + 3 H2O. But I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe SO3 + H2 → something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck here. Let me try to think about E's structure again. If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), what would that imply?

Phosgene is produced by the reaction of carbon dioxide with chlorine gas in the presence of a catalyst. So, CO2 + 2 Cl2 → O=CCl2 + 2 HCl (maybe, but not sure about the exact reaction conditions). So in that case, Reaction 2 would be C (CO2) + 2 D (Cl2) → E (phosgene). 

Then, Reaction 1 would be A (solid) + 8 B (Cl2?) → CO2. Wait, but B is a gas. So if B is Cl2, then Reaction 1 is A + 8 Cl2 → CO2. What solid A would react with 8 Cl2 to form CO2? That seems unlikely because CO2 is usually from oxidation of carbon. Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon, and B is oxygen.

Wait, if A is carbon (solid), B is O2 (gas), Reaction 1: C + 8 O2 → CO3? But that's not a typical reaction. Carbon typically forms CO or CO2 upon oxidation. 

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction 1 is 4 C (solid) + 8 O2 → 4 CO2. Which would mean 2 equivalents of O2 per C. But the question states 8 equivalents, so I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see what the options are for E's symmetry. If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), then its structure is linear, so symmetry D∞h. That would make option C the answer.

Alternatively, if E is a different molecule, maybe with a different symmetry. For example, if E is O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. But O3 is not extremely hazardous, but more of an irritant.

Another possibility: E is SO2, which is a bent molecule with a C2v symmetry. SO2 has a structure of bent (like O3), so its symmetry group is Dvh or similar. Wait, SO2 has a structure with a central S, double-bonded to two O atoms, with a lone pair. So the molecular geometry is bent, leading to a C2v symmetry.

But then, how does that fit into the reactions? Let's see.

If E is SO2, then Reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → SO2. So, if D is H2, then C + 2 H2 → SO2. That would imply C is SO3, which upon reaction with H2 forms SO2 and H2O. For example: SO3 + H2 → SO2 + H2O. But the stoichiometry would need to be 1:1. However, Reaction 2 uses 2 equivalents of D (H2), so maybe 2 H2 → 1 H2O.

But this is getting a bit tangled. Another angle: if E is SO2 (bent, C2v symmetry), then the answer would be D) C2v.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.

Alternatively, if E is SO3, which has a trigonal planar structure, but that's not one of the options. Or, E is something else.

Wait, perhaps E is HCN. HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. HCN is highly toxic, which fits the description. So if E is HCN, then Reaction 2 would be C + 2 D → HCN.

In that case, what is C? If D is H2 (since Reaction 4 is D + B → H2O), then D is H2, B is O2.

So Reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → HCN. That would require C to be something like (maybe) CH2O (formaldehyde), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is CO, and CO + H2 → CH3OH (methanol), but that doesn't give HCN.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.

Let me summarize what I know:

- H is a solvent formed from D and B. If D is H2 and B is O2, H is H2O.

- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So C is likely a trioxide, e.g., SO3, which when hydrolyzed gives H2SO4 (strong) and H2SO3 (weak).

- Reaction 2: C (SO3) + 2 D (Cl2?) → E. So if D is Cl2, then SO3 + 2 Cl2 → ?

Alternatively, maybe D is another gas. Wait, if D is O2, but B is something else.

Wait, now I'm more confused. Maybe I should focus on the options and the likely structure of E.

If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which has D∞h symmetry, then the answer would be C. Another possibility is that E is a linear molecule like CO (carbon monoxide), which has a D∞h symmetry. But CO isn't extremely hazardous in the same way, though it's toxic.

Alternatively, E could be something like Cl2O, which has a bent structure. Wait, Cl2O is dichlorine monoxide, which has a structure similar to O3 and has C2v symmetry. Cl2O is a toxic gas, so that could fit.

But without more information, it's hard to pin down. However, considering the options, D∞h is the symmetry group for linear molecules, so if E is a linear molecule, that's the answer.

Another point: if E is a linear molecule, then the correct symmetry group is D∞h. So, option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves deducing the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests A is likely a solid reactant, and B is a gas. The stoichiometry of 8 equivalents implies a high oxidation state or a specific reaction pathway. A possible candidate for C is SO₃ (sulfur trioxide), which is a bright red solid.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is described as extremely hazardous. If C is SO₃ and D is Cl₂, the reaction could form SOCl₂ (thionyl chloride) or SO₂Cl₂ (dithionyl chloride), both of which are hazardous. However, the most plausible candidate for E is phosgene (COCl₂), which is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If C is SO₃, the hydrolysis reaction would yield H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and H₂SO₃ (weak acid), consistent with the given conditions.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If B is O₂ and D is H₂, their reaction forms H₂O, a common solvent.

From this analysis, E is identified as phosgene (COCl₂), which has a linear structure. Linear molecules exhibit D∞h symmetry due to an infinite-fold rotation axis along the molecular axis and two-fold mirror planes perpendicular to it. This matches the description of E as a highly hazardous product.

Critical evaluation of the options:
- **A) C2**: This corresponds to a two-fold rotation axis, which does not match the linear structure of phosgene.
- **B) D4h**: This is the symmetry group of tetrahedral molecules like SO₄²⁻, which does not fit the linear structure of phosgene.
- **C) D∞h**: This is the correct symmetry group for linear molecules like phosgene, making it the best choice.
- **D) C2v**: This corresponds to bent molecules like SO₂ or O₃, which does not match the linear structure of phosgene.

Thus, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
