Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness changes periodically, which could look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness variation (amplitude) as these spots do?

So I need to find Rpl/Rstar. The options are A to D, with numbers around 0.07, 0.11, 0.32, 0.39. Hmm.

First, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the planet's radius divided by the star's radius. The formula is (Rp/R*)^2. But wait, this is about dark spots, not a planet. So the scenario here is that the spots cause a dip in brightness when they're facing us as the star rotates, right?

So the star's brightness without spots would be a certain value. But with spots, the observed brightness will dip when the spots are in view. So this dip in brightness can be modeled similarly to a planet transit.

The tricky part is calculating the equivalent effect of these spots on the star's brightness. Let me break it down.

The star's total brightness, or luminosity, depends on its radius and effective temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σTeff⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since the star is divided into spots and non-spots, the observed flux will change.

Wait, the star is a sphere, so the surface area is 4πR². But the spots cover a certain fraction. The problem states that the hemisphere is covered 20% with spots. So in one hemisphere, 20% is spots, and 80% is normal. Since the spots are cooler, each spot contributes less flux.

The effective temperature of the star is given as 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. Oh wait, wait. The temperature difference is 1000 K. So if the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spots are at 5000 K.

Now, when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, and then goes away. So the observed brightness will dip when the spots are on the side facing us.

So the question is, what is the amplitude of this dip compared to the planet case.

Let me think about the flux from the star. The star's total flux when not spotted is F_total = σTeff^4. But when spots are present, part of the surface is emitting less.

The total flux from the star would be the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the non-spotted regions. Let me consider that the star's surface area is divided into two parts: the spotted hemisphere and the unspotted hemisphere.

Wait, no. The problem says that one hemisphere is covered in spots, so the entire hemisphere (the area) has 20% spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere). The area of a hemisphere is 2πR², so the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². The rest of the hemisphere is unspotted, so 0.8 * 2πR² = 1.6πR². Plus the other hemisphere, which is completely unspotted, 2πR².

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere. The surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is all the surface facing us when the star is viewed from the side, but the star spins, so as it rotates, different parts come into view.

Wait, maybe I should model the star as being divided into two hemispheres: one with spots and one without. So each hemisphere is 2πR² in area. The spotted hemisphere has 20% of its surface covered in spots. So the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². The rest is normal, so 1.6πR². The other hemisphere is entirely normal, so 2πR².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total flux from the star is the sum of the spotted part and the unspotted part, plus the flux from the other hemisphere which is fully unspotted.

Wait, but the other hemisphere isn't being viewed when the spotted one is facing us. Wait, no. The star emits light from all sides. Wait a minute, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's entire surface, and what fraction is covered by spots, and their temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the average flux from the star in two different situations: when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. Then the difference in flux will be the amplitude of the brightness variation.

Let me try that.

When the spotted hemisphere is on the near side:

The flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the flux from the rest of the star (both hemispheres).

Wait, no, because only half of the star is spotted. Wait, no, the problem says one hemisphere is covered, so the other hemisphere is spotless.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star as having a fraction f of its surface covered by spots. But in this case, the spots are only on one hemisphere, so the total area covered is (0.5 * surface area) * 0.2.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere is 2πR². 20% of that is 0.4πR². So the total area of spots is 0.4πR².

The star's total flux without any spots would be L = 4πR² * σ * (6000)^4.

But with spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux from the spots is less.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the average flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible and when it's not, then find the difference.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible:

The flux from the spotted regions is (0.4πR²) * σ * (5000)^4.

The flux from the non-spotted regions:

The rest of the spotted hemisphere is 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR². So the flux is 1.6πR² * σ * (6000)^4.

The other hemisphere is 2πR² * σ * (6000)^4.

So total flux when spotted hemisphere is visible: F_spot = [0.4π*(5000^4) + (1.6π + 2π)*(6000^4)] * σ R².

Wait, let me compute that.

F_spot = [0.4 * (5000^4) + (1.6 + 2) * (6000^4)] * π R² σ.

Wait, adding the terms:

0.4*(5^4) + (3.6)*(6^4) all multiplied by π R² σ.

Similarly, when the spotted hemisphere is not visible (i.e., the star is rotating so that the other hemisphere is facing us), the entire star emits at the normal temperature.

So F_unspot = [ (4π R²) * (6000^4) ] * σ.

Wait, or more accurately, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_unspot = (4π R²) * (6000^4) * σ.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When the spotted hemisphere is on the near side, the flux is F_spot. When it's on the far side, the flux is F_unspot.

Wait, but no, because when the star rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is now on the near side. So the flux in that case is the same as F_unspot, which is the star without any spots.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's own emission is from all surfaces. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, part of what we see is the spots, and the rest is normal. When the other hemisphere is facing us, all we see is normal surface.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the same side comes into view. So the maximum brightness is when the entire unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait, the star's brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view.

So let me compute the flux in both scenarios.

First, the maximum flux F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is the one we're seeing. So F_max = (4π R²) * (6000^4) * σ.

Wait, no, because the entire star is emitting, but when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the other hemisphere is not. Wait, no, that's not correct. The entire star emits, but from our point of view, when the unspotted hemisphere is on the near side, the far side (spotted hemisphere) is on the back. So the total flux we receive is the sum of the flux from the near side (unspotted hemisphere) and the flux from the far side (spotted hemisphere), but the far side's flux is directed away from us, so we don't see it. Oh wait, no! The star emits light in all directions. So when the spotted hemisphere is on the far side, the flux we receive is from the near side, which is entirely unspotted, and the far side's contribution is zero because it's behind, but that's not correct because the star's surface is emitting in all directions. So actually, the flux we receive when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us is just the flux from that hemisphere, because the other hemisphere's flux is directed away.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The star's surface emits light in all directions. So when the spotted hemisphere is on the far side, from our perspective, the light that reaches us is only from the unspotted hemisphere. Because the far side's light is going away from us. So the total flux when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (F_max) is the flux from the unspotted hemisphere (2π R² * 6000^4 * σ) plus the flux from the near side of the spotted hemisphere? No, wait, the spotted hemisphere is on the far side, so its near side is the same as the far side from our point of view. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should model the star as having two hemispheres: the near (facing us) and far. When the near hemisphere is the unspotted one, we receive all the flux from that hemisphere plus none from the far (since it's behind). When the near is the spotted hemisphere, we receive flux from the spots and the non-spotted regions on that near hemisphere, plus nothing from the far hemisphere.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because when the near hemisphere is the spotted one, the far is the unspotted. But we can't see the far hemisphere's emission because it's on the opposite side. So the flux we receive is just the flux from the near hemisphere.

So let me model it that way.

Case 1: The near hemisphere is unspotted. So the flux received is F_max = (2π R²) * (6000^4) * σ.

Case 2: The near hemisphere is spotted. So the flux received is the sum of:

- The flux from the spotted regions on the near hemisphere: 0.2 * 2π R² * (5000^4) σ.
- The flux from the non-spotted regions on the near hemisphere: 0.8 * 2π R² * (6000^4) σ.

Plus, the flux from the far hemisphere, which is the unspotted one: 2π R² * (6000^4) σ. Wait, no, because the far hemisphere is on the opposite side; we can't see its flux. So the flux from the far hemisphere is zero for us. Only the near hemisphere's flux contributes.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. The star emits light in all directions, so when the near hemisphere is the spotted one, the far hemisphere is the unspotted. But from our perspective, the far hemisphere's light is going away, so we don't receive any of it. So the only flux we get in this case is from the near hemisphere, which is the spotted one.

So in Case 2, the flux is:

F_min = [ (0.2 * 2π R² * (5000^4) ) + (0.8 * 2π R² * (6000^4) ) ] * σ.

Let me compute F_max and F_min.

F_max = 2π R² σ (6000^4).

F_min = 2π R² σ [ 0.2*(5000^4) + 0.8*(6000^4) ].

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min). But wait, the amplitude is the difference between maximum and minimum brightness, divided by the maximum, I think. Or maybe it's (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Wait, the relative brightness change is (F_max - F_min) / F_max. Because when the spots are visible, the brightness is lower, so (F_max - F_min) is the dip, and the amplitude would be that dip relative to F_max.

So the amplitude A is [ (F_max - F_min) ] / F_max.

Let me compute this.

Compute F_max: 2π R² σ (6000^4).

F_min: 2π R² σ [0.2*(5000^4) + 0.8*(6000^4)].

So the difference F_max - F_min is 2π R² σ [6000^4 - (0.2*5000^4 + 0.8*6000^4) ].

Simplify inside the brackets:

6000^4 * (1 - 0.8) - 0.2 *5000^4.

= 6000^4 * 0.2 - 0.2 *5000^4.

= 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4).

So F_max - F_min = 2π R² σ * 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4).

Then A = [0.2 (6^4 -5^4) ] / 6^4.

Compute 6^4: 6000^4. Let's compute 6^4 = 1296. 5^4=625. So 6^4 -5^4= 1296-625=671.

So 0.2 *671 = 134.2.

So A = 134.2 / (6^4) = 134.2 / 1296 ≈ 0.1036, which is about 10%.

So the amplitude is approximately 10%.

Wait, but when a planet transits the star, the amplitude is (Rp/R*)^2. So the planet's radius relative to the star's radius squared would give the same dip as 10% amplitude.

Wait, no. Wait, in the planet case, the dip is (Rp/R*)^2, but that dip is (Rp^2)/(Rstar^2), which is the fractional area blocked.

In the star's case, the dip is 10% of the star's maximum brightness. So the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2, which should equal 0.1036.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

Wait, so that would be 0.32. Let me check the options. Option D is ~0.32. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, I calculated A as (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [0.2 (6^4 -5^4)] / 6^4.

Which is 0.2*(1296-625)/1296 = 0.2*(671)/1296 ≈ (134.2)/(1296)= ~0.1036.

So that's a 10.36% dip. So the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1036 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322, which is about 0.32, so option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate the term inside:

F_max - F_min = 2π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (0.2*(5000^4) + 0.8*(6000^4)) ) ]

= 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 (1 - 0.8) ) - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4)

So F_max - F_min = 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4) * 2π R² σ.

Then F_max is 2π R² σ 6000^4.

So the amplitude A is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = [0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4) * 2π R² σ ] / [ 2π R² σ 6000^4 ].

The 2π R² σ cancels out, so numerator is 0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4), denominator is 6000^4.

So A = 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4) / (6000^4)

Compute 6000^4 = 1296e8 (since 6^4=1296), 5000^4=625e8.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = (1296 -625) e8 = 671e8.

So A= 0.2 *671e8 /1296e8 = 0.2 * 671 /1296 ≈ 0.2 * 0.5176 ≈ 0.1035, as before.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which fits.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in considering the area of the spots. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's area covered by spots. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux we receive is from the near hemisphere, which is the spotted one. So the flux is the sum of the spotted areas and non-spotted areas on that hemisphere.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is near is:

F_min = (0.4π R² * (5000^4) σ) + ( (2π R² - 0.4π R²) * (6000^4) σ )

= [0.4π R² (5^4) + 1.6π R² (6^4)] σ

= π R² σ [0.4 * 625 + 1.6 * 1296 ]

= π R² σ [ 250 + 2073.6 ] = π R² σ * 2323.6

F_max is when the unspotted hemisphere is near: 2π R² * 6^4 σ = 2π R² * 1296 σ = 2592 π R² σ.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when the unspotted hemisphere is near, the flux is 2π R² *6^4 σ, because the near hemisphere is unspotted and the far hemisphere is spotted. But I can't see the far hemisphere's flux, so it's only the near hemisphere that contributes. So F_max is 2π R² *6^4 σ = 2592 π R² σ.

F_min is the near hemisphere being spotted, so:

0.2 of 2π R² is 0.4π R² covered by spots.

So F_min = [0.4π R² *5^4 σ ] + [ (2π R² -0.4π R²) *6^4 σ ]

= [0.4 π R² *625 σ ] + [1.6 π R² *1296 σ ]

= (250 π R² σ) + (2073.6 π R² σ )

= 2323.6 π R² σ

So F_max is 2592 π R² σ.

So the dip is F_max - F_min = 2592 -2323.6 = 268.4 π R² σ.

So the amplitude A is (268.4 π R² σ) / (2592 π R² σ ) = 268.4 / 2592 ≈ 0.1035, which is 10.35%.

So same as before.

So the planet's (Rp/R*)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/R* ≈ 0.322, so option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the star's brightness change caused by the dark spots and compare it to the dip caused by a planet transiting the star.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Temperature of spots: \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) (1000 K cooler than the star).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - When the spotted hemisphere is facing Earth, the observed brightness decreases due to the cooler spots.
   - The total brightness of the star depends on the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions.

3. **Flux Calculations**:
   - The flux from a surface with temperature \( T \) is proportional to \( T^4 \).
   - The star's total surface area is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the spotted hemisphere covers 20% of its area.

   - **Maximum Brightness (\( F_{\text{max}} \))**:
     When the unspotted hemisphere is facing Earth, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{max}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot (6000)^4
     \]

   - **Minimum Brightness (\( F_{\text{min}} \))**:
     When the spotted hemisphere is facing Earth, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{min}} = \left[ 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot (5000)^4 + 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot (6000)^4 \right]
     \]
     Here:
     - \( 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) is the area of the spots.
     - \( 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) is the area of the unspotted part of the spotted hemisphere.

4. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation**:
   The amplitude \( A \) is the relative change in brightness:
   \[
   A = \frac{F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}}{F_{\text{max}}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot (6000)^4 - \left[ 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot (5000)^4 + 1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot (6000)^4 \right]
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}} = 0.2 \cdot \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot (6000^4 - 5000^4)
   \]
   Using \( 6000^4 = 1296 \times 10^8 \) and \( 5000^4 = 625 \times 10^8 \):
   \[
   6000^4 - 5000^4 = 671 \times 10^8
   \]
   \[
   F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}} = 0.2 \cdot \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 671 \times 10^8
   \]
   Substituting \( F_{\text{max}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot \sigma \cdot 6000^4 \):
   \[
   A = \frac{0.2 \cdot 671}{1296} \approx 0.1036 \, \text{(or 10.36%)}.
   \]

5. **Planet's Radius**:
   The dip in brightness caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \). Setting this equal to the amplitude:
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1036
   \]
   Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322
   \]

### Final Answer:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately **0.32**.

**Answer: D**
