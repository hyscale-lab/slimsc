Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the stability constants of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, with a total cobalt concentration of 1e-2 M and SCN- concentration of 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I think I remember that stability constants (β) are related to the formation of complexes. So each β corresponds to a different complex. For example, β1 might be for the complex with one SCN- ligand, β2 for two, and so on.

Wait, but what's the structure here? Cobalt can form complexes with multiple thiocyanate ions. The complexes might be [Co(SCN)]^n+, [Co(SCN)_2]^m+, etc. Each complex's stability constant β tells us how much it's favored over the free ions.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which is usually Co(II) with two SCN- ligands. So that's the third species, perhaps? Wait, the β values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, does that mean β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on? I think so.

So the possible complexes are Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^0, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe the numbering is different. Wait, the stability constants are given in order, so β1 is the first complex (monomeric), β2 next, etc.

So for each complex, the β is the formation constant, which is the ratio of the concentration of the complex to the product of the concentrations of Co^2+ and the appropriate power of SCN^-.

So, the general formation would be:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n+} 

The stability constant β_n is equal to [ [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

Each β is for a different n, where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which has two SCN- ligands. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or is it a different charge? Hmm.

Wait, for n=2, the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Because Co^2+ has a +2 charge, and each SCN- is -1. So two SCN would give -2, so +2 -2 = 0. So the complex is neutral? Hmm, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which would mean that the complex has a +2 charge. Wait, that's possible if the complex has two SCN and the Co is in a higher oxidation state, but Co is +2. So each SCN^- is -1, so 2*( -1 ) = -2. So Co^2+ plus two SCN^- gives 0 charge. So the complex would be neutral. Hmm, but maybe for the purposes of the problem, the exact charge isn't too important, as long as we use the β correctly.

But the key point is that each β corresponds to a specific number of ligands. So for each β, that's the stability constant for that complex.

So the problem is to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) relative to all possible cobalt species.

Wait, the options are about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, but I'm not 100% sure. But perhaps the question is just about the species with two SCN ligands, regardless of color.

So, given the stability constants, and the concentrations of Co and SCN-, I need to calculate the fraction of the complex with two SCN- ligands.

The approach is to consider all possible complexes and free Co^2+ and calculate their concentrations, then find the percentage of the dithiocyanato species.

So, let's think about the possible species:

1. Free Co^2+ (n=0)
2. [CoSCN]^+ (n=1)
3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}? Wait, let me think. Co^2+ has +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So with n=1, the complex is [CoSCN]^+ (charge 2+ + (-1) = +1). For n=2, the charge would be 0. So [Co(SCN)_2] is neutral.

Wait, but in solution, the charge can influence the stability. But perhaps the exact charge isn't critical for the calculation of the fractions, as it's all in terms of concentrations.

The steps I need to take:

1. Write the formation expressions for each complex.
2. Use the given β values and concentrations to find the fraction of each species.
3. Sum all fractions to get 100%.
4. Find the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

But wait, there are four β values given, so four complexes. Or wait, perhaps β4 corresponds to a higher n, but it's possible that n can't be more than 4? Or maybe the complexes can form up to four SCN ligands.

But considering the given β's, β1=9 (n=1), β2=40 (n=2), β3=63 (n=3), β4=16 (n=4).

Wait, but I'm not sure if n can be 4, but let's proceed with the given data.

So, the possible complexes are n=1,2,3,4.

So, each complex's formation is governed by their respective β.

The total concentration of all cobalt species is c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but considering the charges, the complexes with higher SCN- might have different charges. But when considering their concentrations, perhaps we can model each complex's concentration in terms of the free Co^2+ and SCN-.

But this seems complicated. Perhaps it's better to model this using the stability constants and the concentrations.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of successive approximations or consider the dominant species.

But I'm not sure. Another approach is to use the distribution of Co species, taking into account all the possible complexes. So, the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion can be determined by the given β and the concentrations of SCN-.

But I'm a bit confused about how to relate the β to the concentrations.

Wait, the general approach for such problems is to use the formation constants and the concentrations to find the distribution of species. Since all the β's are given, we can model each possible species and find their relative concentrations.

But given that the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, which is relatively high, the higher complexes might be more favored.

Wait, the total cobalt is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M. The SCN- is 0.1 M.

Hmm, let me think. For each complex, the concentration can be expressed in terms of the free Co^2+ and SCN-.

For Co^2+:

[Co^2+] = [Co^2+]

For [CoSCN]^+:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

Wait, no, I think that's not correct because each β is the cumulative constant for the nth complex. Wait, no, the formation constants are stepwise, not cumulative. Or are they? Oh, wait, stability constants are usually for the overall formation, not stepwise.

Wait, no. I think each β represents the formation constant for the specific complex. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n}, the β is the overall formation constant for that complex.

Thus, the concentration of each complex is given by β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

So, the concentrations of all complexes and the free Co^2+ can be written in terms of [Co^2+].

So, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

Which can be factored as:

[Co^2+] [ 1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4 ] = c_total

So, solving for [Co^2+]:

[Co^2+] = c_total / ( 1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4 )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can compute the concentrations of all complexes.

But let's plug in the numbers.

Given:

c_total = 1e-2 M = 0.01 M

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So compute each term in the denominator:

Term0 = 1

Term1 = β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2 = β2 * [SCN]^2 =40*(0.1)^2=40 * 0.01=0.4

Term3 = β3 * [SCN]^3 =63*(0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063

Term4 = β4 * [SCN]^4 =16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

So adding all terms:

Denominator = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = Let's calculate step by step.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Thus [Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.01 divided by approximately 2.3646.

0.01/2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Now, to find the concentration of each species:

[Co^2+] = 0.004225 M.

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] = 9 * 0.004225 * 0.1 = 9 * 0.0004225 = 0.0038025 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 =40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.004225 *0.01=40 * 0.00004225=0.00169 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 =63 *0.004225*(0.1)^3=63 *0.004225*0.001=63 * 0.000004225=0.000266175 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4=16 *0.004225*(0.1)^4=16 *0.004225 *0.0001=16 *0.0000004225=0.00000676 M.

Now, let's sum all these concentrations to check if they total to 0.01 M.

Compute each:

[Co^2+] = 0.004225 M

[CoSCN^+] = 0.0038025

[Co(SCN)_2] = 0.00169

[Co(SCN)_3] = 0.000266175

[Co(SCN)_4] = 0.00000676

Adding them:

0.004225 + 0.0038025 = 0.0080275

0.0080275 + 0.00169 = 0.0097175

0.0097175 + 0.000266175 ≈0.009983675

0.009983675 + 0.00000676≈0.009990435 M.

Which is very close to 0.01 M, so that checks out.

Now, the question asks for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex. Its concentration is 0.00169 M.

So the fraction is 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169, which is 16.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, but that's the percentage for [Co(SCN)_2], which is n=2. But wait, wait a minute. I thought the blue complex was the one with two SCN- ions. So according to this calculation, it's 0.00169/0.01 = 16.9%, which matches option D.

But wait, let me think again. Because in the denominator, when I calculated [Co^2+], I included all the complexes up to n=4. That's correct because the total includes all species. So the percentage of each species is (concentration of that species) divided by total c_total, which is 0.01 M.

So the calculation seems correct. So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but wait a moment. The β3 is 63, which is the highest β given. So that would suggest that the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex is the most stable. But according to the calculation, its concentration is only about 0.000266 M, which is less than the [Co(SCN)_2] complex. But that seems contradictory because β3 is higher than β2. Hmm, maybe because the higher β comes with higher powers of [SCN^-], which is 0.1 M, so maybe the effect is not as strong as the β.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait for [Co(SCN)_3], the calculation is 63 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.004225 * 0.001.

0.004225 * 0.001 = 0.000004225. Multiply by 63: 0.000004225 *63 = 0.000266175 M.

Yes, that's correct.

And [Co(SCN)_2] is 40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.004225 *0.01 =40 * 0.00004225=0.00169 M.

Hmm, so [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169 M, [Co(SCN)_3] is 0.000266 M. So [Co(SCN)_2] is more abundant, despite β3 being higher than β2. So why is that?

Because the [Co(SCN)_3] requires three SCN- ions, each at 0.1 M, so (0.1)^3 is 0.001, which is 1e-3, whereas (0.1)^2 is 1e-2, which is higher.

So even though β3 is higher, the denominator is higher because it's multiplied by more factors of [SCN], which is lower.

Wait, let me calculate the ratios.

For [Co(SCN)_3] vs [Co(SCN)_2]:

The ratio would be (β3 * [SCN]^3) / (β2 * [SCN]^2) ) = (β3/β2) * [SCN] = (63/40)*0.1 = (1.575) *0.1=0.1575.

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_3] is about 0.1575 times that of [Co(SCN)_2]. So [Co(SCN)_3] is about 15.75% as much as [Co(SCN)_2], which aligns with our calculated values, where [Co(SCN)_3] is about 0.000266 and [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00169. 0.000266 / 0.00169 ≈ 0.157, which matches the 15.75% ratio.

So the calculation seems correct.

But wait, the highest β is β3=63, so why isn't [Co(SCN)_3] the most abundant?

Because even though β3 is high, the higher order terms (like [SCN]^3) reduce the overall product. So the actual concentration depends on both β and the power of [SCN].

In this case, the β for n=3 is higher than n=2, but the [SCN^-]^3 is (0.1)^3=1e-3, while for n=2, it's (0.1)^2=1e-2, which is 10 times higher. So the product for n=3 is (63 * 1e-3) = 0.063, while for n=2 it's (40 * 1e-2)=0.4. So 0.4 is higher than 0.063, so n=2 is more dominant.

So in this scenario, the highest β doesn't necessarily mean the highest concentration because the other factors (like [SCN]^n) can have a significant impact.

So coming back to the original question, the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I thought the blue one might be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or another. But according to the options, 16.9% is an option, so perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. The β4 is given as 16, which is lower than β2 and β3. So the highest β is β3=63, but [Co(SCN)_3] has the lowest concentration.

So the dominant species are [Co^2+], [CoSCN]^+, and [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, let's look at their concentrations:

[Co^2+] ≈0.004225 M (4.225 mM)

[CoSCN^+] ≈0.0038025 M (3.8025 mM)

[Co(SCN)_2] ≈0.00169 M (1.69 mM)

So the order of concentrations is [Co^2+] > [CoSCN^+] > [Co(SCN)_2] > others.

Wait, that's interesting. So the most abundant is the free Co^2+.

So the percentage for each is:

[Co^2+] : 4.225 mM / 10 mM = 42.25%

[CoSCN^+] : 3.8025 mM /10 mM =38.025%

[Co(SCN)_2]: 1.69 mM/10 mM = 16.9%

Others are negligible.

So the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question asks for the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I thought blue is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. But according to our calculations, its percentage is 16.9%, which matches option D.

So the answer should be D) 16.9%.

But wait, wait a second. I'm getting confused about which complex is blue. Is the blue one [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or another complex?

Wait, I think the blue one is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. But according to the β given, β2 is 40, which is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or wait, perhaps the complexes have different charges.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which β corresponds to which complex. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. It doesn't specify, but I assumed that βn corresponds to the complex with n SCN- ligands.

But maybe β1 is the first step, which would be the formation of [CoSCN]^+ from Co^2+ and SCN^-. Then β2 would be the next step, so the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would be β1 * β2, perhaps. But that depends on how the β's are defined.

Wait, this is a critical point. Are the β's cumulative or sequential?

Oh, wait. This is a confusion point. Stability constants can be defined as stepwise or overall.

In the stepwise definition, β1 is the formation constant for the first ligand, β2 is the formation constant for the second ligand, etc. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n] would be the product of β1 through βn.

Alternatively, in the overall definition, βn is the formation constant for the complex with n ligands in one step.

But the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

So each β corresponds to a specific complex, not a step. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (if that's the case), etc.

Wait, but the way I used earlier, I used each β as the formation constant for the specific complex. So [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} has a βn equal to its formation constant.

So I think my initial approach is correct.

But perhaps I should model the problem differently, considering that the β's are stepwise. So the formation constants are for adding each SCN- in sequence.

In that case, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, that would be a different approach. Let me think about that.

If the β's are stepwise, then:

β1 = [ [CoSCN^+] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2^+] ] / ( [CoSCN^+][SCN^-] )

β3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3] ] / ( [Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-] )

And so on.

Then, for [Co(SCN)_2]^+, the overall formation constant would be β1 * β2.

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^0, it would be β1 * β2 * β3.

Wait, because each β is the stepwise constant.

But the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So if they are stepwise, then the overall β for a complex with n ligands would be the product of β1 to βn.

In that case, the approach I took earlier would be incorrect because I treated each β as the overall constant for that complex. If the β's are stepwise, I need to compute the overall constants by multiplying them.

So that changes everything.

Hmm, this is a crucial point. I think I assumed the β's were overall, but if they're stepwise, the calculation is different.

Let me clarify.

If β1 is the formation constant for the first ligand:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

β2 is the formation constant for the second ligand:

[Co(SCN)_2^+] = β2 [CoSCN^+][SCN^-] = β2 β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3] would be β3 β2 β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

And [Co(SCN)_4] would be β4 β3 β2 β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

So the total concentration of Co would now be:

c_total = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

So the denominator becomes:

1 + β1[SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 

So substituting the given β's:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So compute each term:

Term0 =1

Term1= β1[SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

Term2= β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6

Term3= β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) → 22680 * 1e-3 =22.68

Term4= β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880; 362880 * 1e-4=36.288

So adding all terms:

Denominator =1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288

Let me compute:

1 +0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So denominator is 64.468.

Thus, [Co^2+] = c_total / denominator = 0.01 /64.468 ≈0.0001551 M.

Wait, that's way lower than before. So [Co^2+] is about 1.55e-4 M.

Then, the concentrations of each species:

[Co^2+]=1.551e-4 M.

[CoSCN^+]=β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1= 9 * 1.551e-5 = 1.3959e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2^+]=β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2=9*40 *1.551e-4*(0.1)^2 = 360 * 1.551e-4 *0.01=360 *1.551e-6=5.5836e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]=β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3=9*40*63 *1.551e-4*(0.1)^3 =22680 *1.551e-4 *1e-3 → 22680 *1.551e-7= approximately 3.516e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]=β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4=9*40*63*16 *1.551e-4*(0.1)^4 → 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880. 362880 *1.551e-4 *1e-4= 362880 *1.551e-8 ≈5.623e-3 M.

Now, summing all concentrations:

[Co^2+]=1.551e-4

[CoSCN^+]=1.3959e-4

[Co(SCN)_2^+]=5.5836e-4

[Co(SCN)_3]=3.516e-3

[Co(SCN)_4]=5.623e-3

Adding:

1.551e-4 +1.3959e-4=3.947e-4

3.947e-4 +5.5836e-4=9.5306e-4

9.5306e-4 +3.516e-3=4.469e-3

4.469e-3 +5.623e-3=1.0092e-2 M.

Wait, that's approximately 0.010092 M, close to the total c_total of 0.01 M, considering rounding errors.

So the concentrations are:

[Co^2+] = ~0.000155 M

[CoSCN^+] = ~0.0001396 M

[Co(SCN)_2^+] = ~0.0005584 M

[Co(SCN)_3] = ~0.003516 M

[Co(SCN)_4] = ~0.005623 M

So the percentage of each:

[Co^2+]: (0.000155 /0.01)*100 = 1.55%

[CoSCN^+]: (0.0001396 /0.01)*100 = 1.396%

[Co(SCN)_2^+]: (0.0005584 /0.01)*100=5.584%

[Co(SCN)_3]: (0.003516 /0.01)*100=35.16%

[Co(SCN)_4]: (0.005623 /0.01)*100=56.23%

Wait, so sum of percentages:

1.55 +1.396=2.946

+5.584=8.53

+35.16=43.69

+56.23=99.92. So almost 100%.

In this scenario, the [Co(SCN)_4] is the dominant species, at about 56.23%, [Co(SCN)_3] is 35.16%, [Co(SCN)_2^+] is 5.584%, [CoSCN^+] is 1.396%, and [Co^2+] is 1.55%.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Assuming that the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (which would correspond to [Co(SCN)_2^+], but in this case, the [Co(SCN)_2^+] is a minor species at about 5.584%.

But according to the options provided, the closest is option C (38.1%) or D (16.9%). But according to this new approach, it's 5.58% which isn't an option. So I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the β's are not stepwise but overall. So the initial approach was correct, leading to the dithiocyanato complex being 16.9%, option D.

But how to decide which approach is correct?

The problem states that the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Stability constants usually refer to the overall formation constants for each complex. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^something, etc.

So the initial approach is correct.

Thus, the percentage is 16.9%, option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species, we analyze the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16), the total cobalt concentration (c(Co) = 10⁻² M), and the thiocyanate concentration ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M).

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:  
   Each β corresponds to the formation constant of a specific cobalt-thiocyanate complex:
   - β₁ = 9 for [CoSCN]⁺ (n = 1),
   - β₂ = 40 for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ (n = 2),
   - β₃ = 63 for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n = 3),
   - β₄ = 16 for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n = 4).

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is distributed among all species:
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)₂}^{2+}] + [\text{Co(SCN)₃}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)₄}^{2-}].
   \]
   Using the stability constants, the concentration of each species can be expressed in terms of the free cobalt ion \([\text{Co}^{2+}]\):
   \[
   [\text{CoSCN}^+] = \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-],
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)₂}^{2+}] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2,
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)₃}^-] = \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3,
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)₄}^{2-}] = \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4.
   \]

3. **Solving for \([\text{Co}^{2+}]\)**:  
   Substituting the expressions into the total cobalt concentration equation:
   \[
   c_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 \right).
   \]
   Rearranging for \([\text{Co}^{2+}]\):
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{c_{\text{total}}}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}.
   \]

4. **Substitute Values**:  
   Given \(c_{\text{total}} = 0.01 \, \text{M}\) and \([\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), calculate each term:
   \[
   \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9,
   \]
   \[
   \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4,
   \]
   \[
   \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063,
   \]
   \[
   \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016.
   \]
   Adding these:
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   [\text{Co}^{2+}] = \frac{0.01}{2.3646} \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}.
   \]

5. **Concentrations of All Species**:  
   Using \([\text{Co}^{2+}] \approx 0.004225 \, \text{M}\), calculate the concentrations of all cobalt species:
   \[
   [\text{CoSCN}^+] = \beta_1 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-] = 9 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot 0.1 = 0.0038025 \, \text{M},
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)₂}^{2+}] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.00169 \, \text{M},
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)₃}^-] = \beta_3 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.000266175 \, \text{M},
   \]
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)₄}^{2-}] = \beta_4 [\text{Co}^{2+}] [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.004225 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.00000676 \, \text{M}.
   \]

6. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**:  
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)₂}^{2+}]}{c_{\text{total}}} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
