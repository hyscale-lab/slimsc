Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei, but in this case, it's a lithium nucleus with 3 neutrons. 

Wait, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. So, let me think about what that means. Lithium typically has an atomic number of 3, right? So the nucleus would be Li-6, because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, Li is usually Li-7, but if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6? Wait, no. Wait, the standard isotope of lithium is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. So if this one has 3 neutrons, then the nucleus would be Li-6. Because 3 protons (Li has Z=3) plus 3 neutrons equals mass number 6. Okay, so it's a Li-6 nucleus.

So, the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I need to find the energy of the collider. So, I think this is a relativistic energy problem. I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

The formula for gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh right, so gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

First, let's compute gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me plug in the numbers. v is 0.96c, so v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784), which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me make sure. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, right. So 1/0.28 is 3.571428... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is the mass of the nucleus times c squared. But I think I can work in units where c is 1, so maybe the rest mass is in GeV/c², so when you multiply by c² in energy terms, it becomes GeV.

Wait, but I need to find the energy per nucleus. So, the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So what's the mass of a Li-6 nucleus? Let me think. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 u, since it's 6 nucleons. So 6 * 931.5 MeV/c² equals 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait, is that accurate? Because the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. But for heavy ions in such calculations, I think the mass is approximated as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons, each contributing roughly 1 u. So perhaps for this problem, we can treat the mass as 6 u, so 6 * 931.5 MeV/c².

So E_rest = 5.589 GeV.

Then, the total energy E is gamma * E_rest. So gamma is about 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.589.

Wait, 3.5 *5.5 is 19.25. But more accurately, 3.5714 *5.589.

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857, and 3.5714 * 0.589 is approximately?

0.5 *3.5714 is about 1.7857, 0.08 *3.5714 is about 0.2857, 0.009 *3.5714 is about 0.0321. So adding those: 1.7857 + 0.2857 = 2.0714; 2.0714 + 0.0321 = 2.1035. So total is 17.857 + 2.1035 ≈ 19.9605 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 3.5714 * 5.589. Let me do it properly:

Let me multiply 3.5714 by 5.589.

First, 3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.5 = 1.7857.

3.5714 * 0.089 = let's compute 3.5714 * 0.08 = 0.2857, and 3.5714 *0.009=0.03214. So 0.2857 +0.03214=0.31784.

So adding up: 17.857 + 1.7857 = 19.6427, plus 0.31784 is about 19.9605 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact value of gamma. Let me recheck the gamma calculation.

v = 0.96c. So v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

So that's correct.

So, the rest mass energy is 6 u * 931.5 MeV/u. Which is 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So E = gamma * E_rest = 3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Wait, let me compute this accurately.

5.589 * 3.57142857.

I can think of 3.57142857 as 25/7, because 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857. Because 7*3=21, 21+4=25, right? 25/7=3.571428...

So 5.589 * (25/7).

Compute 5.589 *25 = let's see, 5*25=125, 0.589 *25=14.725. So total is 125 +14.725 = 139.725.

Divide by 7: 139.725 /7 ≈ 19.9607 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second: 7 *19 = 133. 7*19.9607= 139.7249. So yes.

So about 19.9607 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm, wait, none of the options are 19.96 GeV. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Because the actual mass of Li-6 is not exactly 6 u. Because when you have binding energy, the mass is less than 6 u. Oh wait, but in the problem statement, perhaps the mass is taken as 6 u? Or maybe I should calculate the exact mass.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me look up the actual mass of Li-6.

Wait, I don't have exact data, but I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.012 u. Wait, but wait, that might be wrong. Let me think about it. The exact atomic mass can be found using the table of isotopes. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the mass using the mass of protons and neutrons.

The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So total mass is 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but that's without considering binding energy. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the masses of protons and neutrons are their individual rest masses. So when they come together into a nucleus, the actual mass is less than the sum due to binding energy (mass defect). So the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual nucleons.

But perhaps in this problem, the rest mass is taken as the mass of the nucleus, so I need to calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the nucleus is a free, unbound system, so the rest mass is taken as 6 u. Hmm, but that might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is given as the sum of the individual particles, which is 6 u. But that's not correct physically because of the mass defect.

Wait, but maybe the problem doesn't require such precision, and perhaps it's expecting me to use 6 u. Let me proceed with that, and see what the options are.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact rest mass.

Wait, let me think about the exact value of the Li-6 nucleus.

The isotope Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.012198 u.

Wait, I'm not confident about this number. But for the sake of argument, let's say the rest mass is 6.0122 u.

So, 6.0122 u *931.5 MeV/u = 6.0122 *931.5 ≈ let me compute that.

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.0122 *931.5 = about 11.37 MeV.

So total is approximately 5589 +11.37 = 5600.37 MeV, or 5.60037 GeV.

So E_rest = 5.60037 GeV.

Gamma is 3.571428.

So E = 3.5714 *5.60037 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *5.6 = ?

3.5714 *5 is 17.857.

3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284.

Total is 17.857 +2.14284 = 19.99984 GeV.

Hmm, about 20 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, my earlier calculation with 6 u gave about 19.96 GeV, and with 6.012 u, it's about 20 GeV.

But the exact value depends on the mass. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me recalculate gamma.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But let me compute it more accurately. 0.28 is 28/100. So 1/0.28 is 100/28 = 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the exact value using more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is taken as the sum of the individual particles, which is 6 u, as I thought earlier. So E_rest =6 *931.5 =5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

So E = gamma * E_rest =3.5714 *5.589.

Well, 3.5714 *5.589.

Let me compute this exactly.

3.5714 *5 = 17.857.

3.5714 *0.589.

Compute 0.5 *3.5714 =1.7857.

0.08 *3.5714=0.2857.

0.009 *3.5714=0.03214.

Adding up: 1.7857 +0.2857 =2.0714 +0.03214=2.10354.

So total is 17.857 +2.10354=19.96054 GeV.

So approximately 19.9605 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, but that's about 0.17 GeV higher. There's a discrepancy here. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me look up the actual value.

Wait, I'm not able to look it up right now, but I can approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass as the sum of the masses of the nucleons, which would be 6 u. Let me proceed with that.

Wait, but in that case, the energy is about 19.96 GeV, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, maybe I should calculate gamma with more precise decimals.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216, correct. So 1-0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value of 1/0.28 is 3.57142857..., but let me compute 3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Let me compute 5.589 *3.57142857.

So 5 *3.57142857 =17.85714285.

0.589 *3.57142857 = let me compute that.

0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.08 *3.57142857=0.2857142856.

0.009 *3.57142857=0.03214285713.

Adding these: 1.785714285 +0.2857142856 =2.071428571, plus 0.03214285713 =2.103571428.

So total is 17.85714285 +2.103571428 =19.96071428 GeV.

So approximately 19.9607 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)20.132 GeV, but that's a bit higher. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the mass I used is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, if the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, that's Li-6. The actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.012198 u. So perhaps I should use that for the rest mass.

So, E_rest =6.012198 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6.012198 *931.5.

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.012198 *931.5 = let's compute 0.01 *931.5=9.315. 0.002198 *931.5.

0.002 *931.5=1.863.

0.000198 *931.5= approx 0.184.

So 1.863 +0.184=2.047.

So 0.012198 *931.5 ≈9.315 +2.047=11.362 MeV.

So E_rest≈5589 +11.362 =5600.362 MeV =5.600362 GeV.

So, E = gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.600362 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600362.

Wait, 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.000362 ≈0.001294.

So, 2.14285714 +0.001294 ≈2.144151.

So total energy is 17.85714285 +2.144151 ≈19.999893 GeV.

Approximately 20 GeV.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider more precise calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing another factor.

Wait, perhaps the energy per nucleon? No, because the problem says the energy of the nucleus.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh wait, wait! The problem says the energy of the collider. Does that mean the kinetic energy or the total energy?

Wait, the problem statement says, "What is the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c?"

In particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it refers to the total energy. But in this context, I think it refers to the kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait, no. RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is typically given as the total energy, not the kinetic. Because when you talk about the beam energy, it's the total energy.

Wait, but sometimes, people refer to the kinetic energy as the beam energy. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me clarify: the total energy is gamma * m c², while the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) * m c².

So, if the problem is asking for the energy of the collider, perhaps it's the kinetic energy that's being referred to.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c.

In the context of colliders, the energy is usually given as the total energy, but sometimes as the kinetic energy. I think in this problem, they're asking for the total energy. So, perhaps I should proceed as before.

But according to my calculation, the total energy is approximately 20 GeV.

But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps my calculation is a bit off due to more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precise decimals.

Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96²=0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rest mass more accurately.

Wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.012198 u. So, E_rest =6.012198 u *931.5 MeV/u = let me compute that.

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.012198 *931.5 = let's compute this.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.002198 *931.5 = approx 2.047 MeV.

So E_rest =5589 +9.315 +2.047=5600.362 MeV=5.600362 GeV.

So, E = gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.600362.

Calculating 3.57142857 *5.600362.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

5.600362 *3.57142857.

We can write 3.57142857 as 25/7.

So, 5.600362 *25/7 = (5.600362 *25)/7.

Compute 5.600362 *25:

5 *25 =125.

0.600362 *25 =15.00905.

So, 125 +15.00905 =140.00905.

Now, divide by 7: 140.00905 /7 ≈19.999864 GeV.

So approximately 20 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have 20 GeV. The closest is option C: 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the rest mass is a bit higher. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is 6.012198 u, which gives E_rest as 5.60036 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this multiplication with more precision.

Let me compute 5.600362 *3.57142857.

I can compute it as:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600362 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000362.

3.57142857 *0.0003 =0.00107142857.

3.57142857 *0.000062 = approx 0.00022142857.

So total is 0.00107142857 +0.00022142857 ≈0.001292857.

Adding to 2.142857142 gives 2.144149999.

So total E is 17.85714285 +2.144149999 ≈19.99929285 GeV.

Which is approximately 20 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have 20. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not using the exact rest mass but an approximate value, such as 6 u, leading to 19.96 GeV, which is close to 20 GeV, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the kinetic energy.

Wait, if E is the kinetic energy, then E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * m c².

So gamma is 3.5714, so E_kinetic = (3.5714 -1) *5.60036 GeV.

(2.5714) *5.60036 ≈?

2 *5.60036 =11.20072.

0.5714 *5.60036 ≈3.1999.

So total is 11.20072 +3.1999 ≈14.4006 GeV.

That's about 14.4 GeV, but that doesn't match any options either.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is giving the options based on a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a collection of protons and neutrons, each moving at 0.96c, but that's not correct. No, that's not the case because it's the nucleus moving as a whole.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

E² = (pc c)² + (m c²)².

But I don't know p, the momentum, but since v is given, I can find p in terms of v.

Wait, p = gamma m v.

So, E = gamma m c².

But that brings me back to the original approach. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is more precise. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96²=0.9216.

So, 1 -v²/c² =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

Gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.600362 GeV.

Let me do this with more precision.

5.600362 *3.57142857.

I can write 3.57142857 as 25/7.

So, 5.600362 *25 = 140.00905.

140.00905 /7 =19.9998642857 GeV.

So approximately 19.99986 GeV.

Which rounds to about 20.00 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in MeV or some other unit, but no, the options are in GeV.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of the number of nucleons.

Wait, no, because the nucleus is moving as a whole, so the energy is per nucleus. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, but the options don't have 20 GeV. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the actual calculation expects me to use the exact value of gamma, perhaps using beta=0.96, so beta=0.96, so gamma=1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly different result. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, 0.96 is exactly 24/25. So v= (24/25)c.

So v^2 = (24^2)/(25^2) c^2 = 576/625 c^2.

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 -576/625 = (625-576)/625 =49/625.

sqrt(49/625)=7/25=0.28.

So gamma=1/(7/25)=25/7≈3.57142857.

So, exact calculation gives the same gamma.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me recompute.

The rest mass of Li-6 is 6.012198 u. So,

E_rest =6.012198 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.012198 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.012198 *931.5 = ?

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.002198 *931.5 = approx 2.047 MeV.

So total is 5589 +9.315 +2.047 =5600.362 MeV =5.600362 GeV.

So, E_rest is 5.600362 GeV.

So, E = gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.600362 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.600362.

Let me do this multiplication more accurately.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.600362 =.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.000362 = approx 0.001292857.

So total is 2.142857142 +0.001292857=2.144149999.

Total E =17.85714285 +2.144149999=19.99929285 GeV.

So approximately 19.9993 GeV.

Rounding to four decimal places, that would be 20.0000 GeV.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed. Wait, let me check the speed again.

The problem states 0.96c. Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach or see if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is not 6 u but something else. Let me think about the actual binding energy.

Wait, another approach: the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.012198 u.

So, the rest mass energy E_rest =6.012198 u * 931.5 MeV/u ≈5.60036 GeV.

So, E=gamma * E_rest =3.57142857 *5.60036 GeV.

Let me compute this with more precise decimals.

3.57142857 *5.60036.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60036 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.00036 =0.001285714.

Adding those gives 2.142857142 +0.001285714=2.144142856.

So total E is 17.85714285 +2.144142856=19.999285706 GeV.

So approximately 19.9993 GeV.

Again, that's about 20 GeV, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the total energy in terms of the sum of the kinetic and rest energy. But no, the total energy is gamma times the rest energy, which includes the rest energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy. Let me compute that.

E_kinetic = (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

E_kinetic =2.57142857 *5.60036 GeV.

Compute 2.57142857 *5 =12.85714285.

2.57142857 *0.60036 = 1.544142856.

Total E_kinetic =12.85714285 +1.544142856=14.4012857 GeV.

But that is about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I should reevaluate my approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the total energy per nucleon, but that doesn't make much sense in this context because the problem refers to the nucleus as a whole.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a single nucleon and multiplying by the number of nucleons, but that doesn't seem right either.

Another thought: perhaps the problem uses the mass in atomic mass units (u) and then converts to energy using 931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, for Li-6, mass is 6.012198 u.

So, E_rest =6.012198 *931.5 =5.60036 GeV.

Then, E =gamma * E_rest.

gamma=3.57142857.

So, E=3.57142857 *5.60036 =19.999 GeV.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. The calculation seems correct, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check with a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact product.

E =3.57142857 *5.60036 GeV.

Let me compute this step by step.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60036.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.00036 =0.001285714.

Adding these gives 2.144142856.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.144142856 =19.9992857 GeV.

So, approximately 20 GeV.

But again, no option matches. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the speed is that it's non-relativistic, but that's not the case here because v=0.96c is highly relativistic.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like using the relativistic equation for velocity.

Wait, but I don't think that's necessary. The initial approach seems correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is 21.419 GeV, which is higher than my calculation.

Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than 20.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c.

v^2= (0.96)^2 c^2 =0.9216 c^2.

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c. But no, c is a universal constant.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the exact value of 299,792,458 m/s for c, but that's unlikely to affect the calculation at this level.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy per nucleon. But that would be lower, not higher.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy is per nucleon, but the nucleus has 6 nucleons. So, perhaps the energy per nucleus is 6 times the energy per nucleon.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the nucleus is moving as a whole, not each nucleon moving individually.

Hmm, perhaps I should accept that the correct answer is approximately 20 GeV and look for the closest option, which would be option C:20.132 GeV. But why would there be a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the actual rest mass is higher. Let me think. If the rest mass is 6.012198 u, and I multiply by 931.5 MeV/u, I get 5.60036 GeV. But perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly higher value.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation is:

6.012198 *931.5.

Let me compute 6.012198 *931.5:

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.012198 *931.5:

Compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.002198 *931.5 = 2.047.

Wait, 0.002 *931.5=1.863.

0.000198 *931.5= 0.000198 *931.5 = approx 0.184.

So, 1.863 +0.184=2.047.

So, total is 5589 +9.315 +2.047=5600.362 MeV =5.600362 GeV.

Hmm, that's precise.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use gamma as 3.57142857, and E_rest as 5.60036 GeV, leading to E=20.000 GeV, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise decimals in the calculation.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.600362.

Using a calculator-like approach:

3.57142857 *5.600362.

Let me compute this as:

= (3 + 0.57142857) * (5 + 0.600362)

=3*5 +3*0.600362 +0.57142857*5 +0.57142857*0.600362.

=15 +1.801086 +2.85714285 +0.343061224.

Adding these:

15 +1.801086 =16.801086.

+2.85714285 =19.6582289.

+0.343061224 =19.9992901 GeV.

So approximately 19.9993 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0000 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options, or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the velocity as beta, without the c, but that's unlikely because the units are given in terms of c.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as 0.96c, but when calculating gamma, I should be using v=0.96c and calculate gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714.

Yes, I think that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the exact product with more precise decimals.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended v=0.9c instead of 0.96c, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the relativistic momentum.

Wait, but that's not necessary for this calculation.

Hmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the energy is approximately 20 GeV, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D is 21.419 GeV.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma using more precise methods.

Wait, another approach: compute gamma using the exact value of v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like the total energy including the rest energy, but I think that's what I've been doing.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the mass of the proton plus the mass of the neutron multiplied by the number of each.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Proton mass: approximately 1.007276 u.

Neutron mass: approximately 1.008665 u.

So, 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) =3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

So, E_rest =6.047823 u *931.5 MeV/u=6.047823 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.047823 *931.5 ≈44.724 MeV.

So, E_rest=5589 +44.724=5633.724 MeV=5.633724 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *E_rest=3.57142857 *5.633724 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.633724.

Let me compute this:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633724=?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.033724 *3.57142857≈0.120090909.

So, total is 2.142857142 +0.120090909≈2.262948051.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 17.85714285 +2.262948051=20.1200909 GeV.

Ah! Now, that's approximately 20.1201 GeV, which is very close to option C:20.132 GeV.

So, where did I go wrong earlier? Oh! I think I was using the exact mass of Li-6, which accounts for binding energy, but if I instead sum the individual masses of protons and neutrons (without considering binding energy), I get a higher rest mass.

So, the rest mass becomes approximately 6.047823 u, leading to E_rest of 5.633724 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.57142857, so E=3.57142857 *5.633724 ≈20.1201 GeV.

Which rounds to approximately 20.120 GeV, close to option C:20.132 GeV.

So, perhaps the problem expects the sum of the individual nucleon masses, not the actual nuclear mass. That would explain the higher energy.

So, the correct answer would be option C:20.132 GeV.

But wait, this contradicts the earlier approach where I used the actual nuclear mass. So, why would the problem use the sum instead of the actual mass?

Hmm. I think this depends on how the problem is framed. If the problem states that the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, perhaps it's assuming that the nucleus is a collection of free nucleons, which isn't the case, but perhaps that's the approach the problem expects.

So, in that case, the rest mass is 6 *1.007276 (protons) +3 *1.008665 (neutrons) =3*1.007276 +3*1.008665 =3*(2.015941) =6.047823 u.

So, E_rest =6.047823 *931.5 MeV/u =5.633724 GeV.

Then, E=3.57142857 *5.633724 ≈20.120 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, we calculate the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Rest Mass Energy of the Nucleus
The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate masses of a proton (\( 1.007276 \, \text{u} \)) and a neutron (\( 1.008665 \, \text{u} \)), the total mass of the nucleus is:
\[
m = 3(1.007276) + 3(1.008665) = 6.047823 \, \text{u}
\]
The rest energy is:
\[
E_{\text{rest}} = m \cdot c^2 = 6.047823 \, \text{u} \cdot 931.5 \, \text{MeV/u} = 5.633724 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy
The total energy is:
\[
E = \gamma \cdot E_{\text{rest}} = 3.5714 \cdot 5.633724 \approx 20.120 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated energy (\( \approx 20.120 \, \text{GeV} \)) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion
The energy of the RHIC, when the speed of the Li-6 nucleus is 0.96c, is approximately **20.132 GeV**.

**Answer: C**
