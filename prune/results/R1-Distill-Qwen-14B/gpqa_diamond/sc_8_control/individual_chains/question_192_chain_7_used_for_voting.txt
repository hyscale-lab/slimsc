Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. Okay, the setup is a bit detailed, so I need to parse it carefully.

So, the problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor—it's shifted by a distance s. So the cavity's center is s units away from the conductor's center, right? The cavity's radius is r, and since r is less than R, it's entirely inside the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is located at a distance L from the conductor's center. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both l and L are greater than R. There's an angle θ between l and s, I think. Wait, the angle between l and s is θ, so that's about the spatial arrangement of these points.

Hmm. I remember that when a charge is placed inside a conducting cavity, the conductor's response is to have induced charges. But wait, the conductor itself was initially uncharged. So, how does this work?

Okay, so the conductor is uncharged. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have an induced charge as well. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

No, actually, for a conductor with a cavity, when you put a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. But wait, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface must have -q, and then the outer surface must have +q to balance. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero, the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q to make the total zero. Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the net charge is zero. So, if the inner surface has -q, then the outer must have +q because the conductor's net charge is zero. Wait, that's correct.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The conductor is neutral, so total charge is zero. The charge +q inside the cavity induces a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge +q. Because the inner surface has -q, the outer has +q: summing to zero. So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q.

But wait, point P is outside the conductor. So, when calculating the electric field at P due to the conductor's charges, we can treat the conductor as a spherical shell with charge +q uniformly distributed on the outer surface. Because for points outside a spherical shell, the field is as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. So, the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P. But wait, the conductor's outer radius is R, and P is outside, so yes, the field is as if the charge is at the center.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, but the arrangement of the cavity's position might affect the distribution of the charge on the outer surface. Oh, but since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform regardless of the cavity's position because the conductor is a sphere. Oh wait, no—no, the cavity is off-center, but the conductor is a sphere, right? So, the inner surface's charge distribution would be non-uniform, but the outer surface's charge would still be uniform because the conductor is a sphere.

Hmm, no, that's not quite right. The conductor is a sphere, so even if the cavity is off-center, the outer surface would still be symmetric. Because any induced charges would be on the inner surface, but the outer surface would adjust to ensure that the overall conductor is neutral and the field outside is the same as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the charge distribution on the inner surface would depend on where the charge is placed inside the cavity. But the outer surface would still look like a uniform sphere because the conductor is spherical. So, the electric field outside would be that of a point charge at the center, with magnitude q/(4πε₀ L²), where L is the distance from the center to point P.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the answer would be option B. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

Wait, the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q. So the field outside is due to that +q. So yes, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor (which is the same as the center of the outer surface) to point P. So that's option B.

Wait, but I should think about why the other options are incorrect. Option A has (l - s cosθ) squared in the denominator. That would imply that the effective distance is from the center of the cavity, but I don't think that's the case here because the outer charge distribution is on the conductor's surface, which is centered at the conductor's center, not the cavity's center.

Option C uses (l + s cosθ), which seems like the sum, but that doesn't make sense because the conductor's field is determined by its center. Option D uses l squared, but l is the distance from the cavity's center to P, but the conductor's field depends on the conductor's radius and the distance from its center, not the cavity's.

So, the correct answer should be option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²).

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$) inside it. The center of the cavity is shifted by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. For points outside the conductor, the electric field due to a spherical shell of charge is equivalent to the field produced by the total charge concentrated at the center of the shell. Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is determined by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor, located at the center of the conductor.

The distance from the center of the conductor to point $P$ is $L$, so the electric field at $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: This suggests the electric field depends on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which implies the field is influenced by the cavity's center. However, the field outside the conductor is determined by the charge distribution on the outer surface, which is centered at the conductor's center, not the cavity's center. This makes Option A incorrect.

- **Option B**: This matches the derived expression for the electric field at $P$, as the field outside the conductor depends only on the charge $+q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center. This is correct.

- **Option C**: This suggests the electric field depends on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is inconsistent with the symmetry of the conductor and the fact that the field outside depends only on the charge at the center. This makes Option C incorrect.

- **Option D**: This suggests the electric field depends on $l^2$, where $l$ is the distance from the cavity's center to $P$. However, the field outside the conductor is determined by the charge on the outer surface, which is centered at the conductor's center, not the cavity's center. This makes Option D incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
