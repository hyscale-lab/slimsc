Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decays, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the decay of a boson X into fermions. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. The boson X interacts with the fermions through this term.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to find out what fermions it can decay into at the lowest order. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, the energy (or mass) of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion has mass, and in the decay, each would take some energy. So, the condition is M_X ≥ 2m_f. If the boson's mass is less than twice the fermion's mass, the decay isn't kinematically allowed.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions:

- Electron (e): very light, around 0.0005 GeV. So 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV, way below 6 GeV. So e can be produced.
- Muon (μ): about 0.1057 GeV. 2m_mu ≈ 0.211 GeV. Also much less than 6.
- Tau (τ): much heavier, about 1.777 GeV. 2m_tau ≈ 3.554 GeV. So 6 GeV is more than that, so tau can be produced.
- Up quark (u): mass around 2 MeV (0.002 GeV). 2m_u ≈ 0.004, so yes.
- Down quark (d): similar, about 4-5 MeV, so 2m_d around 0.01 GeV. Also allowed.
- Strange quark (s): around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV). 2m_s ≈ 0.2 GeV. So yes.
- Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV. 2m_c ≈ 3 GeV. 6 GeV is bigger, so allowed.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.5 GeV. 2m_b ≈ 9 GeV. Oh wait, 9 is bigger than 6, so 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks because 6 < 9. So b and anti-b would require X mass of at least 9 GeV.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. X mass is 6 GeV. The bottom quark's mass is about 4.5 GeV. So each b would take 4.5 GeV, but you need 2 times that, 9 GeV. Since X is only 6, it's not enough. So b quarks are out.

Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. 2m_t is way over 6 GeV. So no way X can decay into top.

So, looking back at the fermions, which are allowed?

The fermions that can be produced in pairs (since X is a boson and likely decays into a pair of fermions) would be those where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

So let's list them:

- e- e+ : allowed (mass ~0)
- mu+ mu-: allowed
- tau+ tau-: allowed (since 2*1.777 ~3.55 <6)
- u u-bar: allowed
- d d-bar: allowed
- s s-bar: allowed
- c c-bar: allowed (2*1.5=3 <6)
- b b-bar: not allowed (as discussed)
- t t-bar: nope, way too heavy.

Wait, what about the charged leptons and quarks? The problem states it's a Yukawa interaction, but in the Lagrangian given, it's written as -λ f ψ_f X ψ_f. Wait, the term is -λ f ψ_f (X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe I should parse this correctly.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this looks like a Yukawa coupling term. So for each fermion species f, X can couple to ψ_f and ψ_f̄ (since the term is ψ_f X ψ_f, which implies creation or annihilation of a pair ψ_f and ψ_f̄? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the term is written as -λ f ψ_f (y) (something) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe it's more like λ f (y) X(y) ψ_f (y) ψ_f (y). Hmm, but I'm not entirely clear on the exact structure. Wait, perhaps the term is -λ f (y) X(y) ψ_f (y) ψ_f (y) plus the υ term.

Wait, but in any case, the X field is interacting with the fermions ψ_f. So, for each f, X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f-bar, because the interaction term allows that. So it's a Yukawa coupling, so X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair.

So for each fermion f, if 2m_f ≤ M_X=6 GeV, then decay into f and f-bar is allowed.

So which fermions meet that condition?

List of fermions and their approximate masses:

Electron (e): 0.000511 GeV → 2m_e ≈ 0.001 → allowed.

Muon (μ): 0.1057 GeV → 2m_mu ≈ 0.211 → allowed.

Tau (τ): 1.777 GeV → 2m_tau ≈ 3.554 → allowed.

Up quark (u): ~0.002 GeV → 2m_u ≈ 0.004 → allowed.

Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV → 2m_d ≈ 0.008 → allowed.

Strange quark (s): ~0.1 GeV → 2m_s ≈ 0.2 → allowed.

Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV → 2m_c=3 → allowed.

Bottom quark (b): 4.5 GeV → 2m_b=9 → X=6 <9 → Not allowed.

Top quark (t): way too heavy, 173 GeV → no.

So the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but in the options, let's check each.

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, wait. The boson would decay into a pair of each allowed fermion. But the b quark pair is not allowed. So option A includes b, which is not allowed, so A is wrong.

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That's correct because c is allowed (2*1.5=3 ≤6), no b. So B includes c, which should be allowed, but wait let me check the masses again. Wait, 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6, so yes.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy. So this option is wrong.

Option D: X→ b b-bar, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is not allowed, so D is wrong.

So the correct set is e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Yes, that's correct.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking back, the problem says the interaction is with fermions f. So which fermions are included? The Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ_f (y) ( ... ) ψ_f(y). So for each fermion species f, it's coupling.

So each fermion f can be produced in a pair.

So the possible decay products are pairs for each allowed f.

So in the options, the decay channels are X → [fermion pair], so each option lists the possible fermion pairs.

Looking at the options:

Option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's 7 fermion pairs, all allowed.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check about the charm quark.

Charm quark mass is about 1.27 GeV (sometimes cited as around 1.5, depending on the source), but let's take it as 1.5 GeV.

So 2m_c is 3 GeV. 3 <6, so yes, c c-bar is allowed.

So in the Lagrangian, X couples to all these fermions, so their decays are allowed.

So the allowed decays are into all these fermion pairs except b and t.

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze its decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The condition for a decay \( X \rightarrow f\bar{f} \) to be allowed is \( M_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion \( f \).

- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9 > 6 \)).
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 346 > 6 \)).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
