Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's an operator P with components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each has a matrix form given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because usually we work in the eigenbasis of an operator when dealing with its measurements.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, this is the state vector ψ.

We need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of P_z in this state. The formula for uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but since ψ is an eigenstate of P_x, but P_z is a different operator. So ψ is not an eigenstate of P_z, which means the expectation values won't be straightforward.

First, I think I need to compute the expectation value of P_z and the expectation of P_z squared.

But wait, the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh, so our state vector is already in the P_z eigenbasis. That might make things easier. Because in that case, each component of the vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z.

Wait, so the state is a vector in the P_z basis. Let me see. So the basis vectors are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, |−z⟩, or something like that, which are the eigenvectors of P_z. So when I write the state as a column vector (a, b, c), each component a, b, c corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate.

In our case, the state is (−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2). So, the components correspond to the eigenvalues of P_z. Wait, but what are the eigenvalues of P_z?

Looking back at the matrix of P_z: it's diagonal, right? The diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenvalues are +ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the state ψ can be written as a linear combination of these eigenstates. So when I compute ⟨P_z⟩, it's just the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Wait, because each component in the vector corresponds to the eigenstate's amplitude. So the probabilities are the squares of the amplitudes.

So, the state is ψ = a |+z⟩ + b |0⟩ + c |−z⟩, where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. The state is a vector in the P_z eigenbasis, so each component is the amplitude for each eigenvector. So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is |a|^2 * (ħ) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Because, for each eigenstate, the expectation is the eigenvalue times the probability.

So, let's compute |a|^2 and |c|^2.

a is -1/2, so |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Similarly, c is -1/2, so |c|^2 is also 1/4.

b is 1/√2, so |b|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the average P_z is zero. What about ⟨P_z²⟩?

P_z squared is just the same as (P_z)^2, which in the eigenbasis is diagonal, with eigenvalues squared, so (ħ)^2, 0, (−ħ)^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by (eigenvalue)^2.

So |a|^2 * (ħ²) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ²).

Which is (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (ħ²)/2.

Then the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( (ħ²/2) - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes I might mix up the order or signs.

Wait, the square of the eigenvalues are all positive, right? So for P_z, the squared eigenvalues are ħ², 0, ħ².

So the calculation seems correct. The uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it using the matrix. But since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, it's easier to compute the expectation values without matrix multiplication.

Wait, let me think again. The state is in the P_z basis, so the expectation value of P_z is just the diagonal elements multiplied by the probabilities.

Yes, so I think my approach is correct.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the state $\psi$, represented as the column vector $(-1/2, 1/\sqrt{2}, -1/2)$, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of its matrix representation.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as the weighted sum of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, where the weights are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $\psi$). The components of $\psi$ are:
- $a = -1/2$, so $|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$,
- $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, so $|b|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$,
- $c = -1/2$, so $|c|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.

Thus:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 (\hbar) + |b|^2 (0) + |c|^2 (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 + \frac{1}{4} (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Therefore:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 (\hbar^2) + |b|^2 (0) + |c|^2 (\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$.
