Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says we have 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. The system is isolated, which probably means no external fields are affecting them, and we're considering their mutual interactions.

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. And the question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electrostatic potential energy, right? Because kinetic energy would require motion, and if the charges are constrained, their positions are fixed except for the 13th which is also fixed. Wait, no, the 13th is fixed at point P. The others are each 2 meters away from P. So all 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, but how are the 12 charges arranged around point P? Are they all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters? Probably. But since the problem is about the potential energy, I might not need to know their exact arrangement, just the distances between each pair.

Wait, but calculating the potential energy for all interactions could get complicated. For a system of charges, the total electrostatic potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. So for each pair, you calculate (k * q1 * q2) / r, where r is the distance between them.

But with 13 charges, the number of pairs is... let's see. The formula is n(n-1)/2. So 13 * 12 / 2 = 78 pairs. Wait, but some of these pairs are between the fixed charge and the others, and the others are between the 12 moving charges.

The 13th charge is fixed at P. Each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P. So the distance between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is 2 m. So each of those pairs contributes (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2). 

Wait, but wait, the 13th charge is fixed. So each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from the 13th. So each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th, and each of the 12 interacts with the others.

So let me break the total potential energy into two parts: the energy due to the interactions between the 13th charge and the 12, and the energy due to the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

So first part: energy between 13th and each of the 12. Each of these is (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2 m). Since there are 12 such pairs, the total for this part is 12*(k*(4e²)/(2)).

Wait, let me compute that: 12 * (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2) = 12 * (k * 4e²) / 2 = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, let me recalculate. Each pair is (2e) and (2e), so the product is (2e)*(2e)=4e². Divided by 2 meters, and multiplied by k. So each such pair contributes (k *4e²)/(2) = 2 k e². Since there are 12 pairs, it's 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now the second part: the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Since each of the 12 is at a distance of 2 meters from P, but how are they arranged? Are they all on the same sphere, but the distance between any two of them is more than 2 meters? Wait, no. If they're arranged on a sphere, the minimal distance between two charges on the sphere would be when they're diametrically opposite, but the sphere's radius is 2 m, so the minimal distance is 4 m. Wait, no, wait. If the radius is r, the distance between two points on the sphere is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. But in the case where all 12 are equally spaced, maybe arranged as the vertices of a regular polyhedron. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes they are all at a mutual distance of 2 meters? That can't be right because you can't have 12 points all equidistant on a sphere, unless it's a very high-dimensional shape, which is not the case here.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. That makes me think their positions are fixed on a sphere of radius 2 m, but the distances between them are not given. So perhaps we need to model their mutual distances as 2 m as well? No, that's not possible because the distance between two points on a sphere can't be the same as the radius unless they are the same point, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same distance from each other as from P. Wait, but that would require them all to be at the same point, which is impossible. I'm confused here.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The problem states that each of the 12 is at 2 m from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So each of the 12 is 2 m away from the 13th. But the distance between any two of the 12 depends on their arrangement. Since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the arrangement that gives the minimum potential energy is when the 12 charges are placed as close as possible to each other. Wait, but that would lower the potential energy because bringing like charges closer would increase the potential energy (since they repel). Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the potential energy between two positive charges is positive because they repel each other. So arranging them as close as possible would make the potential energy higher, not lower. But the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps I'm supposed to consider the configuration where the 12 charges are arranged in a way that minimizes the total potential energy. But I'm not sure what that configuration is. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are considered to be very large, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the interactions between the 12 and the 13th charge, and not the interactions among the 12 themselves. But that doesn't make sense, because the potential energy would include all pairs.

Wait, but in the case of 12 charges each at 2 m from P, perhaps they are arranged in such a way that each is equidistant from every other, which would require them to be at the vertices of a regular polyhedron, but that's only possible for certain numbers of points. 12 points on a sphere in a regular arrangement... I don't think that's possible. So maybe the problem is oversimplifying and considering that the 12 charges are all at 2 m from each other as well. That can't be right because the radius is 2 m, so the distance between them would have to be 4 m, which isn't possible unless they are diametrically opposite points, but then you can't have 12 of them.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think again. The problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed on a sphere of radius 2 m. The 13th is at P. So the distance from the 13th to any of the 12 is 2 m.

But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? We don't know, but perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum total potential energy of the entire system, which would be the sum of all the pairwise potentials.

In that case, the potential energy contributions would be:

1. Between the 13th charge and each of the 12. Each contributes (k*q1*q2)/r = (k*(2e)^2)/2.

2. Between each pair of the 12 charges. Each such pair is separated by some distance d, which we don't know. But since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps we arrange the 12 charges as close as possible to minimize the potential energy. Wait, but since they're all positive charges, bringing them closer would increase the potential energy because potential energy for like charges is positive and increases as they get closer. So to minimize the total energy, perhaps we need to arrange them as far apart as possible, but in this case, they are constrained to be 2 m from P. So their mutual distances can vary, but how?

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to reapproach. The problem asks for the minimum energy, so perhaps the arrangement that gives the minimum potential energy is when the 12 charges are placed in such a way that all their mutual distances are as large as possible. But since they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m, the maximum possible distance between any two would be 4 m (diametrically opposite). But arranging all 12 to be as far apart as possible is a complicated problem. I don't think the problem expects me to calculate that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is ignoring the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves, considering only their interactions with the 13th charge. Because otherwise, without knowing their exact arrangement, the problem can't be solved. So perhaps the setup is that the 12 charges are located at the same point, which would imply their mutual distance is zero. But that can't be right because the charges are identical and positive, so they would repel each other, but in this scenario, they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters from each other. But that's impossible because if they're all on a sphere of radius 2 m, the minimum distance between any two would be larger than 2 m. Wait, wait. Wait, let's think about two points on a sphere of radius r. The minimum distance between them is zero (if they coincide), but that's not possible for distinct points. The maximum distance is 2r (diametrically opposite). But if all 12 are equally spaced, perhaps on a regular polyhedron, their mutual distances would vary but not be the same.

But this seems too complicated for a problem that probably expects a simpler approach. Maybe the problem is only considering the interactions between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, but not the interactions between the 12 themselves. So perhaps the total potential energy is just the sum of the interactions between each of the 12 and the 13th charge.

But wait, that would be neglecting the interactions between the 12, which I don't think is correct because the total potential energy of the system includes all pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, which is 2 m from P. But that can't be because if they are at the same point, their mutual distance is zero, making their potential energy undefined (infinite), which doesn't make sense. So I think that approach is invalid.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 charges are at the same point, making their mutual distance zero. But that's impossible, so I must be missing something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a spherical shell around P, each at a radius of 2 m, and the mutual distances are such that the potential energy due to their arrangement is zero or minimal. But without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute their mutual distances.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe the problem is designed so that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2 meters from each other. But that would require the radius of the sphere to be such that the points are all 2 meters apart. The radius r of a regular polyhedron with n points and edge length a is given by r = a/(√(n)) for a regular simplex, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a regular tetrahedron (4 points), the radius would be a * sqrt(3/8), but this is getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the interactions among the 12. If that's the case, then the total energy would be the sum of the 12 individual interactions.

So, each of the 12 contributes (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2 m.

So that's 12 * (k *4e²)/(2) = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But that's only the energy due to the 13th and the 12. What about the energy between the 12 charges themselves?

If the problem is considering that, then I have to find the sum of all the interactions between the 12 charges. But without knowing their mutual distances, I can't compute that. So maybe the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are infinitely far away from each other, making their potential energy zero. But that's not realistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the interactions between the 13th and the 12, and the 12 are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. But that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges. The problem says it's an isolated system, so all the charges contribute to the potential energy. But without knowing their mutual distances, I can't compute it. Maybe the problem is designed in a way that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would make their mutual distance zero, leading to infinite potential energy, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the problem is a trick question and the answer only considers the interactions between the 13th and the 12, and not the 12's mutual interactions. Let me proceed under that assumption for now.

So each of the 12 interactions contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2). Since k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C², and e is 1.602 x 10^-19 C.

So let's compute this.

Each term: (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.602e-19)^2) / 2.

Wait, let me compute the numerator first.

(2e)^2 = 4 e². So each term is (k * 4 e²) / 2.

So, (8.988e9) * (4 * (1.602e-19)^2) / 2.

Wait, let's compute (1.602e-19)^2 first.

1.602e-19 squared is approximately (1.602)^2 = 2.566, so 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 4: 4 * 2.566e-38 = 10.264e-38.

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 10.264e-38 = let's compute that.

8.988e9 is 8.988 x 10^9.

10.264e-38 is 1.0264 x 10^-37.

Multiply: 8.988 * 1.0264 ≈ 9.23.

10^9 * 10^-37 = 10^-28.

So 9.23e-28. Then divide by 2: 9.23e-28 / 2 ≈ 4.615e-28.

Each interaction contributes about 4.615e-28 J.

But wait, 12 such interactions: 12 * 4.615e-28 ≈ 5.538e-27 J.

Wait, but the options are in the order of 1e-26 to 1e-27. Let me see the options:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26

B) 2.822 x 10^-26

C) 7.056 x 10^-27

D) 122.330.

So 5.538e-27 is about 5.538 x 10^-27, which is close to option C (7.056e-27) but not exactly. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recompute the numbers more accurately.

Compute (2e)^2 = 4e².

Each term: (k *4e²) / (2 * r), where r is 2 m.

So (k *4e²) / (2*2) = (k *4e²)/4 = k e².

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, the formula is (k q1 q2)/r.

So q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, so product is 4e².

r is 2 m.

So each term is (k *4e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Wait, I see. So each of the 12 interactions contributes 2 k e².

So total for the 12 is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now compute this:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So:

24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2: (1.602)^2 = 2.566, so 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23 (approx 23). But more accurately:

8.988 * 2.566:

8 *2.566 =20.528

0.988 *2.566 ≈ approx 2.531

So total ≈23.059.

So 23.059e(9 -38) = 23.059e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 *23.059e-29 = 553.416e-29 = 5.53416e-27 J.

So approximately 5.534e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is larger.

Option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger.

Wait, but wait. Did I forget to include the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Because in reality, each pair among the 12 will also contribute to the potential energy.

So earlier assumption that only the 13th and 12 interactions are considered was incorrect. I must include all pairs.

So let's compute that.

Number of pairs between the 12 charges: C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/d, where d is the distance between two of the 12 charges.

But wait, I don't know what d is, because the 12 are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 m. So the distance between any two charges depends on their positions. Without knowing their arrangement, I can't compute d.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would mean d=0, leading to infinite potential energy, which can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges cancel out. But that's unlikely because all charges are positive, so their mutual potential energy contributions are positive.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the 12 and the 13th charge. But that leaves out the 66 interactions among the 12, which would contribute a significant amount.

Wait, but if the 12 are arranged at the vertices of a regular icosahedron (which has 12 vertices), perhaps the average distance between them can be calculated. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2 meters from every other charge. But that's impossible because the maximum distance on a sphere of radius 2 m is 4 m (diametrically opposite). So you can't have 12 points all 2 m apart on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged as a regular icosahedron on the sphere. The edge length of a regular icosahedron inscribed in a sphere of radius r is given by a = r * sqrt( (10 + 2 sqrt(5) ) / 5 ) / something. Or perhaps more accurately, the formula for the edge length a of a regular icosahedron with radius r is a = 2r * sin(π/5) ≈ 2r * 0.5878 ≈ 1.1756 r. So for r=2 m, a ≈ 2.351 m.

Wait, but that's just the edge length, the distance between adjacent vertices. So if the 12 charges are arranged as an icosahedron, the distance between each pair of adjacent ones is about 2.351 m. But not all pairs are adjacent; some are further apart. So the potential energy would depend on all the pairwise distances.

This seems too complicated. Maybe the problem is expecting me to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, making the total energy just the 24 k e² term we calculated earlier, which was approximately 5.53e-27 J.

Looking at the options, C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times our calculated value. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recompute the 24 k e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So:

24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38.

Now, 24 * 8.988e9 = 24 *8.988 = 215.712; so 215.712e9.

Multiply by 2.566e-38.

215.712e9 * 2.566e-38 = 215.712 *2.566 * 1e(9-38) = (approx 553.7) * 1e-29 = 5.537e-27 J.

So about 5.537e-27 J.

But the options given don't have this. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is larger. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the 12 charges are at 2 m from P, but the 13th is at P, so each 12 charges interact with the 13th. But when calculating all pairwise interactions, perhaps I need to include the 13th charge's interactions with all 12, and the 12's interactions among themselves.

So, the total potential energy is:

U_total = U_13_with_12 + U_12_among_themselves.

We've computed U_13_with_12 as 24 k e² = 5.537e-27 J.

Now, U_12_among_themselves is the sum of all pairs between the 12 charges. Each pair contributes (k * (2e)^2)/d, where d is the distance between them.

But without knowing d, we can't compute this. So perhaps the problem is expecting us to ignore this part and only consider U_13_with_12.

But then the answer is 5.537e-27 J, which isn't one of the options. The options are A:5.645e-26, B:2.822e-26, C:7.056e-27, D:122.330.

Hmm, 5.537e-27 is about 5.54e-27. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, but it's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let me compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

First, (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Now, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 * 2.566 = about 23.06e-29.

Wait, 8.988e9 is 8.988 x 10^9.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 8.988 * 2.566 = 23.06, and 10^9 * 10^-38 = 10^-29.

So 23.06e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 *23.06e-29 = 553.44e-29 = 5.5344e-27 J.

So that's correct.

But none of the options match this value. So perhaps the problem is considering only the interactions between the 12 and the 13th, and not the 12's mutual interactions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed differently.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 13 charges are arranged in a different way.

Wait, another possibility: since the 13th is at P, and the others are at 2 m from P, perhaps the 13th is one charge and the other 12 are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 4 m. Because if you have a sphere of radius 2 m, the diameter is 4 m. So perhaps each of the 12 charges is arranged on the sphere, and each is diametrically opposite another. But that would only allow 6 pairs, so 6 charges, but we have 12, so perhaps each charge is at a position such that their mutual distances are 4 m. But that can't be right because you can't have 12 points all separated by 4 m on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged on a circle (equator) of the sphere, each separated by a certain angle, leading to a certain chord length.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute the mutual distances. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. If that's the case, then the total energy is about 5.537e-27 J, which is closest to option C (7.056e-27), but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Coulomb's constant. Let me check the exact value of Coulomb's constant. Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C². Let me use more precise numbers.

Compute 24 * k * (2e)^2 / (2).

Wait, wait no, earlier calculation: each pair contributes (k * (2e)^2)/2.

So 24 * (k * (2e)^2) / 2 = 24 * (k *4e²)/2 = 24 * 2 k e² = 48 k e².

Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me recalculate.

Wait, no. Each of the 12 charges is 2 m from P. So each of the 12 pairs between the 13th and a charge is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2.

So that's  (k *4e²)/2 = 2 k e².

Multiply by 12: 12 *2 k e² = 24 k e².

Yes, that's correct.

So 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Compute e^2: (1.602176634e-19)^2 = (1.602176634)^2 * (1e-19)^2 = 2.566969851e-38 C².

So 24 *8.9875517879e9 * 2.566969851e-38.

Compute 24 *8.9875517879 = 215.7012429.

215.7012429 *2.566969851e-29 (since 8.98755e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.297e-28, but wait, no:

Wait, 8.98755e9 * 2.566969851e-38 = 8.98755e9 * 2.566969851e-38 = 8.98755 * 2.566969851e(9-38) = 22.970e-29.

Wait, 8.98755 *2.566969851 = let's compute:

8 *2.56697 = 20.53576

0.98755 *2.56697 ≈ approx 2.533.

Total ≈ 23.068.

So 23.068e-29.

Multiply by 24: 24 *23.068e-29 = 553.63e-29 = 5.5363e-27 J.

So approximately 5.536e-27 J.

The options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that all 13 charges are identical, so the 13th charge is also 2e. Then, each of the 12 charges at 2 m from P (the 13th charge) is 2e, and the 13th is 2e.

Wait, but the problem says 13 identical particles each with charge 2e. So that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the 12 charges as being at a distance of 2 m from each other, not from P. But that can't be because they're constrained to be 2 m from P, which is the position of the 13th charge.

Wait, maybe the problem is a typo and meant that 12 charges are at 2 m from each other, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. Wait, for the 12 charges, the number of pairs is 12*11/2 = 66 pairs. So if each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/d, where d is the mutual distance, but without knowing d, perhaps the problem is assuming that d is 2 m as well. That would mean each of the 12 charges is 2 m away from every other charge, which is impossible, but perhaps the problem is making that assumption.

So if d is 2 m, then each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2 = 2 k e².

So 66 pairs contribute 66 *2 k e² = 132 k e².

Wait, but then the total energy would be the sum of the interactions with the 13th charge (24 k e²) and the mutual interactions (132 k e²), giving a total of 156 k e².

Compute 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, that's a lot larger than the options given. Let me compute:

156 *8.988e9 = 156 *8.988 ≈ 1400. So 1400e9.

(1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply: 1400e9 * 2.566e-38 = 1400 *2.566 = 3592.4e-29 = 3.5924e-26 J.

Hmm, option A is 5.645e-26, which is larger. So if the problem is considering mutual interactions with d=2 m, the total would be about 3.59e-26 J, which is close to option A but not exactly.

But the options don't have 3.59e-26. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that the 12 charges are arranged in a regular dodecahedron or some other shape where each charge is equidistant from each other, but that's not possible on a sphere of radius 2 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 2 m, but that's impossible, so the problem must be expecting another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point, making their mutual distance zero, but that leads to infinite potential energy, which isn't possible.

I'm stuck. Let me think differently. The problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. To minimize the potential energy, the charges should be arranged as far apart as possible. But since the 12 are constrained to be 2 m from P, their arrangement on the sphere must be such that they're as far apart from each other as possible. The most spread-out arrangement on a sphere is the one where the points are equally spaced, like the vertices of a regular polyhedron.

But without knowing the exact distances, perhaps the problem is expecting that the mutual potential energy is zero, which would only happen if all the mutual charges are at infinite distance. But that's not possible here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is zero because they're arranged in a way that their contributions cancel out. But that's only possible if they form a symmetric configuration leading to zero net potential energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual interactions, leading to the earlier result of 5.537e-27 J. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each pair between the 12 charges interacts, but the problem is only considering the interactions between each of the 12 and the 13th, not the mutual interactions. So the answer would be 5.537e-27 J, which is approximately 5.54e-27, but the closest option is C)7.056e-27.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me recalculate with 9e9.

So 24 *9e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

(1.602e-19)^2 =2.566e-38.

9e9 *2.566e-38 = 23.094e-29.

24 *23.094e-29 =554.256e-29 =5.54256e-27 J.

Still around 5.54e-27, which isn't matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges also interacts with the 13th charge, but not that the 13th charge's own potential energy is counted multiple times. Wait, no, each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th once, so 12 interactions.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 7.056e-27. Let's see what value of the product would lead to that.

So 7.056e-27 = 24 * k * (2e)^2 / (2).

Wait, no, that's not right. It's 24 *k*(2e)^2 / (2) =24 *k*4e²/(2)=24 *2 k e²=48 k e².

Wait, no, earlier calculation was 24 k e².

Wait, perhaps the charges are e instead of 2e. No, the problem says each charge is 2e.

Wait, perhaps the distance is 2 meters between the 12 charges and the 13th, but the mutual distance between the 12 is 4 meters, which is 2*2 m. So each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(4) = (k *4e²)/(4) =k e².

So the mutual energy would be 66 *k e².

Adding the 24 k e², total is 90 k e².

Compute 90 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 90 *8.988e9 = 808.92e9.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

808.92e9 *2.566e-38 = (808.92 *2.566) *1e(9-38) = 2076.4 *1e-29 =2.0764e-26 J.

Which is close to option A (5.645e-26) and option B (2.822e-26), but not exactly matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mutual distance assumption. If mutual distances are 2 m, then each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2 = 2k e². 66 pairs would contribute 132 k e².

Adding the 24 k e², total is 156 k e².

156 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = ?

156 *8.988e9 =156 *8.988 =1400. So 1400e9.

1400e9 *2.566e-38 =1400 *2.566e-29 =3592.4e-29 =3.5924e-26 J.

Which is about 3.59e-26 J, which is close to option A (5.645e-26) but not exact.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distance is 3 m, but that's just a guess. Let me compute: if the mutual distance is 3 m, then each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/3 = (k *4e²)/3.

So 66 pairs would contribute 66*(4 k e²)/3 = 66*(4/3) k e² = 88 k e².

Adding the 24 k e², total is 112 k e².

112 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = ?

112 *8.988e9 = 1e3 *8.988e9 *1.12 → wait, 112 *8.988e9 = 1.006e12.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 1.006e12 * 2.566e-38 = 2.587e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to only consider the interactions between the 12 and the 13th charge, leading to 5.537e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy cancels out the energy from the 13th charge. But that would require a specific arrangement which isn't provided in the problem, so I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate using more precise values for e and k.

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

Compute 24 *k * (2e)^2 / (2).

So 24 *8.9875517879e9 * (2*1.602176634e-19)^2 /2.

Compute (2e)^2 =4e²=4*(1.602176634e-19)^2=4*(2.566969852e-38)=1.026787941e-37.

Then, 24 *8.9875517879e9 * 1.026787941e-37 /2.

Compute 24/2=12.

12 *8.9875517879e9 =107.850621455e9.

Multiply by 1.026787941e-37: 107.850621455e9 *1.026787941e-37 = 107.850621455 *1.026787941e(9-37)=110.72e-28 =1.1072e-26 J.

Wait, that's about 1.1072e-26 J. None of the options match this either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the division. Let me recheck.

Wait, the expression is 24 *k * (2e)^2 / (2).

Which simplifies to 24 *k *4e² / 2 = 24 *2 k e² =48 k e².

Wait, wait, no: (2e)^2 is 4e². So:

24 *k *4e² /2 =24*2 k e²=48 k e².

Ah, here's where I might have made a mistake. Earlier, I thought each term is (k*(2e)^2)/2 =2 k e². So 12 charges * 2 k e² each gives 24 k e². But if each of the 12 charges contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2, which is 2 k e², then 12 charges contribute 24 k e².

Wait, but according to the correct calculation, 24 * k *4e² /2 = 24 *2 k e² =48 k e².

Wait, this changes everything. So my earlier calculation was wrong. I thought each term was 2 k e², leading to 24 k e², but it's actually 48 k e².

So let's recompute with this correction.

So U_13_with_12 = 48 *k *e².

k=8.9875517879e9.

e²= (1.602176634e-19)^2=2.566969852e-38.

48 *8.9875517879e9 *2.566969852e-38.

Compute 48 *8.9875517879e9 =4.314e11.

Multiply by 2.566969852e-38: 4.314e11 *2.56697e-38 =4.314 *2.56697 =approx 11.079e-27=1.1079e-26 J.

Wait, that's approximately 1.108e-26 J.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.645e-26, which is about 5 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges as well, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but according to the corrected calculation, U_13_with_12 is 48 k e² = 48 *8.98755e9 * (1.602176634e-19)^2.

Compute this precisely:

48 *8.98755e9 =4.314e11.

(1.602176634e-19)^2 =2.566969852e-38.

Multiply: 4.314e11 *2.566969852e-38 =4.314 *2.566969852e-27 =11.079e-27=1.1079e-26 J.

So approximately 1.108e-26 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is to include both the 13th charge's interactions and the 12's mutual interactions.

Assuming mutual distance d=2 m:

Each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2 =2 k e².

66 pairs contribute 66 *2 k e²=132 k e².

Total U = U_13_with_12 + U_12_mutual =48 k e² +132 k e²=180 k e².

Compute 180 *8.98755e9 *2.566969852e-38.

180 *8.98755e9=1.61776e12.

Multiply by 2.566969852e-38: 1.61776e12 *2.566969852e-38 =4.157e-26 J.

Which is approximately 4.157e-26 J. Still doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distance is 4 m. Then each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/4 =k e².

66 pairs contribute 66 k e².

Total U =48 k e² +66 k e²=114 k e².

Compute 114 *8.98755e9 *2.566969852e-38.

114 *8.98755e9=1.027e12.

Multiply by 2.56697e-38: 1.027e12 *2.56697e-38=2.645e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

I'm really stuck. Let's look at the options again. The options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330.

Wait, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 2.822e-26 J.

If I compute 24 k e², which is without considering mutual interactions, I get 5.537e-27 J. But option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times that.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the potential energy with the 13th charge and each of the 12, but each pair is counted once, leading to 24 k e², but perhaps in the problem, the charges are arranged in a way that each mutual pair is at 2 m, leading to mutual energy of 66*(k*(2e)^2)/2 =66 *2 k e²=132 k e².

So total energy would be 24 k e² +132 k e² =156 k e².

Which is 156 *8.98755e9 *2.566969852e-38.

156 *8.98755e9=1.400e12.

1.400e12 *2.56697e-38=3.594e-26 J.

Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each charge interacts only with the 13th, and the mutual interactions are zero due to symmetry, but that doesn't make sense because all charges are positive.

I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure how to arrive at it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 are arranged such that their mutual distances are all 2 meters. But that's impossible on a sphere of radius 2 m. So perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 are arranged at the same point as each other, but that would make their mutual distance zero, which isn't feasible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the 13th charge and one of the 12 charges, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, but each pair is counted once, leading to 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2) =12 *2 k e²=24 k e².

As earlier, 24 *8.98755e9 *2.566969852e-38=5.536e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest is option C)7.056e-27.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me compute 24 *8.98755e9 * (1.602176634e-19)^2 *4 / (2).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P, but each of the 12 has a charge of 2e, and the 13th has a charge of 2e as well. So the interactions are between 2e and 2e.

So each pair between 13th and the 12 contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2.

Which is 2 k e² per pair. 12 pairs: 24 k e².

As before, which is 5.537e-27 J.

Hmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I can't see how to get there with the given information.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for e, such as 1.6e-19 instead of 1.602e-19. Let me try that.

e=1.6e-19.

Then, (2e)^2=4*(2.56e-38)=1.024e-37.

24 *8.988e9 *1.024e-37 =24 *8.988e9=215.712e9.

215.712e9 *1.024e-37=215.712 *1.024e-28=220.8e-28=2.208e-26 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point as the 13th charge, but that would make all the mutual distances zero, leading to infinite energy, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy of the 13th charge only, which would be the sum of the potentials from the 12 charges, but that's not the case because potential energy is a system property, not just due to a single charge.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Based on the calculations, the only possible answer I can get close to is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I can't see how to reach it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only the interactions between the 13th and the 12, leading to 5.537e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to only consider the 13th charge's potential due to the 12, but that's not the case.

In the absence of further information, I'll have to choose the closest option based on the calculation, which was approximately 5.537e-27 J. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)7.056e-27 J, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to have the 12 charges arranged such that each is at a distance of 2 meters from P and 4 meters from each other. So each mutual pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/4 =k e².

So mutual energy is 66 *k e².

Plus the 24 k e² from the 13th charge, total 90 k e².

90 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38= 90 *8.988e9=808.92e9.

808.92e9 *2.566e-38=2.076e-26 J.

Which is close to option A)5.645e-26 but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps, leading me to choose option C)7.056e-27 J.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we analyze the electrostatic potential energy contributions. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to remain at a distance of \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of two contributions:

1. **Interactions between the 13th charge and the 12 charges**:  
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the 13th charge, fixed at \( P \). The potential energy for each pair is given by:  
   \[
   U_{13, i} = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = \frac{k \cdot 4e^2}{2} = 2k e^2
   \]  
   Since there are 12 such pairs, the total energy for this part is:  
   \[
   U_{13, \text{total}} = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2
   \]

2. **Interactions among the 12 charges**:  
   The problem does not specify the exact arrangement of the 12 charges on the sphere of radius \( 2 \, \text{m} \). Without explicit information about their mutual distances, it is challenging to compute the exact potential energy contribution from their interactions. However, if we assume the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are \( 2 \, \text{m} \), the potential energy for each pair is:  
   \[
   U_{i,j} = \frac{k \cdot (2e) \cdot (2e)}{2} = 2k e^2
   \]  
   There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) pairs, so the total energy for this part is:  
   \[
   U_{12, \text{total}} = 66 \cdot 2k e^2 = 132k e^2
   \]

Combining both contributions, the total potential energy is:  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = U_{13, \text{total}} + U_{12, \text{total}} = 24k e^2 + 132k e^2 = 156k e^2
\]

Substituting the values \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 156 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38}
\]  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 156 \cdot 23.06 \times 10^{-29} = 3592.56 \times 10^{-29} = 3.59256 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, if we consider only the interactions between the 13th charge and the 12 charges (ignoring the mutual interactions among the 12 charges), the total energy is:  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24k e^2 = 24 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38}
\]  
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot 23.06 \times 10^{-29} = 553.44 \times 10^{-29} = 5.5344 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]

This value is closest to option \( \text{C} \) (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)), though it is still not an exact match. Given the ambiguity in the problem regarding the mutual interactions among the 12 charges, the most reasonable choice based on the calculations is:

ANSWER: C
