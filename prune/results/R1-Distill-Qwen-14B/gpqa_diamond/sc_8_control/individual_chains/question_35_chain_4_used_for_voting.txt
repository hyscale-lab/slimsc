Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, let me write that down.

So S looks like this:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So A_y would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. Let me calculate A_y.

A_y = (h/(4π)) * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So the matrix A_y is:
[ 0   (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Wait, but quantum mechanics angular momentum operators are usually in terms of ħ. Oh wait, because c is h/(4π), but ħ is h/(2π), right? So h/(4π) is ħ/2. So c = ħ/2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) * S.

Wait, but S here is already a matrix. Let me think about the structure of the spin matrices. For spin-1/2 particles, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The spin operator components are usually (ħ/2) σ_x, etc.

Wait, looking at the given S matrix: the first row is 0, -i, and the second is i, 0. Hmm, that looks familiar. Let me compare to the Pauli matrices.

The Pauli Y matrix is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Which is exactly the S matrix given here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σ_y. So A_y is (ħ/2) σ_y.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator is A_y = c·S, with c = h/(4π). Then S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y. But since h/(2π) is ħ, h/(4π) is ħ/2.

So A_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Alternatively, since σ_y is a Pauli matrix, I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then scale by (ħ/2).

The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σ_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues of A_y would be (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

Wait, but the options don't have ħ. Let me think about the constants. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between h and ħ. Oh, because c is h/(4π), which is ħ/2 (since ħ = h/(2π)), so c = (h/(2π)) / 2 = ħ/2.

So A_y is (ħ/2) σ_y.

So eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2)*(1) = ±ħ/2.

So looking at the options, let's check each.

Option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't make sense because eigenvalues of spin operators are real numbers, right? Angular momentum components are Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues should be real, so the options that talk about imaginary parts being non-zero must be incorrect.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, but the eigenvalues are real, so any option talking about imaginary parts would be wrong. So A and B are out because they suggest complex eigenvalues.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Let me think. The square of the angular momentum operator would be A², which for spin-1/2 is s(s+1)ħ², where s=1/2. So A² is ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) ħ² I , which is (3/4) ħ² I. So any eigenfunction of A_y is automatically an eigenfunction of A². So C says that the eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is true. But what about Az? Well, the eigenfunctions of A_y and Az are different, because they're different components. So an eigenfunction of A_y can't be an eigenfunction of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenfunction, which is only possible if the system has maximum symmetry, but in general spin states can't be eigenfunctions of two different components. So C seems correct. But let me think again.

Alternatively, the eigenfunctions of A_y are the eigenvectors of A_y, which are the spin-up and spin-down states in the y-direction. Since the spin states are eigenvectors of A_y, and spin operators commute with A^2, because A^2 is the magnitude squared operator which commutes with all components. So A² and A_y can have simultaneous eigenvectors. So eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of option C is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Right, because the eigenfunctions of A_y and Az are different. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. The matrix operator Ay has eigenvectors which form a basis, which is correct. But the way it's phrased, "the basis functions of the matrix operator," it's a bit unclear. Alternatively, any square matrix can be diagonalized, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D might be correct as well, but let's think.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps we need to look at all the options again.

Wait, let me go back to the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of A_y are ±(ħ/2). So the real parts would be ± ħ/2, and no imaginary parts, so options A and B are wrong because they have imaginary parts.

So looking back, the eigenvalues are real, so C and D are the remaining options.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. I think that statement is correct because any square matrix can be diagonalized, so the eigenvectors form a basis. But are the eigenfunctions the same as the basis functions of the matrix? Hmm, perhaps the wording is a bit off. Alternatively, the matrix is 2x2, which is a linear operator on a 2-dimensional space, so the eigenvectors naturally form a basis. So D could be correct.

But the confusion is between the statements in C and D. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, which of these is correct?

Wait, the problem says during the calculation, which statement is correct. So during the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which of these statements is correct.

Wait, let's think about each statement.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

As I thought, since A^2 commutes with Ay, any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A^2. So the first part is correct. The second part, not being eigenfunctions of Az, is correct because the three components of angular momentum don't share eigenvectors except in certain cases (like when you have maximum symmetry, but generally, you can't have a state that's an eigenstate of two different components, like Ay and Az, unless you're in a specific basis). So C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm, I'm not sure. The 'basis functions' part is a bit unclear. The matrix Ay is a linear operator on a 2-dimensional space, and its eigenvectors form a basis. So the eigenfunctions φ are the basis vectors for the operator Ay. So D's statement is correct. But I'm a bit confused because the statement is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but let me think about the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which are real numbers, so options A and B are incorrect because they mention imaginary parts.

So that leaves C and D.

Another point: the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as eigenfunctions of A^2, so C's first part is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. So that's correct because the eigenfunctions of different components are orthogonal in the Hilbert space, so they can't be the same.

So for the options, option C is correct.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but let me think about option D again. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay would form a basis for the vector space. So yes, if the matrix is diagonalizable (which it is, because it's a Pauli matrix, which is Hermitian, so it's diagonalizable), then the eigenvectors are a basis. So D's statement is correct. But that would make both C and D correct. But the options are supposed to have only one correct answer.

Wait, but let me check if the matrix is diagonalizable. Since Ay is Hermitian (because it's a spin component operator), it is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. So the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So D's statement is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but let's look back at the options.

Wait, looking back, the options may not both be correct. Let me re-examine each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the statement in D is a bit ambiguous. Or perhaps D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So when you calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you could find that the eigenfunctions form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's think about each option again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, the matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so the statement is correct.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the basis functions are usually the basis vectors of the Hilbert space. So the eigenvectors of Ay would form a basis for the 2D space, so D's statement is correct.

Hmm, but earlier I thought option C is correct.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. The calculation involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

So, for each option:

A) Eigenvalues have imaginary parts. But eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

B) Same issue as A, so wrong.

C) The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². Correct. And not eigenfunctions of Az? Correct, because a state can't be an eigenstate of two different components (unless, perhaps, in a simultaneous eigenstate, but that's not the case here). So C is correct.

D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Correct because eigenvectors form a basis.

So now, the problem is that both C and D seem correct, but the options are given as single-choice. Let me read the options again.

Wait, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, both statements are correct, but perhaps only one is correct according to the options.

Wait, but let me make sure: Can the eigenfunctions of Ay be eigenfunctions of A² and Az? 

Well, A² and Ay commute, so they can share eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So the first part of C is correct.

As for being eigenfunctions of Az: Well, no, because Ay and Az don't commute. So their eigenfunctions are different. So the second part of C is correct.

So C is a correct statement.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, and its eigenvectors are a basis, this is correct. So D is correct.

But this seems conflicting because the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about the eigenvalues.

Wait, I thought the eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2), but let me compute them.

The matrix Ay is (ħ/2) σ_y.

The eigenvalues of σ_y are +1 and -1. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues are ±(ħ/2).

So they are real numbers, so the eigenvalues have zero imaginary part.

So options A and B are incorrect because they mention imaginary parts.

So now, looking back, the correct statements must be C or D.

But according to the problem, which statement would be correct during the calculation.

So, the first part: Which statements are correct about the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Hmm, perhaps both are correct. But the options likely have only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of an operator form a basis for the space if the operator is diagonalizable, which it is.

So, perhaps D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option is saying.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Which is correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But it's not an eigenstate of Az because Az and Ay don't commute.

So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, looking at the given options:

Option C is talking about A² and Az, which are related to the same system. So perhaps the statement is correct.

Option D is a general statement about the eigenvectors forming a basis, which is always true for a matrix, but the way it's phrased might not be the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option says.

Another approach: Let's compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The matrix A_y is (ħ/2) * S, where S is [[0,-i],[i,0]].

The eigenvalues come from solving det(Ay - a I) =0.

So the matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -(a)   (-i ħ/2) ]
[ (i ħ/2)  -a ]

The determinant is (a)^2 - ( (i ħ/2)(-i ħ/2) )

Compute that: (i)(-i) = -i² = 1. So (ħ²/4) * 1.

So determinant equation: a² - (ħ²/4) =0 → a² = ħ²/4 → a= ± ħ/2.

So eigenvalues are real, ± ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalues are real numbers, so any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect. So A and B are out.

So, only C and D are possible.

Now, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For a= ħ/2:

The matrix Ay - (ħ/2) I is:

[ -(ħ/2)   (-i ħ/2) ]
[ (i ħ/2)  -(ħ/2) ]

To find the eigenvector, we set up the equation (Ay - a I) v =0.

Equation 1: -(ħ/2) v1 - (i ħ/2) v2 =0 → -(v1) -i v2 =0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as v = [ -i v2, v2 ]^T = v2 [ -i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenvector is proportional to ( -i, 1 ).

Similarly, for a= -ħ/2:

Matrix becomes:

[ (ħ/2)   (-i ħ/2) ]
[ (i ħ/2)  (ħ/2) ]

Equation 1: (ħ/2) v1 - (i ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 -i v2 =0 → v1 = i v2.

Eigenvector is (i, 1) T.

So the eigenfunctions are ( -i, 1 ) and (i, 1 ), up to normalization.

Now, these are the eigenvectors for A_y.

Now, the eigenfunctions of A_y are the same as the eigenfunctions of A², because A² and A_y commute. So any eigenvector of A_y is also an eigenvector of A².

Hence, option C's statement is correct.

As for option D, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

Wait, but the question gives four options, and only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct.

Wait, the problem statement says that the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix is a 2x2, and the eigenvectors are a basis for R^2. So D is correct.

But perhaps during the calculation, we find that the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to see which options are correct.

So, if the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, and the eigenvectors are ( -i, 1 ) and (i, 1 ), then:

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², which they can, and not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D are correct. But the question has only one correct option, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenfunctions. Let me think again.

Wait, the eigenvectors are ( -i, 1 ) and (i, 1 ). Are these the same as the eigenfunctions of A²?

Yes, because A² is diagonal in the same basis. So any state written in terms of these eigenfunctions is also an eigenstate of A².

So, the eigenfunctions of A_y are the same as those of A². So option C's first part is correct.

The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Correct, because Az has eigenfunctions (1,0) and (0,1), which are different from the A_y eigenfunctions.

So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. But perhaps the way it's phrased is incorrect.

Wait, the statement in D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the matrix operator is represented as a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

But given the options, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the question expects one answer.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So when I calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors, I might find that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator's matrix. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the correct answer because the question is more about the properties of the eigenfunctions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to eliminate options.

Options A and B are wrong because the eigenvalues are real, so the statements about imaginary parts are incorrect.

Now, between C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Which statement is more correct during the calculation?

Perhaps D is a more general statement, but C is a specific property about the eigenfunctions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, let me think again: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions because the matrix is diagonal in that basis. So D is correct.

But the question is about the calculation process. So, during the calculation, when you diagonalize Ay, you find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which form a basis. So D is correct.

But, given the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Hmm, I'm not entirely certain, but based on the reasoning, I think option C is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the given operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, \( A_y \) can be written as:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since \( \frac{h}{4\pi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we have:

\[
A_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
The eigenvalues of the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix are \( \pm 1 \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are:

\[
a = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

These eigenvalues are real, so any option suggesting imaginary parts for the eigenvalues is incorrect.

### Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) can be computed by solving \( (A_y - aI)v = 0 \) for each eigenvalue \( a = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenvectors are proportional to:

\[
v_+ = \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad v_- = \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

These eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space.

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A**: Claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \)).

2. **Option B**: Claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \)).

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional space.

### Conclusion
Both options C and D are correct. However, the question requires selecting only one correct statement. Since option C specifically addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), it is the most relevant choice.

**Answer: C**
