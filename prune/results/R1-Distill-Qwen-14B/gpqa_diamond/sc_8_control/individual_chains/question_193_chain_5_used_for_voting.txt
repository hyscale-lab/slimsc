Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Hmm. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I recall is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So, plx is in arcseconds, and d is in parsecs, so d = 1/plx.

Wait, but wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, I need to relate N to r (distance). Let's think about the relation between N and plx first.

Given: N ∝ 1/plx^5 → N = k * (1/plx^5) → N = k * plx^(-5), where k is a constant.

But we want to find N as a function of r. Since plx = 1/r, substituting that into the equation.

So, plx = 1/r → plx^5 = (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5.

So, N = k * (1/(1/r^5)) ) → N = k * r^5. So, N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait. The question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?". Oh, does that mean the change is dN/dr, the derivative? Hmm, that's a crucial point. Wait, the question says "how does the number ... change with distance (per unit range)".

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-express the relations.

Let me think in terms of number per unit volume or something. Oh wait, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume depends on how many stars are in a certain volume. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a shell at distance r with thickness dr, i.e., the number per unit distance (per unit r) would be the surface area times the number density.

Wait, but let's try another approach. Let's say that the number of stars in a region is N, and that N varies as 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ (1/plx)^5. But since plx is inversely proportional to r, 1/plx is r.

So, N ∝ r^5. So, when r increases, N increases as the fifth power of r.

But wait, the question is about the change with distance, per unit range. So, perhaps we need to find the number of stars per unit distance. That would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

If N = kr^5, then dN/dr = 5kr^4. So, the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the question isn't entirely clear. Let me read again.

Question: How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?

Hmm. So, it's asking about the change in number per unit distance. So, it's the rate of change of N with respect to r. That would be the derivative.

So, if N ∝ r^5, then dN/dr ∝ r^4. So, the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. So, if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then N = (r)^5. So, for a given distance r, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But the number of stars per unit distance (like how many stars you see when you move a little further) would involve the derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r. So, for a thin shell, the number of stars would be surface area times the number density.

Wait, but wait, the question says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, 1/plx is r. So, 1/plx^5 is r^5. So, the number density (stars per unit volume) is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the number of stars in a volume would be density multiplied by volume. So, the total stars in a sphere of radius r would be density * volume. But that's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. Let me consider that the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So, N = k * (1/plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/r, N = k * r^5. So, as r increases, N increases as r^5. Now, the question is: how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range. So, perhaps it's how N changes as you move from r to r+dr. That would be the derivative.

So, dN/dr = 5k r^4. So, the rate of change is proportional to r^4. So, the answer would be C) ~ r^4.

But wait, the options are A to D, and C is r^4. So that's the option.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = 1/r \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = 1/r \) into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto r^5
\]

This means the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance. However, the question asks specifically about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This requires calculating the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \):

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance changes as \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
