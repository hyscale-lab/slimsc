Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R) and (S) forms of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the starting materials A and B are treated with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively, and both give the same ketone product but with different stereochemistry. The options give possible structures for A and B.

Wait, I remember that reducing agents can affect the configuration of the stereocenter in a molecule. So, it's about how the reducing agent works and whether it leads to retention or inversion of configuration, or maybe racemization.

The product in both cases is a tetrahydropyranone. Tetrahydropyran is like a six-membered ring with an oxygen, similar to a cyclic ether. The substituents are ethyl and the ketone group. Let me visualize that structure. The ring is probably formed from an acetal or something like that.

So, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The '2H' notation indicates that the double bond is in position 2, but since it's a pyranone, I think the ring is fully saturated except for the ketone. Wait, actually, pyranone usually has a ring with a ketone and a double bond elsewhere. But maybe in this case, it's fully saturated because it's tetrahydro.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a reduction of a cyclic ketone or an ester? Hmm. Let me think about the starting materials. The options are A and B, which are both 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids, differing in their configurations (S or R).

Ah, okay, so A and B are both pentanoic acids with substituents. The substituents are ethyl at position 3, isobutoxy at position 5, and an oxo group (keto) also at position 5. So, the structure is something like CH2CH2-COOH, but with substituents. Wait, position 3 is ethyl, 5 is isobutoxy and oxo. So, maybe it's a substituted pentanoic acid with a keto group and an ether group at the same position?

Wait, that's confusing. Let me draw the structure. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Position 5 would be the COOH group, but that can't be right because the chain is only five carbons. Wait, maybe the structure is more like this: the main chain is five carbons, with substituents on carbons 3 and 5. So, for 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH(Et)C(OIsobu)O-COOH. Wait, but that might not fit, as position 5 would be the same as the COOH position. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's more like:

The pentanoic acid is CH2-CH2-CH(Et)-C(OIsobu)O-COOH? No, that doesn't make sense because position 5 would be the COOH. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the numbering. Pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So, the first carbon is the COOH, then four more CH2 groups. So, position 3 would be the third carbon from the COOH. So, numbering from the COOH end: 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5 (CH3). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in pentanoic acid, the COOH is carbon 1, then 2, 3, 4, and 5 (the methyl end). So, substituents at position 3 would be on the third carbon from COOH. So, 3-ethyl would be CH2CH2CH(Et)CH2COOH? Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-C(Et)(OIsobu)-CH2-OH? No, wait, the substituents are at position 5. Oh wait, wait, the compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, position 5 is the same as the COOH group? That can't be right. Maybe the structure is:

CH2CH2-COOH, but with substituents on the middle carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclo structure after reduction.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction. The product is a tetrahydropyranone, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone. The starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. So, perhaps the starting material is an acyloxy group that, upon reduction, forms the cyclic ether.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they're used for different types of reductions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters, ketones, etc. BH3 is often used in hydroboration reactions, which are anti-Markovnikov additions to alkenes, but it's also used in reductions, though I'm not as sure about that.

Wait, in the case of LiBH4, when it reduces a ketone, it would produce a secondary alcohol. But in this problem, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is something else. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester or a lactone.

Wait, another approach: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The ketone is at position 2. The substituent is ethyl at position 4. So, the ring is formed by connecting oxygen to two adjacent carbons, and the substituents are ethyl and the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acyloxy compound, which upon reduction forms the cyclic ether. Let me think: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. If the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), then LiBH4 could reduce it to a diol? No, wait, LiBH4 can open esters. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are esters. For example, if the starting material is an ester like R-O-CO-R', then upon reduction, it could form a diol. But the product here is a ketone, so maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what each reaction does. Reaction A uses LiBH4 and H+. So, maybe it's a reduction of an ester. Let's say the starting material is an ester, and LiBH4 reduces it to a diol. But the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is a ketone or an aldehyde. But then, the product is a secondary or primary alcohol. But in our case, the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

Wait, LiBH4 can reduce esters to glycols. For example, a lactone (cyclic ester) would be reduced by LiBH4 to form a diol. But the product here is a ketone, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic acetal. When an acetal is treated with a reducing agent, it can be opened. Let me think: acetals are typically formed from aldehydes or ketones. But if you reduce an acetal, maybe you get a diol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a lactone, which upon reduction forms a diol. But again, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the stereochemistry. The product has (R) and (S) configurations, meaning that the starting material must have a stereocenter that's retained or inverted.

Looking at the options, the starting materials are either (S) or (R) configurations. So, the reaction must determine whether the configuration is retained or changed.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but in the context of ketone reductions, it would reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol. But in our case, the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting material is not a ketone but perhaps an ester or another group that upon reduction forms the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and the reaction is doing something else. Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) which upon reduction forms a diol, but that doesn't produce a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic acetal, which upon reduction forms a diol, but that also doesn't produce a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen. For example, perhaps it's a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent, but that seems redundant.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol, but the product is a ketone. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another thing: LiBH4 is a hydride source. When it reduces a ketone, it adds a hydride to the carbonyl carbon, producing an alcohol. But our product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material isn't a ketone but maybe an ester or another group that, when reduced, becomes a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. No, LiBH4 doesn't typically open epoxides, unless under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the reduction of an ester to form a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't lead to a ketone either.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the product structure again. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, it's a six-membered ring, with an oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal. For example, an acetal derived from a diol and a ketone. Then, reducing the acetal would break it into a diol and release the ketone. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent ester group. When reduced, the ester is hydrolyzed or transformed.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a methyl ester of a ketone, and upon reduction, it becomes an alcohol. No, but the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. LiBH4 can reduce β-keto esters. Wait, for example, if you have a β-keto ester like ethyl acetoacetate, LiBH4 would reduce it to the corresponding alcohol. But what would that look like?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester. Let's say the structure is an ester within a ring, which upon reduction would open or form an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but I don't think LiBH4 would reduce them to form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. Upon reduction, it forms a diol, but that still doesn't give a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry aspect. The product has (R) and (S) configurations, which implies that the reduction is stereoselective, retaining or inverting the configuration.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically gives retention of configuration when reducing ketones to alcohols because the hydride attacks the carbonyl from the same side as the leaving group. Wait, no, in ketone reduction, the hydride adds to the less substituted carbon (in a planar attack), leading to a racemic mixture unless there's some other factor. But wait, if the starting material is a prochiral ketone, then the reduction would create a chiral center, and the configuration would depend on the hydride source and the reaction conditions.

Wait, if the starting material is a ketone with a stereogenic center, then the reduction would lead to a specific stereochemistry based on the approach of the hydride. For example, using LiBH4 would typically lead to the hydride attacking from the less hindered side, perhaps leading to a specific configuration.

But in this problem, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is not a ketone but another group that becomes a ketone after the reaction. Maybe the starting material is an ester, and the reduction forms a diol, but how does that become a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. When you reduce a β-keto ester with LiBH4, you would typically get a secondary alcohol, not a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a nitrile, and LiBH4 can reduce it to an amine, but that's unrelated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal with an ester group. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to an alcohol, and the hemiacetal opens to form a diol, but that doesn't result in a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent, but that's what the product is.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a lactone. Let me think: lactones are cyclic esters. When you reduce a lactone with LiBH4, you would open the ester into a diol. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce esters to glycols. So, for example, if you have a five-membered lactone, reducing it would give a five-membered diol. But the product here is a six-membered ring, which is tetrahydropyran. So, perhaps the starting material is a lactone that, upon reduction, becomes a diol which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, that's possible. Let's suppose the starting material is a five-membered lactone. When LiBH4 reduces it, it breaks the ester into a diol, which then cyclizes to form a six-membered ring, leading to the pyranone.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of the mechanism. LiBH4 would attack the ester group, breaking it into an alcohol. For a lactone, the ester is in a ring, so reduction would break the ring and form a diol. Then, perhaps under acidic conditions, the diol would undergo cyclization to form a new ring, perhaps a six-membered one, which would be a tetrahydropyranone.

Wait, but how does the configuration at the center come into play? The starting material has an S or R configuration, which would influence the product's configuration.

So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative, specifically a 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let's try to parse it. The main chain is five carbons, with a COOH group at one end. At position 3, there's an ethyl group. At position 5, there's an isobutoxy group and an oxo group. So, the structure could be something like:

CH2CH2-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 on the same carbon as the COOH group.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the COOH is at position 1. So, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So, position 3 is ethyl, position 5 is isobutoxy and oxo. So, perhaps it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(Et)-C(O-)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, that would mean the fifth carbon is the same as the COOH, which can't be right. Maybe the structure is:

COOH-(CH2)3-C(O-)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

But that would be position 5 is the same as the COOH. Hmm, perhaps the structure is more like:

CH2CH2-COOH, with substituents on the middle carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the starting material is a β-keto acid. Because 5-oxo suggests a keto group at position 5. So, maybe the structure is something like:

CH2-CH(Et)-CO-O-R, where R is an isobutoxy group. Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. For example, if it's a pentanoic acid with substituents, the ester could be at the β position, and upon reduction, it would form a secondary alcohol.

But how does that form a pyranone?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and when reduced, it forms a secondary alcohol, which then cyclizes to form a ring. For example, if the starting material is a β-keto ester with an adjacent hydroxyl group, reducing it might form a diol, which could then form a cyclic ether upon losing water.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a β-keto acid. Then, when reduced, the acetal is broken, releasing the β-keto acid, which could then form the pyranone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a reduction of an ester group to form an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form a ring with a ketone. So, the ester group is at one end, and the other end is a hydroxyl group, leading to the formation of a six-membered ring upon elimination of water.

Ah, that makes sense. So, the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, but let me think about the specific reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. If the starting material is a β-keto ester, LiBH4 would reduce the ester group to an alcohol. The β-keto group would remain, perhaps leading to the formation of the pyranone.

Wait, but how? Let me think of the mechanism. Suppose the starting material is something like CH2CH(Et)-CO-O-R, where R is an isobutoxy group. Wait, no. Alternatively, it's a cyclic β-keto ester. Upon reduction, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the β-keto group becomes a ketone, but that's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a β-keto group. When LiBH4 reduces the ester, it breaks the ring and forms an alcohol, which then can form a new ring upon elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a γ-keto ester. When reduced, it forms a secondary alcohol, which can cyclize.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure and how it's formed. The product is a tetrahydropyranone, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. So, the ring is formed by connecting an oxygen between two adjacent carbons, with a ketone on one of them.

If the starting material is a β-keto ester, perhaps upon reduction, the ester becomes an alcohol, and then the β-keto group allows for cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, another approach: LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols. So, if the starting material has an ester group, LiBH4 would reduce it to a hydroxyl group. If the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), then LiBH4 would reduce it to a diol, which then could undergo cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, but a diol would form a ring upon elimination of water. For example, a diol with two OH groups on adjacent carbons could form a ring upon elimination, releasing water and forming a double bond. But the product is a saturated ring with a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps the diol would form a cyclic ether via an acid-catalyzed mechanism, but the presence of a ketone suggests that another group is involved.

Alternatively, maybe after reduction, the molecule undergoes an aldol condensation to form the ring and the ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol. Then, under acidic conditions, the secondary alcohol can undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to form a ring, creating the pyranone.

But would LiBH4 reduce a β-keto ester to a secondary alcohol? I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I think that β-keto esters are relatively resistant to reduction, but LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's the ester group that's being reduced, not the ketone.

Wait, okay, perhaps the starting material is an ester group, which upon reduction becomes an alcohol, allowing for cyclization. But the product has a ketone, so maybe the starting material has a β-keto ester.

Let me think of an example. Suppose the starting material is ethyl acetoacetate, which is a β-keto ester. Reducing it with LiBH4 would typically yield the secondary alcohol, which is ethyl glyoxylate, but that's not a ring.

Alternatively, consider a cyclic β-keto ester. Upon reduction, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the ring size changes. Hmm.

This is getting a bit too abstract. Let me try to think about the stereochemistry part. The starting materials are either R or S configurations, and the product is R or S, depending on which reducing agent is used.

If the starting material has an R configuration, and LiBH4 is used, what happens to the configuration? Similarly, for BH3.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong hydride donor. When it reduces a ketone, it adds the hydride to the carbonyl carbon, which is planar, leading to a racemic mixture unless there's some other factor. But in this problem, the product is a single enantiomer. So, perhaps the starting material is a chiral center that is retained or inverted during the reaction.

Wait, maybe the starting material is not a ketone but a nitrile. No, that's unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of an ester to a diol, and the configuration of the starting material dictates the configuration of the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal, and upon reduction, it breaks into a diol, which then cyclizes. But the product is a ketone, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a nitrile, but again, that's not leading directly to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. No, I don't think LiBH4 would reduce an epoxide to a ketone.

Another thought: perhaps the starting materials are secondary alcohols, but that doesn't make sense because the product is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used in polar aprotic solvents. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions but can also be used as a reducing agent in certain contexts.

Wait, the product is a ketone, and the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. Maybe the reaction involves decarboxylation. For example, if the starting material is a β-keto acid, it can undergo decarboxylation upon heating, forming a ketone. But then, how does the reducing agent fit in?

Wait, if the starting material is a β-keto acid, and it's treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, perhaps the ester group is reduced. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and LiBH4 reduces it to a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone. The configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the diol, which in turn affects the configuration of the product.

So, suppose the starting material is a β-keto ester. When LiBH4 reduces the ester group, it forms a secondary alcohol. Then, the β-keto group allows for an intramolecular aldol reaction, forming the ring and the ketone.

Wait, but that doesn't directly tie into the stereochemistry. Let me think again about the configuration.

The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one for reaction A, and (S) for reaction B. So, depending on the starting material and the reducing agent, the configuration changes.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically results in the formation of the more stable alcohol. However, if the starting material is a chiral center, the reduction could either retain or invert the configuration based on the mechanism.

Wait, in ketone reductions, the hydride attack is from the less hindered side, leading to the major product. If the starting material is a prochiral ketone, the hydride would approach from the less substituted side, leading to a specific configuration.

But in this case, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material isn't a ketone but another group that upon reduction becomes a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a nitrile. If LiBH4 reduces a nitrile to an amine, but that's unrelated to the product being a ketone.

Another approach: perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals. For example, a cyclic acetal derived from a diol and a ketone. When reduced, the acetal breaks down, releasing the diol and the ketone.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not a released ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an acetal group, which upon reduction forms the pyranone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a β-diketone. Upon reduction, it forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. But I don't see how that would produce a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-hydroxy ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, leading to cyclization.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the possible reaction mechanisms again.

If the starting material is a β-keto ester, and it's treated with LiBH4, the ester would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. The β-keto group would remain as a ketone. Then, the molecule would have two adjacent carbonyl groups, which could lead to cyclization.

Wait, but how? If the molecule is CH2CH(Et)-CO-O-R, where R is an isobutoxy group, and the COO is the ester. Upon reduction, the ester becomes CH2CH(Et)-CH(OH)-R. Then, the β-keto group isn't present, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, and then undergoes an aldol condensation to form the ring.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a reducing agent, not a base, so aldol condensation might not happen under those conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a hemiacetal or acetal formation after the reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the reduction forms a secondary alcohol, which then reacts with another part of the molecule to form a ring.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a γ-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, allowing for a five-membered ring to form.

Wait, but the product is a six-membered ring, so maybe it's a different position.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are about the configurations of A and B. Each option provides A and B as different enantiomers.

In the problem, A is treated with LiBH4, and B with BH3, to produce (R) and (S) products, respectively.

I need to determine which starting material configuration gives which product configuration when treated with which reducing agent.

Assuming that the reduction of a chiral center occurs, if the starting material is R, and the reduction inverts configuration, the product would be S. Or if it's retention, the product would be R.

But under what conditions does the configuration invert or retain?

In ketone reductions, the attack of the hydride is from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the more stable (less hindered) diastereomer. But if the starting material is a planar ketone, the product would be racemic. However, in this case, the starting material is a chiral β-keto ester, so the reduction would proceed with a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a β-keto ester to form a secondary alcohol, and the configuration is determined by the starting material.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of an acetal to form a diol, and the configuration of the starting material determines the diol's configuration, which then forms the product.

In that case, the configuration of the product would depend on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's behavior.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is an acetal with a chiral center. When reduced, the acetal breaks, and the configuration is retained or inverted.

For example, if the acetal is (R), and the reduction leads to inversion, the product would be (S), and vice versa.

But I'm not sure about the specifics of how the reduction affects the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a ketone to a secondary alcohol, and the product's configuration depends on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, not an alcohol, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via an elimination reaction after reduction. For example, reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, followed by elimination to form an alkene and then cyclization. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone.

In that case, the configuration of the starting material would influence the configuration of the diol, which in turn determines the configuration of the product.

So, if the starting material is R, and the reduction leads to retention of configuration, the product would be R. If the reduction leads to inversion, the product would be S.

But which reducing agent causes retention and which causes inversion?

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to retention of configuration when reducing esters because the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the same side as the leaving group.

Wait, in ester reduction, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the ester oxygen leaves as an alkoxide, which then picks up a proton. So, the attack is from the same face, leading to retention of configuration. But in this case, the starting material isn't a ketone but an ester or another group.

So, if the starting material is a β-keto ester, and the ester is reduced with LiBH4, the reduction would break the ester into an alcohol, retaining the configuration. Then, the β-keto group would allow for cyclization to form the pyranone, retaining the configuration.

Alternatively, if the starting material is a β-keto ester and the reduction is done with BH3, perhaps the configuration is inverted.

But I'm not entirely certain about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a conjugate reduction. For example, BH3 could reduce a β-keto ester's carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, BH3 is more commonly used for hydroboration, which follows anti-Markovnikov addition. But in the context of ketones, perhaps it's used for different reductions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol, while BH3 would reduce the β-keto group.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe LiBH4 reduces both ester and ketone groups, while BH3 only reduces ketones.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones, esters, nitriles, etc. BH3 is less strong and typically used for alkenes via hydroboration, but it can also reduce some carbonyl groups under certain conditions.

So, perhaps in reaction A, LiBH4 reduces the β-keto ester to a diol, which then cyclizes to form the pyranone with a specific configuration. In reaction B, BH3 reduces a different group, leading to a different configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but that's not matching the product.

Wait, perhaps the key is that LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration and BH3 leads to inversion, or vice versa.

In the product, the configuration depends on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent's effect.

Option D says A is R and B is S. So, when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R product, and when B is treated with BH3, it gives S product.

If LiBH4 leads to retention (so starting material R gives product R), and BH3 leads to inversion (so starting material S gives product S after inversion?), then that would fit.

Wait, but I think when using LiBH4 to reduce a ketone, the hydride attacks from the less hindered side, leading to the major product, but this is for planar sp² centers, not chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral β-keto ester. When reduced with LiBH4, the configuration is retained, leading to the same configuration in the product. When reduced with BH3, the configuration is inverted, leading to the opposite configuration.

But I'm not certain about how BH3 would affect the configuration. Alternatively, perhaps BH3 is acting as a borohydride, similar to LiBH4, but under different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps BH3 is used in a different solvent, leading to a different stereochemical outcome.

Wait, another approach: in ketone reductions, the configuration of the product depends on the approach of the hydride. If the starting material is a planar ketone, the product is a racemic mixture. But if the starting material is a chiral β-keto ester, the reduction might be stereoselective.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester, and the reduction leads to a diol, which cyclizes to form the pyranone. The configuration would depend on whether the reducing agent causes retention or inversion.

Wait, if the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester with R configuration, reducing the ester to an alcohol would break the ring, and the β-keto group would allow for cyclization to form the pyranone. The configuration of the product would depend on how the reduction occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction of the ester leads to a specific configuration in the diol, which then forms the pyranone with a specific configuration.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of the possible options and their configurations.

The options are:

A) A and B are both S
B) A and B are both R
C) A is S, B is R
D) A is R, B is S

The product from A is (R), from B is (S).

So, when A (either R or S) is treated with LiBH4, it gives R. When B is treated with BH3, it gives S.

If the configuration of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent's effect, then perhaps:

If A is R and treated with LiBH4 (which causes retention), the product is R.

If B is S and treated with BH3 (which causes inversion), the product would be R, which doesn't match the problem statement.

Wait, the product from B is S. So, if B is S and the reaction leads to the same configuration, then the product is S. But in that case, treating B (S) with BH3 would give S, but how does that fit?

Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 causes retention, and BH3 causes inversion.

So, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, product is R.

If B is S and treated with BH3, which inverts configuration, the product would be R, which doesn't match.

Wait, but the product from B is S. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 causes inversion, and BH3 causes retention.

So, if A is R and treated with LiBH4, the product is S. But the problem says it's R, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration dictates the product's configuration regardless of the reducing agent. But that doesn't make sense because the same starting material would give the same product, but the problem uses two different starting materials.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents affect the configuration in a way that depends on their own properties.

So, for LiBH4, the product configuration is the same as the starting material. For BH3, the product configuration is the opposite.

In that case:

If A is R and treated with LiBH4, product is R.

If B is S and treated with BH3, product is R, which isn't correct because the product is supposed to be S.

Wait, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite: LiBH4 causes inversion, and BH3 causes retention.

So, if A is S, LiBH4 would produce R (because S becomes R upon inversion).

If B is R, BH3 would produce R (retention), but the product is supposed to be S, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is not directly inverted but depends on the specific reaction. For example, LiBH4 might cause the product configuration to be the same as the starting material, while BH3 leads to retention.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration is opposite to the product's configuration based on the reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction's stereochemistry is as follows:

LiBH4: product configuration is same as starting material.

BH3: product configuration is opposite.

In that case:

Product from A (LiBH4) is R. So, starting material A must be R.

Product from B (BH3) is S. So, starting material B must be R (since BH3 would invert it to S).

Looking at the options, option D says A is R and B is S.

Wait, no. Because if B is S and treated with BH3, which inverts, the product would be R, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, if B is R and treated with BH3, product is S.

So, according to that scenario, A should be R (product R when treated with LiBH4), and B should be R as well, but when treated with BH3, it becomes S.

But looking at the options, option B says both A and B are R. Then, product from B would be S, which matches.

But then, the product from A would be R, which matches the first product.

Wait, that's possible.

So, if both A and B are R, then:

A + LiBH4 → R (product)

B + BH3 → S (product)

Which fits the given problem.

But wait, let me think: if the starting material is R and the reaction with LiBH4 gives R, then LiBH4 is causing retention. If the same starting material R is treated with BH3, it would give S, implying BH3 causes inversion.

So, if A is R, LiBH4 → R.

If B is R, BH3 → S.

So, the product from B is S, which matches.

So, in that case, both A and B are R.

Looking at the options, option B says A and B are both R.

But let me double-check the options.

Option B: A is (R)-3-ethyl... , B is same.

So, if both are R, then treating A with LiBH4 gives R, treating B with BH3 gives S.

Which matches the products given.

So, the correct option would be option D? Wait, no. Because the options are:

A) A and B are S.

B) Both R.

C) A S, B R.

D) A R, B S.

Wait, according to my reasoning, the correct option would be D, where A is R and B is S.

Because if A is R and treated with LiBH4 (retention) → R.

B is S and treated with BH3 (inversion) → R. But that doesn't fit the product, which is S for B.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

If the products are:

A + LiBH4 → R

B + BH3 → S

So, the configuration of A must be R if LiBH4 causes retention.

The configuration of B must be R if BH3 causes inversion (R → S).

So, both A and B are R.

Which corresponds to option B.

Wait, but option B says both A and B are R.

So, let's see:

A is R, treated with LiBH4 → R (retention).

B is R, treated with BH3 → S (inversion).

Which matches the products given in the problem.

So, the correct option is B.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option B says A and B are both R. So, treating A with LiBH4 gives R, as desired. Treating B with BH3 gives S, as desired.

So, option B is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when starting material is R and treated with BH3, the product is S. So, this would fit.

Thus, the correct answer is option D? No, according to this, option B.

Wait, no. Because if both A and B are R, then when A is treated with LiBH4 (retention), product is R. B is treated with BH3 (inversion), product is S. Which matches the products given.

So, the correct option is option B.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option B: A = (R), B = (R)

So, the answer would be option B.

Wait, but the options are:

A) A = S, B = S

B) A = R, B = R

C) A = S, B = R

D) A = R, B = S

Yes, so according to my reasoning, option B is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The reactions use two different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The stereochemistry of the products depends on the configurations of the starting materials and the stereochemical outcomes of the reductions.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Overview**:
   - Reaction A: Starting material A is treated with LiBH4, producing (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - Reaction B: Starting material B is treated with BH3, producing (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

2. **Stereochemical Considerations**:
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces esters to alcohols while retaining the configuration of the starting material.
   - BH3, under certain conditions, can invert the configuration of a chiral center during reduction.

3. **Starting Materials**:
   - Both starting materials (A and B) are (R)- or (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, differing only in their configurations.
   - The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the stereochemical outcome of the reduction.

4. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - If A is (R), LiBH4 reduces it while retaining the configuration, resulting in the (R)-product.
   - If B is (R), BH3 reduces it while inverting the configuration, resulting in the (S)-product.

5. **Option Evaluation**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S). This would result in the (S)-product for Reaction A and the (R)-product for Reaction B, which does not match the given products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R). This would result in the (R)-product for Reaction A (retention with LiBH4) and the (S)-product for Reaction B (inversion with BH3), which matches the given products.
   - **Option C**: A is (S), B is (R). This would result in the (S)-product for Reaction A and the (R)-product for Reaction B, which does not match the given products.
   - **Option D**: A is (R), B is (S). This would result in the (R)-product for Reaction A (retention with LiBH4) and the (S)-product for Reaction B (retention with BH3), which does not match the given products.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for both A and B. This configuration ensures that Reaction A produces the (R)-product via retention with LiBH4, and Reaction B produces the (S)-product via inversion with BH3.

**Answer: B**
