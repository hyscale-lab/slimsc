Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star's properties when it has and doesn't have dark spots on its surface. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) between two energy levels is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet range, but maybe the exact wavelength isn't directly needed unless it's for calculating energy difference. Hmm.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is lower. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler regions. So when the spots cover part of the surface, the average Teff observed from the star decreases. But each spot is cooler, perhaps around 5000 K or less, but the rest is at 6000 K.

Wait, but the question says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, that's interesting because the average Teff isn't just a simple average. The flux from each part contributes to the total luminosity. So perhaps the effective temperature is calculated based on the total luminosity and the star's surface area.

But wait, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So maybe the spots have a lower temperature, and the rest is at 6000 K. So the total flux is a combination of the two areas.

But how does that affect the photospheric temperature? The effective temperature is the temperature of a blackbody that would emit the same total radiation as the star. So the star's total luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from the spotted areas and the unspotted areas.

But wait, the problem says the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. So does that mean that the overall emission is such that a blackbody at 5500 K would produce the same flux? That would imply that the average of the fluxes from the spotted and unspotted regions is considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire photosphere's effective temperature, which is a combination of the two regions. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about what's being asked.

The ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels is being observed. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when the star isn't spotted, the ratio is higher, and when spotted, it's lower.

The question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes (n1/n2) when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, Factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Since the ratio decreases when spots are present, the factor will be greater than 1. So the answer should be a number like 2.9, or 7.8, etc.

Let's model this. Let's assume that when the star has spots, the temperature in the photosphere is lower. But wait, the spots are cooler regions, but the rest of the photosphere is at 6000 K. Or is the effective temperature of the entire star 5500 K when 40% is spotted?

Wait, maybe each spot has a lower temperature, but the rest of the photosphere is still at 6000 K. So the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K, which is a weighted average based on the areas.

Wait, but let me recall that the effective temperature is determined by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4.

The star's luminosity when part of its surface is cooler would be the sum of the luminosity from the spotted and unspotted regions.

So, the total luminosity L = L_spot + L_unspotted.

Each area contributes L = σT^4 * area.

The unspotted area is 60% (since 40% is spotted). So, L_unspotted = σ*(6000)^4 * 0.6 * πR², and L_spot = σ*T_spot^4 * 0.4 * πR².

The total luminosity L = σπR² [0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4)].

The effective temperature is given as 5500 K, so L = σπR² (5500)^4 *4πR²? Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that:

Wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law is L = 4πR²σTeff^4. So when the surface has spots and unspotted regions, the total luminosity is L = L_unspotted + L_spot.

Each part is L = σT^4 * area.

So,

L = σ * (0.6 * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4) * π R².

But the total luminosity when the effective temperature is 5500 K is:

L = 4π R² σ (5500)^4.

Set them equal:

σ π R² [0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*T_spot^4] = 4 π R² σ (5500)^4.

We can cancel σ, π, R² from both sides:

0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*T_spot^4 =4*(5500^4).

Wait, no, wait: Wait, the left side is 0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) multiplied by σ π R², and the right is 4 π R² σ (5500^4). So, when you cancel, it's:

0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 4*(5500^4) ?

Wait, no. Because 4π R² σ Teff^4 = 4π R² σ (5500^4). The left side was (0.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 * T_spot^4) * σ π R². So when you equate:

σ π R² [0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4)] = 4 π R² σ (5500^4).

Divide both sides by σ π R²:

0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 4*(5500^4) / (π R²) * (π R²) ? Wait, no, wait! 4π R² σ (5500^4) is the right side. But the left side is σ π R² (sum).

So, dividing both sides by σ π R²:

0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = [4 π R² σ (5500^4) ] / [σ π R²] ]

Which is 4*(5500^4) / 1? No, wait, 4 π R² σ (5500^4) divided by σ π R² is (4 π R² / π R²) ) * (5500^4) ) → 4 * (5500^4).

Wait, no: [4 π R² σ (5500^4)] / [σ π R²] ] = (4/1) * (5500^4) * (π R² / π R²) ) → 4*(5500^4) * 1.

But that can't be correct because then the left side would be 0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 4*(5500^4).

Wait, but the left side is 0.6*(6000^4) +0.4*(T_spot^4) = something, and the right side is 4*(5500^4).

Wait, let me compute this:

Compute 4*(5500)^4.

5500^4 is (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * 1e12.

5.5^4: 5.5 squared is 30.25, then squared again is ~915.0625. So 915.0625e12.

Multiply by 4: 3660.25e12.

Now the left side is 0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot^4).

6000^4 is (6e3)^4 = 1.296e17 (since 6^4=1296, so 1296e12 → 1.296e15? Wait, wait, 6000 is 6e3, so (6e3)^4 is 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

So 0.6*(1.296e15) = 7.776e14.

Let me write that as 7.776e14.

So 7.776e14 + 0.4*(T_spot^4) = 3.66025e16.

Wait, wait, 4*(5500^4) is 4*(5500^4) = let's compute accurately.

5500^4 = (5.5*10^3)^4 = (5.5)^4 * (10^3)^4 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e14.

Multiply by 4: 3.66025e15.

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier. So 4*(5500^4) = 3.66025e15.

So,

0.6*(6000^4) = 0.6*(1.296e15) = 7.776e14.

So,

7.776e14 + 0.4*T_spot^4 = 3.66025e15.

Subtract 7.776e14 from both sides:

0.4*T_spot^4 = 3.66025e15 - 7.776e14 = 2.88265e15.

So,

T_spot^4 = (2.88265e15) / 0.4 = 7.206625e15.

Take the fourth root: T_spot = (7.206625e15)^(1/4).

Let me compute that.

First, take the natural logarithm:

ln(7.206625e15) ≈ ln(7.206625) + ln(1e15) ≈ 1.974 + 34.5387 ≈ 36.5127.

Divide by 4: 9.128175.

Exponentiate: e^9.128175 ≈ 9495 K.

Wait, e^9 is about 8103, e^9.128 is approximately 9495 K? Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, express 7.206625e15 as 7.206625 x10^15.

Take the fourth root of 7.206625e15:

The fourth root of 1e15 is 1e3.75 ≈ 5623.413.

The fourth root of 7.206625 is about 7.206625^(0.25).

7.206625 is between 6.25 (2.5^2) and 9 (3^2). The fourth root of 7.2 is approximately 1.65 (since 1.65^4 is about 7.38, which is close to 7.2). So 1.65 * 5623 ≈ 9275 K.

Hmm, so T_spot is approximately 9275 K? That can't be right, because spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. But wait, this would mean that the spots are hotter than the unspotted regions, which contradicts our understanding. So clearly, I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the setup. Let me double-check the equation.

We have the total luminosity when 40% is spotted as:

L = L_unspotted + L_spots.

L_unspotted = 0.6 * (6000^4) * σ * 4π R² (no, wait no, the area is a fraction; wait, no, wait: Each area contributes to the total flux. So the total flux is (unspotted area fraction * T_unspotted^4) + (spotted area fraction * T_spot^4). Then the effective temperature is given by the fourth root of the average.

Wait, perhaps I should model the effective temperature as the fourth root of the average of the flux contributions.

Wait, the flux from each region is F = σ T^4. The total flux is the sum of the fluxes from each part, weighted by their area fractions.

So, F_total = (0.6) * F_unspotted + (0.4) * F_spotted.

F_unspotted is σ*(6000)^4.

F_spotted is σ*(T_spot)^4.

So F_total = σ [0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 ].

The effective temperature is given by F_total = σ (Teff)^4.

So,

σ (Teff)^4 = σ [0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4 ]

Cancel σ:

(Teff)^4 = 0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_spot)^4.

We have Teff =5500 K, so:

5500^4 =0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T_spot^4).

Now compute 5500^4:

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12.

5.5^4 is 5.5 *5.5 =30.25; 30.25 *5.5= 166.375; 166.375 *5.5=915.0625. So 915.0625e12 →9.150625e14.

0.6*(6000^4) = 0.6*(1.296e15) → 7.776e14.

So,

9.150625e14 =7.776e14 + 0.4*(T_spot^4).

Subtract 7.776e14: 1.374625e14 =0.4*(T_spot^4).

Multiply both sides by 2.5: T_spot^4 = 3.43656e14.

Fourth root: T_spot = (3.43656e14)^(1/4).

Compute this:

3.43656e14 is 3.43656 x 1e14.

Take the fourth root:

The fourth root of 1e14 is 1e3.5 = 3162.27766.

The fourth root of 3.43656 is approx ?

3.43656^(1/4) is about 1.36, because 1.36^4 ≈ 3.43.

Because 1.3^4 is 2.8561, 1.4^4=3.8416. So 1.36^4 is about 3.43.

So T_spot ≈1.36 *3162.27766 ≈ 4314 K.

Wait, that makes sense because the spots are cooler than the unspotted regions (6000 K), which fits with what we know about sunspots being cooler.

So the spot temperature is about 4314 K.

Now, back to the problem about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels.

The ratio n1/n2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

But when the star has spots, the temperature in the spotted regions is 4314 K, and the unspotted regions are 6000 K.

Wait, but wait. The question says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But the question is about the photospheric effective temperature. So perhaps the observed Teff is an average of the two regions. But the photosphere is a mix of 60% at 6000 K and 40% at 4314 K.

But wait, when the star has spots, the observed spectrum is a combination of the two regions. So for each region, the ionization state depends on their respective temperatures.

But the problem states that in the photosphere, when examining the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower, leading to a lower ratio.

Wait, no. The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So as T decreases, the exponential term becomes larger (since ΔE/(k T) is smaller, so negative exponent is less negative, making the exponential larger). So if T decreases, n1/n2 increases. But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That suggests that the effective temperature must be higher. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something here. Let's think again: The energy levels are such that level 2 is higher than level 1. So, ΔE = E2 - E1.

The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

If ΔE is positive, then as T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio decreases. So, higher T → lower ratio n1/n2.

But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. That would mean that when the star is spotted, the temperature is higher. But that can't be, because the spots are cooler.

Hmm, maybe I got the ratio the other way around. Let me check: if ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then the higher the temperature, the more the atoms are in the higher level. So n2 increases, n1 decreases, making the ratio n1/n2 decrease.

So, if the temperature increases, n1/n2 decreases.

Ah, so when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That would mean that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is higher? But that's not possible, because the spots are cooler.

Wait, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the effective temperature of the photosphere as observed is lower when spots are present (5500 K vs 6000 K), which would imply that T decreases, leading to higher n1/n2 ratio. But the problem observes that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So something's wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is such that level 2 is lower than level 1. No, that's unlikely because typically, higher energy levels are higher.

Wait, maybe the transition is from a higher level to a lower level, so the photon emitted corresponds to a drop from level 2 to level 1. So the transition wavelength corresponds to the energy difference.

But regardless, the ratio n1/n2 is given by (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So if T increases, the ratio decreases.

So, when the star has spots, its effective temperature is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K. So when the star has spots, T_eff is lower than when it doesn't. So the ratio n1/n2 should increase when T_eff decreases.

But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That's the opposite of what I just thought.

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the scenario. Maybe when the star has spots, the parts of the photosphere that are unspotted are at the same temperature as before (6000 K), and the spotted regions are cooler. But the overall effect is that the average T_eff is 5500 K. But when looking at the ratio, it's an average across the entire photosphere.

Wait, but the ratio n1/n2 would depend on the local temperature in each region. So perhaps the observed ratio is a combination of the two regions.

Wait, but the problem states, "when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels... when the star has spots, this ratio decreases."

Wait, perhaps it's considering the overall ratio as an average. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of spots affects the average T in the photosphere, thereby affecting the ratio.

But let's think again: for each region, the ratio is different. So the unspotted regions have T=6000 K, and the spotted regions have T=4314 K. So the observed ratio is a combination of both. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

Wait, but perhaps the ratio observed is the average ratio across the entire photosphere. So when 40% is at T_spot and 60% is at T_unspotted, the average ratio (n1/n2)_average is lower than the ratio from the unspotted regions alone.

Wait, how would that work?

Wait, let's model it. The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), which is a function of T. Let's call this R(T) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

When the star has spots, 60% of the area has R(6000 K) and 40% has R(4314 K). The observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average, perhaps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's a simple area-weighted average if the lines are optically thick. But perhaps it's a flux-weighted average because hotter regions emit more flux.

Wait, but when looking at absorption lines, the line depth depends on the number of absorbers in each region. So if the line is formed in the photosphere, which is a mix of 60% 6000 K and 40% 4314 K regions, the equivalent width or the line strength would depend on the contribution from each region.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels. So perhaps, the average ratio is a weighted average of the ratios from each region.

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So perhaps the presence of spots, which are cooler, causes the average ratio to change. But according to the model, when you have cooler regions (lower T), R(T) increases because exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) becomes larger, so R(T) is higher.

So if the average R(T) is a weighted average of R(6000) and R(4314), and R(4314) is higher than R(6000), then the average would be higher than R(6000). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this suggests that perhaps the observed ratio is dominated by the hotter regions, or perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective temperature of the photosphere (5500 K) is being used to compute the ratio. That would make sense if the line is formed in such a way that the overall T is 5500 K.

Wait, the problem says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So perhaps the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So the ratio is computed using T=5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K, so the ratio would be higher. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present, which would imply that the ratio is lower when T is 5500 K than when T is 6000 K.

But earlier analysis said that lower T leads to higher ratio. So this would not fit. Hence, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I've got the formula backwards. Let me re-derive the Boltzmann equation.

Boltzmann distribution: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So rearranged, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no, because ΔE=E2-E1. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, if T increases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

Thus, higher T → lower n1/n2 ratio.

So, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K). So, n1/n2 would be higher than when the star doesn't have spots (6000 K). But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That's a contradiction.

So perhaps the ratio is actually n2/n1 instead of n1/n2? Because if the ratio is n2/n1, then higher T would lead to lower ratio.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So in the problem statement, the ratio is n1/n2. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. That would imply that T is higher. But the star's Teff is lower, so T is lower. So this is a contradiction.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is such that ΔE is negative, which would make the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is negative, meaning E2 < E1.

Wait, but that's possible. For example, if level 2 is lower than level 1, then ΔE would be negative. So the exponent becomes positive, and increases as T increases.

But in that case, higher T would make the ratio larger. So when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio would be smaller. That aligns with the problem statement.

So perhaps the energy levels are such that E2 < E1, making ΔE negative. That would explain why the ratio decreases when T decreases.

So let's proceed with that understanding.

So, for the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K), so the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So, the ratio when spotted is lower than when not spotted (6000 K). Thus, the factor is (n1/n2)_unspotted / (n1/n2)_spotted.

Wait, no. Because when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K, and the ratio is lower than when it's 6000 K.

Wait, no. Because when the Teff is lower, and ΔE is negative (E2 < E1), the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Since ΔE is negative, the exponent is positive. So, at lower T, the exponent is larger, so n1/n2 is larger. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, which would require that n1/n2 is lower when T is lower. Which would not happen if ΔE is negative.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the levels backwards. Suppose that level 1 is lower than level 2. So ΔE is positive. Then, higher T → lower ratio.

So when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K), so the ratio increases. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So this can't be.

I'm getting tangled here. Let me think again.

The problem says that the ratio of n1 to n2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower, n1/n2 decreases.

So, that would require that when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases.

Which, from the formula, requires that:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller.

Wait, yes. So if ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then a lower T makes the exponent more negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) becomes smaller. So n1/n2 decreases.

Ah, that makes sense. So, when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases.

So the ratio is lower when T is lower. But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T=5500 K), the ratio decreases. So this aligns.

So, in the unspotted case, T=6000 K, and the ratio is higher. So the factor is the ratio when unspotted divided by ratio when spotted.

So, Factor = [ (n1/n2)_6000 ] / [ (n1/n2)_5500 ]

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

The g1/g2 terms cancel out.

So,

Factor = exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Compute the exponent:

Compute 1/5500 - 1/6000.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818,

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Subtract: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151.

So,

Exponent = ΔE/(k) * 0.000015151.

But wait, what is ΔE?

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 meters.

The energy of the photon is E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448e-10 m.

So,

E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10)

= (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7)

≈ 1.372e-18 J.

But we need this in terms of k*T. Let's compute ΔE/(k).

k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

Approximately 1e5 K.

So,

Exponent ≈ (1e5 K) * (0.000015151) )

= 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ 1.5151.

So,

Factor = exp(1.5151) ≈ 4.54.

Which is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, \( n_1/n_2 \), using the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem states that the ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) decreases when the star has spots, which implies that the effective temperature \( T \) is lower in the spotted case.

### Key Steps:
1. **Determine the energy difference \( \Delta E \):**  
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to units of \( kT \), where \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 9.95 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the temperature difference:**  
   When the star has no spots, the effective temperature is \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \). When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature decreases to \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \).

3. **Compute the factor by which the ratio changes:**  
   The factor is given by:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substituting \( \Delta E / k \approx 9.95 \times 10^4 \, \text{K} \), \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \):
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(9.95 \times 10^4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
   \]
   Compute \( \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667, \quad \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00001515.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(9.95 \times 10^4 \cdot 0.00001515\right) \approx \exp(1.515) \approx 4.54.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) changes is approximately \( 4.5 \). This corresponds to option **C**.
