Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay length depends on their lifetime and speed. Oh right, the formula for mean decay distance (L) is L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh yeah, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. Γ is the total decay width, and the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think I should be careful with units here.

Hmm, the width Γ is given in MeV. Oh right, because Γ is the energy width, and the uncertainty in energy is Γ. So using natural units where ħ = 1, but I might need to convert units properly.

Wait, no, let me think again. The uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a particle, ΔE is Γ (the width), and Δt is the mean lifetime τ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But the units here are a bit tricky. Let me get the constants straight. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because ħ in SI units is about 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s, but when working in GeV, we use ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, so Γ is given in MeV. Let me convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Wait, no, 20.56875e-25 is the same as 2.056875e-24. Right.

Next, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. Because the mean decay length is L = v * τ. So I need to find v.

The meson's energy is given as 8 GeV. Its rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is E = γ m c². Wait, but in natural units, c=1, so E = γ m. Since m is 1.2 GeV/c², but in natural units, it's E = γ m, where m is in GeV/c², but when c=1, units get a bit confusing. Maybe better to compute gamma.

Wait, relativistic dynamics: the energy E is the total energy, which is γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). But since in natural units, c=1, so E = γ m, with m in GeV/c², but the GeV is energy, and mass is in GeV/c², so when we write E = gamma m, the units would match if m is in GeV/c² and E in GeV.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the velocity. The velocity v can be found using the relativistic relation. The energy is given, so E = gamma m c². So gamma is E/(m c²). But since we're working in natural units, let's see. Wait, perhaps using beta (β) which is v/c.

The relation between energy and velocity is:

E = γ m c²
p = γ β m c

But since we have E and m, perhaps I can find beta. Alternatively, I know that E² = (p c)² + (m c²)².

So let's compute p. But maybe using beta and gamma:

gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, beta can be found using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So, gamma squared is (1/(1 - beta^2)) = gamma².

So 1 - beta^2 = 1/(gamma²) = 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225.

So beta squared is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. Let me compute gamma exactly. 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667. Gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

So 1 - beta² = 9/400 = 0.0225. So beta² is 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v = 0.9887 c.

But wait, more precisely, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 * speed of light.

The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s.

So, v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So, the decay length L is v * τ.

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) ≈ 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute that.

Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24:

Calculating the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

Now 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 2.000 (actually, 0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 2.000 because 0.966 * 2 is 1.932, and 0.966 * 0.056875≈0.055. So total around 1.987).

So total is approximately 4.11375 + 1.987 ≈ 6.10075.

But wait, that's a rough estimate. Let me compute it more accurately.

2.966 * 2.056875:

Let me write 2.056875 as 2 + 0.056875.

So 2.966 * 2 = 5.932

2.966 * 0.056875 = ?

Well, 2.966 * 0.05 is 0.1483.

2.966 * 0.006875 ≈ 0.0204.

Total is approx 0.1483 + 0.0204 = 0.1687.

So total is 5.932 + 0.1687 ≈ 6.1007.

So, 6.1007 × 1e-16 m.

Wait, but wait, 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) × 1e(8-24) )= 6.1007 × 1e-16 m.

So L ≈ 6.1e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15. Hmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma.

Wait, given E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c². But wait, in the equation E = gamma m c², since I'm using E in GeV and m in GeV/c², the units would involve c², but perhaps I should account for that correctly.

Wait a second, maybe I should compute gamma correctly. Let me think again.

The energy E is the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest energy (m c²). So E = gamma * m c².

But since we're working with units where c is in m/s, perhaps I should adjust for that. Alternatively, perhaps using natural units (c=1, ħ=1), but I need to be careful with the units when calculating velocity.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the velocity using the energy and mass.

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

So, p = sqrt( E² - (mc²)^2 ) / c.

But let's make sure about the units. Let's compute p in kg·m/s.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the ratio of E and m, since the units will cancel out in terms of beta.

Alternatively, since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v.

So, p c = gamma m v c.

But also, from E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2, so:

gamma^2 m^2 c^4 = (p c)^2 + m^2 c^4.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: calculate beta using E and m.

Let me compute beta using the formula:

beta = [sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 ) ] × c.

Wait, that's another way to write it. So, beta c = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 ) * c.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that.

Actually, the correct formula is beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 ).

Because beta is v/c, so beta c = v.

Wait, let me see:

E = gamma m c².

p = gamma m v.

But v = beta c.

So, p = gamma m beta c.

The relation between E and p is E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Which can be rewritten as (gamma m c²)^2 = (gamma m beta c * c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So (gamma^2 m^2 c^4) = (gamma^2 m^2 beta^2 c^4) + m^2 c^4.

Divide both sides by m^2 c^4:

gamma^2 = gamma^2 beta^2 + 1.

So, gamma^2 (1 - beta^2) = 1.

Which is the same as gamma = 1 / sqrt(1-beta^2), which is correct.

Alternatively, from E = gamma m c²,

gamma = E/(m c²).

So,

beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E )^2 )

Wait, but in natural units where c=1, beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ).

So in our case, E =8 GeV, m =1.2 GeV, so beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887, which matches what I had before.

So beta is approximately 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 c.

But wait, perhaps the issue is with the calculation of the mean lifetime.

Wait, earlier I used tau = hbar / Gamma.

But let's make sure about the units. Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.

6.582 / 0.32 = let me compute that more accurately.

0.32 * 20 =6.4, so 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182. So 0.32 * 20 =6.4.

So 6.582 is 20.56875 * 0.32 = 6.582.

Wait, wait, 0.32 * 20.56875 = 6.582.

Yes, so 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

That's correct.

So, v is approximately 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So now, L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the numbers: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute 2.966 * 2.056875 = approximately 6.1007 as before.

So 6.1007e(8-24) = 6.1007e-16 m.

Wait, but none of the options are 6e-16 m. The options are 4e-15, 5e-15, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of beta.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should use the relativistic mean lifetime, not just the proper lifetime. Because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. Wait, no, tau is the proper lifetime, and L is calculated as v multiplied by tau. Wait, no, no—actually, the lifetime measured in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

Wait, hold on. I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In the rest frame of the meson, the lifetime is tau (proper time). But in the lab frame, since the meson is moving, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

Wait, no, the mean lifetime is the proper lifetime multiplied by gamma. So tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper.

Tau proper is the lifetime in the meson's rest frame. So in our calculation, tau was calculated as hbar / Gamma, which is the proper lifetime. So when the meson is moving, the lab frame sees a longer lifetime, by gamma.

So the mean decay distance L is v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau_proper.

Ah, that's where I went wrong earlier. I used tau_proper, but I should have used tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper.

So let's redo this.

So, tau_proper = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, gamma is 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.6666667 ≈ 20/3.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating that: 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 = let's compute 2.056875 *6.6666667.

2.056875 *6 =12.34125.

2.056875 * 0.6666667 ≈ 1.37125.

Total approximately 12.34125 +1.37125 =13.7125e-24 s.

So tau_lab ≈ 13.7125e-24 s.

Wait, no, because 2.056875e-24 * (20/3) = (2.056875 *20 ) /3 * 1e-24.

2.056875 *20 =41.1375.

Divide by 3: 41.1375 /3 =13.7125.

So tau_lab =13.7125e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay length L = v * tau_lab.

v is approximately 0.9887 c, which is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.966e8 m/s.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 13.7125e-24 s.

Compute 2.966 *13.7125 ≈ 40.8 (exactly, let's compute 2.966 *13.7125)

Wait, 3 *13.7125=41.1375, but 2.966 is 0.034 less than 3. So 41.1375 - (0.034 *13.7125) ≈41.1375 - 0.466 ≈40.6715.

So L ≈40.6715e-16 meters.

Which is 4.06715e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, 4.067e-15 is very close to option B (4.0655e-15 m). So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because sometimes, the width is given in MeV, and the calculation of tau involves Gamma in GeV.

Wait, Gamma is 320 MeV which is 0.32 GeV. So the calculation of tau_proper was correct.

Then, gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6666667, so tau_lab is 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 =13.7125e-24 s.

v is 0.9887 c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Multiply v and tau_lab: 2.9661e8 * 13.7125e-24.

Let me compute 2.9661 *13.7125.

2.9661 *13 =38.5593, 2.9661 *0.7125≈ 2.9661 *0.7=2.07627, 2.9661 *0.0125=0.037076. So 2.07627 +0.037076=2.113346.

So total is 38.5593 +2.113346 ≈40.6726.

So 40.6726e-16 meters is 4.06726e-15 m.

Which matches option B exactly, 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, but why is there a slight discrepancy? Let me check the exact figures.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me re-calculate the exact value:

gamma = E_X / m_X = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

Tau_proper = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) )= 20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

Tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper = (20/3) * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute (20/3)*2.056875:

2.056875 * 20 =41.1375.

41.1375 /3 =13.7125.

So tau_lab =13.7125e-24 s.

Velocity v = beta c.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m_X / E_X)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 )= sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 )= sqrt(1 - 0.0225)= sqrt(0.9775)= approximately 0.9887056.

So v = 0.9887056 * 3e8 m/s ≈2.9661168e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau_lab:

2.9661168e8 m/s *13.7125e-24 s = 2.9661168 *13.7125e(8-24) = (2.9661168 *13.7125) *1e-16.

Compute 2.9661168 *13.7125.

Let me compute this precisely:

13.7125 = 13 + 0.7125.

2.9661168 *13 = 38.5595184.

2.9661168 *0.7125 = let's compute:

0.7 *2.9661168 =2.07628176.

0.0125 *2.9661168=0.03707646.

So 2.07628176 + 0.03707646 =2.11335822.

Total is 38.5595184 +2.11335822 =40.6728766.

So 40.6728766e-16 m =4.06728766e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0673e-15 m.

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference could be due to more precise calculation of beta.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2 )= sqrt(1 - 9/400)= sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775).

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

Using a calculator, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.98871.

So beta is 0.98871.

So v = 0.98871 *3e8 = 2.96613e8 m/s.

So L = 2.96613e8 * 13.7125e-24.

Again, 2.96613e8 *13.7125e-24 = (2.96613 *13.7125) *1e-16.

2.96613 *13.7125 = let's compute.

Breaking it down:

13.7125 =13 + 0.7125.

2.96613 *13 = 38.55969.

2.96613 *0.7125 = let's compute:

0.7 *2.96613 =2.076291.

0.0125 *2.96613 =0.037076625.

So 2.076291 +0.037076625 =2.113367625.

So total is 38.55969 +2.113367625 =40.673057625.

So L =40.673057625e-16 m =4.0673057625e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0673e-15 m.

Comparing with option B:4.0655e-15 m. There's a small discrepancy, but perhaps due to rounding in the calculation of beta or in the constants used.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for hbar.

Wait, the value I used for hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Maybe a more precise value is 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, but perhaps the exact computation requires precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay distance can be calculated using the formula L = (E * c * tau) / (m c^2).

Wait, but let me think in terms of units.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

L = c * tau * (E / m c^2) * beta.

Wait, because the lifetime is tau_lab = gamma tau_proper, and gamma = E/(m c^2).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 ).

So,

L = v * tau_lab = (beta c) * (gamma tau_proper).

But tau_proper = hbar / Gamma.

So,

L = beta c * gamma * (hbar / Gamma).

Which can be written as (beta gamma c hbar ) / Gamma.

But beta gamma can be written as (E/(m c^2)) * sqrt(1 - (m c^2 / E)^2 ) ) = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / (m c^2) ).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using E and m.

Wait, let me try using E and m in GeV and c in terms of m/s.

Wait, let me compute each part step by step with precise numbers.

Compute hbar: 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau_proper = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma (the Lorentz factor) is E / (m c^2) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) )= 6.6666667.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper =6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s =13.7125e-24 s.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 )) ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2 )) = sqrt(1 - (1.44/64)) = sqrt(1 -0.0225)= sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.98871.

v = beta c =0.98871 *3e8 m/s=2.96613e8 m/s.

L= v * tau_lab =2.96613e8 m/s *13.7125e-24 s = (2.96613 *13.7125) *1e-16.

Compute 2.96613 *13.7125:

Break into 13 +0.7125.

2.96613 *13 =38.55969.

2.96613 * 0.7125 = let's compute:

0.7 *2.96613 = 2.076291.

0.0125 *2.96613 =0.037076625.

Total 2.076291 +0.037076625 =2.113367625.

Total 38.55969 +2.113367625 =40.673057625.

So L=40.673057625e-16 m=4.0673057625e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0673e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. The slight difference could be due to using more precise values for hbar, beta, or gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of sqrt(0.9775) with more decimals.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

Using a calculator:

sqrt(0.9775) = approx 0.9887056.

So v=0.9887056 *3e8 =2.9661168e8 m/s.

Thus, L=2.9661168e8 *13.7125e-24.

Compute 2.9661168 *13.7125:

= (2 + 0.9661168) *13.7125

=2*13.7125 +0.9661168 *13.7125.

2*13.7125=27.425.

0.9661168 *13.7125:

Let me compute 0.9661168 *13 =12.5595184.

0.9661168 *0.7125= approx 0.9661168 *0.7=0.67628176; 0.9661168 *0.0125=0.01207646.

So 0.67628176 +0.01207646 =0.68835822.

So total for 0.9661168 *13.7125=12.5595184 +0.68835822=13.24787662.

So total 27.425 +13.24787662=40.67287662.

So L=40.67287662e-16 m=4.067287662e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.0673e-15 m.

Again, the options are B)4.0655e-15 m and C)5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation of tau_lab again.

Wait, tau_lab = gamma * tau_proper.

Gamma is 8 GeV /1.2 GeV =20/3=6.6666667.

Tau_proper =6.582e-25 / 0.32 =20.56875e-25=2.056875e-24 s.

So tau_lab =6.6666667 *2.056875e-24 =13.7125e-24 s.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in the formula, the decay width is given in the meson's rest frame, so the mean lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma.

But perhaps I should use the relativistic expression where the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the decay length is v gamma tau_proper.

Which is the same as what I did.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option B. I think I've done the calculations correctly, considering all factors. So the answer should be option B.

To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

where \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \) is the lifetime of the meson in the lab frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the meson. The lab frame lifetime is related to the proper lifetime \( \tau_{\text{proper}} \) by the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{proper}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau_{\text{proper}} \)
The proper lifetime is given by:

\[
\tau_{\text{proper}} = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

where \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau_{\text{proper}} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6667
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lab frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
Using \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_{\text{proper}} \):

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 13.7125 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{m}{E}\right)^2}, \quad v = \beta \cdot c
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1.2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

Thus:

\[
v = 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
Using \( L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}} \):

\[
L = (2.9661 \times 10^8) \cdot (13.7125 \times 10^{-24}) = 40.673 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} = 4.0673 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 6: Compare with the options
The closest option to \( 4.0673 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \) is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).
