Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I've studied a bit of mechanics, both classical and relativistic, but I'm a bit rusty. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The question is asking about the maximum speed of a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The mass is m, maximum amplitude is A, and it's obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but this is relativistic, so things are different.

Wait, relativistic harmonic oscillator—oh right, in relativity, the energy isn't just (1/2)mv² because that's non-relativistic. So the total energy in relativity is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the non-relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is also (1/2)kA², so total energy is kA². But relativistically, the energy includes both the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, but in this problem, what's the setup? The potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², so the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but I'm not sure how the potential and kinetic energies relate in a relativistic context. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the oscillator's energy is quantized, but I don't think that's relevant here since the question is about the maximum speed, which might be a classical consideration. Or perhaps it's a particle in a relativistic harmonic potential.

Wait, another approach: In the relativistic case, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator would still have the same form, but the energy would include relativistic terms.

Wait, so the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the total energy E is gamma mc². The energy comes from the potential and kinetic, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Alternatively, perhaps the system's total energy is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, at maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero because the mass is at rest at that point (the turning point). But wait, that's not correct because in relativity, the velocity is zero at the extremes, but the total energy would be the sum of rest energy plus kinetic energy. Wait, no, at x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is just the potential energy plus the rest energy.

Wait, no. At x=A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy (mc²) and the potential energy (1/2 k A²). So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, that doesn't seem right because the rest energy is separate. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy is gamma times mc². But when the mass is at x=0, all energy is kinetic, and when at x=A, it's all potential (but that's non-relativistic thinking).

Wait, no. In the real scenario, the total energy would be the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy, but I'm a bit confused about that. Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case is the same as in the non-relativistic case, but with relativistic expressions for kinetic energy.

Alternatively, another approach: The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Let me recall the equation. The force is F = -kx, so F = m a, but relativistically, the momentum p is gamma m v, so F = d p / dt = d/dt (gamma m v) = m [gamma (dv/dt) + (v gamma') (dv/dt)] ?

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me think of the energy. The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. So E = gamma m c². But also, the total energy is the sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but how does potential energy factor into this?

In the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2)k A², which is the maximum potential energy. But in relativity, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)k x², so when x = A, the potential is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy would be E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Wait, but that's a non-relativistic approach. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is E = mc² + (1/2)k A², which would then be equal to gamma m c² at all times.

Wait, so when the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, and when at x=A, all is potential plus rest energy. So, perhaps the energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy.

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Let's proceed.

So, E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

But in the relativistic case, E is also gamma m c². So,

gamma m c² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

We can write this as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, because (1/2)k A² = (k A²)/(2), so when we factor out mc², it's (k A²)/(2 m c²) times mc², I think that's correct.

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so we can write:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the dimensions. Let me see: k has units of N/m, so k A² is N m, which is J. Dividing by m gives J/kg, which is m²/s². Dividing by c² (m²/s²) gives unitless. So the equation seems okay.

So, let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable for simplicity. Let me call it a = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2.

Taking reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2].

= [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 +a )^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²)/(1 + a)^2.

But 'a' is (k A^2)/(2 m c²), so let's substitute back.

v² = c² [ (2a + a²) / (1 +a )^2 ]

= c² [ a(2 + a) ) / (1 +a )^2 ]

But this seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can factor it differently.

Wait, but let's look at the options. Let's compute each option to see which matches.

Option C is sqrt( k A^2 / m ), which is the non-relativistic maximum speed. So if the options are considering relativity, C is probably incorrect.

Looking at options A, B, D.

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m) )^2 )

Wait, but in our expression, we have a = (k A²)/(2 m c²), so (k A^2)/(2 m ) is a different term. So Option A's denominator is 1 - (k A^2)/(2 m), which seems to have units mismatched because (k A^2)/(2m) is (N m^2)/(kg) ) → (kg m/s² * m²)/(kg) ) → m^3/s². Hmm, but that's not unitless, so the expression inside the square root would have a term that's not dimensionless. So that can't be correct.

Wait, no, wait: Option A's denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2m)), but I was expecting 'a' to be (k A^2)/(2 m c²), which is unitless. So Option A's denominator would not be unitless, which is invalid. Therefore, Option A is incorrect because the denominator inside the square root must be unitless.

Similarly, let's check Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2/(2 m c²)) ) )

Wait, the denominator here is (1 - (k A^2/(2 m c²))), which is unitless. Let me see: (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) → (N m²) / ( kg m²/s² )) → kg·m/s² * m² / (kg * m²/s² ) → unitless. So yes, the denominator is unitless. So Option B's expression is 1 + 1/(some unitless term), so the whole sqrt would be dimensionless.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Again, the denominator is (1 + a), unitless. So 1/(1 + a)^2 is unitless.

So I think we can proceed.

From our earlier equation, we have:

v² = c² [ (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2 ].

So,

v = c sqrt( (2a + a²) ) / (1 + a ).

Factor numerator:

2a + a² = a (2 + a).

So,

v = c sqrt[ a (2 + a) ) ] / (1 + a ).

But a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, let's compute a:

a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 2 + a = 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [4 m c² + k A^2 ]/(2 m c²).

Wait, perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, maybe we can factor the expression inside the sqrt.

Wait, [2a + a²]/(1 + a)^2 = [a (2 + a)] / (1 + a)^2.

But I'm not sure if this simplifies to any of the given options.

Wait, perhaps I should express the expression I have for v in terms of gamma or something else. Alternatively, let's consider the velocity in terms of the maximum speed.

Wait, another approach: The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)k A², which equals (1/2) m v_max².

But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)k A².

So that gives:

gamma - 1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which is the same as before.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²)]².

Rearranging,

1 - v²/c² = 1/[1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2], where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Which simplifies to:

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (1 + a)^2 -1 ) / (1 +a )^2 ].

Expanding numerator:

(1 + a)^2 -1 = 1 + 2a + a² -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Taking square root:

v = c sqrt( (2a + a^2) ) / (1 + a).

But perhaps we can factor this.

Let me compute 2a + a^2:

a^2 + 2a = a(a + 2).

Denominator is (1 + a)^2.

So,

v/c = sqrt( a(a + 2) ) / (1 + a).

So,

v/c = sqrt{ [a(a + 2)] } / (1 + a).

Let me see if that can be simplified.

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, square both sides:

(v/c)^2 = [ a(a + 2) ] / (1 + a)^2.

= a (a + 2) / (a + 1)^2.

Hmm. Let me compute this with a as (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

(v/c)^2 = [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) + 2 ) ] / [ ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) + 1 )^2 ]

Wait, that's a bit messy, but let's see:

Let me denote a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ a (a + 2) ] / (a + 1)^2.

Hmm.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, 1 - a is the denominator. Let's compute 1/(1 - a):

So,

1/(1 - a) = 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)).

So,

sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - a)) = sqrt( [ (1 - a) + 1 ] / (1 - a) ) ) = sqrt( [2 - a]/(1 - a) )

But I'm not sure if this matches our expression.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another way: perhaps the energy equation is incorrect. Maybe the total energy in the relativistic case includes only the potential energy and the kinetic energy, but not the rest energy. Wait, but that can't be right because the rest energy is part of the total energy. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the equation as E = gamma m c^2 = (1/2) k A^2 + mc^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is what I had before.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote b = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

gamma = 1 + b.

So,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + b)^2.

Thus,

v^2 = c^2 (1 - 1/(1 + b)^2 ).

= c^2 [ ( (1 + b)^2 -1 ) / (1 + b)^2 ].

Which,

= c^2 [ (1 + 2b + b^2 - 1 ) / (1 + b)^2 ]

= c^2 [ (2b + b^2 ) / (1 + b)^2 ].

Which is what I had earlier.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2b + b²) ) / (1 + b )

= c * sqrt( b (2 + b) ) / (1 + b )

Hmm.

Alternatively, let's compute this expression.

Let me compute 2b + b² = b (b + 2).

So,

v = c sqrt( b (b + 2) ) / (1 + b )

Hmm. Let me consider the options again.

Looking at Option A: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m)))^2 )

But the denominator (1 - (kA^2/(2m))) isn't unitless, so this can't be correct.

Option B: c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - a) ), where a is (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - a) )

= c sqrt( [ (1 - a) +1 ] / (1 - a) )

= c sqrt( (2 - a) / (1 - a) )

Hmm, but from our earlier expression, we have:

v^2 = c^2 (2a + a²)/(1 + a)^2.

So, let's compute the square of Option B's expression:

v^2 = c² [ (2 - a)/(1 - a) ) ]

Compare to our expression,

(2a + a²)/(1 +a )^2: not matching.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's compute each option's v²/c² and see which matches.

Option B:

v²/c² = 1 + 1/(1 - a), where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So,

v²/c² = 1 + 1/(1 - a) = [ (1 - a) + 1 ] / (1 - a )

= (2 - a)/(1 - a ).

Our expression is (2a + a²)/(1 + a )^2.

Wait, can these be equal?

Let me compute (2a + a²) = a(2 + a).

(1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a^2.

So,

(2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2 = a(2 + a) / (1 + a )^2.

Comparing to (2 - a)/(1 - a ) from Option B.

Hmm, perhaps not the same.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2) ) )^2 )

Which is,

v_max/c = sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + a)]^2 )

= sqrt( [ (1 + a)^2 -1 ] / (1 +a )^2 )

= sqrt( (1 + 2a + a² -1 ) / (1 +a )^2 )

= sqrt( (2a + a²)/(1 + a )^2 )

Which is exactly our expression for v²/c². Because,

v²/c² = (2a + a²)/(1 +a )^2.

So,

v/c = sqrt( (2a + a^2)/(1 +a )^2 ) = sqrt( (2a + a^2) ) / (1 + a )

Which is what we have.

So, Option D's expression is:

v/c = sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + a )^2 ] )

Which simplifies to sqrt( (2a + a^2)/(1+a)^2 ), which is our expression.

So, D is the correct option.

Wait, but let me confirm.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ), where a is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( ( (1 + a)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (1 + 2a + a^2 -1 ) / (1 + a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2a + a^2 ) / (1 + a )^2 )

Which is exactly what we derived earlier.

So, the correct answer should be Option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the relativistic energy relationship. The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = m c^2 + \frac{1}{2} k A^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Rearranging, we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}.
\]

Let \( a = \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + a.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + a)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2},
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
v^2/c^2 = \frac{(1 + a)^2 - 1}{(1 + a)^2} = \frac{2a + a^2}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v = c \sqrt{\frac{2a + a^2}{(1 + a)^2}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}}.
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2} \), we find that this matches the form of Option D:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{k A^2}{2 m c^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect because the denominator inside the square root is not unitless.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because the expression does not match the derived result.
- **Option C**: Incorrect as it represents the non-relativistic maximum speed.
- **Option D**: Correct, as it matches the derived relativistic expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
