Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for alkene metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the positions of the substituents on a double bond are rearranged. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium-based, right? It's good for olefin metathesis, which involves breaking and reforming double bonds.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene—let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I should number it correctly. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. 3-methyl would be on the third carbon, so structure should be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I should write the structure properly.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. 3-methyl would be on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? But wait, that would make it pent-1-ene with a methyl on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pent has five carbons. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me write it properly.

Carbon 1: CH2=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), and then carbon 4 and 5. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, no, because that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is from C1 to C2, and a methyl group on C3. So the structure is: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make the molecule CH2=CH-CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, it's 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Now, Grubbs catalyst would facilitate ring-closing metathesis if possible, but in this case, it's an open chain. Alternatively, it could cause cross metathesis, but since it's a single alkene, it's more likely to undergo ring-closing if possible. Wait, but wait: for ring-closing metathesis, the molecule needs to have two alkenes or a way to form a ring. Or perhaps it's a question of breaking and reforming the existing double bond, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible metathesis products. Grubbs can cause the alkene to break and recombine in different ways. Let's think about the structure:

The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's actually 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Adding a methyl on the third carbon: so the third carbon is CH(CH3), so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's more than five carbons. Oh wait, no. Let me count:

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure correctly. Pent-1-ene has 5 carbons:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on the third carbon, which is CH2, so it becomes CH(CH3). So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. Oh, no, wait, no. Wait, pent is five carbons. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 → that's five carbons in the chain. Wait, no, because after the double bond, we have another four carbons? No, wait: the numbering is from the end with the double bond. So for pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the rest is C3, C4, C5.

So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's 5 carbons in total. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that would be more than 5. Hmm, perhaps I should think again. Oh, wait, wait: 3-methylpent-1-ene is actually (CH2)2CHCH2CH2CH3 with the double bond at 1. No, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is C6H10? Because pentene has 5 carbons and one double bond (so 10 H if all single bonds), but with a methyl substituent, perhaps the formula is C6H10.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's calculate the formula. Pent-1-ene is C5H10. Adding a methyl group (CH3) on C3 would make it C6H10? Because each CH3 adds two C and so on. Alternatively, perhaps I should not get stuck on the formula but focus on the structure.

Anyway, moving on. The molecule is treated with Grubbs catalyst. So, the type of metathesis reaction here. Grubbs catalyst typically does ring-closing metathesis when possible, but in the case of a single alkene, it can't do cross metathesis without another alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening metathesis? Or perhaps it's a diene undergoing some rearrangement.

Wait, but the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. It's a mono-alkene, so metathesis would require another alkene to react with. Since there's only one, maybe it's a process where the double bond is broken and reformed, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, wait, in the absence of another alkene, maybe the Grubbs catalyst can't do much. But wait, Grubbs is a catalyst for olefin metathesis, so maybe it can cause the existing double bond to undergo some cleavage and rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis by forming a ring. How many carbons would that take? Let's see: the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If we form a ring by connecting the ends, perhaps a five-membered ring?

Wait, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So, the chain is five carbons long, with a double bond between C1 and C2, a methyl group on C3, and the rest are CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps I should count the possible sites for metathesis. Metathesis typically breaks the double bond and rearranges the substituents. So, Grubbs would break the double bond and form new double bonds between different carbons.

Wait, but in the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The possible sites for breaking and recombining would involve the adjacent groups.

Let me visualize the structure. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are:

On C1: a CH2 group (from CH2=CH...).

On C2: a CH group that is connected to a CH(CH3) and a CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe this is a bit complicated. Let me think about the possible products.

When the double bond breaks, the two ends can recombine in different ways. For each end, the substituents can switch.

Wait, in an olefin metathesis, the Grubbs catalyst will break the double bond and then facilitate the exchange of the substituents on either side.

So, the reaction for metathesis is: R1-R2-C=C-R3-R4 becomes R1-R3-C=C-R2-R4, plus some other possible rearrangements.

Wait, more accurately, the catalyst breaks the double bond, forming two metal carbene complexes, and then those can exchange groups.

In this scenario, what are the possible products when 3-methylpent-1-ene undergoes metathesis?

Let me imagine the original structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Breaking the double bond between C1 and C2, the two fragments are CH2- and -CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but each fragment has a carbene group. Then, they can recombine in different ways.

Wait, perhaps the possible products include:

1. The same starting material (if no change occurs, but since Grubbs is a catalyst, it's unlikely without any reaction).
2. A different alkene where the substituents are rearranged.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form a cyclic product, like cyclopentene or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible rings that can form. If the molecule has five carbons, forming a five-membered ring would be favorable.

Another approach: Let me think of the possible products of the metathesis reaction.

The starting molecule is (Z)- or (E)-3-methylpent-1-ene, but since it's racemic, it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, wait: 3-methylpent-1-ene is a chiral molecule?

Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The C3 has a methyl group and two CH2 groups (one from C2 and one to C4). So, looking at the geometry around C3, is there a chiral center?

Wait, no. Because C3 is connected to: a CH2 from C2, a methyl group, a CH2CH3 (from C4 and C5), and a CH from C1-C2. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral, but since it's racemic, that suggests it's a pair of enantiomers. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the term 'racemic'. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a racemic mixture, but for a molecule with a chiral center, it would have two enantiomers. But in this case, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which might not have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me look again. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. At C3, the substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3) (the group itself), CH2CH3 (from C4 and C5), and another CH2 group (from C2: no, wait. Let me see: C3 is connected to:

- One CH2 from C2 (the part before C3 is CH2-)
- A CH(CH3) group (so, the substituent is a methyl)
- A CH2CH2CH3? Or perhaps a single CH2 and then a CH2-CH3.

Wait, C3 is:

- Connected to C2 (CH2-), which is part of the double bond.
- Has a methyl group (CH(CH3)).
- Connected to C4, which is CH2-CH3.

So, the substituents on C3 are: CH2- (from C2), CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups? No, that can't be. Let me think: each carbon can have four bonds. So C3 is bonded to:

- C2: CH2-CH- (double bond to C1)
- CH(CH3)
- C4: CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the structure as:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So, C3 is connected to:

- C2 (CH2-)
- CH(CH3)
- CH2CH3 (from C4 and C5)
- And perhaps another CH2 from another direction? No, wait, no. C3 is connected to:

- One bond to C2 (CH2-)
- One bond to C4 (CH2-)
- One bond to the methyl group (CH3)
- And the fourth bond is to another CH2 group? Wait, no, that can't be. Because if C3 is CH(CH3), then it's connected to three other carbons: C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and the methyl group. The fourth bond is a single bond, but in this case, it's just a single bond to another carbon? Wait, no, all the connections are accounted for.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this too much. Let me get back to the main question.

So, the molecule is racemic, meaning it's a 50:50 mix of two enantiomers. But perhaps that's a red herring because the reaction in question is about metathesis, which might not depend on the stereochemistry of the starting material. Or maybe it does.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to think about the possible products.

When Grubbs catalyst is used on an alkene, it can perform ring-closing metathesis if possible. But in this case, the molecule is a mono-alkene. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that can't be right because the question says "how many possible products", implying that there are some.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule can undergo a ring-opening or ring-closing metathesis. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond can shift positions.

Wait, another possibility is that the Grubbs catalyst promotes the formation of a new double bond elsewhere in the molecule.

Let me think of the starting molecule: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

If Grubbs breaks the double bond, perhaps it can form a new double bond between C2 and C3, or between C3 and C4, etc.

Wait, but when Grubbs does metathesis, it tends to swap the substituents on the double bond. So the original double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are CH2- (from C1) and CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 (from C2).

After metathesis, the substituents on the new double bond could be different.

So, possible products could be alkenes where the double bond is between C1 and C3, or between C2 and C3, etc.

Wait, but in general, when a metathesis occurs, the two alkenes that were broken can recombine in different ways. Let me think about the possible ways.

In the original molecule, the two ends of the double bond are:

Left end: CH2-

Right end: CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

When metathesis happens, the catalyst would break the double bond and create two carbene intermediates. Then, these can recombine in different ways.

So, the two carbene species could exchange substituents, leading to different alkenes.

So, the possible products would be the alkenes formed from different combinations.

Let me imagine the possible products:

1. The original molecule (but that wouldn't be a product; it's the starting material).

2. The double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, producing 2-methylpent-2-ene or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible structures.

Another approach: The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Breaking the double bond between C1 and C2, Grubbs could form new bonds in various ways.

Possibility 1: Recombining the same substituents, so the same starting material. But that's not a product, just the same as starting.

Possibility 2: The left fragment (CH2-) combines with the right fragment (CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3) in a way that forms a new double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the new double bond forms between C1 and C3, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be another alkene, like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH=CH3, but that structure might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible combinations.

When Grubbs breaks the double bond, it can form two different alkenes, depending on how the substituents are arranged.

Let me think of the two ends as A and B. So, the left side (A) is CH2- and the right side (B) is CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

In metathesis, the two ends can exchange partners. So, (A-B) can become (A-A) and (B-B), but that doesn't make sense in this context. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the metathesis can lead to the exchange of substituents, so new alkenes are formed by combining different parts.

Wait, perhaps the possible products are:

1. The same as the starting material (but that's not a new product).

2. 3-methylcyclopentene, if the molecule undergoes ring-closing.

Wait, can 3-methylpent-1-ene form a five-membered ring? Let's see: the chain is five carbons, but with a double bond at the start. To form a ring, perhaps the double bond could connect with another part of the chain.

Wait, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. To form a ring, the double bond must connect two parts of the chain.

Wait, the double bond is at C1-C2. The rest of the chain is C3, C4, C5. So, perhaps the end of the chain (C5) could connect back to C1 or C2, forming a ring.

If C5 (which is CH3) connects to C2, that would form a four-membered ring, which is possible but less favorable. Alternatively, connecting C5 to C1 would make a five-membered ring.

Wait, but how? The Grubbs catalyst facilitates swapping of substituents, not necessarily forming rings unless the chain is long enough and the right structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form a ring by the ends connecting, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the possible products from metathesis would be different alkenes based on the rearrangement of the substituents.

So, for the molecule CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, the metathesis could form the following:

1. 2-methyl-1-pentene (but that's the same as the starting material if the double bond shifts).

Wait, no. Let me think of the possible new positions for the double bond.

If the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, that would produce CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that would require hydrogen shifts, which is more like a hydride shift, not metathesis.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up different reactions. Metathesis isn't about shifting hydrogen; it's about breaking and reforming the double bond with different substituents.

So, perhaps in this case, the possible alkenes are:

1. The same as starting (but that's not a product, as the question says excluding ethene, which suggests other products).

2. 3-methyl-1-pentene? No, that's the same as starting.

Wait, perhaps the possible products are different based on the rearrangement of substituents.

Wait, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the two ends are CH2- and CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

After metathesis, the two ends can swap substituents. So the new alkenes would be:

a) CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond somewhere else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the possible alkenes that can form from the metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Alternative approach: The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Grubbs will break the double bond and create a new one.

Possible new alkenes would be:

1. The same as starting (but that's the same molecule).

2. 2-methyl-1-pentene: Not sure if that's possible.

Wait, another possibility: breaking the double bond and forming a new double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't make sense because that would require adding another carbon.

Alternatively, the double bond could form between C2 and C3, making 2-pentene derivatives.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about the number of possible products.

Wait, another thought: Grubbs catalyst can cause different types of metathesis. For a molecule like this, perhaps the possible products include different alkenes formed by swapping substituents.

In the starting molecule, the substituents on the double bond are:

- On the left: CH3 (from the left end, but actually it's CH2-).

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the substituents as R1 and R2. So, the original substituents are R1 = CH2- and R2 = CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Upon metathesis, possible products would be R1-R2 and R2-R1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the possible alkenes are:

1. 3-methyl-1-pentene (same as starting, so not a new product).

2. 3-methyl-2-pentene.

3. 3-methyl-3-pentene (but that would be a single bond, so not possible).

Wait, perhaps the possible positions for the double bond after metathesis are between C1-C2, C2-C3, C3-C4, etc.

But considering the structure, can a new double bond form in another position?

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst can cause the double bond to shift, but that's more of a hydride shift, which is a different reaction. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, the possibility of ring formation. Let's imagine the molecule forming a ring. For example, if the end of the chain (C5) connects back to C2, making a four-membered ring. But four-membered rings are less favorable. Alternatively, connecting to C3 would make a five-membered ring, which is more favorable.

So, if the molecule forms a five-membered ring, the structure would be cyclopentene with a methyl substituent.

The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the end (CH3 at C5) connects back to C2, that would form a ring, but wait, the chain is too short for that.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't form a ring. Alternatively, if the double bond is broken and the ends recombine to form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst could cause the formation of a ring by connecting the two ends of the chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond breaks, and the two ends recombine to form a smaller molecule, like ethene, which the question says to exclude.

Wait, the question says to exclude ethene, so any products that would form ethene are not considered.

So, if the Grubbs catalyst causes the double bond to break and ethene is released, that's excluded. The question is about the other products.

So, possible products would be the remaining parts.

Wait, but the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If metathesis breaks the double bond and ethene is released, the remaining part would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a four-carbon molecule, which would be 3-methylbutane, but that's not an alkene. So that's not a product we're considering, as the question excludes ethene.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis doesn't release ethene but rearranges the substituents to form a different alkene.

So, perhaps the possible alkenes are:

Product 1: Same as starting (but not counted as a new product).

Product 2: 2-methyl-1-pentene.

Product 3: 3-methyl-2-pentene.

Product 4: 4-methyl-1-pentene.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible products depends on the number of different alkenes that can form from the metathesis.

Wait, another approach: for each possible breaking and recombining of the double bond, how many different alkenes can form?

In the starting molecule, the two substituents on the double bond are:

Left: CH2- (from CH2-CH-)

Right: CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

When the double bond breaks, the substituents can recombine in different ways.

So, the possible new alkenes would be:

- The same as starting (but not a new product).

- The left substituent (CH2-) combines with the right substituent's other end (CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3), leading to CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond, so not an alkene.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination forms a new double bond.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents can form new double bonds in different positions.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are rearranged so that the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So, the new molecule would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents can form a new double bond between C1 and C3, but that's not possible because that would require a different structure.

Wait, another possibility is that the metathesis leads to the formation of a new double bond between C2 and C3, creating 2-methyl-2-pentene or something similar.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible diastereomers or enantiomers, but since Grubbs doesn't necessarily favor any particular stereochemistry, perhaps stereoisomers aren't a concern here.

Wait, but the starting material is racemic. So, perhaps the metathesis products are influenced by the stereochemistry of the starting material. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible products depends on the number of different alkenes that can form, considering the possible rearrangements.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can form two different alkenes, each with different substituents, leading to multiple products.

Wait, another approach: the number of possible alkenes that can form from metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

In this case, the possible alkenes would be determined by the possible combinations of substituents.

I think the possible products are:

1. The same as starting material (excluded as a product).

2. 2-methyl-1-pentene (but that's the same as starting, so no).

Wait, perhaps there are two possible products. Let me think: after metathesis, the substituents can form either a more substituted or a less substituted double bond.

Wait, but the specifics are unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form a ring, which would give another product.

Wait, considering the possibility of ring formation.

If the molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis to form a five-membered ring, the product would be cyclopentene with a substituent.

In this case, the product would be 3-methylcyclopentene. But since it's a five-membered ring, it's a possible product.

So, that's one product.

Then, are there any other products?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't form a ring because the chain isn't long enough, or the substituents are in the wrong positions.

Wait, the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

To form a five-membered ring, the double bond must form between C5 and C1, but that's not possible because the chain isn't that long.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form a four-membered ring by connecting C5 to C2.

But four-membered rings are strained, so they're less likely but possible.

So, the products could include:

1. 3-methylcyclopentene (five-membered ring).

2. 3-methylcyclobutene (four-membered ring, but less likely).

But considering the question, maybe only the five-membered ring is a feasible product.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't form a ring, and the metathesis doesn't proceed, but that can't be right because the question states to find the number of products.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the possible alkenes that can form through metathesis.

In metathesis, the two ends of the double bond can swap substituents. So, the substituents on each end can pair with the substituents on the other end.

In the starting molecule, the substituents are:

A: CH2- (from CH2-CH=)

B: CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 (from the other end).

Metathesis can lead to:

1. The same molecule (A-B → A-B, no change).

2. A new alkene where substituent A pairs with the other end of substituent B.

Wait, perhaps the substituents can form new bonds.

Wait, substituent A is CH2-, substituent B is CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

After metathesis, the substituents can pair as:

A with the other end of B, leading to a new substituent arrangement.

But I'm not exactly sure how this translates into new alkenes.

Another approach: think of the possible alkenes that can form. Let me think about the possible products based on possible double bond positions.

Possible new double bonds could be between C1-C2 (same as starting), C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5.

But since the starting material has a double bond at C1-C2, perhaps the metathesis can form new double bonds at other positions.

For example, between C2 and C3.

The product would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that's a single bond. No, wait, the double bond would be between C2 and C3.

So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH3. Wait, that doesn't seem right because that would require a different arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at C2-C3, making 2-pentene with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the product would be 2-methyl-2-pentene or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-methyl-1-pentene, which is the same as the starting material.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of possible alkenes that can form.

Another thought: Grubbs can cause the formation of different alkenes based on the possible combinations of substituents. For a molecule with n carbons, the number of possible alkenes depends on the possible positions and substituents.

In this case, perhaps the possible products are two: one where the double bond remains at C1-C2 and another where it shifts to C2-C3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the number of products is four, considering stereoisomerism or different substituent arrangements.

Wait, but the starting material is racemic, so it's a 50:50 mix of enantiomers. Since Grubbs is a chiral catalyst? No, I think Grubbs catalyst is achiral, but it can catalyze reactions that produce racemic mixtures if the starting material is chiral.

Wait, but the starting material is already racemic, and the reaction might not change the stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the number of possible products is four, considering different stereoisomers. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible products is two, considering the different possible alkenes.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each metathesis can lead to two possible products, considering the different ways the substituents can be arranged.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form a ring and a straight-chain product, leading to two products.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the original molecule has a double bond, and Grubbs can cause it to undergo ring-closing metathesis, forming a cyclic alkene, and also possibly form a different acyclic alkene.

So, the products would be the cyclic product and another acyclic product.

Thus, two products. But the question says to exclude ethene, so perhaps there are two products, making the answer D) 2.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible products is four.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think again.

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Grubbs catalyst will cause metathesis. Possible products are the cyclic product and the acyclic products.

Wait, if the molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis, it would form cyclopentene derivative.

But in this case, the chain is five carbons, so closing the ring would require connecting the end of the chain to the beginning.

Wait, perhaps the ring formed would have five members, making 3-methylcyclopentene.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a four-membered ring, which is less likely.

If the ring forms, that's one product.

Then, there's the possibility of forming another acyclic product where the double bond is in a different position.

For example, the double bond could shift to between C2 and C3, forming 2-pentene with substituents.

Thus, two possible products: the cyclic product and the acyclic product.

So, the number of products would be two, making the answer D) 2.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps there are more products.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule can undergo metathesis in two different ways, leading to two different acyclic products and one cyclic product, making three products. But the options don't have three.

Alternatively, perhaps each possible ring size (four and five) is possible, leading to two products.

But I'm not certain.

Another thought: the number of possible products depends on the possible positions where the double bond can be located after metathesis.

In the starting material, the double bond is between C1 and C2. After metathesis, the double bond can be between C1 and C3, C2 and C3, etc., but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the possible products are 1,3-pentadiene, but that's not possible with this structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 3-methylcyclopentene and another product, making two products.

Thus, the answer would be D) 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst breaks and reforms double bonds, leading to rearranged products. The starting material, 3-methylpent-1-ene, has the structure **CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃**, with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a methyl group on C3.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Metathesis Reaction**: Grubbs catalyst can break the double bond in 3-methylpent-1-ene and recombine the substituents in different ways. This can lead to the formation of new alkenes or cyclic products.

2. **Possible Products**:
   - **Acyclic Products**: The double bond can shift to different positions, such as between C2 and C3, forming new alkenes like 2-methyl-2-pentene or 3-methyl-2-pentene.
   - **Cyclic Products**: The molecule can undergo ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic product. A five-membered ring (3-methylcyclopentene) is the most likely product due to its favorable ring size.

3. **Exclusion of Ethene**: The question specifies excluding ethene, which would result from the complete cleavage of the double bond. Thus, only rearranged products are considered.

4. **Counting Products**:
   - One possible product is the cyclic compound, **3-methylcyclopentene**.
   - The other possible product is an acyclic alkene with the double bond shifted to a different position, such as **2-methyl-2-pentene**.

5. **Racemic Mixture**: While the starting material is racemic, Grubbs catalyst does not introduce new stereoisomers in this reaction. The products are not influenced by the stereochemistry of the starting material.

### Conclusion:
The reaction produces two distinct products: one cyclic and one acyclic alkene. Therefore, the number of possible products is **2**.
