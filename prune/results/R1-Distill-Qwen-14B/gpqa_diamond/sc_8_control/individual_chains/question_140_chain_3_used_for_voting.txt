Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step. 

So the question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Another clue is that the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

First, I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let's break this down.

The melting point of B is ~277 K. I remember that 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. Which substance melts around there? Oh, yeah, maybe something like ice? No, ice melts at 273 K. Wait, maybe another solid. Wait, maybe it's not ice. What about another substance? Let's think: Mercury melts at around -39°C, which is 234 K. Hmm, not matching. Wait, what about something like camphor? Or maybe something else. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a different kind of solid. Alternatively, maybe it's a more common substance. Another thought: perhaps B is a salt? No, wait, the melting point being 277 K is just slightly above 0, so maybe it's ammonium chloride? No, I think it's a different approach. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid that's not a pure element but a compound. Let me think again. Wait, maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the reaction between X and Y. It's a violent reaction, and a precipitate forms. Gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the gas's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So, the molecule would have a molecular weight based on that. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O: H is 1, O is 8 protons, but neutrons would be 8 (since O has 16, so 8 neutrons). Wait, H2O's molecule would have 2 H (each with 1 p and 0 n) and 1 O (8 p, 8 n). So total protons would be 2 +8=10, and neutrons 8. Not equal. Hmm. Another gas: maybe CO2? Carbon has 6 p and 6 n, oxygen has 8 p and 8 n. CO2 has 6+8*2=22 p, and 6+8*2=22 n. Oh wait, that's equal. So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in the molecule. So W could be CO2.

Wait, but the problem says that W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So in CO2, each carbon has 6 p and 6 n, each O has 8 p and 8 n. So the molecule has 6 + 2*8 = 22 p and 6 + 2*8 = 22 n. So yes, that's equal. So W is probably CO2.

So if W is CO2, then the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So Y might be an acid because when something reacts with a carbonate, it produces CO2. Wait, but Y is a liquid. Oh, maybe Y is water, but that doesn't produce CO2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something like hydrochloric acid, but that's a liquid. Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like NaOH, KOH, etc. Wait, but if X is a carbonate, reacting with an acid would produce CO2. So perhaps Y is an acid.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate salt, reacting with an acid (Y) would produce CO2 gas. So for example, perhaps X is Na2CO3. Then Y could be HCl, which is a liquid (concentrated HCl is a liquid). So the reaction would be Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2 + H2O. The precipitate G would be NaCl, but wait, NaCl is soluble. Hmm. So maybe X is not a carbonate but a sulfite or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate. Let's say X is CaCO3. Then Y could be HCl, producing CO2, CaCl2, and water. CaCl2 is soluble, so precipitate G wouldn't form. So maybe X is something else.

Wait, another angle. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes. For example, if G is CaCO3, heating it would produce CaO and CO2. But that would require B to be CO2, but B is a solid. Wait, no, CO2 is a gas. So maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a bicarbonate. For example, when a carbonate reacts with an acid, it produces CO2 and a salt, but if the acid is weak, maybe a bicarbonate is formed. Alternatively, maybe G is a sulfide?

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the product of the reaction between X and Y. The product is a precipitate G. So when X reacts with Y, a solid forms. Then, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. So B is a solid at that melting point.

Hmm, another approach: what about the initial reaction? If X is a heavier isotope-containing compound, perhaps it's something like sodium or potassium, which have isotopes. Wait, but X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, LiAlH4, Grignard reagents. Oh, wait, Grignard reagents are Mg-based. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal like sodium or magnesium. Wait, but the heavier isotope part—so perhaps X is something like deuterated, like D2O, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, the product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So if the product is of a reaction between a keto acid and X, and the product has two oxygen atoms, perhaps it's an ester or something else. Wait, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. For example, acetoacetic acid. Reacting with X might form something like an ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base. If a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid with a ketone) reacts with a base, maybe it forms a salt. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the reaction between a metal and an acid. If X is a metal, and Y is an acid, then the reaction produces a salt (precipitate G?), gas (like H2), and maybe water. But earlier I thought the gas was CO2, but if it's H2, then W would be H2. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (each H has 1 p, 0 n). So protons would be 2, neutrons would be 0. Not equal. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, going back to the gas W. It's a molecule where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So the molecule's total p = total n.

Possibly, another gas: O2? O2 has 16 p and 16 (8 each) n. So each O atom has 8 p, 8 n. So O2 has 16 p, 16 n. So yes, equal. So W could be O2. But O2 is a diatomic molecule. So in that case, the reaction between X and Y would produce O2 gas.

But why would that happen? Maybe a decomposition reaction. For example, if X is a peroxide, like H2O2. Hmm, but if X is a peroxide, and Y is perhaps an acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the gas W could be CH4. No, because CH4 has 6 p (C) + 4 (H) = 10 p, and 6 n (C) + 4 *0 (H) = 6 n. Not equal. So not CH4. Hmm.

Wait, another option: maybe the gas is something like HCN. HCN has 1 p (H) + 7 (C) + 9 (N) = 17 p. And 0 n (H) + 6 n (C, since C-12 is 6 p and 6 n) + 10 n (N, which is usually 14, so 7 p, 7 n). Wait, but HCN's molecular weight is 27 g/mol. Wait, but the count of protons and neutrons per molecule: H has 1 p, 0 n. C has 6 p, 6 n. N has 7 p, 7 n. So total p: 1+6+7 =14. Total n: 0 +6 +7=13. Not equal. So no.

Hmm, maybe the gas is CO. CO has 6 p (C) +8 p (O) =14 p. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8. So 6+8=14. So CO has 14 p and 14 n. That fits the condition.

So W is CO. So the reaction produces CO gas.

So what reaction produces CO? Maybe the decomposition of a carbonate. Wait, but carbonate (CO3^2-) would produce CO2 when reacted with acid, not CO. Alternatively, maybe a reaction where a metal oxide reacts with something else. Or perhaps a reaction involving a carbide.

Wait, carbides (like CaC2) reacting with water produce acetylene (C2H2) and Ca(OH)2. But in that case, the gas would be C2H2, which doesn't fit. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like Na2CO3, but when it reacts with something else, it produces CO. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: when X reacts with Y to produce CO, precipitate G, and perhaps something else. So the reaction could be:

X + Y → G + CO + ?

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbide, and Y is water. For example, CaC2 + H2O → C2H2 + Ca(OH)2. But that would produce acetylene, not CO. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong reducing agent. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, another thought: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If G is a carbonate, then heating would decompose it into a metal oxide and CO2. But earlier, the gas W was CO, so that wouldn't fit.

Wait, maybe G is a bicarbonate. Heating NaHCO3 would produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But again, that would produce CO2, not CO.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe the product is an ester or a ketone. Wait, keto acid is something like RCO-COOH. Reacting with X (maybe an alcohol) could form an ester. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a metal, and the reaction is a Grignard reagent formation. Grignard reagents are Mg-based, so perhaps X contains Mg. Or maybe X is Na or K.

Wait, let's think about the melting point. B melts at 277 K. Let me calculate that: 277 K is about 4°C. Which substances have a melting point around there? I think that's similar to the melting point of camphor, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is ammonium chloride. Wait, no, ammonium chloride's melting point is around 334 K (61°C). Hmm, not matching. Maybe another compound. Wait, maybe it's a different salt.

Wait, what about iodine? No, iodine melts at around 113°C (386 K). Hmm. Wait, perhaps B is a different kind of compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid like glucose or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. Wait, sodium freezes at about 371 K (98°C), potassium around 337 K (64°C), but that's higher than 277 K. Hmm.

Wait, 277 K is 4°C. Which solid has that melting point? Maybe something like paraffin wax? No, paraffin's melting point varies. Alternatively, perhaps it's a type of salt. Wait, perhaps it's a hydrate. For example, sodium acetate trihydrate has a melting point around 277 K. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different kind of compound.

Hmm, maybe I should try to figure out what X is. The options for X are based on the cumulative atomic masses of its elements. So the question is about X's elements.

The question asks to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within X. Also, if multiple instances of an element exist, all heavier and lighter isotopes are summed.

Wait, but how does that work? For example, if X has two elements: the lightest is carbon (atomic mass ~12) and the heaviest is, say, chlorine (atomic mass ~35.5). Then the sum would be 12 + 35.5 = 47.5. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with two elements, and the lightest and heaviest are those two. So the sum would be their atomic masses added.

Wait, looking at the options: A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

So the sum must be one of these numbers. Let's see: the options are all around 25-35. So perhaps X is a compound with elements having atomic masses adding up to one of these.

Wait, the elements in X could be hydrogen and oxygen? But 1 + 16=17, not in the options. Or maybe sodium (23) and chlorine (35.5), sum is 58.5, way higher than the options. Hmm.

Wait another thought: perhaps X is CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but then elements are C, H, O. The lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16), sum is 17. Not in the options. Or maybe X is something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with two isotopes. Wait, but the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So for example, if X is H2O, and one of the H is deuterium (D), making it D2O or HDO. Then the elements are H and O. So the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17. Not in options.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH4. Then elements are C and H. Sum is 12 + 1=13. Not in options. Alternatively, if X is CO2, then C (12) and O (16). Sum is 28. Option D is 29. Close, but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So, perhaps X is a base, and the reaction forms an ester or something else. For example, a keto acid (RCO-COOH) reacting with a base (like NaOH) would form a salt and a carboxylic acid. But the product would have more oxygen atoms than that.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. Wait, but the product has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is an ester, which has the formula R-O-CO-R. Wait, no, esters have more oxygens. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, which has one O. Wait, no, that's not two.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ether, which has two oxygen atoms? No, ethers have one O. Wait, or maybe a carbonate, which has three O. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think of possible candidates for X based on the other clues.

Let's think about the initial reaction: X reacts with Y to produce CO (if W is CO), precipitate G, and maybe something else.

If W is CO, the reaction could be something like the decomposition of a metal carbide. For example, sodium carbide (NaC) reacts with water to produce sodium hydroxide, methane, and carbon monoxide? Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction between a carbonate and a strong reducing agent, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is a reducing agent like H2S. Hmm, but not sure.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So when G is heated, it decomposes into B and perhaps another gas. Since B's melting point is ~277 K, which is about 4°C, maybe B is a solid that's slightly above freezing.

Wait, if G is a carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and a metal oxide. But earlier I thought W was CO, not CO2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. Heating sodium bicarbonate produces sodium carbonate, water, and CO2. But again, that would yield CO2, not CO.

Wait, perhaps G is a sulfite. Heating a sulfite would produce SO2 and the corresponding sulfate? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G is a nitride. Heating a nitride might produce N2 and the metal. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is the oxide of the metal. For example, if X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl, producing NaCl precipitate (but NaCl is soluble). Hmm, not forming a precipitate.

Wait, maybe X is a sulfate. Reacting with an acid would not produce a precipitate unless it's a lead sulfate or something, but that's getting complicated.

Another approach: Let's think about the options given. The options are 35,25,31,29. These are possible sums of two elements' atomic masses.

Let me list possible pairs:

Option A:35. Possible pairs: Cl (35.5) and something else. Maybe Cl and H: 35.5 +1=36.5. No. Or O and Cl: 16+35.5=51.5. No.

Option B:25. Hmm, possible pairs: C (12) and O (16) sum to 28. No. Or Na (23) and O (16) sum to 39. Hmm, no. Or perhaps F (19) and O (16) sum to 35. Not matching.

Option C:31. Let's see: S (32) and H (1) sum to 33. No. Alternatively, O (16) and something else: 31-16=15. Which element has ~15? That's phosphorus. So O and P? Or maybe N (14) and O (16): 30, close but not 31. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's nitrogen (14) and something else. 31-14=17. Chlorine is ~35.5, but 14+17=31. Hmm, 17 is chlorine-35, but wait, 17 is the atomic number for chlorine is 17, but its atomic mass is about 35.5.

Wait, perhaps X contains elements with atomic masses adding to 31. So for example, O (16) and S (32): no, that's 48. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the elements are N and O. N has 14, O 16: sum is 30. Close to option C (31), but not exactly.

Wait, another approach: the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a dehydrating agent, which when reacts with a keto acid would form an anhydride or something. For example, if X is P2O5, which is a dehydrating agent. Reacting with a keto acid would form an anhydride. The product would have more oxygen, but if it's an anhydride, perhaps it has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base like NaOH. Reacting a keto acid with NaOH would form a sodium salt and water. The product would have more oxygen, but I'm not sure how that leads to 2 oxygen atoms.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester. For example, a keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) reacting with an alcohol (X) would form an ester. But the ester would have more oxygen atoms, like three in an ester group. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe the product is an acid anhydride. For example, two keto acid molecules losing water to form an anhydride, which would have more oxygen. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the options again. The options are 35,25,31,29. Summing the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Possible pairs:

- Cl (35.5) and H (1) → sum 36.5 → not an option.
- O (16) and Cl (35.5) → 51.5 → no.
- O (16) and S (32) →48 → no.
- N (14) and O (16) →30 → no.
- F (19) and O (16) →35 → option A is 35. So 19+16=35. So if X has F and O as its elements, the sum would be 35, which is option A.

But wait, what compound has F and O? Fluorine and oxygen could form OOF, but that's not a stable compound. Alternatively, perhaps X is OOF, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe X is something like NaF, which is sodium fluoride. But NaF has Na (23) and F (19). Sum is 42, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X could be something like COF2, which is carbon tetrafluoride? No, wait, COF2 is a thing? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is not a binary compound. Hmm.

Wait, another pair: perhaps X contains C and O. 12 +16=28. Not an option, but option C is 31. Hmm.

Wait, another possible pair: S (32) and F (19). 32 +19=51, which isn't an option. Not helpful.

Hmm. Another angle: the product of the reaction of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So maybe X is a compound that, when reacted with a keto acid, forms something with two oxygen atoms. For example, if X is a base like Mg(OH)2, and the reaction forms Mg salt with the keto acid. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, like Mg. When Mg reacts with a keto acid (which is a carboxylic acid with a ketone group), it would form a salt. The product would have more oxygen, but perhaps the formula has two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is CH3COOH (acetic acid), reacting with Mg would form Mg acetate, which is Mg(O2CCH3)2. That has four oxygen atoms. Hmm, not two.

Alternatively, maybe X is a deuterated compound, as it incorporates heavier isotopes. For example, if X is D2O, then reacting with a keto acid (like HOOCCOOH) would form a deuterated product. But D2O is a liquid, which doesn't fit because Y is also a liquid.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. Then when it reacts with HCl (Y), it produces CO2 gas, NaCl (which is soluble, so no precipitate). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfate. Reacting with HCl might produce a chloride and sulfuric acid. But that doesn't produce a precipitate unless it's a lead sulfate or something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible elements in X. Suppose X contains elements A and B. The lightest is A, the heaviest is B. Their atomic masses sum to one of the options.

Looking at the options again, the highest sum is 35 (option A). So perhaps A is H (1) and B is Cl (35.5), sum 36.5. Not matching, but perhaps the question uses rounded numbers. 35 could be 35.5 (Cl) + 0 (H) doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the elements are O (16) and F (19), sum 35.

So if X has O and F as elements, then the sum is 35, option A. But what compound has O and F? Fluorine and oxygen don't form a stable compound, but perhaps X is a compound like NaF and something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound containing O and another element, say, Na. Na has 23, O 16. Sum 39, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: if X is something like LiCl. Li is 7, Cl is 35.5. Sum 42.5, not an option.

Wait, maybe X is a diatomic molecule with two different isotopes. For example, H and D in H2O. But that would involve H and O. Sum is 1 +16=17.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is NH3. N is 14, H is 1. Sum 15. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CH4. C is 12, H is 1. Sum 13.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the initial reaction again.

The reaction of X with Y produces gas W (CO) and precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of ~277 K. So B is a solid that melts around 4°C.

What about B being ammonium chloride? No, melting point is higher. Or maybe it's a different ammonium salt. Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium acetate? Sodium acetate's melting point is around 342 K (69°C), which is higher than 277. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 277 K. Wait, I think that's correct! Sodium carbonate decahydrate (washing soda) has a melting point close to 277 K. So if B is Na2CO3·10H2O, then when heated, it would lose water of crystallization and form anhydrous Na2CO3.

So if B is Na2CO3·10H2O, then when heated, it loses water and becomes anhydrous. So the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. Wait, no, the precipitate G, upon heating, releases B. Wait, no, the question says when G is heated, it releases B. So G is a solid, heating it gives B and perhaps another product.

Wait, no, the question says when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a hydrate, and upon heating, it loses water (as gas?) and forms B. Wait, if B is a solid, then maybe G is a hydrate that upon heating becomes anhydrous B.

Wait, perhaps G is Na2CO3·10H2O (which is a hydrate), and heating it produces anhydrous Na2CO3 (B) and water vapor. But the melting point of B (Na2CO3) is higher, around 842 K (569°C). So that doesn't fit. So perhaps B is not a carbonate.

Hmm, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think of another solid that melts around 4°C. Wait, maybe it's a different kind of salt. Alternatively, perhaps it's a solid organic compound.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different form of water, but that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound entirely. Let me think: another solid that has a melting point around 4°C. There's something called "dry ice," but that's CO2 and it's a solid at -78°C. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps B is a type of hydrate. Wait, another thought: the melting point of sodium acetate is around 342 K, but maybe a different hydrate. For example, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate has a melting point around 277 K? I'm not certain, but perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid with a low melting point. Maybe something like camphor? Camphor's melting point is around 177°C, which is higher than 277 K (4°C). Hmm.

Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. So something that's solid at 0°C and melts just above. Maybe it's a different type of compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is a type of crystal or something else.

Wait, perhaps B is a solid oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of salt. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reagent X. The question says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include Grignard reagents (Mg-based), NaNH2, KOtBu, etc. Grignard reagents are Mg with alkyl halides. So X could be a Grignard reagent, but Grignard reagents are typically RMgX. So elements involved would be R (alkyl group, C and H), Mg, and X (halogen like Cl, Br, I).

Wait, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps one of the elements in X has a heavier isotope. For example, if X is CH3MgBr, then the elements are C, H, Mg, Br. Among these, Mg has isotopes (like Mg-24, Mg-25, Mg-26), and Br has isotopes (Br-79, Br-81). So in this case, the heaviest element would be Br (atomic mass ~80), and the lightest would be H (1). Sum would be 81 +1=82, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Wait, another common reagent is NaOH, which is used in many organic reactions. NaOH has Na, O, H. The heavier isotope could be O-18 or something, but that's not a heavier isotope. Alternatively, maybe X is D2O (deuterium oxide), which is used in some reactions as a heavy water. D2O has D (2) and O (16). So the elements would be D and O. Lightest is D (2), heaviest O (16). Sum is 2+16=18, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like LiAlH4, which is used as a strong reducing agent. LiAlH4 has Li, Al, H. Heavier isotopes could be present. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Al (27). Sum is 1+27=28, which is close to option C (31) but not exact. Or perhaps the lightest is Li (7), so 7+27=34, which is not an option.

Wait, another common reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu), which is a strong base. The elements are K, O, C, H. The heaviest would be K (39), lightest H (1). Sum 40, not an option.

Hmm, perhaps X is something like acetone (a keto acid?), but acetone is (propan-2-one), which is a ketone, not an acid. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another approach: the product of the reaction between X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So if X is a base, maybe the reaction forms a salt with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid is RCO-COOH and X is NaOH, the product would be Na+ [RCO-COO^- ] and water. The anion would have more oxygens. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, an ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. So that's three oxygen atoms. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe a ketone. Wait, a ketone has one oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonate. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and the keto acid is H2SO4, the reaction would produce Na2SO4, CO2, and water. The product Na2SO4 has four oxygen atoms. Not two.

Hmm, I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think of possible B. The melting point is 277 K, so B is solid at 4°C. Maybe it's a type of crystal or something else.

Wait, perhaps B is a different compound. Let me think: another solid that melts around 4°C. Maybe it's a polymer or something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a type of salt with a low melting point. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different form of a metal. For example, mercury is liquid at room temperature, but perhaps another metal in a different state.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are 35,25,31,29. I'm considering possible pairs:

Option C:31. Possible elements: S (32) and something else. 32 + (−1?) No. Or perhaps O (16) and something else: 15? That's phosphorus. 16 +15=31. So if X has O and P, the sum is 31.

What compound has O and P? Maybe phosphate esters, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is POCl3 or something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with N and O. N is 14, O 16. Sum 30, close to 31 but not exact.

Wait, another pair: F (19) and S (32) → 51, no.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X has elements with atomic numbers 15 and 16, which are phosphorus and sulfur. Wait, but their atomic masses are about 31 and 32. Sum is 63, not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X has elements with atomic masses 12 (C) and 19 (F). 12+19=31. So that's option C.

What compound has C and F? TCF (trichloroethylene?), no. Wait, carbon tetrafluoride is CF4, which is a gas. So if X is CF4, then elements are C and F. The lightest is C (12), heaviest F (19). Sum 12 +19=31. So option C.

But does X being CF4 fit the other clues? Let's think.

CF4 is a gas, not a liquid. But the question says X is a substance known for incorporating a heavier isotope. CF4 could have heavier isotopes, like C-13 or F-19 (but F's main isotope is F-19 anyway). Hmm.

But CF4 is a gas. The reaction of X (CF4) with Y (what?) would produce gas W. Let's say W is CO. Wait, how would CF4 react to produce CO?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm way off. Maybe X is another compound.

Wait, if X is CF4, reacting with a strong base like KOH might produce something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else entirely.

Wait, another thought: the initial reaction produces gas W, which is CO. So if X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong reducing agent. For example, X is Na2CO3, Y is something like H2S (but that's a gas, not a liquid). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with H2O to produce C2H2 and Ca(OH)2. But that's not CO.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal oxide. For example, PbO2 (lead dioxide) reacts with HCl to produce PbCl2, water, and Cl2 gas. Hmm, but that's not CO.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitride. For example, AlN reacts with water to produce Al(OH)3 and NH3. Not CO.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should try to pick an option based on the earlier pair of C and F.

If X is CF4, and elements are C and F, sum 12+19=31 (option C).

But does CF4 fit the other clues? Let's see.

When X reacts with Y, a liquid, to produce CO gas and precipitate G. If Y is a strong base, maybe KOH, but that's a solid. Or perhaps Y is H2O, but that's a liquid.

Wait, if X is CF4 and Y is NaOH, perhaps the reaction produces something else. But I don't know what reaction CF4 would have with NaOH. Maybe it's inert.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something else. Another possibility: X is NaNO3. When it reacts with something like HCl, it produces NaCl, NO2, and H2O. But NO2 is a gas, not CO.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite. For example, Na2SO3. Reacting with HCl would produce S (maybe), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base with one oxygen, and when it reacts with the keto acid, the product has two oxygens. For example, X is Mg(OH)2. The keto acid (like HOOCCOOH) would react with Mg(OH)2 to form Mg(OOCCH3)2 and water. Wait, not sure about the formula, but the product would have more oxygen atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, like Zn. Reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would produce Zn acetate, which has more oxygen atoms.

Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps it's a simple salt with two oxygens. Like MgO. Wait, MgO has one O. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate. For example, if X is NaOH and the keto acid is H2CO3 (carbonic acid), the product would be Na2CO3, which has three oxygens. Hmm.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options and the earlier C and F pair leading to option C (31). So I'll go with option C.

The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction and Gas W**: The reaction of X with liquid Y produces gas W, which has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. This suggests W could be CO (14 protons, 14 neutrons). The reaction also forms a precipitate G, which, when heated, releases B, a solid with a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C).

2. **Melting Point of B**: B's melting point (~277 K) suggests it could be a hydrate or a compound like sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na₂CO₃·10H₂O), which has a melting point near 277 K.

3. **Product of X and Keto Acid**: The reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product containing 2 oxygen atoms. This implies X interacts with the keto acid to form a compound with a specific oxygen count, possibly an ester or salt.

4. **Substance X as a Reagent**: X is used in organic chemistry, suggesting it could be a reagent like a Grignard reagent (e.g., RMgX), a carbonate, or a fluoride compound.

5. **Atomic Masses of Elements in X**: The problem requires summing the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options provided (35, 25, 31, 29) suggest X contains elements with relatively low atomic masses. For example:
   - If X contains carbon (C, ~12) and fluorine (F, ~19), their combined atomic mass is 31, matching option C.
   - Other combinations (e.g., oxygen and fluorine, or nitrogen and oxygen) do not align as well with the given options.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are 12 (C) and 19 (F), summing to 31.
