Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these, so I need to figure out which ones are required.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you consider all possible higher-dimensional operators that can be constructed from the Standard Model fields, respecting certain symmetries. So the operators must obey the symmetries of the Standard Model, but maybe some additional ones too?

First, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Lorentz symmetry is about local transformations of the coordinates, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations, so it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz too, right? Or the other way around? Well, I think that the SMEFT is organized in a way that maintains Lorentz symmetry because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare?

Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory valid below a certain energy scale. Effective theories usually still respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the Standard Model. The Standard Model is Poincare symmetric. So I think the operators in SMEFT should also preserve Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, what about the other options. Let's think about the structure of SMEFT. The operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect. The operators must be invariant under the Standard Model gauge symmetries, obviously. But what about other symmetries like CP and CPT?

CP symmetry is charge conjugation combined with parity. The Standard Model is almost CP symmetric, except for certain parts like the CKM phase which causes CP violation in the electroweak sector. So in the Standard Model, CP symmetry is an approximate symmetry, but not exact. Therefore, the SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry unless the operator itself is CP invariant. Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So do all operators have to be CP symmetric?

Hmm. I think that the operators in SMEFT can violate CP unless they are forbidden by some symmetry. But wait, is that right? Or are the operators required to preserve certain symmetries regardless of the Standard Model's behavior?

Wait, the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which doesn't include new physics beyond the SM, but parametrizes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the SM symmetries. So the SM includes CPT symmetry, which is a fundamental symmetry, I think. CPT symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model is CPT symmetric. So all operators in the SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because the SM does, and SMEFT is an effective theory of it.

But what about CP? The Standard Model doesn't respect CP exactly because of the CKM mechanism. So SMEFT operators can violate CP? Or are they required to respect CP unless some operator explicitly breaks it? Wait, no. Because the SM itself allows for CP violation, SMEFT can include operators that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So point 3 is not necessarily a must.

Wait, but let me think again. When you write down operators in SMEFT, you have to respect the symmetries of the SM. The SM has CPT symmetry, so all operators must respect CPT as well. But CP isn't a symmetry of the SM, so operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So the SMEFT operators must respect CPT, but not necessarily CP. Therefore, option 4 is a must, but 3 is not.

So putting it all together, which of the given statements must be respected by all operators?

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes, because SM is Lorentz invariant, SMEFT must be too.

2. Poincare symmetry: Also yes, because as a larger symmetry group, and SM respects it.

Wait, wait, but SMEFT is an effective field theory, and EFTs sometimes have broken Lorentz symmetry? No, I don't think so. Effective theories still need to respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory because they are just different ways of describing the same physics at different scales. So Lorentz and Poincare should be maintained.

But what about the operators in SMEFT? For example, the operators are classified based on their Lorentz structure, implying that they must fit into the Lorentz-invariant framework.

So for the options, what do the choices say? The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

So the correct symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, because the question includes all four options as possible, but the choices don't include all four. Let me check the options.

Options:
A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

Wait, the question is which must be respected by all operators. Poincare includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. So if all operators must respect Lorentz, but do they also have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries.

Wait, the SMEFT is formulated as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz-invariant. Wait, but Poincare involves translations. Do the SMEFT operators respect translations? Well, I think that in the effective theory, Poincare symmetry is broken only by the presence of the scale Λ (the cutoff scale), but the operators themselves are built in a way that respects the symmetries of the underlying theory (the SM), which includes Poincare. Or perhaps the operators are required to be translationally invariant, which they are because they are part of the Lagrangian, which is a function of the fields and their derivatives, ensuring translation invariance.

Wait, perhaps all operators are built from terms that are local and translationally invariant. So perhaps both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are respected. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

But then, what about CPT (option 4)? Since the SM is CPT invariant, all SMEFT operators must also be CPT invariant. Because if any operator violated CPT, that would imply new physics beyond the SM, and SMEFT is supposed to capture all possible SM extensions in an effective way. So yes, all operators must respect CPT.

CP symmetry is not a must because the SM allows for CP violation, so operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So option 3 isn't a must.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. Looking at the options, that's option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about Poincare. Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So is it correct that all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry? Because the SM does, so the EFT must respect it.

But in the SMEFT, the interactions are written in a way that the theory is invariant under the Poincare group. So yes, both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected.

So the correct answer would include 1, 2, and 4, which is option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that organizes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM). The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT, as an effective theory of the SM, must preserve Lorentz symmetry. This means all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry and SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model is not exactly CP-symmetric due to phenomena like the CKM phase, which allows for CP violation. Therefore, SMEFT operators do not need to respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is already present in the SM.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model is CPT-symmetric, and SMEFT, being an effective theory of the SM, must respect CPT symmetry. Any operator in SMEFT that violates CPT symmetry would imply new physics beyond the SM, which is not the purpose of SMEFT.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not a requirement since the SM already allows for CP violation.

**Correct Answer**: C) 1,2,4
