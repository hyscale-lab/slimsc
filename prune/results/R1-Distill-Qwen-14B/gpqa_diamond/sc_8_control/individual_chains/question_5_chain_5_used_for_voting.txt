Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Hmm, wait, the operator P is along some direction n in the x-z plane. Since it's in the x-z plane, the direction n must have components in x and z but not y. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle, but since it's in the x-z plane, phi is zero or 180, but that's probably not important here. Wait, but the direction is arbitrary, just lies in x-z plane, so n can be any direction where y-component is zero.

But wait, the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P, which is along n. The operator P is given as the vector of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Oh wait, no, the operator is a vector operator, so P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But the operator we are considering is P along n, which would be P_n = n · P.

Oh, right, because when you have a vector operator, the component along a direction n is given by the dot product of n and the operator. So P_n = n · P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that, we're looking for the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but first, I should see what each P component is. Let me write down the given matrices.

The P_x matrix is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli x matrix.

Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is (ħ/2) σ_y.

P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], so (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the operator P_n is n_x (ħ/2 σ_x) + n_z (ħ/2 σ_z). That can be written as (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). Let me factor that.

Since σ_x and σ_z are Pauli matrices, their combination can be represented as a vector in the Bloch sphere. The direction of the operator is along n, so n_x and n_z define the direction in the x-z plane.

The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix combination like a σ_x + b σ_z are ± sqrt(a² + b²). But since we're scaling by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues are (ħ/2) times ± sqrt(a² + b²). Wait, in our case, a is n_x and b is n_z, so sqrt(n_x² + n_z²) is sqrt(|n|^2) since n is a unit vector. So sqrt part is 1. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. That makes sense because the operator is for spin-1/2, so the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2.

Now, to find the eigenvector corresponding to +ħ/2.

Let me denote the eigenvector as |ψ> = [ψ_1; ψ_2]. The operator equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Wait, no: the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

But let me write P_n as (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) = (ħ/2) (n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

So P_n matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

So the equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [ψ_1; ψ_2] = (ħ/2) [ψ_1; ψ_2]

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the factor:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [ψ_1; ψ_2] = [ψ_1; ψ_2]

So the matrix equation becomes:

n_z ψ_1 + n_x ψ_2 = ψ_1

n_x ψ_1 -n_z ψ_2 = ψ_2

Let me rearrange the first equation:

(n_z - 1) ψ_1 + n_x ψ_2 = 0

The second equation:

n_x ψ_1 + (-n_z -1) ψ_2 = 0

So now, we have two equations:

1) (n_z -1) ψ_1 + n_x ψ_2 = 0

2) n_x ψ_1 + (-n_z -1) ψ_2 = 0

We can write this as a system of linear equations. Since non-trivial solutions exist, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. But perhaps it's easier to express one equation in terms of the other.

From equation 1:

ψ_2 = [ (1 - n_z) ψ_1 ] / n_x   [assuming n_x ≠ 0]

Substitute into equation 2:

n_x ψ_1 + (-n_z -1) [ (1 - n_z) ψ_1 / n_x ] = 0

Multiply both sides by n_x to eliminate denominator:

n_x² ψ_1 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) ψ_1 = 0

Factor ψ_1:

ψ_1 [n_x² + ( -n_z -1 )(1 - n_z) ] =0

Since ψ_1 can't be zero (trivial solution), the term in brackets must be zero.

Compute the term inside:

n_x² + (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z) 

Let me expand (-n_z -1)(1 -n_z):

= (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)
= -n_z + n_z^2 -1 + n_z
Simplify:
-n_z + n_z = 0, so
= n_z^2 -1

So the term becomes n_x^2 + (n_z^2 -1) = 0

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1 since n is a unit vector (since it's a direction vector). So 1 -1=0. So the term is zero. So this holds, which is consistent.

Therefore, the ratio ψ_2 = (1 -n_z) /n_x * ψ_1 holds.

So the eigenvector can be written as ψ_1 [1; (1 -n_z)/n_x ]

But we can choose ψ_1 to be any non-zero value, so let's set ψ_1 = 1.

Then ψ_2 = (1 -n_z)/n_x.

So the eigenvector is [1; (1 -n_z)/n_x ]

Wait, but n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z). So n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Let me think about this. Let me parameterize n. Since it's in x-z plane, θ is the angle from z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So (1 - n_z ) /n_x = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ.

Hmm, using trigonometric identities, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) ] = tan(theta/2).

So the ratio ψ_2 / ψ_1 = tan(theta/2).

Thus, the eigenvector is [1; tan(theta/2)].

But wait, this is only when n_x is not zero. If n_x is zero, then theta is 0 or pi, but in that case, the direction is along z. Let's check that case.

If n_x =0, then n_z=±1.

Wait, no, if n_x is zero, then n is purely along z. So P_n would be P_z, which is diagonal.

So for n along +z, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is in the top state, |+z> = [1; 0], and for -z, it's the bottom state. So in the case where n_x=0, the eigenvector is [1; 0] for +ħ/2.

But in the general case, when n_x is not zero, the eigenvector is [1; tan(theta/2)].

But we need to normalize the eigenvector. The eigenvector is [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ]^T, which is [1, tan(theta/2)]^T.

The normalization condition is |1|^2 + |(1-n_z)/n_x |^2 = 1.

Let me compute that. Let me express in terms of theta.

n_x = sinθ, n_z= cosθ.

So (1 - cosθ)/sinθ = tan(theta/2), as before.

So the components are [1, tan(theta/2)].

The norm squared is 1^2 + [ tan(theta/2) ]^2 = 1 + tan^2(theta/2) = sec^2(theta/2) = 1/(cos^2(theta/2)).

So to normalize, we multiply by cos(theta/2).

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Because:

cos(theta/2) * [1; tan(theta/2)] = [cos(theta/2); sin(theta/2)].

Because [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] has a norm of sqrt( cos^2 + sin^2 ) =1.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but theta is the polar angle from the z-axis, so (theta/2) is half that angle.

Looking at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D introduces factors with sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which I don't see in my calculation. Option B is in terms of theta and phi, but since n is in the x-z plane, phi is 0, so e^{i phi} is 1. So option B would reduce to (cos theta, sin theta), but that's not matching. Wait, no, in option B, it's (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Since phi is zero, it becomes (cos theta, sin theta), which is a vector in the x-z plane, but wait, no, because in the original problem, we're talking about the state vectors in the spin space, not the direction in the physical space. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The eigenvector in spin space. So the components are spin-up in the direction n, which is along x-z.

Wait, in our calculation, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C says exactly that: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait, some of the options have factors of ħ. Wait, looking back at the question, it says "the elements of the normalized eigenvector". So the eigenvector is a vector in a 2D Hilbert space, whose components are complex numbers (possibly). So the options have elements like √(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), etc. Wait, but in our calculation, the components don't have any factors of ħ. Because the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Let me double-check.

Wait, in our calculation, the eigenvector ended up as [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the components are pure numbers, not involving ħ.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So this matches. So the answer should be option C.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, in the process, I set psi_1 =1, but then normalized.

Wait, perhaps the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)], but since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so it's [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So option C is correct.

Wait, but the other options have √(2/3) and √(1/3) factors. How?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, but when we form the operator P_n, it's a spin-1/2 operator along that direction. The eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along n.

In the standard case, the eigenvectors are given by [cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)] for spin-up, where theta is the polar angle and phi is the azimuthal angle.

But in our case, n lies in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. So the spin-up state is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Which matches option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$, respectively. The eigenvector must satisfy the eigenvalue equation $P_n |\psi\rangle = (+\hbar/2) |\psi\rangle$, where $P_n = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{P}$.

### Key Steps:
1. **Operator Along an Arbitrary Direction**:  
   Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis. The operator $P_n$ is then given by:
   \[
   P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z \right),
   \]
   where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$.

2. **Eigenvalue Equation**:  
   Substituting $P_n$ into the eigenvalue equation, we solve for the eigenvector $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_1 \\ \psi_2 \end{bmatrix}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. This leads to the system of equations:
   \[
   \left( n_z - 1 \right) \psi_1 + n_x \psi_2 = 0, \quad n_x \psi_1 + \left( -n_z - 1 \right) \psi_2 = 0.
   \]
   Solving these equations, the ratio of the components is found to be:
   \[
   \frac{\psi_2}{\psi_1} = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
   \]

3. **Normalization**:  
   The eigenvector is proportional to $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}$. To normalize it, we multiply by $\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, yielding the normalized eigenvector:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes factors of $\hbar$, which are not relevant for normalized eigenvectors in quantum mechanics.  
   - **Option B**: Involves $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$, which describe the direction vector $\vec{n}$ in space, not the spin state.  
   - **Option C**: Matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}$.  
   - **Option D**: Introduces additional factors of $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the solution.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**: $\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}$.
