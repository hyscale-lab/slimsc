Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. 

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to think about the structure of the target molecule. The name is a bit complex. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That means there’s a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Then, at the 1-position, there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, let me visualize this. The cyclohexane ring (let's say it's ring A) has a CH2 group attached. This CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane ring (ring B) and also has an -OH group. And on ring A, there's an aldehyde group attached.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (C≡C-) attached. Ethynylcyclohexane is like a cyclohexane ring with a triple bond to a carbon that's probably at the end (maybe a terminal alkyne).

I need to convert ethynylcyclohexane into the target molecule. Let's think about the steps involved. 

The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a methylene (CH2) group, which also has an -OH. So, perhaps we're adding a substituent to the ethynyl group. 

First, maybe the triple bond needs to undergo some kind of addition. Let me think about common reactions of terminal alkynes. One common reaction is the hydration of a terminal alkyne to form a ketone. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane, when hydrated, would form cyclohexanecyclohexanone? Or maybe a propargyl alcohol? No, wait, hydration of a terminal alkyne (ethynyl group) would typically give a ketone. For example, H2O and HgSO4 would add to the triple bond to form a ketone. So ethynylcyclohexane + H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O would become cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? Wait, no. Wait, the alkyne is at the end, so the triple bond is R-C≡CH. Hydration would give R-CO-CH2-OH? No, wait, no, that's more like if it's an internal alkyne. Wait, no, for a terminal alkyne like HC≡C-R, hydration would give R-CO-CH2-OH? Or maybe R-C(OH)-CH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

Terminal alkynes (like R-C≡CH) upon acid-catalyzed hydration (like with H2SO4 and HgSO4) typically form ketones. So, R-C≡CH + H2SO4/HgSO4/H2O → R-C(OH)CH3? Wait, no. No, when you add water across a triple bond, you get a carbonyl. For a triple bond, R-C≡CH would become R-C(OH)CH3? Or wait, I think I'm mixing up. The hydration of a terminal alkyne (like HC≡C-R) in acidic conditions gives R-C(OH)CH2-OH? No, wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. Hydration of an alkyne: for a terminal alkyne like HC≡C-R, adding water would give R-C(OH)CH2-OH? No, perhaps I should just think about the product. Oh wait, no. Hydration of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would form cyclohexanecarbonyl group. Wait, I think when H2O adds to a triple bond, it can give either an aldehyde or ketone, depending on the conditions. Oh, right. For a terminal alkyne, HgSO4 and H2SO4 and H2O would give a ketone, but wait, in that case, the product would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? No, because the triple bond is at the end. Wait, no. Let me think. The structure is cyclohexane with a C≡C-H group. Hydration would add an OH to each carbon. So, the triple bond C≡C-H becomes C-OH and CH2-OH? No, wait. Wait, when a triple bond is between two carbons, R-C≡C-R', upon hydration, it becomes R-C(OH)-C(OH)-R'. But that's for internal alkynes. For a terminal alkyne, R-C≡CH, the hydration would add water across the triple bond to form R-C(OH)-CH2-OH? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, for a terminal alkyne, the addition would form a ketone. Because adding H and OH across the triple bond. So, R-C≡CH + H2O → R-C(O)-CH3? No, wait, because with HgSO4, it's a mercury-catalyzed hydration which tends to produce ketones from terminal alkynes. So, in this case, the ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexanecarbonyl group attached to a methyl group? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think with actual structures. 

Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexyl-C≡CH. When I hydrate that, adding H and OH across the triple bond, the product would be cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that's an alcohol. Wait, no. Wait, no, HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O (acidic conditions) typically cause hydration of terminal alkynes to form ketones. So, R-C≡CH → R-C(O)-CH3? No, that can't be right because that would be a ketone. Wait, but wait, if R is cyclohexyl, then the product would be cyclohexyl-C(O)-CH3, which is cyclohexylacetone? But the target molecule doesn't have a ketone; it has an aldehyde and some other groups.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the target molecule again. It's an aldehyde on a cyclohexane ring. So maybe we need to form that aldehyde group. One way to get an aldehyde from an alkyne is through oxidation. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a relatively simple structure. Another thought: perhaps we're adding substituents to the triple bond, then functionalizing it.

Looking at the options, each has a series of reagents. Let's see what each reagent does.

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride. Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is CH3Cl; perhaps an alkylation?

Wait, NaNH2 and CH3Cl: could that be an alkylation, like a Grignard-like reaction? But wait, NaNH2 is used for deprotonating things like terminal alkynes to form acetylides. So, step 1: deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane to form a cyclohexylacetylide. Then, methyl chloride would alkylate it. So, cyclohexylacetylide + CH3Cl → cyclohexyl-CH2Cl? No, wait, no. The acetylide is a strong base; alkylating would add a methyl group to the acetylide's carbon. So, the triple bond becomes CH2Cl after alkylation. Then, after step 1, maybe the product is cyclohexyl-CH2Cl.

Wait, but then step 2 is H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation, so it would reduce the triple bond (if any) to a single bond. But wait, after alkylation, the triple bond was converted to a single bond? No, wait: in step 1, we started with ethynylcyclohexane. Deprotonation gives an acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride to add a methyl group. Wait, the acetylide is a strong base, so when you treat it with CH3Cl, it would add the methyl group to the acetylide carbon, so you get cyclohexyl-CH2-Cl. But wait, the triple bond would have been converted to a single bond upon alkylation. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is adding a methyl group to the ring. Not sure. Let me move to another option.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So again, deprotonate the alkyne to form acetylide, then react with ethyl chloride. So, adding an ethyl group to the acetylide carbon. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination, or perhaps for deprotonating something else. Then step 3 and 4: ozonolysis followed by NH4OH. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So, perhaps after step 2, there's a double bond formed.

Wait, let me think. Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexylacetylide. Alkylation with ethyl chloride gives cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2Cl? No, wait, the acetylide is at the end, so adding ethyl would make it CH2CH2Cl? Not sure. Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3, which is a method for deprotonating to form a strong base, maybe for elimination. So, perhaps the ethyl chloride adds to the acetylide, making a longer chain, and then elimination occurs to form a triple bond again? Not quite. Or maybe it's a Birch reduction? No, Birch is for aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by some reaction.

Wait, maybe step 1: create an acetylide, then alkylate to get a longer chain. Then step 2: possibly a coupling reaction? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation to form a strong base which could eliminate. Not sure. Then ozonolysis would break a double bond into two carbonyls. So perhaps the Li/NH3 step creates a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the process is: alkyne → acetylide → alkylated → then treated with Li/NH3 to form a metal-organic compound, which upon workup forms the cyclohexane ring with another substituent.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the target molecule. It has a cyclohexane ring (ring A) with an aldehyde group and a CH2 group attached. That CH2 is connected to a cyclohexane ring (ring B) and an -OH group.

So, the structure is: ring A has a CH2 group attached, which is connected to ring B and an -OH. And ring A also has an aldehyde group.

So, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is ring A with a triple bond. Then, we need to add a substituent that, upon certain reactions, would form that CH2 group connected to ring B and an -OH.

Wait, perhaps the process involves adding a substituent to the ethynyl group. So, let's say we alkylate the acetylide to form a longer chain. Then reduce the triple bond to a single bond, add an oxygen-containing group, etc.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a CH2-OH and a CH2-cyclohexyl group. So, that's a gem-diol? No, wait, it's a CH2 with two substituents: OH and cyclohexyl.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group with substituents.

Another plan: the ethynylcyclohexane is ring A with a triple bond. If we add a methylene group (CH2) to that, perhaps via alkylation, then reduce the triple bond to a single bond, and then introduce an -OH group.

Wait, but let's think step by step.

1. Start with ethynylcyclohexane (ring A-C≡C-H).

2. First reagent: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. NaNH2 is a strong base; in the presence of an alkyne, it deprotonates the acidic terminal hydrogen to form an acetylide. So, ethynylcyclohexane → cyclohexylacetylide (ring A-C≡C^- + NH2^-). Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide carbon, giving cyclohexyl-CH2Cl (ring A-CH2Cl). But wait, the triple bond would be gone, replaced by a single bond with Cl. So, the product after step 1 would be cyclohexyl-CH2Cl.

3. Step 2: H2/Pd. That's hydrogenation, so it would reduce any triple bonds, but in this case, after step 1, the triple bond is already gone. So, maybe hydrogenation is used for something else. Or maybe the Cl is a leaving group, and H2/Pd could facilitate some substitution?

Wait, H2 with Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds, but if there's a Cl on a carbon adjacent to a ring, perhaps hydrogenation isn't the next step. Alternatively, maybe the Cl is replaced by H in some way.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2Cl. Then, H2/Pd would perhaps reduce anything, but with CH2Cl, that's not reducible. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe step 1 is different. Let's think about the reagents in the options.

Looking at option D: step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, methanol is CH3OH. Deprotonating ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide, then reacting with methanol would give cyclohexyl-CH2-OH. But wait, that would be an alkylation with an -OCH3 group? Or perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. If the acetylide (strong base) reacts with methanol, which is a good nucleophile, maybe it's a substitution. But wait, CH3Cl is an alkylating agent, while methanol is an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide could attack the methanol, leading to the formation of a longer chain. Wait, but acetylide is a strong base; perhaps it would deprotonate methanol, but that might not form anything. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the acetylide attacks the methyl group in CH3Cl. But in option D, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol, which might lead to the acetylide reacting with methanol. Hmm, perhaps that's a possibility. So, after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-CH2-OH.

Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strongly basic condition. Li in NH3 is used for deprotonation and elimination, perhaps forming a carbene or a birch reduction. Alternatively, it could be for coupling reactions, like the Gilman reagent. Wait, but after step 1, we have cyclohexyl-CH2-OH. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is adding a methyl group to the ethynyl, then step 2 is a hydrogenation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then further functionalized.

Let me think about each option's steps:

Option A: first NaNH2 and methyl chloride. Then H2/Pd, then Ba(OH)2, then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used for elimination reactions, perhaps for forming double bonds. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are for hydration, as discussed before.

Another thought: maybe the steps are alkylation, hydrogenation, elimination, and then hydration.

Wait, step 1: alkylation of the acetylide gives a longer chain. Step 2: hydrogenation reduces any triple bonds to single bonds. Step 3: Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination, forming a double bond. Then step 4: hydration of the double bond.

But I'm not sure.

Option C: step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So same as option A. Step 2: H2/Pd with calcium carbonate. Not sure what that does. Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. Then step 4: Ba(OH)2.

Wait, if O3 is used, then maybe there's a double bond somewhere that gets cleaved.

So, perhaps the steps are: alkylation, hydrogenation, then oxidation to form a double bond, then ozonolysis to break it into carbonyls.

Wait, let me try to imagine a possible pathway.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane:

1. Deprotonate with NaNH2 to form the acetylide.

2. Alkylation with methyl chloride: so the acetylide (ring A-C≡C^-) reacts with CH3Cl to give ring A-CH2Cl.

Wait, but then the triple bond is gone, replaced by a CH2Cl group.

3. Step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: that would hydrogenate any triple bonds, but in this case, the triple bond is already gone. So maybe hydrogenation isn't necessary here. Unless the CH2Cl is being reduced. But I don't think H2/Pd would reduce Cl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Another approach: Perhaps the first step is to add a substituent via alkyne alkylation, then introduce a double bond, then ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe the initial steps are: make an alkyne into an alkyne with substituents, then hydrogenate to a cis or trans double bond, then ozonolyze to form aldehydes.

Wait, but the target molecule has a ring with a CH2 group attached to another ring and an -OH.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is:

1. Alkylate the ethynyl group to add a substituent.

2. Reduce the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond.

3. Ozonolyze the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. Work up to form the aldehyde.

But I need to think how that would fit into the target structure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group with substituents. So, via alkylation, the triple bond becomes a CH2 with some substituent, then through oxidation or other steps, the substituent is modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is:

- Convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) via hydration.

- Then reduce it to an alcohol.

- Then perform some kind of oxidation or functionalization to get the substituent.

But I'm not sure.

Looking at the target molecule again: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

The substituent is a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexyl ring and an -OH. So, that's a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the cyclohexane ring which also has an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the process involves:

1. Adding a substituent (like a CH2Cl) to the ethynyl group.

2. Reducing the triple bond would give a CH2Cl group attached to the cyclohexane.

3. Then, introduce an -OH group on that CH2, perhaps via hydrolysis or another reaction.

Wait, but how can we get the OH on the CH2 group?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl is transformed into a carbonyl group, then further functionalized.

Wait, let me think about each option's steps and see which sequence makes sense.

Option D: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li in liquid NH3.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to make acetylide, then react with methanol. If the acetylide reacts with methanol, perhaps it would form a longer chain. But acetylide is a strong base; it might deprotonate methanol, but I'm not sure if that would create a new product. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but methanol isn't an alkylating agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but with NaNH2 and methanol, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form cyclohexyl-CH2-OCH3. That is, attaching an OCH3 group to the acetylide carbon.

Then step 2: Li in liq NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for deprotonating something. Maybe it's used to eliminate, forming a triple bond again. But if we have OCH3 attached, perhaps elimination would form a double bond or another triple bond.

Wait, if after step 1, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-OCH3, then treating with Li in NH3 might deprotonate where? Maybe it abstracts a proton from the CH2-OCH3, leading to an alkoxide, which could eliminate to form a double bond, but that's a stretch.

Then step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it. But I'm not seeing how that leads to the target molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the possible transformations.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde and a CH2 group attached, which in turn is connected to a cyclohexyl ring and an -OH.

So perhaps the synthesis involves:

- Adding a substituent to the ethynyl group to form a CH2 group.

- Introducing an -OH group on that CH2.

- Then, oxidizing a secondary alcohol to a ketone, but wait, the target has an aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a CH2 group with substituents, then oxidized to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but how to get the substituent on the CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a substituent (like a methyl group) via alkylation to form CH2Cl.

2. Hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to CH2Cl.

3. Then, introduce an -OH group via hydrolysis.

But I'm not sure.

Another thought: The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl group.

Wait, that might involve some kind of oxidation or addition.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

- Ethynylcyclohexane → Alkylation to add a substituent (like methyl) → then functionalize the substituent.

But I'm not getting closer. Maybe I should analyze each option step by step.

Looking at option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → forms methyl-substituted acetylide, giving cyclohexyl-CH2Cl.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenation, but triple bond is gone, so maybe reducing Cl? Doesn't seem right.

3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, could cause elimination. If there's a Cl on CH2, Ba(OH)2 might deprotonate and eliminate Cl as HCl, forming a double bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2Cl → cyclohexyl-CH2- → which would form a double bond if elimination occurs. Wait, but the structure after step 2 is cyclohexyl-CH2Cl. Ba(OH)2 would deprotonate the CH2Cl (but CH2Cl isn't acidic enough), but perhaps in a different way.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. It's an aldehyde on a cyclohexane ring, and the substituent is a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexyl and an OH. So, perhaps the ethynyl is converted into a CH2 group with substituents.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add methyl group via alkylation → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2Cl (I might be wrong here).

Wait, no, if we add methyl to the acetylide, it becomes CH2-Me group. Then, perhaps reduce the triple bond to a CH2 group.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation to form a longer chain.

2. Hydrogenation to make a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break a double bond into aldehyde groups.

4. Workup to form the final product.

Looking at option C:

Steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-CH2Cl.

2. H2/Pd with CaCO3 → reduces any triple bonds, but in this case, after step 1, the triple bond is replaced with CH2Cl.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → cleaves double bonds, but where would the double bond come from? Maybe after step 2, a double bond is formed. Wait, no, step 2 is hydrogenation, which would add H and reduce any triple bond. So, maybe step 3 isn't applicable unless there's a double bond from another process.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the steps. Maybe after step 1, the molecule is CH2Cl attached to the ring. Then step 2, H2/Pd, maybe reduces the Cl, but I don't think H2/Pd reduces Cl. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a reduction of a triple bond, but it's already gone.

Another approach: Maybe the alkylation adds a methylene group (CH2) to the ethynyl, making it a longer chain, then the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, forming a longer chain. Then, ozonolysis would cleave a double bond formed somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

Step 1: Alkylation to add a group that becomes the hydroxymethyl group.

Step 2: Reduce the triple bond to a double bond.

Step 3: Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyls.

Step 4: Workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group (CH2-OH) attached to the cyclohexane, and another cyclohexyl group on the CH2.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is derived from the ethynyl, and the substituents are added via alkylation and then functionalized.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → acetylide with NaNH2.

2. Alkylation with a cyclohexyl group (but the options don't have that).

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding a substituent, then introducing an -OH group.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group that's connected to both a cyclohexyl and an -OH group. So, perhaps the CH2 group is a secondary alcohol attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the process is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkyne is functionalized to add a substituent.

2. The substituent is then oxidized to form a carbonyl.

3. Then, a reduction step forms the CH2-OH group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding a substituent, the molecule is reduced and then oxidized.

Wait, maybe the correct option is D.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li in liquid NH3.

3. O3 with (CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form acetylide, then react with methanol. Methanol has an -OH group. So perhaps the acetylide attacks the methanol, leading to cyclohexyl-CH2-OCH3.

Then, step 2: Li in NH3. Li is a strong base, maybe for deprotonating something. If we have OCH3 on the CH2, perhaps it's deprotonated, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a coupling reaction, like a Glaser coupling, but that's for acetylenes. Or perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but that's for rings.

Then, step 3: Ozonolysis. So, if after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing how that leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, we have a CH2-OCH3 group. Then, step 2 could eliminate to form a double bond, perhaps via deprotonation and elimination. So, CH2-OCH3 → CH2=CH2OCH3? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a nucleophilic substitution where the OCH3 leaves, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the Li in NH3 is for a different purpose, like opening an epoxide or something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the presence of Ba(OH)2 in some options. Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination reactions, like in the Cope elimination or for forming epoxides, but more commonly for elimination to form alkenes.

In option A, Ba(OH)2 is step 3. So, perhaps after step 2, which is H2/Pd, the molecule has a substituent that Ba(OH)2 can eliminate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to reduce the triple bond.

3. Elimination with Ba(OH)2 to form a double bond.

4. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyls.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the -OH is introduced via oxidation.

So, perhaps one of the steps involves introducing an -OH group. How? Maybe via hydrolysis of a leaving group.

Looking at option A's step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the hydration reagent for alkynes. So perhaps after that step, a triple bond is converted into a ketone. But if the triple bond is gone, then step 4 might not have anything to do.

Wait, another thought: After adding a substituent (like a methyl group) to the ethynyl, then reducing the triple bond to a single bond, perhaps introducing an -OH via some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to reduce triple bond to single bond.

3. Introduce an -OH via Ba(OH)2 (elimination) and then some addition.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to match the options to the possible steps.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, so one of the steps must form that aldehyde. How?

One way to form an aldehyde is through the oxidation of a primary alcohol. Alternatively, through the cleavage of a double bond via ozonolysis, which can produce carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis.

Looking at the options, options B, C, and D have ozonolysis steps.

Option B: step 3 is O3, H2O, then NH4OH.

Option C: step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S.

Option D: step 3 is O3 with (CH3)2S.

So, after ozonolysis, workup with something. (CH3)2S is a reductant used in the workup to prevent over-oxidation.

So, when ozonolysis is done, the double bond is cleaved to form carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the molecule before ozonolysis has a double bond which upon cleavage forms the aldehyde and another carbonyl.

But wait, the target has only one aldehyde. So, perhaps the starting molecule for ozonolysis has a double bond that, when cleaved, forms the aldehyde on the cyclohexane and another carbonyl elsewhere.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis is part of forming the aldehyde group.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Let's think about the target's substituent: a CH2 connected to a cyclohexyl and an -OH. So, perhaps that is formed via a substitution reaction, such as a Grignard or organometallic addition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the result of a hydroxylation reaction.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into an epoxide, but I don't think that's likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the process involves adding a hydroxyl group via some kind of epoxide ring opening, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into an aldehyde via oxidation. But ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡C-, which upon oxidation would form R-CO-OH (a carboxylic acid), but that doesn't match the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl, then further functionalized.

Wait, if the triple bond is hydrated to a ketone (using HgSO4 and H2SO4), then perhaps the ketone is reduced to a secondary alcohol, which then is oxidized to form another carbonyl.

But the target has an aldehyde, which is a primary carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is first reduced to a cis double bond, then subjected to ozonolysis to form two carbonyl groups.

If the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, reducing the triple bond to a cis double bond would give cyclohexene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups. But ethynylcyclohexane is a single ring with a triple bond, so upon reducing the triple bond to a double bond, it becomes a cyclohexene. Ozonolysis of cyclohexene would form two formyl groups (CHO) on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but that would produce something like two aldehyde groups on the cyclohexane ring, which doesn't match the target's structure.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of each option's steps.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexylacetylide, which reacts with methanol. Perhaps the acetylide attacks methyl from methanol, leading to cyclohexyl-CH2-OCH3.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3. This is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation. Maybe it's used to eliminate, forming a triple bond again. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-OCH3 → cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3. Then, perhaps something else happens.

Step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave the triple bond if present. But wait, ozonolysis is for double bonds, not triple bonds, I think. Alternatively, maybe the Li/NH3 step forms a double bond.

Wait, if after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it. But I'm not certain.

In any case, after ozonolysis, workup with NH4OH (which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps). So, if the ozonolysis breaks a double bond into carbonyl groups, then the aldehyde could be formed.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C:

Steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-CH2Cl.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → not sure. Maybe hydrogenation, but the triple bond is already gone.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S → if there's a double bond, this would break it into carbonyls.

4. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, perhaps for elimination.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is D: because after step 1, we have a CH2-OCH3 group, which is then deprotonated, leading to a triple bond, then ozonolysis breaks it into carbonyls.

But I'm not certain.

Another approach: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group that has a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So, that CH2 is a secondary alcohol attached to a cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps the steps involve forming that secondary alcohol.

How can that be achieved? Perhaps via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is replaced by a hydroxyl group.

But where would the leaving group come from?

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl is converted into a CH2Cl via alkylation, then hydrolyzed to CH2OH.

But that would give a primary alcohol, not a secondary.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2Cl is adjacent to a ring, and when hydrolyzed, becomes CH2OH attached to the ring.

Wait, but that would require the CH2Cl to be attached to the ring. So, ethynylcyclohexane is ring A-CH2Cl after alkylation.

Then, step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → which is the hydration reagent for alkynes. But after step 1, the alkyne is gone, replaced by CH2Cl.

So, perhaps in option A, step 4 would have no effect. So, the sequence would be:

1. Alkylation to CH2Cl.

2. Hydrogenation (no effect).

3. Ba(OH)2: strong base. Maybe deprotonate and eliminate Cl, forming a double bond.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4: hydration, but no triple bond.

Wait, maybe the Cl is eliminated, forming a double bond, which is then hydrated.

So, the steps would be:

1. Alkylation → CH2Cl.

2. H2/Pd: no effect.

3. Ba(OH)2: elimination of HCl, forming a double bond (CH2Cl → CH2 with adjacent H elimination → forms a double bond between ring and CH2 → ring-CH2-CH2 → becomes ring-CH2-CH2Cl → elimination to ring-CH2-CH2 → no, perhaps elimination forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure after step 1 is ring-CH2Cl. Then, Ba(OH)2 would deprotonate where? The Cl is on the CH2, but CH2Cl isn't very acidic. Maybe deprotonation isn't feasible. Alternatively, perhaps elimination to form a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, maybe the ethynylcyclohexane after alkylation becomes a longer chain, allowing for elimination.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

After thinking for a while, I think the correct sequence is option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: forms cyclohexyl-CH2-OCH3.

2. Li in liq NH3: perhaps deprotonates and eliminates to form a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

3. Ozonolysis: if there's a double bond, cleaves into carbonyls.

4. NH4OH: workup, perhaps to form aldehyde.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which likely comes from the cleavage of a double bond via ozonolysis. So the presence of ozonolysis (steps 3 in options B, C, D) is probably part of the correct sequence.

Looking at the options, option D's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S, which is a reductive workup to form aldehydes and ketones without over-oxidizing. Then, step 4 is NH4OH, which is aqueous workup.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is D.

But how does each step contribute?

1. NaNH2 and methanol: convert ethynylcyclohexane to cyclohexyl-CH2-OCH3.

2. Li in NH3: perhaps deprotonate and eliminate to form a triple bond or a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis: cleave the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: aqueous workup, perhaps protonating carbonyls.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the Li in NH3 is for a coupling reaction, like the formation of a cyclopropane or similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

Option C's steps:

1. Alkylation to CH2Cl.

2. Hydrogenation: no effect.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: but no double bond, so nothing happens.

4. Ba(OH)2: perhaps elimination.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Maybe the correct option is D because it includes ozonolysis, which is needed to form the aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: Which option's steps can form the hydroxymethyl group?

The hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) attached to the cyclohexane. Perhaps it's formed via hydrolysis of a leaving group, like Cl.

Looking at option A's steps:

Step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: which is the hydration reagent for alkynes. But after step 3 (Ba(OH)2), which is a base, perhaps it's used for elimination. So, if after step 3, there's a triple bond or a double bond, step 4 would hydrate it.

But I'm still not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the sequence in option D is:

1. Alkylation to form CH2-OCH3.

2. Li in NH3: perhaps deprotonate OCH3 and eliminate to form a carbene or something else.

3. Ozonolysis: not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not certain.

After all this thinking, I'll go with option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and a CH2 group attached, which is further connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl (-OH) group. The analysis of the options involves determining which sequence of reagents can achieve the desired transformations.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide carbon, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH2Cl.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond, but the triple bond is already gone after step 1, so this step may not have a significant effect.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base that could eliminate HCl from the CH2Cl group, forming a double bond.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Hydration of a triple bond or double bond to form a carbonyl group. However, after step 3, there is no triple bond left, so this step may not contribute meaningfully.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of the hydroxymethyl group or the aldehyde group in the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which reacts with ethyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide carbon, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH2CH2Cl.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base that could deprotonate or eliminate, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O3/ H2O**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Aqueous workup to neutralize and stabilize the carbonyl groups.

While ozonolysis could form carbonyl groups, this sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxymethyl group or the aldehyde group in the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which reacts with methyl chloride to alkylate the acetylide carbon, resulting in cyclohexyl-CH2Cl.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenation reduces the triple bond to a single bond, but the triple bond is already gone after step 1, so this step may not have a significant effect.
3. **O3/ (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups, with (CH3)2S as a reductant to prevent over-oxidation. However, there is no clear double bond formed in the molecule after step 2.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base that could eliminate, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the formation of the hydroxymethyl group or the aldehyde group.

This sequence does not provide a clear pathway to the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Deprotonates the ethynyl group to form an acetylide, which reacts with methanol to form cyclohexyl-CH2-OCH3.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base that could deprotonate or eliminate, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O3/ (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups, with (CH3)2S as a reductant to prevent over-oxidation.
4. **NH4OH**: Aqueous workup to neutralize and stabilize the carbonyl groups.

This sequence provides a plausible pathway to form the aldehyde group via ozonolysis and the hydroxymethyl group through earlier steps. The use of methanol in step 1 could introduce the hydroxyl group, and ozonolysis in step 3 could form the aldehyde group.

### Conclusion:
Option D is the most consistent with the transformations needed to synthesize the target molecule, as it includes steps that can introduce the hydroxymethyl group and the aldehyde group.
