Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(parallax)^5, or N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are A to D, each with a different power of r.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on how parallax relates to distance. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Like, parallax plx = 1/distance (but I think in parsecs or something; the exact unit might not matter here). So plx is 1/r, where r is the distance. So plx = 1/r, which implies that r = 1/plx.

Wait, but the formula given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx in terms of r. Since plx = 1/r, then plx^5 would be (1/r)^5, which is 1/r^5. So 1/(plx^5) would be r^5/(1^5) = r^5. Because 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If plx = 1/r, then plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. So 1/(plx^5) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5? Wait, but that can't be right because the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh wait, because N is the number in a specific region, but how does the number per unit distance change?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the total number with the density. Let me see. The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, but that's for a region. So perhaps the number per unit volume is involved. Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of how N depends on r.

Wait, let me think in terms of variables. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance r. So plx = k / r, where k is some constant (like 1 parsec or whatever). So plx = k/r.

Given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx in terms of r gives N ∝ (r/k)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So that suggests that as r increases, the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because stars should get less dense as you go further away. Wait, but the question says the number varies with parallax in that way. Maybe it's a specific region, so perhaps it's not the number density but the total number in a region?

Wait, let's think about it. If the number of stars in a region is given as N = C / (plx)^5, then if I express this in terms of r, since plx = 1/(r), N = C * r^5. So N increases with r^5. But wait, that would mean that as you look further away (larger r), you're seeing more stars? That doesn't align with what I know about the distribution of stars. But perhaps this is a hypothetical situation, and the question is about the mathematical relationship, regardless of real-world expectations.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is about the number per unit distance, so the density along the line of sight. Let's think in terms of per unit distance.

Wait, if N is the number of stars in a unit volume or per unit distance. Wait, no. Let me think of the relation. Let me model this as N = C * (1/plx^5). But plx is 1/r, so N = C * r^5.

But that's the total number of stars in the region. So when r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. That seems odd because in reality, you might expect the number to decrease because stars are more spread out, but perhaps this is a special case.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, maybe it's the density. So the number of stars per unit volume, or per unit distance?

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r would be proportional to r^5. Because for a thin shell (a spherical volume), the number of stars might depend on r squared (surface area) times thickness. Wait, but I'm getting a bit off track.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of stars in a small range of distance dr. Let's say we consider a small volume element at distance r, with thickness dr. The number of stars in that volume element would be proportional to the cross-sectional area (π r²) times the thickness dr, multiplied by the number density (stars per volume). But I'm not sure that's the right approach here.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the question is about the number of stars per unit distance, so the number per unit r. So dN/dr would be the derivative of N with respect to r. Since N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be 5 r^4. So the rate at which the number of stars increases with r is proportional to r^4.

But looking back at the options, option B is r^5, option C is r^4. Hmm. Wait, the question says, how does the number of stars in that region change with distance per unit range of distance, r? So perhaps it's the change in the number per unit distance, which would be the derivative dN/dr.

Wait, no, the question's wording is a bit unclear. Let me read it again: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit range, which is dr. So perhaps it's the rate of change of N with r, which is dN/dr.

So if N = C r^5, then dN/dr = 5 C r^4. So the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance. So the correct option would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the number N is proportional to r^5, which would mean that the rate of change of N with r is r^4. So that would make option C the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about this again. The initial statement is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5). Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But the question is asking about how the number changes with distance per unit range, which is the derivative of N with respect to r.

So dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the change in N per unit change in r is proportional to r^4. So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Alternatively, maybe the question is not about the derivative but about the number of stars per unit distance. Wait, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume depends on r^5. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would be N(r) * (dV/dr), where dV is the volume element. But wait, perhaps it's better to model it in terms of a volume. In a region of the sky, the volume at distance r with thickness dr is roughly the area (constant for a given region) times dr. So the number of stars in that volume element would be proportional to (number per unit volume) * (A * dr).

But perhaps the number per unit volume depends on r. Let me think again.

Wait, given that N is the number of stars in some region, and that N = C / (plx^5) = C r^5. So N increases with r^5. So if you go further away, you have more stars. That seems odd, but it's given.

So if you go from r to r+dr, the change in N is dN = 5 C r^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is 5 C r^4. So per unit change in r, the number of stars added is proportional to r^4.

So the correct option is C, which is ~ r^4.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \) into the given relationship, we find \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), taking the derivative gives \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). Therefore, the rate at which the number of stars changes with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Among the options provided:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the change is proportional to \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect, as \( r^5 \) describes the total number of stars, not the change per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct, as the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the change is not proportional to \( r^2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the number of stars per unit range of distance changes with \( r^4 \).
