Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, right. In quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. So first, I should figure out the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian.

In natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density has to be 4 because the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So let's break down the Lagrangian term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, I'll recall the mass dimensions of the fields involved. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4 dimensions, the action is ∫d^4x L, so each term must have [L] = 4.

Wait, the fields:
- For a scalar field φ, [φ] = 1 (since L would be (∂φ)^2, which is (mass^1)^2 = mass^2, and φ^2 gives [L] = 2 + 1*2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, scalar fields in Lagrangian terms: (∂μ φ)^2 has dimension (mass^1)^2 * [φ]^2. Because ∂μ has mass dimension 1, so (∂μ φ)^2 is (1 + [φ])^2. So for the term (∂μ φ)^2 to have mass dimension 4 (since the Lagrangian has to be mass dimension 4), then (1 + [φ])^2 =4 → 1 + [φ]=2 → [φ]=1.

But Dirac spinor fields ψ have different dimensions. The term in the Lagrangian is i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The dimension of ∂_μ is 1, and ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2. So the term is [ψ̄][ψ][∂_μ] = (3/2) * (3/2) * 1 = 9/4, but wait, that can't be right because the whole term must be dimension 4.

Wait, no, let me think again. The term is ψ̄ ∂μ ψ, which would have dimensions: [ψ̄] = 3/2, [∂μ] = 1, [ψ] = 3/2. So 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 4. Yes, that adds up to 4. So that's correct. So each ψ has dimension 3/2.

Now, looking at the term in the question: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ̄ and ψ contributes 3/2 each, so together they give 3.

What about σ_{μν}? σ is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (since they're just matrices, no mass dimension). So [σ_{mu nu}] = [γ_mu, gamma_nu] = same as gamma, since commutator doesn't add dimension. So σ is dimensionless.

Then F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field or something similar. For electromagnetism, F is built from the fields, which are like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each A has dimension 1 (since [∂μ] is 1, and A is the gauge field which is a vector potential, so [A] =1). Then F is [∂μ Aν] which is (1 + 1) = 2.

So F^{mu nu} has mass dimension 2. So putting it all together:

The term is κ * [ψ̄ σ ψ] * [F].

Each ψ and ψ̄ are 3/2 each, so together 3. F is 2.

So the entire term without κ is [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2? Wait, wait no, wait. Wait, the product of the fields is ψ̄ σ ψ F. Wait, no, σ is dimensionless, right? So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ has 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then F is 2, so the product is 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, hold on. Let me think again.

The term is κ [ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ] [F^{mu nu}].

Each part's dimensions:

[ψ̄] =3/2; [σ_{mu nu}] =0; [ψ]=3/2. So [ψ̄ σ ψ] = 3/2 + 3/2 =3.

[F^{mu nu}] is made from ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So [F] = [∂μ] [Aν] = 1 *1 =1. Wait, no, [F] is a tensor, each component is [∂μ Aν], which is [∂][A] =1 *1=1. So each component is dimension 1. But F is antisymmetric, so F^{mu nu} has dimension 2? Because F is like (∂A - ∂A), so each F_{μν} ~ ∂μ Aν, which is [∂][A] → [A] is 1, so [F] = 1. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the field strength tensor F_{μν} has dimensions. Let me think, Maxwell's Lagrangian is F_{μν} F^{μν}, which must have dimension 4. So F^2 must have dimension 4, so F has dimension 2. Because F_{μν} F^{μν} is (F)^2 → 2* [F] =4 → [F]=2. Oh right, that's correct. So [F^{μν}]=2.

So ψ̄ σ ψ is dimension 3, F is 2. So the product without κ is 3+2=5. The entire term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so [κ] must be [4 -5] = -1.

So [κ]_M =-1.

Now, the next part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. For a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have positive mass dimension (I think). Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the condition is that the coupling dimension must be ≥ 0, but wait, not necessarily. Let me think.

In 4 dimensions, the mass dimension d of the coupling in a term L ~ g φ^n must satisfy d = 4 - [φ]^m, where m is the number of fields in that term. Wait, or more accurately, the term g φ^m must have mass dimension 4, so d = 4 - m [φ]. So for a renormalizable theory, d must be ≥0.

In our case, our term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's think about the term as κ (ψ̄ σ ψ) F. Wait, but in terms of the coupling, it's a term involving the product of four fermion fields? Or perhaps it's considered as a four-fermion interaction? Wait, no, because the term is ψ̄ ψ F. Wait, F is a field (like A's derivative), but in this case, F is part of the Maxwell term. Hmm, perhaps this is a higher-order term.

Wait, but the term is a three-dimensional operator? Wait, no, the term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4.

Wait, but let me think in terms of the dimensionality of the operator. The operator is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. How many fields are in this operator? ψ̄ is one, ψ is another, and F is another. So three fields? Or is F itself a derivative of a field?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the term as part of the interaction Lagrangian. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian can be renormalizable only if the dimension of the coupling constant is ≥0. Because in the Feynman diagrams, the coupling appears as vertices, and higher dimension couplings would lead to more divergences that can't be absorbed.

Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling is given by [κ] = 4 - (sum of field dimensions in the term). Or wait, [L] =4, so [κ] =4 - (sum [fields]).

Wait, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Each ψ is 3/2, so two ψs give 3, and F is 2. So the sum is 3 + 2 =5. So [κ] =4-5= -1.

So [κ]=-1.

In 4 dimensions, for a coupling constant g to be renormalizable, [g] must be ≥0. Because a dimensionful coupling would mean that the interaction is nonrenormalizable. Because when you have a coupling with negative mass dimension, you can't have a renormalizable theory — because the beta function would have terms that require higher-order terms, and you can't absorb the divergences with a finite number of counterterms.

So if [κ] is -1, which is negative, the theory is nonrenormalizable.

Wait, but wait: the standard example is the Fermi theory of weak interactions, which is four-fermion interaction, which has a coupling with negative mass dimension, making it nonrenormalizable. So yeah, that's the case.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1. Renormalizable. No, because [κ]=-1 implies nonren.

Option C: [κ]=-1. Not renormalizable. Yes.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, which is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor, being a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, is dimensionless: $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension $4$ in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes as follows:
- $[\bar{\psi}] = [\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$, so $[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The total dimension of the term without $\kappa$ is $3 + 2 = 5$.
- To ensure the Lagrangian has dimension $4$, $\kappa$ must satisfy:
  \[
  [\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
  \]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies that the theory is **not renormalizable**. Such terms typically lead to higher-order divergences that cannot be absorbed by a finite number of counterterms.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa] = -1$. The theory is renormalizable. (Incorrect, as $[\kappa] = -1$ implies nonrenormalizability.)
- **Option B**: $[\kappa] = 1$. The theory is renormalizable. (Incorrect, as $[\kappa]$ is not 1.)
- **Option C**: $[\kappa] = -1$. The theory is not renormalizable. (Correct, as $[\kappa] = -1$ and the theory is nonrenormalizable.)
- **Option D**: $[\kappa] = 1$. The theory is not renormalizable. (Incorrect, as $[\kappa]$ is not 1.)

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.

**Answer: C**
