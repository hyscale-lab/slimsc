Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the boson X and its possible decay channels. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if certain conditions are met.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation, but I think it's saying that the boson X interacts with fermions. The interaction term probably involves the fermion fields and X. The mass term for X is 6 GeV, so that's the key here.

So, the question is about kinematically allowed decays. Kinematically allowed means that the energy and momentum allow the decay. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the center-of-mass energy must be at least twice the rest mass of the fermion. Because X is a boson, its decay products can be any fermion pair as long as their combined mass is less than X's mass.

Wait, but X's mass is 6 GeV. So, the fermions it can decay into must have a mass such that 2m_fermion <= 6 GeV. Because each fermion and antifermion must have at least their rest mass, right?

Let me list the known fermion masses. The top quark is the heaviest, but it's like around 173 GeV, so way more than 6 GeV. So top quarks are out of the question. The next is the bottom quark, which is about 4.5 GeV. So 2 times that is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So bottom quarks can't be produced either because 2*4.5=9>6. So which quarks are lighter?

The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3, which is less than 6. So that's possible. Similarly, strange quarks are about 100 MeV, up and down quarks are even lighter, maybe 2-5 MeV. Electrons are about 0.5 MeV, muons about 100 MeV, taus are around 1.77 GeV. So 2*tau is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6. 

So which fermions can X decay into? Let's see:

- Electron (e) and positron: mass negligible, so 2m_e <<6 GeV. Allowed.
- Muon (μ) and antimuon: same, 2m_mu around 0.2 GeV, which is way under 6. Allowed.
- Tau (τ) and antitau: 2*1.77= ~3.54 GeV. Also allowed.
- Quarks: let's see, up, down, strange, charm. Because charm is 1.5 GeV, 2*1.5=3<6. So possible. But bottom is too heavy.
- How about the top? No, as I said. So X can't decay into b or t quarks.

But wait, in the options, some have 'b' and others don't. Let me check the masses again. Wait, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV each, so 4.5*2=9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so that's not enough. So X can't decay into b quarks. So any decay option that includes b or t quarks is invalid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-
But b is too heavy. So option A is not possible.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. All these fermions have 2m_f <6 GeV except for c? Wait, c is 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 <6. So yes. So B includes c, which is allowed.

Option C: It includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, but also t. 2*m_t is way larger than 6 GeV, so option C is invalid.

Option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, b is too heavy, so D is invalid.

So the allowed fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options, option B includes all of them except for the c cbar. Wait, option B says c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Wait, but why does the interaction Lagrangian affect this? The Lagrangian must interact with the fermions, right? The term is L = -λff (something) ψ_f. So the fermion types f that X couples to would determine possible decays. So if X couples to all these fermions, then that's possible. But the problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, implying that X couples to all fermions f. So all fermion types (quarks, leptons) are possible decay products, as long as their mass is less than 3 GeV (since m_X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must be less than 3 GeV). Wait, wait, no: the combined mass of the fermion pair can't exceed m_X. So each fermion can be up to 3 GeV mass, because 2*3 =6. So the fermion must be less than or equal to 3 GeV in mass.

But wait, let me double-check fermion masses:

Electron: ~0.5 MeV (so way under)
Mu: ~105 MeV
Tau: ~1.77 GeV (so about 1.77 <3 GeV. So allowed.)
Charm quark: ~1.25 GeV (so allowed)
Strangeness quark: ~100 MeV
Up and down: ~2-5 MeV
Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV (so 4.5 >3 GeV, so can't decay into b)
Top quark: way too heavy.

So the fermions X can decay into are: e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. So X can decay into any of these pairs.

Now looking at the options, which option includes all allowed fermion pairs?

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that matches everything except the bottom quark.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the combined rest mass of the pair must not exceed the boson's mass. This means each fermion must have a mass \( m_f \) such that \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

The known fermion masses are approximately:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( 105 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up (\( u \)): \( 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down (\( d \)): \( 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange (\( s \)): \( 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm (\( c \)): \( 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom (\( b \)): \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are too heavy, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \), making their decays kinematically forbidden.

The interaction Lagrangian implies that \( X \) can couple to all these fermions, so the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are into pairs of \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \).

Answer: B
