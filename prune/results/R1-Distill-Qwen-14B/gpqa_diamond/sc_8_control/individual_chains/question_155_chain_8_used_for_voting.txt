Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the operator P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

Alright, first, I need to understand the setup. So, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is a matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, because each P is a component of the angular momentum or something similar, probably.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). It's the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Wait, so the system is in a state that's an eigenstate of P_x, but we're asked about the uncertainty in P_z.

I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the variance. The variance ΔP_z squared is ⟨Ψ| P_z² |Ψ⟩ minus ⟨Ψ| P_z |Ψ⟩ squared. So, I need to calculate those expectation values.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm on the right track. The state Ψ is given, and I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ to find ΔP_z.

Let me write down the given matrices for each operator. Let's do that step by step.

The matrix for P_x is:
First row: 0, ħ/√2, 0
Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ√2
Wait, no, the user wrote it as second row: [hbar/sqrt(2), 0, hbar/sqrt(2)]. Wait, I think the user made a typo there. Let me recheck the question.

Wait, the user wrote for P_x: second row as (ħ/sqrt(2), 0, ħ/sqrt(2)). So it's [ [0, ħ/√2, 0],
[ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2],
[0, ħ/√2, 0] ]

Similarly, P_y is given with first row (0, -iħ/√2, 0), second row (iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2), third row (0, iħ/√2, 0). And P_z is diagonal: first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). 

So, the state vector Ψ is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's denote this as |Ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

I think I can proceed by calculating ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z^2⟩.

First, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, it's easy. The expectation value is the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the corresponding probabilities.

Wait, no. The expectation value ⟨A⟩ is Ψ† A Ψ.

So for P_z, which is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

So, P_z = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ).

So, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩ = Ψ† P_z Ψ.

Ψ is a column vector, so Ψ† is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Multiplying Ψ† by P_z gives [ (-1/2)(ħ), (1/√2)(0), (-1/2)(-ħ) ] = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Then, multiply this with Ψ:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( -ħ/2 )*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (ħ/2)*(-1/2).

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-ħ/2)*(-1/2) = (ħ/4)
Third term: (ħ/2)*(-1/2) = -ħ/4.

So adding them: (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0.

Interesting, the expectation value of P_z is zero. Hmm.

Now, what about ⟨P_z^2⟩?

P_z squared is just the square of its diagonal elements. So the diagonal entries would be (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2. So P_z² = diag(ħ², 0, ħ²).

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ = Ψ† P_z² Ψ.

Again, let's compute this. 

Ψ† multiplied by P_z² is [ (-1/2)(ħ²), (1/√2)(0), (-1/2)(ħ²) ] = [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Wait, no. Wait, P_z² is diag(ħ^2, 0, ħ^2). So each element in Ψ is multiplied by these diagonal elements when Ψ is multiplied by P_z².

Wait, no, when you do Ψ† P_z², you multiply each element of Ψ† with the corresponding diagonal element of P_z².

So, first element: (-1/2) * ħ² = -ħ²/2.

Second element: (1/√2) * 0 = 0.

Third element: (-1/2) * ħ² = -ħ²/2.

So the row vector after Ψ† P_z² is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Then, multiply this by Ψ, which is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = [ -ħ²/2 ]*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + [ -ħ²/2 ]*(-1/2 )

Calculating each term:

First term: ( ħ²/2 * 1/2 )= ( ħ² * 1 ) /4 = ħ²/4.

Third term: ( -ħ²/2 )*( -1/2 ) = ( ħ²/4 ) again.

So total is ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So, ⟨P_z^2⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2.

Since ⟨P_z⟩ is 0, the variance is just ħ²/2.

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check these calculations because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication steps.

So, for ⟨P_z⟩, I had:

( -ħ/2 ) * (-1/2 ) = ħ/4.

( ħ/2 ) * (-1/2 ) = - ħ/4.

Sum is zero.

For ⟨P_z²⟩:

Each term in Ψ† P_z² is:

-1/2 * ħ² = - ħ²/2.

1/√2 * 0 = 0.

-1/2 * ħ² = - ħ²/2.

So when you multiply this vector by Ψ, it's:

(-ħ²/2)(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (-ħ²/2)(-1/2 )

Which is (ħ²/4) + (ħ²/4) ) = ħ²/2.

So variance is ħ²/2, uncertainty is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.

But wait, let's think again. Is there another approach? Maybe using the expectation values.

Alternatively, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, perhaps it's in a superposition of eigenstates of P_z, so the uncertainty in P_z would be non-zero, which matches our calculation.

Hmm, so I think I did everything correctly. The answer is B.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is given as a diagonal matrix:

\[
P_z = \text{diag}(\hbar, 0, -\hbar).
\]

The state of the system is the column vector:

\[
|\Psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \Psi^\dagger P_z \Psi.
\]

First, multiply $\Psi^\dagger$ (the row vector $[-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{2}]$) by $P_z$:

\[
\Psi^\dagger P_z = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, multiply this result by $\Psi$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 0 + \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is:

\[
P_z^2 = \text{diag}(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2).
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is calculated similarly:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \Psi^\dagger P_z^2 \Psi.
\]

First, multiply $\Psi^\dagger$ by $P_z^2$:

\[
\Psi^\dagger P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, multiply this result by $\Psi$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + 0 + \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
