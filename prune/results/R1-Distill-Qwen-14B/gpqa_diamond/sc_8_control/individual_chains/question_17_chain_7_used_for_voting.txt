Okay, so I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The question gives me the formation constant, which is 5x10^10. Hmm, wait, I remember that the formation constant, Kf, relates the concentration of the complex to the concentrations of the ions it's formed from. 

So, the Ca-EDTA complex is a 1:1 ratio, right? So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, the problem says the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Now, since we're assuming ideal pH, I think that means the concentration of EDTA^4- is in excess, so it doesn't change much. Oh wait, no, actually, at ideal pH, the EDTA is in its correct form, which is the Y^4- ion. 

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that means the initial concentration is all CaEDTA^2-, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. 

So, the initial concentrations are [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in solution. So the solution already has the complex, and we need to find the [Ca²+] that comes from the dissociation of the complex. 

So the complex dissociates as CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. 

But wait, the Kf is given as 5e10. Wait, wait, Kf is the formation constant, which is the reverse of the dissociation. So Kf = 1/Kd, where Kd is the dissociation constant. So Kd would be 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. 

So, for the dissociation reaction, the Kd is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/ [CaEDTA^2-] = Kd. 

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, but that's a bit unclear. Wait, because the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will increase. 

Wait, but let's think about the initial state. The solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and negligible amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- initially. But then, when it dissociates, let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that comes off. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, and x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. 

So substituting into the Kd equation: (x)(x) / (0.02) ) = Kd = 2e-11. 

So x^2 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. 

Taking the square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*1e-13, so sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because 6.5 *2=13. So sqrt(4e-13) is (2e-6.5) M. But 2e-6.5 is the same as 2 * 10^(-6.5) which is approximately 6.32e-7 M because 10^(-0.5) is about 0.316, so 2 * 0.316e-6 is 0.632e-6, which is 6.32e-7. 

Wait, so x would be about 6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer should be C. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to approach this is to use Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So if [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and assuming that [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, then Kf = 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10. 

So, 0.02/(x^2) =5e10 → x^2=0.02/(5e10) → x^2=4e-13 → x=2e-6.5, same as before. So yes, x= sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5=6.32e-7. So option C is correct.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is approximately 0.02 M (assuming negligible dissociation). Let the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \( x \). Using the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Substitute \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x \), \( [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x \), and \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \):

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \cdot K_d = 0.02 \cdot (2 \times 10^{-11}) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ]\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
