Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a hyperbola but in two dimensions. But I'm more familiar with the metric of a sphere, which has positive curvature, so maybe I should compare the two.

In the case of a sphere with radius a, the metric in coordinates (like stereographic coordinates) would have a similar form. The standard metric for a sphere is usually written as ds² = (a²)/(1 + (x² + y²)/a²) (dx² + dy² + dz²), but wait, that's for 3D. Alternatively, in 2D, maybe it's expressed differently.

Wait, no. Let me think about a 2D pseudosphere. The metric for a surface of constant negative curvature is often written in isothermal coordinates. For a hyperbolic space, the metric can be expressed as ds² = (a²)/(x² + y²) (dx² + dy²), but I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Wait, perhaps it's (a²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²) or something like that.

Wait, wait, I think I should get the general form. The metric for a 2D surface of constant curvature K is often written in isothermal coordinates as ds² = (a²)/(1 - (K r²)/a²) (dx² + dy²), where r is the radial coordinate. Or maybe it's scaled differently. Alternatively, for negative curvature, maybe it's ds² = (a²)/(1 + (x² + y²)/a²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, no, that might be for positive curvature.

Wait, in the case of the sphere of radius a, the metric in stereographic coordinates is ds² = (a²)/(1 + (x² + y²)/a²) (dx² + dy²). So for a pseudosphere, which is hyperbolic, the denominator should have a minus sign, right? Because hyperbolic functions involve square differences.

So for a pseudosphere, the metric might be something like ds² = (a²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²) (dx² + dy²). But wait, the denominator would be different because hyperbolic functions have a different structure. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it in terms of the curvature. The Gaussian curvature K for a pseudosphere is negative. For a sphere, K is positive and equal to 1/a². So maybe for a pseudosphere, K is -1/b², where b is a parameter related to the radius.

Wait, the metric given in the question is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)), meaning 4 is like 4 = a², so a would be 2. So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²) = a² - r², where r is the radial coordinate. So this looks like a metric for a space with positive curvature, but wait, no, because if this is a metric for a 2D surface, and the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), that would imply that beyond r=2, the denominator becomes negative, which would make the metric imaginary. So maybe it's a space that's only valid inside r=2, but that's just a sphere of radius 2. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere, which should have negative curvature.

Wait, wait, maybe I got the form wrong. Let me think again. For a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature), the metric in isothermal coordinates is usually written as ds² = (a²)/(1 - (x² + y²)/a²) (dx² + dy²), but wait, that would only be valid when x² + y² < a², which in that case, the denominator would be positive, but the curvature is negative. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as ds² = (a²)/(1 + (x² + y²)/a²) (dx² + dy²), but then that would be positive curvature. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the metric for a pseudosphere is written as ds² = (a²)/(x² + y²) (dx² + dy²), but that doesn't seem right either because that would give a different behavior.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric. Because the question is about a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature. So maybe the given metric corresponds to a pseudosphere, and we can compute its area.

To compute the Gaussian curvature, I remember that for a metric ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the curvature K can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 g)) * [ (g_x y'' - g_y x'' ) / sqrt(g) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the formula for Gaussian curvature in isothermal coordinates. Another approach: The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = e^{2λ(x,y)} (dx² + dy²) is given by K = -e^{-2λ} (λ_xx + λ_yy), where λ is the conformal factor.

Wait, in our case, the metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)) )? Or wait, more accurately, the metric is conformally flat, so it's e^{2λ} (dx² + dy²), where e^{2λ} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So λ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)), where r² = x² + y².

So to compute K, we can compute K = -e^{-2λ} [ (λ_xx + λ_yy) ].

Wait, let's compute λ. Let me define r² = x² + y². Then e^{2λ} = 32/(4 - r²).

So λ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

But perhaps it's easier to compute the derivatives in terms of r.

So λ = (1/2) [ ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ) ]

So λ = (1/2) ln(32) - (1/2) ln(4 - r²).

Now, to compute the second derivatives of λ with respect to x and y. But since the problem is symmetric in x and y, I can compute derivatives in terms of r.

Alternatively, we can compute the second derivatives in polar coordinates, but perhaps using the fact that x and y are coordinates, and using the chain rule.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute λ_xx and λ_yy.

Let me compute λ_x first.

λ = (1/2) ln(32/(4 - r²)).

r² = x² + y², so r = sqrt(x² + y²).

But when taking derivatives, it's easier to treat r² = x² + y² as a function.

So let me compute the first derivative of λ with respect to x:

λ_x = (1/2) [ ( derivative of ln(32/(4 - r²)) ) ]

= (1/2) [ ( derivative of ln(32) - ln(4 - r²) ) ]

= (1/2) [ 0 - ( (-2r dr/dx) ) / (4 - r²) ) ]

Wait, wait, that's perhaps not correct. Let me compute it correctly.

The function inside ln is (32)/(4 - r^2) = 32*(4 - r^2)^{-1}.

So ln(32/(4 - r^2)) = ln(32) - ln(4 - r^2).

So the derivative with respect to x is:

d/dx [ ln(32/(4 - r^2)) ] = [ 0 - ( derivative of ln(4 - r^2) ) ]

= - [ ( derivative of (4 - r^2) ) / (4 - r^2) ]

= - [ ( -2r dr/dx ) / (4 - r^2) ) ]

Because d/dx (4 - r^2) = -2r dr/dx, where dr/dx = x/r.

So putting it together:

d/dx [ ln(32/(4 - r^2)) ] = - [ (-2r * (x/r)) / (4 - r^2) ) ]

= - [ (-2x) / (4 - r^2) ) ]

= 2x/(4 - r^2).

So λ_x = (1/2) * [ 2x/(4 - r^2) ) ] = x/(4 - r^2).

Similarly, λ_y = y/(4 - r^2).

Now, compute the second derivatives λ_xx and λ_yy.

Let's compute λ_xx:

λ_x = x/(4 - r^2) = x/(4 - (x² + y²)).

So λ_xx is the derivative of λ_x with respect to x.

Compute using the quotient rule: [ (denominator * derivative of numerator) - (numerator * derivative of denominator) ] / denominator^2.

Numerator: x.

Denominator: 4 - x² - y².

Derivative of numerator (w.r. to x): 1.

Derivative of denominator (w.r. to x): -2x.

So λ_xx = [ (4 - x² - y²)(1) - x*(-2x) ) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Simplify numerator:

= (4 - x² - y²) + 2x² = 4 + x² - y².

So λ_xx = (4 + x² - y²) / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Similarly, λ_yy:

λ_y = y/(4 - x² - y²).

Derivative with respect to y:

Numerator: y.

Denominator: 4 - x² - y².

Derivative of numerator (w.r. to y): 1.

Derivative of denominator (w.r. to y): -2y.

So λ_yy = [ (4 - x² - y²)(1) - y*(-2y) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Simplify numerator:

= (4 - x² - y²) + 2y² = 4 - x² + y².

So λ_yy = (4 - x² + y²) / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Now, sum λ_xx + λ_yy:

(4 + x² - y² + 4 - x² + y² ) / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

The x² and -x² cancel, same with -y² and +y².

So numerator is 4 +4 =8.

Denominator is (4 - x² - y²)^2.

So λ_xx + λ_yy = 8 / (4 - r^2)^2.

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - e^{-2λ} (λ_xx + λ_yy).

But e^{2λ} = 32/(4 - r^2).

So e^{-2λ} = (4 - r^2)/32.

So K = - [ (4 - r^2)/32 ] * [ 8/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

Simplify:

= - [ (4 - r^2) * 8 ) / (32 (4 - r^2)^2) ) ]

= - [ 8 / (32 (4 - r^2) ) ) ]

Simplify 8/32 = 1/4.

So K = - [ 1/(4 (4 - r^2)) ) ]

Wait, that's a problem because for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature should be a negative constant. But here, K depends on r², which suggests it's not a constant. That can't be right because the question says it's a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the curvature. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is not of a pseudosphere but of a sphere. Let me think again.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is (4 - r^2). Which would be valid for r^2 <4, so within a radius of 2. Now, if r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up, which is a sign of a singularity perhaps, like the north pole in a sphere's stereographic projection.

Wait, but earlier, when I computed K, I found it's K = - [ 1/(4 (4 - r^2)) ), which depends on r. But for a pseudosphere, K should be a negative constant. So perhaps this metric isn't that of a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Let me go back to the computation of the Gaussian curvature.

Wait, the formula I used is K = -e^{-2λ} (λ_xx + λ_yy).

Wait, I thought e^2λ is 32/(4 - r²), so e^{-2λ} is (4 - r²)/32.

Then, when I plug in the sum of λ_xx and λ_yy, which I found to be 8/(4 - r²)^2.

So K = - [ (4 - r^2)/32 ] * [ 8/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

= - [ (4 - r^2) *8 ] / [32 (4 - r^2)^2) ]

= - [ 8 (4 - r^2) ] / [32 (4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

The (4 - r^2) in numerator and denominator cancel, leaving 8/(32 (4 - r^2)).

So 8/32 is 1/4, so K = - [ 1/(4 (4 - r^2)) ) ]

Hmm, that's not a constant. So the curvature varies with r^2, which suggests that the metric given isn't a pseudosphere because the curvature isn't constant. But the question states that it is a pseudosphere. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let's think about the metric's form.

Another way to find the area of a surface is to integrate the area element over the surface. The area element for a metric ds² = g(dx² + dy²) is (1/2) * g dx dy, but wait, no, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, but in 2D, when the metric is diagonal and conformally flat, so g is a diagonal matrix with entries g_xx = g_yy = g, then the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy. But wait, in 2D, when the metric is conformally flat (i.e., ds² = e^{2λ} (dx² + dy²)), the area element is e^{2λ} dx dy.

Wait, no, wait: The area element in 2D for such a metric is indeed sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. For a diagonal metric, det(g) is (g_xx * g_yy) = (e^{2λ})^2 = e^{4λ} for the 2D case. Wait, no, 2D metric is:

g = [
[e^{2λ}, 0],
[0, e^{2λ}]
]

So det(g) = (e^{2λ})^2 = e^{4λ}.

So the area element is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy = e^{2λ} dx dy.

Wait, but wait, no, sqrt(det(g)) is sqrt(e^{4λ}) = e^{2λ}.

So the area element is e^{2λ} dx dy.

In our case, e^{2λ} is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area is the integral over all x and y where 4 - x² - y² >0, because the denominator must be positive for the metric to be real.

So the region of integration is the disk x² + y² <4.

So the area is ∫∫ (32/(4 - (x² + y²))) dx dy.

But this is in 2D, so it's an area, not a volume. So perhaps it's better to switch to polar coordinates.

Let me make the substitution to polar coordinates, where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dx dy = r dr dθ.

So the area becomes ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Compute the integral:

Area = ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

First, integrate over r.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du)/2 = r dr.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [32 r dr ]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ r dr ]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (-du/2) / u.

= -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

The integral of (1/u) du is ln |u| + C.

So the integral from 0 to 2:

When r=0, u=4.

When r=2, u=0.

Wait, substituting from r=0 to r=2:

= -16 [ ln(4) - ln(0) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral becomes -16 [ ln(4) - (-infty) ) ] = -16 (infinite) → divergent.

Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let me re-express the substitution correctly.

u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (r dr) = - du/2.

So when r=0, u=4.

When r approaches 2, u approaches 4 -4=0.

So the integral ∫ (from r=0 to r=2) [32 r dr]/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2) ] / u.

= 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

= 32 * ( -1/2 ) [ ln(u) ] (from 4 to 0) )

= 32 * ( -1/2 ) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ]

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes 32 * (-1/2) ( -infty - ln(4) ) → 32 * (infinite) → the integral diverges to positive infinity.

So the area is infinite, which suggests that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. But wait, that can't be right because a pseudosphere has finite area. Wait, no, I think the pseudosphere actually has infinite area because it's a surface of infinite extent. Wait no, a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between a pseudosphere and a hyperbolic plane. The hyperbolic plane has infinite area, but a pseudosphere is a finite surface with finite area.

Wait, but in our case, the metric only covers a finite region because the denominator 4 - r² requires r² <4, so the surface is limited to a disk of radius 2. So perhaps the area is finite.

Wait, but wait, the metric given is for a pseudosphere, which would have a constant negative curvature. But earlier, when calculating the curvature K, I found it to be dependent on r, which suggests that the given metric isn't a pseudosphere. So perhaps the question is incorrect in stating that the metric is for a pseudosphere, but the options are given, so I have to choose from them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the curvature. Let me try to compute it again.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used for Gaussian curvature is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I should use another method.

Another approach to find the Gaussian curvature is to use the formula for a surface given in isothermal coordinates, where the metric is ds² = e^{2λ}(dx² + dy²). The Gaussian curvature K is given by K = -e^{-2λ} (λ_xx + λ_yy).

Wait, I think I computed that correctly earlier, but let me try again.

Earlier, I found that λ_xx + λ_yy = 8 / (4 - r^2)^2.

So K = -e^{-2λ} * (8) / (4 - r^2)^2.

But e^{-2λ} is (4 - r^2)/(32), because e^{2λ} = 32/(4 - r^2).

So K = -(4 - r^2)/32 * 8/(4 - r^2)^2 )

= -(4 - r^2) *8 / [32 (4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

= -8(4 - r^2) / [32 (4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

8/32 = 1/4.

(4 - r^2) in numerator cancels with one (4 - r^2) in denominator.

So K = -(1)/(4 (4 - r^2)).

Hmm, so K depends on r^2, which means it's not a constant. So this metric doesn't represent a pseudosphere because a pseudosphere requires constant negative curvature. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the question, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, but the question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" So perhaps despite the curvature not being constant, they're referring to a metric that somehow represents a pseudosphere with radius 2, and the area is being asked.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is indeed that of a pseudosphere, and I made a mistake in calculating the curvature. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the metric of a pseudosphere in isothermal coordinates is ds² = (a^2)/(a^2 + r^2) (dx² + dy²), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (a^2 - r^2), but that would only be valid for r <a, which would be a sphere, not a pseudosphere.

Wait, let's consider the metric for a pseudosphere. The pseudosphere (tractricoid) has a metric that can be expressed in terms of coordinates, but perhaps I'm confusing it with the hyperbolic plane. The hyperbolic plane has a metric with constant negative curvature, and in Poincaré coordinates, it's ds² = (a²)/(x² + y²) (dx² + dy²), but that's for a model of hyperbolic space, not a pseudosphere.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a finite surface with constant negative curvature, so it's a surface of revolution of a tractrix. Its metric would resemble that of a sphere but with a different form. Maybe the given metric is a form of a pseudosphere's metric.

But according to the calculation, the curvature isn't constant, which suggests that perhaps the metric is for a sphere, not a pseudosphere. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a portion of a pseudosphere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should proceed to compute the area, given that the area element is 32/(4 - r^2) dx dy, and in polar coordinates, the area becomes:

Area = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The limits are r from 0 to 2 (since 4 - r² must be positive), and θ from 0 to 2π.

So the integral becomes:

Area = 2π ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral.

Let me make substitution u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

When r=0, u=4.

When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ r dr / u ] = 32 ∫ (from 4 to 0) [ (- du/2 ) / u ]

= 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

= -16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

= -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ]

But ln(0) is -infty, so [ln(0) - ln(4)] = -infty - ln(4) = -infty.

So the integral becomes -16 * (-infty) = +infty.

Thus, the area is infinite, which suggests that the area of the pseudosphere, according to this metric, is infinite. But that's not possible because a pseudosphere is a finite surface. Hmm, perhaps the pseudosphere in this case is being represented in a model where the area is infinite, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the metric is for a sphere, not a pseudosphere, but the question states it's a pseudosphere. So perhaps the correct answer is that the area is infinite. Looking at the options, option D is +infty.

So the area would be infinite, so the answer is D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This metric represents a 2D surface, and the question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). To compute the area, the area element for the metric is derived as:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy = e^{2\lambda} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(e^{2\lambda} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r\cos\theta\), \(y = r\sin\theta\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The limits of integration are \(r \in [0, 2]\) (to ensure the denominator remains positive) and \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi]\). Substituting \(u = 4 - r^2\) (\(du = -2r \, dr\)) simplifies the integral:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 2\pi \cdot 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-du/2}{u}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 32 \cdot \frac{-1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 32\pi \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
A = 32\pi \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right].
\]

As \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges, indicating that the area is infinite. This result aligns with the fact that the given metric represents a surface with infinite extent, consistent with a pseudosphere in this context.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as this is not a valid expression for the area of the pseudosphere.
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the area of the pseudosphere, according to the given metric, is infinite.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]

Answer: D
