Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and transgenic mice. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

Hmm, why might that be happening? Let's look at the options provided.

The question gives the sequence of the plus strand of the construct. I should check that sequence for possible issues.

First, the construct includes the coding sequence (CDS) for GADD45G with an HA tag at the N-terminus. The HA tag is a small peptide (like YPYDVPDYDGI) that's used for detection. But wait, in the question, they modified the gene's coding sequence to introduce the HA sequence. Did they do it correctly?

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, let me check for any possible frameshift or premature stop codons. Alternatively, maybe the reading frame is messed up because of the HA insertion.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so its coding sequence would be a short addition before the start codon. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence was inserted in a way that creates a premature stop codon.

Wait, the plus strand starts with 5' ATG... That's the start codon, methionine. So the HA tag must be before this, right? Because the HA is at the N-terminus. So the plasmid's coding sequence would be HA followed by the GADD45G CDS under a promoter.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG. So perhaps the HA tag isn't in the correct frame, or perhaps it's inserted in a way that introduces a stop codon early in the sequence.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag wasn't inserted properly, leading to a frameshift. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons.

Looking through the sequence, the first 60 nucleotides or so:

5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TT...
Wait, the first codon is ATG, which is the start. Then TAC is tyrosine, then CCC (proline), then ATA (isoleucine), CGA ( arginine), TGT (cysteine), TCC (serine), AGA (arginine), TTA (leucine), CGC (arginine), CAA (glutamine), ATG (start again?), etc.

Wait, wait, the problem is that the HA tag is a known sequence. The HA tag is typically something like YPYDVPDYDGI. Its coding sequence is something like TAC TAC CCC ATC GAT GGT TAC GGC TAC, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think: the HA tag is from the influenza virus hemagglutinin, so the DNA sequence would code for the amino acid sequence YPYDVPDYDGI.

Let me figure out the DNA sequence for the HA tag. Each amino acid corresponds to a codon. Let's see:

YPYDVPDYDGI breaks down into amino acids:

Y (tyrosine) -> TAC or TAT
P (proline) -> CC
Y (tyrosine) -> TAC
D (aspartate) -> GAT or GAA
V (valine) -> GTT, GTC, GCT, etc.
P (proline) -> same as above
D (aspartate) -> GAT or GAA
V (valine) -> same as before
P (proline) -> same
Y (tyrosine) -> TAC
D (aspartate) -> GAT or GAA
G (glycine) ->G GT or GCN
I (isoleucine) -> ATT or ATC, etc.

But the exact order might not matter. The point is, the HA tag's coding sequence is added before the start codon of GADD45G.

But looking at the given DNA sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (Y), then CCC (Pro), etc. Wait, that would make the first few amino acids Met-Y-Phe-... So the HA tag would be Met followed by the HA sequence. But wait, the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so the HA sequence comes before the start codon. That would mean the start codon (ATG) would be after the HA. But in the given sequence, it starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So does that mean the HA is part of the coding sequence before the ATG?

Wait, perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong reading frame, causing a frameshift. Alternatively, perhaps the HA sequence wasn't correctly inserted, causing a premature stop codon.

Wait, the construct is designed to have the HA tag N-terminal to GADD45G. So the correct sequence would be: [HA coding sequence] followed by ATG [start codon for GADD45G].

But looking at the given DNA, the sequence starts with ATG, so perhaps the HA wasn't properly inserted. Alternatively, maybe the HA was inserted in a way that the start codon is in the same frame as the HA, which would have the HA as the first part of the protein.

Wait, but the HA is a separate coding sequence. So perhaps the HA tag and GADD45G are in the same reading frame, but the way the HA was inserted may have caused a frameshift.

Wait, but the question states that the HA is introduced as a single determinant at the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA coding sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the given DNA, the first codon is ATG (start), which would be the start of GADD45G. So where is the HA? It's not present in the given sequence. Wait, perhaps the HA wasn't added correctly. Maybe the HA insertion caused a frameshift, leading to a premature stop codon.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the start is ATG, and then the next codons are TAC, CCC, ATA, etc. So the first amino acids would be Met, Tyr, Pro, Ile, Arg, Cys, Ser, Arg, Leu, etc. But without the HA, perhaps the HA insertion caused a frame shift, leading to a shorter ORF.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA wasn't added correctly, so the construct doesn't include it, leading to just the GADD45G being expressed. But the issue is that the overexpression isn't happening as expected.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag insertion might have introduced a premature stop codon. If the HA was inserted in the wrong reading frame, it could introduce a stop codon before the actual ATG, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, so that's the start. Let's see if any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) are present in the sequence before the ATG.

Wait, the given sequence starts with ATG, so the start is correct. Then, let's see if there's any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the provided sequence.

Looking through the sequence:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TT...

Wait, the sequence after ATG is TAC, CCC, ATA, CGA, TGT, TCC, AGA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG, ACT, CTG, etc.

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA. For example, in the sequence, the codon TTA is present. TTA is a stop codon? No, TTA is isoleucine. Wait, no, stop codons are TAA (stop), TAG (stop), TGA (stop). So looking for these triplets.

Looking at the entire sequence:

Looking for TAA: does any triplet match TAA? Let's see.

Looking for T-A-A triplets: For instance, the substring TAA might be present. Let's see:

Looking through the sequence:

...AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT...

Wait, the CGC CAA part: CGC is a codon for arginine, CAA is Gln. The next codon is ATG. So after CAA is ATG. So the next three are ATG... that's the start codon again. Wait, that's a problem because you can't have another start codon in the middle, unless it's part of the reading frame.

Wait, but ATG is a start codon, but in the middle of the sequence. So if the HA wasn't properly inserted, the construct might have an internal start codon, causing the ribosome to start translation earlier.

Wait, but in this case, the HA is supposed to be N-terminal. If the HA wasn't correctly inserted, then the first codon is ATG for GADD45G. But the problem is that the HA wasn't included, but then why would that cause a failure to express.

Alternatively, maybe the HA was inserted, but in the wrong frame, creating a stop codon downstream.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence includes an in-frame stop codon. For example, if the HA's DNA sequence includes a TAA, TAG, or TGA triplet, which would cause a premature stop.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence, the first few codons are ATG (start), TAC (Tyr), CCC (Pro), ATA (Ile), CGA (Arg), TGT (Cys), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), TTA (Ile), CGC (Arg), CAA (Gln), ATG (start), ACT (Thr), CTG (Leu), etc.

Wait, the presence of another ATG after CAA (CAA is position 12-14, then ATG is 15-17). That's another start codon.

Wait, but after the first ATG, which is the start, that's the beginning of the ORF. So the presence of another ATG further down would just be a codon in the middle. So that's not necessarily a problem. Unless it's in the same reading frame, but in this case, it's part of the same frame.

Wait, perhaps the HA insertion caused a frameshift, leading to a premature stop codon. Let me think: If the HA's DNA is inserted in a way that disrupts the reading frame, it could cause the rest of the gene to be out of frame, leading to a stop codon downstream.

Looking at the given sequence, after the initial ATG, the codons proceed as normal. So perhaps the HA was correctly inserted, but another issue is present.

Wait, perhaps the tag is inserted after the ATG, causing the HA to be part of the same reading frame as GADD45G. But that's what was intended.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is in the same reading frame, but the correct sequence leads to a stop codon. Let's see: If the HA's coding sequence includes a stop codon, but that's unlikely because the HA is a short peptide.

Wait, maybe the HA was inserted in the wrong frame, leading to a stop codon. Let me imagine that the HA insertion causes a frameshift. For example, if the HA has a length not divisible by three, it could cause a frameshift. Let's say the HA's DNA is inserted with a length that's not a multiple of three, leading to a frameshift.

Looking at the construct's sequence, perhaps the HA insertion caused an extra nucleotide, leading to a frameshift. If so, the reading frame would change, and downstream, a stop codon would appear.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the ORF continues correctly. So perhaps the HA was inserted correctly, with the right reading frame, but the GADD45G coding sequence has a stop codon.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but in the given sequence, the HA isn't present. Because the sequence starts with ATG, perhaps the HA wasn't added, leading to a shorter protein than expected. But the researcher expects HA-GADD45G, but if the HA isn't present, then the protein is just GADD45G. But that wouldn't explain the lack of overexpression.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted, but the construct includes a stop codon within the HA, preventing translation. For instance, if the HA sequence has a TAA, TAG, or TGA triplet.

Wait, let me try to figure out the actual DNA sequence of the HA tag. The HA peptide is YPYDVPDYDGI. So each amino acid is:

Y -> TAC or TAT (TAC is for Y in the first reading frame)
P -> CCC (Proline)
Y -> TAC
D -> GAT or GAA
V -> GTT, GTC, etc.
P -> CCC
D -> GAT or GAA
V -> GTT, etc.
P -> CCC
Y -> TAC
D -> GAT or GAA
G -> GT (glycine can be GTT, GTA, etc.)
I -> ATT, ATC, etc.

So the HA coding sequence would be something like TAC CCC TAC GAT GTT CCC GAT GTT CCC TAC GAT GTT ATT.

But I'm not sure about the exact sequence. Alternatively, perhaps the HA's coding sequence is TAC TAC CCC ATC GAT GGT TAC GGC TAC, but I'm not certain.

Wait, regardless, perhaps the HA sequence was inserted in the wrong reading frame. For example, if the HA sequence was inserted into a plasmid that's in a different frame, causing the entire coding sequence to be out of frame.

But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is the start. So perhaps the HA wasn't inserted correctly, leading the construct to start with ATG, meaning that the HA is not present. But why would that cause a lack of expression?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion introduced a stop codon. Let me check the given sequence for any TGA, TAG, or TAA triplets.

Looking for TGA:

Looking through the sequence:

...TAC GAT GGT TAC GGC TAC...

Wait, does that have TGA? Let me check:

Looking for TGA in the sequence. Let me scan the given DNA sequence:

The sequence is:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TGA:

Looking for 'TGA' in the sequence.

Looking through parts:

...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm, I see "TGA" at the very end: ...GAGTGA3'

Wait, the last part is GAGTGA. So the last codon is GAG (glutamic acid), then TGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, so the sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. So the last three codons are GAG (acid), TGA (stop), and then A. Wait, no: the last part is 'GAGTGA'. So the codons would be GAG (amino acid 1), TGA (stop), and then A. Wait, but the sequence ends with TGA, so the last codon is TGA, which is a stop.

So the construct's coding sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So when the ribosome translates this, it would stop at TGA, leading to a truncated protein.

So the problem is that the construct has a premature stop codon at the end, causing the protein to be truncated or not expressed at all.

Wait, but why is the stop codon present? The researcher intended to add the HA tag but perhaps accidentally included a stop codon at the end.

Looking back, the construct is designed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G. So the HA tag would be at the beginning, then the ATG start, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

But the given sequence starts with ATG, which suggests that the HA wasn't inserted before the ATG. Or perhaps the HA was inserted incorrectly so that the ATG is the start of the ORF, and the HA is part of the ORF.

But the real issue is that the last codon is TGA, a stop. So when the ribosome translates this, it will terminate early, leading to a protein that's shorter than expected. If the stop codon is in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence, the protein won't be expressed correctly, leading to no overexpression.

So why is there a TGA at the end? Perhaps during the cloning process, the insert wasn't done correctly, and the TGA is part of the original vector or introduced during the process.

Wait, the question says that the HA is introduced at the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA sequence followed by the GADD45G CDS.

But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is the start of GADD45G. If the HA was supposed to be upstream, perhaps the construct was cut in the wrong place, leading to the HA not being included, and the ATG being the start.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA wasn't properly added, leading to the GADD45G being expressed, but with a premature stop codon at the end, making it non-functional.

But why would the HA tag's addition cause a stop codon? Alternatively, perhaps the HA was added in the same reading frame, but the HA's own sequence includes a stop codon.

Wait, but looking at the HA sequence, it's YPYDVPDYDGI, which is all amino acids that don't include any stop signals. So the coding sequence for HA shouldn't include a stop codon. Therefore, the stop must have been introduced elsewhere.

Looking again, the given sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the construct's ORF ends early. That's a problem because it would truncate the protein.

So the issue is that the construct has a premature stop codon at the end. Why? Maybe during the insertion of the HA tag, the cloning introduced an extra nucleotide or a mismatch that caused the TGA to appear.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag wasn't inserted, and the construct was just the GADD45G gene, which itself has a stop codon at the end. But why would GADD45G have a stop codon in its own sequence?

Wait, perhaps the correct GADD45G CDS doesn't have a stop codon, but the introduced construct does. Because the HA wasn't added correctly, maybe the plasmid's original sequence includes a stop codon, which is now present in the construct.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted in a way that caused the plasmid's own origin or other regions to introduce a stop codon.

But regardless, the presence of TGA at the end suggests that the protein would be truncated, leading to no overexpression. So the researcher can't express the protein as expected because the construct has a premature stop codon.

Now, looking at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

Missense mutation would change an amino acid, but if the HA's sequence is incorrect, perhaps the tag isn't recognized. But the issue might be elsewhere. Also, the given sequence starts with ATG, so maybe the HA wasn't added, leading to no HA, but the GADD45G would still be expressed. But the problem is that the GADD45G is being expressed but truncated due to TGA.

B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

That's a possibility, but why? Because of a stop codon. So the construct has a stop codon, leading to early termination.

C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

Hmm, a linker sequence between the HA and GADD45G might be needed to prevent proteolysis if the two domains are prone to self-processing. But the question mentions that the HA is introduced at the N-terminus, but perhaps without a linker, the cell's proteases are cleaving the protein. But the issue here is that the construct has a premature stop, so the protein isn't even made correctly.

D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Wait, UAA is a stop codon. All organisms have tRNA that recognize stop codons, but wait: no, stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs. So if the stop codon is UAA, which is a stop, it doesn't matter if the mouse has a tRNA for it because stop codons are not translated. So this option is unlikely.

So the most plausible options are B or C. If the construct has a premature stop codon (as in the given sequence), the ribosome will terminate early, leading to no protein or a truncated one. So the problem is that the construct has a stop codon, which is causing early termination.

Wait, but why is the stop codon at the end? Let me re-examine the sequence.

Looking at the last part of the given DNA sequence:

...GAGTGA3'

So the last three nucleotides are TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon.

So the construct's ORF ends with TGA, causing the protein to be truncated. This would prevent proper expression of GADD45G, hence no overexpression.

So the reason is that the construct has a premature stop codon, leading the ribosome to terminate early.

Now, looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That fits.

But wait, another angle: the presence of a stop codon in the coding sequence would cause early termination. So that's the cause.

But why is the stop codon present? The researcher intended to add the HA tag but perhaps messed up the cloning, causing the TGA to be included.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion caused a frameshift, leading to a stop codon elsewhere. But in this case, the stop is at the end, suggesting it's part of the intended construct.

Wait, perhaps the construct was designed correctly, but the HA tag was added in a way that the reading frame is correct, but the last codon is TGA. So the GADD45G is being cut short, leading to no functional protein.

So the correct answer would be B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the HA tag wasn't correctly cloned, leading to a frameshift. But the given sequence doesn't show a frameshift because the ORF continues correctly until the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA wasn't added at all, and the sequence starts with ATG, but the problem is the premature stop at the end.

Wait, perhaps during the cloning process, the vector's sequence included a TGA, which is now part of the construct. So when the construct is expressed, the ribosome stops at TGA, leading to no full-length protein.

So the issue is a premature stop codon.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would explain the lack of protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early because of a stop codon within it. But I don't think HA has a stop codon.

So the correct answer should be B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The researcher is attempting to create a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of GADD45G fused to an N-terminal HA tag. However, they are unable to overexpress the protein as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the construct reveals that the coding sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and ends with a premature stop codon (TGA). This premature stop codon is critical because it causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated or non-functional protein. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: A missense mutation would alter the HA tag's amino acid sequence, but the provided sequence does not indicate any mutations in the HA tag. Additionally, the issue here is the premature stop codon, not the HA tag itself.

- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: The presence of the TGA stop codon at the end of the coding sequence explains why the ribosome terminates translation prematurely, preventing proper expression of the full-length protein. This aligns with the observed lack of overexpression.

- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: While a linker sequence might prevent proteolysis, the primary issue here is the premature stop codon, which prevents the protein from being synthesized correctly in the first place.

- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: Stop codons like UAA are not translated by tRNAs but are recognized by release factors. The presence of the TGA stop codon is sufficient to terminate translation, making this option irrelevant.

The most plausible explanation is that the premature stop codon (TGA) in the construct causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to the lack of full-length protein expression. 

Answer: B
