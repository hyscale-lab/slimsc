Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting spectroscopy data. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR and 1H NMR spectra give some clues, so I'll need to piece them together.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl stretch around 1740 cm⁻¹. So the molecule must have an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern could be either para, ortho, or meta. But wait, di-substituted rings can have different splitting patterns. For para substitution, the aromatic protons are equivalent in two sets, maybe. But the number of signals here is two, so perhaps it's para substitution where there are two distinct environments. Alternatively, maybe it's ortho, but that might lead to more signals. Hmm, not sure yet. I'll keep that in mind.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are adjacent to double bonds, so this suggests that the compound has a conjugated system, perhaps a substituent with a double bond attached to the aromatic ring. The doublet could be from a simple vinyl group, like CH₂=CH-. But wait, the doublet of quartets might mean that each proton is coupling with two sets of protons. Maybe it's a substituent like a propenyl group or part of a substituent that's a bit more complex.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. And importantly, there are no –CH2 signals. So the molecule has two methyl groups, but no methylene groups. That suggests that the substituents on the benzene ring are either directly attached or have structures that don't include CH₂ groups. For example, esters have O-CO-O groups, but if the substituent is an ester, maybe as in O-CO-O-R, where R could be something like a methyl group.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so there are two substituents. Let's think about what substituents would fit these NMR signals.

The presence of an ester group suggests that one substituent is an ester. Let's say one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, more accurately, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is directly attached as a substituent, making the ring have an ester group (like in phenyl acetate, but with more substituents).

But wait, the other substituent might be an alkenyl group, considering the vinyl protons. So perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents: one ester group and another group with a vinyl (double bond) structure.

Wait, but the ester group in itself is connected via an oxygen to a carbonyl. Let's think, structure-wise. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Suppose the benzene ring has an ester substituent and another substituent that's a vinyl group. For example, maybe one substituent is OCOOR (like an ester) and the other is a CH₂=CH- group. But wait, the vinyl-H signals in the NMR are two, but perhaps the substituent is more complex.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a group like CH₂=CHCOOR. Wait, but that might have more hydrogens. Or perhaps each substituent is a group that contributes to the signals.

Wait, but the substituents are on the benzene ring. Let's think about possible structures.

Let me try to outline possible substituents.

Substituent 1: An ester group, say, -O-CO-R. R could be an alkyl group, like methyl, ethyl, etc.

Substituent 2: A vinyl group, perhaps -CH₂-CH₂- but that's not vinyl. Wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-. But if it's a vinyl group as a substituent, like -CH₂CH=CH₂? Or perhaps it's a substituent like -CH₂CH₂COOR. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two vinyl-H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That suggests that the vinyl protons are in different environments. For example, a trans coupling could lead to a doublet, but that's in simple cases. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a styryl group, like a substituent with a double bond adjacent to the ring.

Wait, maybe the substituent is something like a propenyl group. Let's imagine substituent 2 is -CH₂CH=CH₂. Then, the vinyl protons would be the ones on the double bond. But in that case, they'd split into different patterns depending on their environment.

Wait, but the ester group is another substituent. Let's think about how the substituents would affect the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups. But wait, the question says it's di-substituted, so two substituents.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals in the NMR. Let's think about the possible structure and how the protons would split.

The aromatic signals: two signals. For a di-substituted benzene, the possible substitution patterns are para, ortho, or meta.

If it's para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. Then the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the two protons ortho to substituent A and the two protons ortho to substituent B, but since it's para, the substituents are opposite, so the aromatic protons would be equivalent in two pairs. So that would give two signals for aromatic protons. That fits the data. So the substituents are para to each other.

So substituent 1 and substituent 2 are para.

Each substituent is a group attached to the ring. One is an ester group. Let's say substituent 1 is an ester, like -O-CO-R. What's R? Let's think about the NMR. The other substituent 2 is a vinyl group or something with vinyl protons.

Wait, but the ester group's structure could influence the number of signals. For example, if substituent 1 is -O-CO-R, and R is a methyl group, then the substituent is -O-CO-CH3 (a methyl ester). Then, the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group.

Then, substituent 2 could be a propenyl group or another group that has vinyl protons.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The two vinyl protons: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. That suggests that each set of protons is coupling with two different sets of protons. Hmm, perhaps that's from a coupling with adjacent groups.

Alternatively, maybe substituent 2 is a group like -CH₂CH=CH₂. But the vinyl protons in that case would be split based on their neighboring groups.

Wait, another possibility is that substituent 2 is a -CH₂-CH₂- group attached to something else. But wait, the NMR says there are no –CH₂ groups. Oh wait, the question says no –CH₂ groups. So substituent 2 can't have any methylene groups (CH₂). So substituent 2 must be a group that contains only CH3 and perhaps CH groups, but no CH2. So maybe substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to something else, but that doesn't make sense for vinyl.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group, like -CH=CH2. But then, would that have any CH2 groups? Because the substituent would be attached to the ring as -CH₂-CH₂-? No, wait, if it's a substituent like -CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-, but that would have CH2 groups, which would show up in the NMR as –CH2 signals. But the problem states there are no –CH2 signals. So substituent 2 must not have any CH2 groups.

So what groups don't have CH2 but have vinyl protons?

Perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached in a way that doesn't have any CH2. For example, a substituent like -CH=CH- attached to the ring. Wait, but that would require some sort of conjugated system. Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a styryl group, like -CH₂-CH=CH₂? No, that has a CH2. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the substituent could be a benzyl group, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, substituent 2 could be part of a ring, but that might not fit the data.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached via a double bond. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, substituent 2 is an allyl group: -CH₂-CH=CH₂. But that has a CH2 group, which is not allowed because the NMR doesn't show any –CH2 signals.

Hmm, so I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again about the NMR signals.

The vinyl signals: two signals. So perhaps there are two distinct sets of vinyl protons. One is a doublet, which might indicate that each proton is coupled to one other set of protons. The other is a doublet of quartets, meaning each proton is coupled to two different sets of protons (each coupling to two different J values).

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like -CH₂-CH₂-CH₂ but that's not possible because of the CH₂ issue.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a cyclopropane ring or something else. No, that's probably not it.

Alternatively, maybe substituent 2 is part of a substituent that's an ester itself. Wait, but the ester is already accounted for in substituent 1.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propargyl group (a triple bond), but that would have different NMR characteristics, like a singlet or certain coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a group where the vinyl protons are next to an oxygen or another electrondonating group, causing splitting.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a substituent with a double bond that's part of an ester group? That doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another thought: substituent 2 could be a group like -CH₂-CH₂-CO-O-R, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a -CH₂-COO-R group, but again, that would have CH2, which is not allowed.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The ester group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So for the substituent, perhaps the benzene ring has an ester group, like O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Let's say R is methyl, so substituent 1 is O-CO-Me.

Then substituent 2 is another group. Let's think about substituent 2.

Since there are two methyl groups (CH3) in the NMR, the substituent 2 might be a methyl group attached to something else. But if substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to the ring, then the benzene would have two substituents: O-CO-Me and Me. But wait, that would give more signals. But according to the NMR, we have two CH3 signals. So substituent 2 might be a group that has a CH3.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like a propenyl group (CH₂=CH-CH2-), but that has CH2, which is not allowed. Or substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a CH3. Like CH₂=CH-CH3. Wait, that's an isopropenyl group. So substituent 2 is -CH₂-CH₂-COOR? No, that would have CH2.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a group like -CH₂-COOR. That would have a CH2, which is not allowed.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the possible structure.

The benzene ring is di-substituted, para positions. One substituent is an ester group, say, -O-CO-R. The other substituent is a group that has vinyl protons and contributes to the CH3 signals.

Wait, substituent 1: -O-CO-R. Let's say R is a methyl group. So substituent is O-CO-CH3 (a methoxycarbonyl group).

Substituent 2: Let's think about it being a group that has a vinyl structure and a CH3. Since the NMR shows two CH3 signals, perhaps substituent 2 has two different methyl groups. But wait, the CH3 signals are two in number, so perhaps each substituent contributes one CH3.

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (one CH3). Substituent 2 is a group with another CH3.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a propenyl group attached to another CH3. For example, it could be a substituent like -CH₂-CH=CH2, but that has CH2. Not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a group like -CH=CH-CH3. So, the substituent would be a propenyl group with a methyl branch. Let's imagine the substituent as -CH₂-C(CH3)=CH2. No, that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl substituent attached. Like -CH2-CH2-COOR? No, that brings back the CH2.

Hmm. Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group where the vinyl protons are adjacent to a methyl group. For example, substituent 2 is a -CH2-CH2- group, but that's not allowed. Or perhaps substituent 2 is a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Hmm, but that's not a vinyl group.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a cyclopropenyl group, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a double bond. Like substituent 2 is -CH2-CH=CH2, but that has CH2 and a methyl. But the NMR doesn't show any CH2 signals, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to the ring via a double bond. Like -CH=CH-Me, but that's a possibility. Let me think. So substituent 2 is -CH=CH-Me attached to the ring.

So the structure would be:

Ph-O-CO-Me and Ph-CH=CH-Me?

Wait, but wait, that would make the benzene ring have two substituents: one ester group and one propenyl group with a methyl.

But in that case, the substituent is -CH=CH-Me. So the ring has two substituents: -O-CO-Me and -CH=CH-Me, both in para positions.

Now, looking at the NMR signals:

Aromatic protons: two signals, as expected for para substitution. So that makes sense.

Vinyl protons: The substituent -CH=CH-Me would have protons on the double bond. Let's see: the structure would be CH2=CH-Me attached to the benzene? No, the substituent would be CH2=CH- attached to the ring, and the Me is on the double bond. Wait, no. Wait, substituent 2 is -CH=CH-Me, so the structure is benzene ring attached to a CH2 group, but that's not right. Wait, no, the substituent would be directly attached to the ring, perhaps as -CH₂-CH=CH₂, but that has a CH2 which isn't allowed.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like -CH₂-CH₂-COOR, but that's not allowed due to CH2.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should consider the possible molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Each substituent contributes some carbons and hydrogens.

The ester group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So substituent 1 is R-O-CO-R'. Let's say R is methyl, so substituent 1 is O-CO-Me, which contributes 2 carbons (O, COO, and Me).

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-Me contributes 3 carbons (O isn't a carbon). Wait, no, O-CO-Me is O connected to C=O, then O connected to Me. So substituent 1 contributes (COO-) and a methyl, so the carbons are: 1 (COO) + 1 (Me) = 2 carbons.

Substituent 2: Let's say it's a vinyl group with a methyl. For example, substituent 2 is -CH₂-CH=CH₂. But that has a CH2, which isn't allowed.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a substituent without any CH2 groups, perhaps a -CH=CH2 group attached to the ring. But that would mean substituent 2 is a vinyl group without any CH2. So substituent 2 is -CH=CH2. So, the substituent is a propenyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but then substituent 2 is -CH2-CH=CH2, which has a CH2, which isn't allowed. Hmm.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a -CH=CH-CH3 group. So, substituent 2 would be a propenyl group with a methyl at the end. That would have structure: CH2=CH-CH3. But substituent 2 would be attached to the ring via the CH2: -CH2-CH=CH3. But that has a CH2, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group where the double bond is directly attached to the ring. Like substituent 2 is a -CH=CH- group, but that would only have two carbons, which may not have a CH3.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals. So substituent 1 is O-CO-Me (which has a CH3 from the methyl group), and substituent 2 must have another CH3.

Hmm, so substituent 2 must have a CH3 group. Let's see.

Suppose substituent 2 is a -CH2-COOR group. But that would have CH2, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a -CH(CH3)- group. Wait, that's an isopropyl group, but that's a single substituent. Wait, but substituent 2 would be a substituent on the ring, so perhaps it's -CH(CH3)- attached to the ring. But that's a single substituent. Wait, but it's a di-substituted ring, so substituent 2 is another substituent.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like -CH(CH3)-CH2-... but that brings back the CH2.

I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should think about the molecular formula.

The benzene ring has 6 carbons. Each substituent adds more carbons.

The ester group (substituent 1) is O-CO-R. If R is methyl, that's 1 carbon. So substituent 1 contributes 2 carbons (the COO and the methyl).

Wait, no: O-CO-R, where R is methyl. So substituent 1 is O-CO-Me. So in terms of carbons: the ring is 6, substituent 1 is 2 carbons (O is not a carbon, but the O is connected to COO. Wait, no, substituent 1 would be -O-CO-Me, which is three atoms: O, C, and another C (Me). So the substituent contributes 1 carbon (from the COO group) and 1 from the Me.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is -O-CO-R, where R is a propyl group. But that would add more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the ester is -O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. That would add three carbons from substituent 1.

Wait, but the problem states the total formula is one of the options, which are C11... up to C12.

Let me calculate: benzene is C6H6.

Substituent 1: -O-CO-R. Let's say R is methyl (so substituent is -O-CO-Me). That adds 2 carbons (from COO and Me) and 3 oxygens? Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So substituent is O-CO-R' (where R' is an alkyl group). So substituent 1 is O-CO-R', which adds (1 for COO) + (n for R') carbons.

So substituent 1 adds (n+1) carbons (the COO is one C, and R' is n carbons). For example, R' is methyl (n=1): substituent 1 is -O-CO-CH3, adding 2 carbons.

Substituent 2: Let's say it's a vinyl group with a methyl. So substituent 2 is -CH2-CH=CH2. But that has a CH2, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3. Then, substituent 2 adds 3 carbons (the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and a methyl on carbon 3). So substituent 2 adds 3 carbons.

So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (substituent 1) + 3 (substituent 2) = 11.

Hydrogens: Let's count.

Benzene: 6 H.

Substituent 1 (O-CO-Me): the methyl has 3 H, but since it's an ester, substituent 1 has 3 H.

Substituent 2 (CH=CH-CH3): the double bond has 2 H on each adjacent carbon. Let's see: the structure is CH2=CH-CH3. But substituent 2 is attached to the ring, so the structure is -(CH2=CH-CH3). Wait, that's substituent 2 as -CH2-CH=CH3. Wait, but that has a CH2, which is not allowed.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is -CH=CH2 attached to a methyl. Wait, no, that's the same as CH2=CH-CH3, which has a CH2.

I'm still stuck. Maybe I should approach this from the NMR signals.

We have two CH3 groups. One is from the ester's R group, say methyl (3 H). The other CH3 is from substituent 2. So substituent 2 must have another CH3.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a group like -CH(CH3)-. But that's a single substituent, and we have a di-substituted ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a group with a CH3 attached to the ring via a double bond. For example, substituent 2 is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group, but that contains a CH2 which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a cyclopropane ring? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-, but that has CH2 and is probably not the case.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a group like -C(CH3)=CH2. So substituent 2 is -(C(CH3)=CH2). That would have a CH3 and a vinyl group without any CH2.

Wait, substituent 2 attached to the ring would look like -C(CH3)=CH2. So the substituent is a vinyl group with a methyl branch.

In that case, substituent 2 would have two protons on the double bond (each on the CH2 and the CH(CH3)), but wait, the structure would be CH2=C(CH3)- attached to the ring. So the substituent is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's more complicated.

Wait, substituent 2 as -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 would have a CH2, which isn't allowed. So perhaps substituent 2 is -C(CH3)=CH2, meaning the substituent is directly attached to the ring as CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that would have a CH2, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like -CH=CH-CH(CH3), but that's still a CH2.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a -CH=CH- group with a methyl on one of the carbons, so like -CH(CH3)-CH2-, but that has CH2.

I'm really stuck here. Let's think about the possible molecular formula.

If the molecular formula is C11H12O2, then the degree of unsaturation can help.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, DoU = (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2 = 6.

Each ring and double bond contributes 1 DoU.

Benzene ring contributes 4 DoU (3 from the double bonds and 1 from the ring). Then, substituent 1 (ester) has a carbonyl (1 DoU), and substituent 2 could have a double bond (another DoU). So total DoU is 4 + 1 + 1 =6. That fits.

So the formula could be C11H12O2 (option D) or C12H12O2 (option C), etc.

Wait, let's count:

Benzene (6 C, 6 H).

Substituent 1: O-CO-Me (2 C, 3 H).

Substituent 2: Let's say substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a methyl, like CH2=CHCH3. Wait, but that has CH2.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group with a double bond and a methyl without any CH2. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CH2? No, that's ethylene, which doesn't have a methyl.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like CH2=CHCH3, but that has CH2.

Wait, let me try substituent 2 as a -CH2- group attached to a double bond. No, that brings back CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a cyclopropane ring, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a -CH3 group attached to the ring. But then, substituent 2 is a methyl group. But that would give only one substituent with a methyl.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So substituent 1 is O-CO-Me (3 H), and substituent 2 is a group with another CH3.

So substituent 2 must have a CH3. But without any CH2 groups.

If substituent 2 is a -CH(CH3)- group, but that's a single substituent. Wait, but the ring is di-substituted, so substituent 1 is O-CO-Me, substituent 2 is a group with a CH3.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a -CH3 group. So substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to the ring.

But then, the ring's substituents are O-CO-Me and Me, both para. That would give a structure with two methyl groups, one as part of an ester.

So the structure would be p-methyl benzoate. Let me check: benzoic acid ester.

Wait, p-methyl benzoate would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-O-Me attached to the ring at the para position. But wait, that's not correct. p-methyl benzoate would have the ester group as the substituent and a methyl group in the para position. So the benzene has O-CO-Me and Me in para.

So the structure would be 4-methyl benzoate.

Let me count the hydrogens and carbons.

Benzene: 6 C, 6 H.

Ester substituent: O-CO-Me. So that's O connected to C, which is double-bonded to O, and single-bonded to OMe. So substituent 1 is O-CO-Me. So substituent 1 adds 2 C (the COO and Me) and 3 H (from the Me).

Substituent 2 is a methyl group (Me) attached in para. So substituent 2 adds 1 C and 3 H.

So total C: 6 + 2 + 1 =9. But the options are C11..., so 9 doesn't match any of the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is another group with a CH3. For example, substituent 2 is a propenyl group with a methyl branch. Let's say substituent 2 is -CH2-CH=CH2, but that has CH2, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like -CH=CH-CH3. Then substituent 2 adds 3 C and 5 H (since it's a vinyl group with a methyl).

Wait, substituent 2 as -CH=CH-CH3 would have the structure CH2=CH-CH3 attached to the ring. But that would have a CH2, which is not allowed.

This is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think about the number of protons in each signal.

The NMR shows six signals:

- Two aromatic H.

- Two vinyl H: one doublet, one doublet of quartets.

- Two CH3.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-R (R is a methyl, perhaps). So substituent 1 contributes 3 H from the methyl.

Substituent 2: must contribute 3 H (another CH3). So substituent 2 is a group with a CH3. But without any CH2.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a -CH3 group attached to another group without CH2. For example, substituent 2 is -C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, substituent 2 would be -C(CH3)=CH2. So structure would be benzene ring with substituents O-CO-Me and -C(CH3)=CH2.

But wait, substituent 2 in this case is -C(CH3)=CH2. So substituent 2 is attached to the ring as a vinyl group with a methyl branch.

So substituent 2 is -(CH2)=C(CH3)- ?

Wait, no. Substituent 2 would be -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's three carbons.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is -CH=CH-C(CH3). So the substituent is attached as CH=CH-C(CH3), but that's four carbons. Hmm.

But in any case, substituent 2 would have a CH3 group and a vinyl group.

So let's count the carbons:

Benzene:6.

Substituent 1: O-CO-Me → 2 C.

Substituent 2: Let's say substituent 2 is -CH=CH-C(CH3) → 3 C.

Wait, that's 6 + 2 +3=11 C. So the molecular formula would be C11H?O2.

Hydrogen count:

Benzene:6 H.

Substituent 1: Me in ester → 3 H.

Substituent 2: -(CH2)=C(CH3)- ... Wait, no, substituent 2 as -CH=CH-C(CH3) would have:

Each CH in the double bond has 1 H each → 2 H.

The C(CH3) has 3 H in the methyl group.

So substituent 2 contributes 2 + 3 =5 H.

Wait, but wait, the substituent is a group like -CH=CH-C(CH3)2? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is -(CH2)=C(CH3)-, but that would have a CH2.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group with two CH3 and a double bond. But I'm not making progress here.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like -CH2-CH=CH2, but that has a CH2, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenyl group (CH₂=CH-CH₂-), but again, that has CH2.

I think I'm missing something here. Let me try to think of the substituents again.

Since there are no CH2 groups in the molecule, substituents cannot have any. So substituent 1 is O-CO-Me (no CH2), substituent 2 must be a group without any CH2.

So substituent 2 could be a vinyl group without any CH2. For example, substituent 2 is a -CH=CH- group attached to the ring. But that would require the substituent to be -CH=CH- attached to the ring, which would mean the substituent is a double bond between two CH groups. But then, where is the CH3?

Wait, substituent 2 must have a CH3 to account for the two CH3 signals. So substituent 2 must have a CH3. But without any CH2.

So substituent 2 could be a -CH(CH3)=CH2 group, but that has a CH2.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a -C(CH3)=CH2 group. So substituent 2 is attached to the ring as -C(CH3)=CH2. That would have a CH3 and a double bond, but no CH2 groups. Let me see:

Structure: benzene ring with substituent 1 as O-CO-Me and substituent 2 as -C(CH3)=CH2.

So substituent 2 is -C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, substituent 2 would have:

- The carbon attached to the ring (C1) is connected to a CH3 and a double bond (C1=C2).

- C2 is connected to two Hs (since it's a double bond, each C in the double bond has one H each if it's CH2, but in this case, substituent 2 is -C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that substituent is actually -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that would have a CH2.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a group like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that has a CH2, which is not allowed.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I need to consider that substituent 2 is a group that has a methyl and a vinyl group without any CH2. For example, substituent 2 is a group like -CH=CH-CH(CH3), but that would have a CH2? Or perhaps substituent 2 is a group where the double bond is directly attached to the ring, without any CH2.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a -CH=CH- group attached to a methyl. But how?

Wait, substituent 2 is -CH2-CH=CH2 would have CH2. Not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3. So the substituent is CH=CH-CH3 attached to the ring. So substituent 2 would have a double bond and a methyl group. So substituent 2 adds 3 carbons.

In that case, the substituent 2 would contribute 2 H from the double bond and 3 H from the methyl.

So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ester) + 3 (substituent 2) =11.

Hydrogen count: benzene has 6, substituent 1 has 3 (from methyl), substituent 2 has 2 (from double bond) +3 (from methyl) =5. So total H =6 +3 +5=14. But looking at the options, for C11H14O2, option A is C11H14O2, and option D is C11H12O2.

Wait, but that would make the formula C11H14O2 (option A) or C11H12O2 (option D).

Wait, but I'm not considering the hydrogens from the ring. Benzene has 6 H, but when substituents are added, some H are lost.

Wait, the benzene ring is di-substituted, so we're replacing two H with substituents. So, benzene is C6H6. Each substituent replaces one H. So for two substituents, we have 6-2=4 H on the ring.

But according to the NMR, there are two aromatic signals. That suggests that the ring has two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. So in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite, leading to two equivalent protons in each ortho position, but that might only give two signals.

Wait, for a para-disubstituted benzene, the two substituents are opposite, leading to two sets of aromatic protons: each set has two equivalent H. So NMR shows two signals: one for each set.

So aromatic H count: 4 H in total (2 sets of 2 H each).

So the H count so far is:

Aromatic: 4.

Substituent 1 (O-CO-Me): 3 H (from methyl).

Substituent 2: let's say substituent 2 is a propenyl group with a methyl, like -CH=CH-CH3. So substituent 2 contributes 2 H (from the double bond) and 3 H (from the methyl).

So substituent 2: 5 H.

Total H: 4 +3 +5=12.

But wait, the options have formulas with H counts up to 14.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is longer. Let's think of substituent 2 as a group that has more H.

Alternatively, maybe substituent 2 has a structure that contributes more H.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a -CH=CH-CH2-CH3 group. But that has CH2, which is not allowed.

Hmm. I'm getting more confused. Let me try to calculate using the options.

Option D is C11H12O2. Let's see if that fits.

Molecular formula: C11H12O2.

Degree of unsaturation: (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6.

Which matches with benzene (4), ester carbonyl (1), and substituent double bond (1). So that works.

If substituent 2 is a group that adds 5 C (since 6 + 2 (ester) +5 would be 13, which is over), no, that can't be.

Wait, benzene is 6 C. Ester substituent is O-CO-R. Let's say R is ethyl (2 C), then substituent 1 contributes 3 C (O-CO and ethyl). Wait, no, O-CO-R would be substituent 1 as O-CO-R, where R is ethyl (2 C). So substituent 1 adds 3 C (COO and R).

Substituent 2: Let's say it's a group with 2 C (like ethyl), but that would contribute 2 C.

So total C:6 +3 +2=11. That fits option D (C11H12O2).

So let's see the H count.

Benzene:6 H, but with two substituents, so 4 H.

Substituent 1 (O-CO-Et): ethyl group has 5 H (2 from each CH2 and 1 from CH3). Wait, no, substituent 1 is O-CO-OEt? No, substituent 1 is O-CO-R, where R is ethyl.

Wait, substituent 1 is -O-CO-OEt? No, substituent 1 is an ester group, which is O-CO-R. So substituent 1 is O-CO-R, where R is ethyl. So substituent 1 has O-CO-OEt? No, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So substituent 1 is O-CO-R' where R' is ethyl.

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-OCH2CH3. No, that would be the ester group. Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, if substituent 1 is an ester group, perhaps as O-CO-R', where R' is ethyl. So substituent 1 is -O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, that's incorrect. The ester group is O-CO connected to a R group, but the R is not necessarily an oxygen. Let's clarify.

Ester structure: R-O-CO-R'. So substituent 1 is O-CO-R' where R' is ethyl. So substituent 1 contributes 3 C (O-CO and ethyl).

So substituent 1's H: the ethyl group has 5 H.

Substituent 2: let's say it's a methyl group. So substituent 2 is -CH3. Then substituent 2 contributes 3 H.

So total H: 4 (aromatic) +5 (ester) +3 (methyl) =12 H. That matches option D, which is C11H12O2.

But wait, the 1H NMR shows two vinyl protons. So substituent 2 must have a vinyl group. Hmm. So substituent 2 can't be a methyl group because the NMR shows vinyl protons.

Ah, right! Substituent 2 must have vinyl protons, so substituent 2 can't be a simple methyl.

So let me re-examine. Substituent 2 must have a vinyl group (protons on a double bond) and a methyl group (to account for the two CH3 signals).

So substituent 2 is a group with a double bond and a methyl, without any CH2 groups.

An example would be a vinyl group with a methyl branch, like -CH=CH-CH3. But that would have a CH2 group, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a group where the double bond is directly attached to the ring and the methyl is on the same carbon, like -C(CH3)=CH2.

So substituent 2 is -C(CH3)=CH2 attached to the ring.

In that case, substituent 2 contributes 3 C (the C attached to the ring, the CH3, and the CH2 in the double bond).

Wait, no, substituent 2 would be -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that has a CH2, which is not allowed.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like -CH=CH2 attached to a methyl, but without any CH2.

Wait, substituent 2 could be a group where the double bond is between two CH groups, each with a methyl. But that would require more substituents.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group where one of the double bond carbons has a methyl group attached, but no CH2 groups.

For example, substituent 2 is -CH(CH3)=CH2. But that would have a CH2.

Wait, substituent 2 is -CH2-CH=CH-CH3. No, that has CH2.

I think I'm not making progress here. Let me try to calculate the molecular formula again.

If the formula is C11H12O2, then the substituent 1 (ester) must be O-CO-R, and substituent 2 must be a group with 4 C (since 6 + 2 + 3 =11, but that might not fit). Wait, 6 (benzene) + substituent 1 (3 C) + substituent 2 (2 C) =11. So substituent 2 has 2 C.

But substituent 2 must have a double bond and a methyl group. So substituent 2 is perhaps a -CH=CH-Me. But that would be three C: CH=CH-Me.

Wait, substituent 2 is -CH2-CH=CH-Me. No, that's four C and has CH2.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a -CH=CH- group attached to a methyl. But that would require a longer chain.

Wait, substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH2-Me. But that's four C and has CH2.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should give up and look for another approach.

Another approach: the NMR has two CH3 signals. So substituents must contribute two different CH3 groups. Substituent 1 is O-CO-Me (so one CH3), substituent 2 must have another CH3.

But substituent 2 can't have any CH2 groups. So substituent 2 is a group where the CH3 is directly attached to a double bond.

For example, substituent 2 is -CH(CH3)=CH2. But that has a CH2.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is -C(CH3)=CH2. So substituent 2 is a group where the substituent is attached to the ring via a carbon that is double-bonded to another carbon, which is attached to a methyl.

Wait, substituent 2 would be -(CH2)=C(CH3)-. But that has a CH2.

No, I'm not getting it. Maybe substituent 2 is a group like -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But that has CH2.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a group like -CH2-C≡C-CH3, but that's triple bonds and beyond the scope.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like -C≡C-CH3, but that's a triple bond, which would show up as a different NMR signal.

I'm really not getting this. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → 11 C, 14 H, 2 O.

B) C12H14O2 → 12 C, 14 H, 2 O.

C) C12H12O2 → 12 C, 12 H, 2 O.

D) C11H12O2 → 11 C, 12 H, 2 O.

So, based on the NMR, substituent 2 must contribute a certain number of H. Let's think about how many H each substituent would contribute.

Substituent 1: O-CO-R, R is methyl → substituent 1 contributes 3 H.

Substituent 2: must contribute 9 H (because total H is 12 for option D: 4 aromatic +3 + substituent2 H =12 → substituent 2 H=5). Wait, no, 4 +3 +5=12. So substituent 2 has 5 H.

Wait, substituent 2 has a double bond and a methyl. So perhaps substituent 2 has 5 H. How?

For example, substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3. That would have 5 H: 2 from the double bond and 3 from the methyl.

So substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3.

But that's three C: CH=CH-CH3. So substituent 2 adds 3 C.

So total C: 6 (benzene) +3 (ester substituent) +3 (substituent 2) =12 C. That would make the formula C12H12O2 (option C). But wait, let's check the H count.

Benzene:4 H.

Substituent 1:3 H.

Substituent 2:5 H.

Total H:4 +3 +5=12. So formula is C12H12O2, which is option C.

But let me check the NMR again.

The substituent 2's structure is -CH=CH-CH3. So the substituent has two H on the double bond (each on the CH groups) and three H on the methyl.

But in the NMR, substituent 2 would have two signals: one for the vinyl protons and one for the methyl.

Wait, but substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3. The vinyl protons are on the CH groups, which are adjacent to each other. So each proton on the vinyl group would couple with each other, leading to a doublet.

But according to the NMR, there are two vinyl signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So substituent 2's vinyl protons must split into two different signals.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group where the vinyl protons are in different environments, leading to two different signals.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a group like -CH2-CH=CH2, but that has CH2, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a group like -CH=CH-CH3, but that's three C and has CH2 in the substituent.

Wait, substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3 attached to the ring. So substituent 2 would have a structure where the double bond is between two CH groups, each attached to a CH3.

Wait, no, substituent 2 structure would be:

Ring-CH2-CH=CH3 → but that has a CH2, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3, but that's connected directly to the ring, so:

Ring-CH=CH-CH3. But that substituent would have a CH2 if the ring is attached to the first carbon.

Wait, no, substituent 2 would be -CH=CH-CH3 attached in a way that the ring is connected to the first carbon, making the substituent -(CH2)=CH-CH3. No, that's a CH2.

This is so confusing. Maybe the correct answer is option B or A.

Alternatively, considering the molecular formula, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation.

The benzene ring contributes 4 DoU.

Ester group has a carbonyl (1 DoU).

Substituent 2 has a double bond (1 DoU).

Total DoU: 4+1+1=6.

Which matches the formula C11H12O2 (DoU 6). So option D is C11H12O2.

So substituent 2 must have a double bond and contribute 5 H (since 12 H total: 4 +3 +5 =12).

If substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3, which would contribute 5 H, that's correct.

But substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3, which has three C: CH=CH-CH3.

So total C:6 +3 (ester) +3=12? No, 6 + (ester substituent: O-CO-Me is 2 C) +3=11 C. So formula would be C11H12O2 (option D).

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-Me (2 C) and substituent 2 is CH=CH-CH3 (3 C). So total C:6+2+3=11.

So the formula is C11H12O2, which is option D.

But wait, substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3. So the substituent is attached to the benzene as -CH2-CH=CH3, which has a CH2 group. But the NMR says there are no CH2 groups. So that's a problem.

So substituent 2 cannot have any CH2 groups. Therefore, substituent 2 must be attached directly to the ring without any CH2.

So substituent 2 must be a group like -CH=CH-CH3 attached via the first carbon, making the structure ring-CH=CH-CH3. That substituent does not have any CH2 groups. So substituent 2 is -(CH2)=CH-CH3? No, that would have a CH2.

Wait, substituent 2 is -CH2-CH=CH3 → has CH2. Not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is -CH=CH-CH3 attached directly, meaning the ring is connected to the first carbon of the double bond. So substituent 2 is -(CH2)=CH-CH3. Wait, that's the same as before.

I'm going in circles again. Maybe the correct answer is option B) C12H14O2.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the NMR again.

The NMR shows six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, and two CH3.

If the structure is a para-substituted benzene with substituent 1 as O-CO-Me and substituent 2 as CH=CH-CH3, but that has CH2 which is not allowed.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a group where the double bond is between two carbons, each with a methyl group.

For example, substituent 2 is -(CH3)C=CH2. So substituent 2 is -C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, substituent 2 contributes 2 C (the C attached to the ring and the CH2 in the double bond), plus the methyl.

Wait, substituent 2 is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. That has a CH2, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is -C(CH3)=CH2. So substituent 2 is attached directly to the ring as C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, substituent 2 has 3 C: the C attached to the ring (with a methyl), the CH2 in the double bond, and the CH2? No, that's not right.

Wait, substituent 2 is -C(CH3)=CH2. So substituent 2 has two carbons in the double bond plus the methyl. So substituent 2 is a group with 3 C.

So total C:6+2+3=11. Again, C11H12O2.

But the substituent 2 is -C(CH3)=CH2, which has a CH2 group (since the substituent is C(CH3)=CH2, the CH2 is part of the substituent). So that's not allowed.

I'm stuck. I think I'll have to make a guess based on the molecular formula and the number of signals.

The correct answer is likely D) C11H12O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on FTIR and 1H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of an ester group, and the 1H NMR spectrum shows six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups (no signals for methylene groups).

### Key Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**: The presence of an ester group (-COO-) is confirmed, suggesting one substituent is an ester group.

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals indicate a para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring.
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) suggest the presence of a vinyl group with two distinct environments.
   - **Methyl Groups**: Two signals indicate the presence of two distinct methyl groups, with no methylene (-CH₂-) groups.

3. **Structure of the Compound**:
   - The benzene ring is para-substituted, with one substituent being an ester group (-O-CO-R) and the other being a vinyl group with a methyl branch.
   - The ester group contributes one methyl group (from -COO-R), and the vinyl group contributes the second methyl group.

4. **Molecular Formula**:
   - The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons.
   - The ester group (-O-CO-R) contributes 2 carbons (from -COO- and R).
   - The vinyl group with a methyl branch contributes 3 carbons.
   - Total carbons = 6 + 2 + 3 = 11.
   - Hydrogen count: 4 aromatic protons (from the para-substituted benzene), 3 hydrogens from the ester methyl group, and 5 hydrogens from the vinyl group and its methyl branch. Total hydrogens = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12.
   - Oxygen count: 2 (from the ester group).

   Thus, the molecular formula is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

5. **Elimination of Other Options**:
   - **C₁₁H₁₄O₂** (Option A): Incorrect, as it has two additional hydrogens, which are not supported by the NMR data.
   - **C₁₂H₁₄O₂** (Option B): Incorrect, as it has one additional carbon and two additional hydrogens.
   - **C₁₂H₁₂O₂** (Option C): Incorrect, as it has one additional carbon but matches the hydrogen count, which is inconsistent with the structure derived.
   - **C₁₁H₁₂O₂** (Option D): Correct, as it matches the derived molecular formula and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₁H₁₂O₂**.

Answer: D
