Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. So, the first part is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Then, I also need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay, so the operator's matrix has zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Wait, but wait, the matrix size depends on the dimension of the space. Since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the Hilbert space is two-dimensional. So the operator matrix would be 2x2. Let me write that out.

In a two-dimensional space, the matrix A would look like:
[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Because A_ij is 0 when i=j and ħ/2 otherwise. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and off-diagonal (i≠j) are ħ/2. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the problem is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator A when the state is |alpha>. Also, find the expectation value (average) of A.

Wait, but the system is in state |alpha>, which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I need to normalize |alpha> because it's proportional, not necessarily of unit length.

Let me first calculate the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|1+i|² + |2 - i|²).

Calculating |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2? Because |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². So 1^2 +1^2=2.

|2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Wait, no: The original expression is proportional, so |alpha> = C*(...), so C must be 1/sqrt(7) because the coefficient's squared magnitudes sum to 7, so C^2 *7 =1 → C=1/sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7 ]|up> + [ (2 -i)/√7 ] |down>.

Now, the next step is to find the eigenstates of operator A. Because the measurement probabilities depend on the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

So let's find the eigenstates of A. The operator A is a 2x2 matrix:

A = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, first compute its eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) =0.

So determinant of [ -λ    ħ/2 ]
               [ ħ/2   -λ ]

Which is λ² - (ħ²/4) =0 → λ² = ħ²/4 → λ=± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. Now, the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

For λ=ħ/2:

A - (ħ/2) I = [ -ħ/2    ħ/2 ]
              [ ħ/2    -ħ/2 ]

The equations are:

-ħ/2 * x + ħ/2 * y =0 → -x + y=0 → y=x.

So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of (1,1). But we can normalize them. So the eigenvectors are of the form (1,1)/√2 for the positive eigenvalue.

Wait, wait, let me make sure. Let me write the system for λ= ħ/2.

The matrix is:

[ -λ, ħ/2 ]  
[ ħ/2, -λ ]

So, substituting λ= ħ/2:

[ -ħ/2, ħ/2 ] → equation: (-ħ/2)x + (ħ/2)y =0 → -x + y=0 → y=x.

So any vector (a, a) is an eigenvector. The normalized version would be (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly for λ= -ħ/2: The matrix becomes [ ħ/2, ħ/2; ħ/2, ħ/2 ].

Wait, no: Wait, for λ= -ħ/2, the matrix is A - (-ħ/2) I = [ ħ/2, ħ/2; ħ/2, ħ/2 ].

But the equations are (ħ/2)x + (ħ/2)y =0 → x + y=0 → y= -x.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, -a) → normalized as (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the two eigenstates of A are |+> = (1,1)/√2 and |-> = (1,-1)/√2, corresponding to eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me double-check. When we apply A to |+>, the result should be λ |+>.

A acting on (1,1) is: (0*1 + ħ/2 *1, ħ/2 *1 +0*1 ) = ( ħ/2, ħ/2 ). So A (1,1) = ħ/2 (1,1), which matches λ= ħ/2. So yes, correct.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (1,1)/√2 and |-> = (1,-1)/√2.

Now, the state |alpha> is expressed in the standard basis (|up> and |down>). We need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Wait, no. Actually, the measurement will project |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A, and the probabilities will be the square of the absolute value of the inner product.

So the probability P_+ of measuring the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is | < + | alpha > |², and similarly P_- for the other eigenvalue.

So, let's compute < + | alpha >.

The state |alpha> is written as:

|alpha> = (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2 -i)/√7 |down>.

The eigenstate |+> is (|up> + |down>)/√2.

So the inner product < + | alpha > is [ (1+ i)/√7 * 1/(√2) ) ] + [ (2 - i)/√7 * 1/(√2) ) ]

Let me compute this:

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (√7 * √2 )

Simplify numerator:

(1+i +2 -i) = 3.

So < + | alpha > = 3/(√7 * √2 ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability P_+ is | < + | alpha > |^2 = (9)/(14).

Similarly, compute < - | alpha >.

The eigenstate |-> is (|up> - |down>)/√2.

So inner product is [ (1+i)/√7 * 1/√2 ] - [ (2 - i)/√7 * (1/√2) ]

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (√7 * √2 )

Simplify numerator:

(1 +i -2 +i ) = (-1 + 2i)

So < - | alpha > = (-1 + 2i)/(√7 √2 )

The probability P_- is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 / (√7 √2)^2.

|(-1 +2i)|² is (1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. The denominator is (7 * 2 ) =14.

So P_- =5/14.

Wait, but wait, let me compute again.

Wait, the inner product < - | alpha > is [ (1+i) - (2-i) ] / (√7 √2 )

Which is (1 +i -2 +i ) = ( -1 + 2i ). So yes, that's correct.

The magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) = 1+4=5. So P_-=5/14.

But wait, when I computed P_+, I got 3^2=9, over 14, so P_+ =9/14 ≈0.6429, and P_- is 5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, but wait, because 9 +5=14, so that's correct, as probabilities sum to 1.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36. Let me check option A: A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

But wait, the average value of the operator A is <A> = sum ( eigenvalue * probability ).

So, the expectation value is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) )= [9/14 * ħ/2 ] - [5/14 * ħ/2 ].

Which is ( (9-5)/14 ) * ħ/2.

(4/14)* ħ/2 → (2/7) * ħ/2 → (2 * ħ )/(7 * 2 ) → ħ /7.

So the expectation value is ħ /7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that matches.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → which seems correct.

But wait, let me make sure. Did I compute the probabilities correctly?

Wait, I had:

< + | alpha > =3/(sqrt(14)), so |...|^2 =9/14.

Similarly, < - | alpha > = (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)), so |...|² is (1+4)/14 =5/14.

Yes, that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.642857 (≈0.64) and 5/14≈0.3571 (≈0.36), which matches option A's first two values, and the expectation is ħ/7, which is option A's third value.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking at option B, which has 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt(7). Hmm, but my calculation doesn't match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the eigenstates or the inner products. Let me double-check.

Wait, I had |+> as (|up> + |down>)/√2, which is correct because A acting on that gives (ħ/2)(|up> + |down>).

But maybe I should verify the inner products again.

The state |alpha> is (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So when I compute < + | alpha >, it's [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, no: Wait, |+> is 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down> ), so the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) ?

Wait, no: Wait, more accurately, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) times [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1+i + 2 -i )/sqrt(7) ].

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) * (3 / sqrt(7)) )=3/(sqrt(14)).

So the magnitude squared is 9/14, correct.

And for |->, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ].

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i -2 +i )/sqrt(7) ] → ( (-1 +2i) ) / (sqrt(14)).

So the squared magnitude is ( (-1)^2 +2^2 )/(14) → (1+4)/14=5/14.

So everything checks out.

Therefore, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the expectation is ħ/7.

Looking at the options again, option A is the only one with these values.

Wait, but let me check option D to see if I made a mistake.

Option D says 0.61, 0.29, and 2hbar/sqrt(7). So the probabilities don't match.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state |α>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. The state |up⟩ and |down⟩ are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. First, we normalize |α>. The normalization factor is determined by calculating the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:  

- \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \),  
- \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).  

The total squared magnitude is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:  
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) if \( i = j \). In the two-dimensional space spanned by |up⟩ and |down⟩, the matrix of \( A \) is:  
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenstates of \( A \), we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \):  
\[
\det \begin{bmatrix} 
-\lambda & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 
\frac{\hbar}{2} & -\lambda 
\end{bmatrix} = \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 = 0.
\]  
The eigenvalues are \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenstates are:  
- For \( \lambda = \frac{\hbar}{2} \): \( |+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩) \),  
- For \( \lambda = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \): \( |−⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩) \).

To compute the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), we calculate the overlap of |α⟩ with the eigenstates |+⟩ and |−⟩. The probability of measuring \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) is:  
\[
P_+ = |\langle + | α \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) \right|^2.
\]  
Simplifying the numerator:  
\[
(1+i) + (2-i) = 3.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
P_+ = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}.
\]

Similarly, the probability of measuring \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) is:  
\[
P_- = |\langle - | α \rangle|^2 = \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) \right|^2.
\]  
Simplifying the numerator:  
\[
(1+i) - (2-i) = -1 + 2i.
\]  
Thus:  
\[
P_- = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{(-1)^2 + (2)^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

The probabilities are \( P_+ = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64 \) and \( P_- = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36 \).  

To compute the average value of \( A \), we use the expectation value formula:  
\[
\langle A \rangle = P_+ \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P_- \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]  
Substituting \( P_+ = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P_- = \frac{5}{14} \):  
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{(9 - 5)}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options:  
- Option A: \( 0.64, 0.36, \frac{\hbar}{7} \) matches the calculated probabilities and expectation value.  

Thus, the correct answer is:  

**Answer: A**
