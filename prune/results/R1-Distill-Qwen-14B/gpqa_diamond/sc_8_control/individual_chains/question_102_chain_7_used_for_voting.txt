Alright, I need to tackle this question. Let's start by breaking down the information given.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and their interaction's developmental fate. The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one vector, right? So, this vector probably allows for the expression of both the ligand and the receptor from a single transcript but under different promoters or something.

The vector setup: The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I recall is a strong promoter. Then, upstream of the receptor is an IRES regulatory element. IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry sites, so they can drive the translation of a downstream ORF without it being part of the same mRNA as the upstream ORF. Oh wait, but in bicistronic vectors, sometimes the IRES is used to allow the second gene to be expressed from the same mRNA. So here, maybe the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand's stop signal or something.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. LoxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. If the Cre is introduced, it would excise the stop cassette. So, when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the downstream genes (mCherry and eGFP) to be expressed.

So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent expression of mCherry and eGFP. Because the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, without Cre, the mCherry wouldn't be expressed. Similarly, the receptor would have its ORF followed by a stop before eGFP. So only when Cre is active would the stops be removed, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed as fusion proteins with the ligand and receptor, respectively.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic, so both the ligand and receptor are on one construct. The ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP. So, the proteins of interest would be the ligand (without mCherry) and the receptor (without eGFP). Or, wait, perhaps the fusion proteins are ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. Because the ORF is fused to the fluorescent proteins.

Wait, the setup: "the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus." So, the mRNA would have both ORFs. The ligand is at 5', then stop, then mCherry. Wait, no, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop in loxP-stop-loxP. So without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so the mRNA would only code up to the stop, meaning the ligand would be expressed, but the mCherry would not. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette. So, the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP wouldn't unless Cre removes the stop.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the structure. Let me think again. The vector is bicistronic, so it's two ORFs in one mRNA. The first ORF is ligand, under CBA promoter; then a stop with loxP cassette. Then, another ORF, the receptor, under IRES, followed by a stop with lox2272 cassette. Wait, no, the way it's written is ligand ORF at 5' (so first), fused to mCherry, but with a stop and loxP cassette in between. So perhaps the ligand is expressed as ligand-mCherry fusion, but only if the stop is removed. The receptor is at the 3', and its ORF is followed by a stop and lox2272 cassette, then eGFP? Or is the eGFP part of the receptor construct, making it a fusion? Hmm.

Wait, the question says "the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus." So, the ligand's ORF is connected to mCherry, meaning it would be a ligand-mCherry fusion protein. Similarly, the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, so receptor-eGFP.

But the vector is set up with stop cassettes. So, in the normal state (without Cre), the ligand ORF is followed by a stop and loxP cassette, so the mRNA would code for the ligand, then stop, meaning the mCherry part would not be expressed. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop and lox2272, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But when Cre is present, it recognizes the loxP and lox2272 sites, which are different, so Cre will excise the stop cassettes. So, the ligand ORF would be followed by the mCherry without a stop, allowing ligand-mCherry fusion. Similarly, the receptor would be followed by eGFP, so receptor-eGFP.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how the Cre excision works. LoxP is a 34 bp sequence, and lox2272 is a longer variant. Cre can only excise if the loxP sites are in a certain arrangement, like in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So, when Cre is present, it would cut the loxP sites and remove the stop, allowing the downstream ORF to be expressed.

So in this case, the ligand's ORF is followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So, without Cre, the mRNA would stop at the stop codon, preventing the expression of mCherry. When Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the mCherry to be expressed as part of the ligand-mCherry fusion.

Similarly, the receptor's ORF is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So, without Cre, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. When Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

So, the idea is that Cre is used to conditionally activate the expression of mCherry and eGFP.

Now, the experiment: the construct is transfected into primary astrocyte culture. They use Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, which probably means they're loading equal amounts of protein. So, they're checking whether the proteins (ligand and receptor) are being expressed, perhaps as fusions with mCherry and eGFP.

But then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells and their derivatives, like astrocytes. So when the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They're looking for green signals, which would come from eGFP.

But they don't see a green signal. Why?

The options are:

A) ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship.

Paracrine means they act on neighboring cells. Maybe if the ligand is produced by one cell and the receptor on another, but how does that affect eGFP expression? Wait, the eGFP is part of the receptor fusion. So if the receptor isn't expressed, then eGFP won't be either. But why wouldn't the receptor be expressed?

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.

If the construct is stuck in the Golgi, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed on the cell surface. But why would it be stuck? Maybe because of the way the construct is built, like if the signal peptide is missing, but the question doesn't mention any issues with expression in the Western blot. If the proteins were expressed but not properly trafficked, perhaps the Western blot would show the proteins but not the GFP fluorescence. But in this case, the Western blot would have shown the presence of the receptor, assuming the construct was expressed.

Wait, but the question doesn't say about the Western blot in the mouse. They did the Western with the transfected cells. Wait, the initial part says that they transfected primary astrocyte cultures and checked with Western blot. So, in the cell culture, were the constructs expressed? The question says that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, implying that the proteins are present. But in the mouse, when using SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't showing up.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps in the mouse, the Cre isn't being expressed, so the stop cassettes aren't removed, hence eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, but the question says they crossed the homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So, their offspring would inherit the construct and the Cre. SOX10-Cre is a transgene that's active in neural crest cells and their derivatives. So in the offspring, the Cre should be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes.

If the Cre is active, it should excise the stop cassettes, allowing eGFP to be expressed. So why isn't eGFP showing up?

Option C says the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is supposed to be a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which should drive expression constitutively, I think. So if the construct was properly inserted, the enhancer shouldn't be the issue.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, that could be a problem. If the ORF of the receptor is not correctly in frame with the eGFP, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP wouldn't be translated correctly. Like, if the receptor is in one frame and eGFP in another, the fusion won't work. But wait, the question says the receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So perhaps the ORF is designed such that the eGFP is in frame. If not, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed as a proper tag.

Alternatively, maybe the stop cassettes are not properly placed. Let's think about how the ORFs are arranged.

In the vector, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop cassette. The receptor ORF is after the IRES, followed by a stop cassette. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion to mCherry, but only if the stop is removed. Wait, no, without Cre, the stop is present, so the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, so the ligand would be expressed as a full-length protein, but not fused to mCherry, because the stop comes before mCherry. So in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed after the ligand, making a ligand-mCherry fusion.

Similarly, without Cre, the receptor is expressed as a full-length protein (since the stop is after the receptor ORF, but before eGFP). When Cre is present, the stop is excised, so eGFP is expressed, making a receptor-eGFP fusion.

So in the mouse, the Cre (from SOX10-Cre) would excise the stop cassettes, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But the question says they didn't see a green signal (eGFP). So why?

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the construct isn't properly recombined. But why?

Another thought: perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the lox2272 sites are not compatible. Because Cre can recognize loxP sites but not lox2272 unless it's a special variant. Wait, no, lox2272 is a variant, but Cre can still recognize it. Maybe the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. Because for Cre to excise, the loxP sites must be in a certain order. If they're in a head-to-head configuration, Cre will excise the intervening DNA. But if it's head-to-tail, it won't. So perhaps the lox2272 sites are in the wrong configuration, so the stop cassette isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the setup says the stop is in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So the lox sites are on either side of the stop. So when Cre is present, it should excise the stop, allowing the eGFP to be expressed.

But, in the mouse, perhaps the Cre isn't active. Wait, the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would have the Cre under SOX10 control. So in the neural crest-derived cells, Cre should be active. So why isn't the stop excised?

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't properly driving the expression of the receptor. Wait, IRES elements can drive expression in a cell-type specific manner, but IRES from which virus? For example, the internal ribosome entry site from certain viruses allows expression in certain conditions. If the IRES isn't functional in that cell type, the receptor might not be expressed, but that would affect the Western blot in the initial experiments.

Wait, but in the Western blot after transfection, the proteins were expressed. So the IRES must be working in the transfected astrocytes. So in the mouse, perhaps the IRES is not active, but that seems unlikely because the construct was designed for expression.

Hmm. Let's think about the eGFP expression. The eGFP is only expressed when the stop is removed. So if the Cre isn't active, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. But in the mouse, the Cre is supposed to be active in the neural crest cells. So the offspring should have the Cre active, excising the stops and allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but maybe the Cre isn't expressed in the right cells. Or perhaps the Cre isn't functional. Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong configuration. For example, the lox2272 sites might be in the same orientation, so Cre can't excise the stop.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are variants, but the orientation matters. The lox sites need to be in a way that allows Cre to cut them. If the lox sites are in the same orientation (both forward or both reverse), then Cre can't excise. Oh wait, no. Cre can only excise if the two lox sites are in the same orientation, but in a head-to-head configuration. Wait, no, I think Cre can work with different lox variants, but the sites need to be in the proper arrangement.

Wait, perhaps in the vector, the lox2272 sites are arranged in a way that doesn't allow excision. For example, if it's lox2272 ... stop ... lox2272, then Cre would excise the stop. But if the sites are in a different configuration, maybe they're in a reverse orientation, making it impossible for Cre to excise. So the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

If that's the case, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed even when Cre is present, leading to no green signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are facing the wrong way, so Cre can't cut them. Alternatively, maybe the same loxP and lox2272 are used, but they're different, so Cre can't recognize them. Wait, no, Cre should recognize lox2272, as it's a variant of the loxP site.

Another possibility: the eGFP is not expressed because the stop is in the wrong place. For example, the stop is before the eGFP, but without the Cre to remove it, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse, the Cre should be present. So the stop should be removed. So why isn't it working?

Another angle: the Western blot was done on the transfected cells, not on the mouse. So perhaps in the mouse, the construct isn't properly expressed, but that's unlikely, since the construct was validated in the transfected cells.

Wait, the question says that the mice were homozygous for the construct. So the construct is present in both alleles. But Cre is from the SOX10-Cre mice, which are hemizygous. So the offspring would have Cre active in neural crest cells.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the expression of the eGFP is cell-type specific, but that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES is not working. But if the IRES wasn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed in the mouse, which would affect the Western blot in the initial experiments. But the initial Western showed that the proteins were expressed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not being translated. The construct is receptor followed by a stop, then eGFP. Without Cre, the stop is in place, so eGFP isn't expressed. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the mRNA would code from receptor to eGFP. But if the frames are not aligned, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. So the mRNA would have the receptor ORF, then the eGFP ORF, but if they're not in the same frame, the ribosome would read through but not produce a functional eGFP.

So option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That could explain why eGFP isn't expressed. Because the eGFP is not in frame, so when the stop is removed, it's not translated as a separate ORF but as part of a larger ORF, leading to no eGFP protein.

But wait, the way the construct is described, the receptor is fused to eGFP. So the eGFP would be part of the same ORF as the receptor, making a receptor-eGFP fusion. Wait, no, that's not what the question says.

Wait, the question says: the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the eGFP is at the end of the receptor ORF. So the receptor's coding sequence is followed by eGFP's coding sequence, but perhaps in frame, so that the eGFP is a C-terminal tag. So, the stop is between them. Without Cre, the stop is in place, so the receptor is expressed as a full-length protein, but not the eGFP. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed as a fusion.

So the eGFP is part of the same mRNA as the receptor, but in the same reading frame. So the construct is designed to have the receptor and eGFP in frame. So when the stop is removed, the receptor is expressed with the eGFP at the C-terminus.

But if the eGFP is not in the same frame as the receptor, the stop is in the way, so when Cre removes the stop, it would lead to a frameshift, making the eGFP not expressed correctly. So the eGFP would not be produced as a proper protein, hence no fluorescence.

That would explain why no green signal is observed. So option D could be the correct answer.

Another possibility: the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. So the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But how does that affect eGFP expression in the current setup? The eGFP is on the receptor. If the ligand is expressed in one cell and the receptor in another, then both would be expressed, but perhaps the eGFP wouldn't be visible if the cells are not the same type. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't present in the mouse, so this seems less likely.

Wait, but the Cre is under SOX10 control, so it's active in the neural crest cells. So the eGFP should be expressed in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes. So if the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship, perhaps the ligand is expressed in one cell, the receptor in another, but that doesn't stop the eGFP from being expressed in the same cell. So probably A is not the correct answer.

So, the most likely reason is that the eGFP and receptor are not in frame, so when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed correctly, leading to no fluorescence. So option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP, with stop cassettes (loxP-stop-loxP and lox2272-stop-lox2272) between the ligand/mCherry and receptor/eGFP, respectively. Cre recombinase, expressed under the SOX10 promoter in neural crest-derived cells, excises these stop cassettes, allowing eGFP expression. However, no green signal is observed in the offspring after crossing the homozygous construct with SOX10-Cre mice. The task is to determine the most likely reason for this outcome.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship implies the ligand acts on neighboring cells. However, this does not explain why eGFP, which is part of the receptor construct, is not expressed. The issue lies with the construct itself, not the interaction between ligand and receptor. This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, eGFP would not fluoresce due to improper trafficking. However, this would not prevent the expression of the receptor protein, which should still be detectable in a Western blot. Since the question focuses on the absence of fluorescence, this is unlikely to be the primary issue.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES element, both of which are strong expression drivers. The absence of an enhancer is unlikely, as the construct was validated in transfected astrocytes. This option does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the removal of the stop cassette by Cre would result in a frameshift, preventing proper eGFP expression. This would lead to the absence of fluorescence, as observed. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The absence of a green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP not being in the same reading frame, resulting in improper translation of eGFP after the stop cassette is excised by Cre.
