Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm supposed to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo or maybe I'm misreading it. Oh, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d is actually o-bromobenzene, right? Because the numbering would be 1 and 2 on the benzene ring. But wait, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-d something else. Wait, maybe 'd' stands for deuterium, so it's a deuterated compound. So the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Or maybe it's 2-deutero-1-bromobenzene.

Anyway, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. That setup usually makes me think of elimination reactions or dehydrohalogenation. Oh wait, but NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base. It's often used for dehydrohalogenation, which forms alkenes from haloalkanes. But in aromatic compounds, especially when there's a halogen attached, what happens?

Wait, another thought: when a benzene ring has a halogen (like bromine) attached, treating it with a strong base like NaNH2 might lead to elimination. But wait, benzene is pretty stable. Maybe it's about forming an aromatic ring with a double bond elsewhere? Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, but wait, benzene is already an aromatic ring. So if it's a bromine attached, and we're using a strong base, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but in a way that forms another substituent. Or maybe it's a case where the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzyn intermediate, but wait, that's more for when you have two halogens adjacent, like 1,2-dihalobenzenes. Because then, elimination can form a triple bond or a diradical or something that can undergo further reactions.

Wait, in this case, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, bromine is in position 1, and a deuterium is in position 2. So, that's o-bromo with a deuterium in the adjacent position.

If I treat this with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, perhaps it's going to deprotonate the deuterium. Wait, but deuterium is a hydrogen isotope; it's harder to abstract. Or maybe the base abstracts a proton elsewhere on the ring, but the deuterium is at position 2.

Wait, the positions are 1 (bromo) and 2 (deutero). So the molecule is o-bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon. So perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4 or something else.

Wait, but for elimination, you usually need two adjacent leaving groups or a leaving group and a hydrogen that's beta to it. Here, the leaving group is bromide, and the adjacent carbon has a deuterium. So when the base abstracts the deuterium, that's adjacent to the bromide. So that would lead to elimination, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2, releasing HBr (but wait, it's deuterium, so would it release DBr? Hmm, but D is a heavier isotope, but I'm not sure if that affects the reaction mechanism.)

Wait, but in the case of o-dihalobenzenes, treating with a strong base like NaNH2 can lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a triple bond (aryne). But in this case, we have a bromine and a deuterium. So when the base abstracts the deuterium, the adjacent bromine leaves, leading to a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, can deuterium be abstracted as easily as a regular hydrogen? Because deuterium is less acidic than protium, so maybe it's harder. Or maybe the base is strong enough to abstract it.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium isn't abstracted, but another hydrogen is. Wait, but where else would the base abstract a hydrogen to eliminate the bromide? Let's think about the structure. The ring has Br at C1 and D at C2. So adjacent to Br is C2 (D) and C6. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, that's two positions away. But for elimination, the hydrogen should be beta, which would be adjacent to the leaving group. Wait, in E2 reactions, the hydrogen and leaving group are antiperiplanar. But in aromatic rings, the positions are fixed, so perhaps the hydrogen needs to be adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br). Then, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, C2 has a D. So that would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's where the D is. Wait, no, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but in that case, the Br is on C1 and the H (from C2) is abstracted to form the double bond. But in our case, C2 has a D, not an H. So if the base abstracts a D from C2, then elimination would occur, Br leaving. So the result would be a triple bond between C1 and C2, forming a benzyne intermediate. But wait, benzyne is an aryne, which is a benzene ring with a triple bond.

Wait, but the reaction conditions here are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. So the mechanism is likely an elimination reaction where two adjacent substituents (Br and D) are removed, but since D is a deuterium, maybe the reaction isn't possible? Or perhaps the D is just a substituent and the base abstracts a regular H elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the structure. Let me draw it out mentally. The benzene ring has a Br on carbon 1 and a D on carbon 2. So, adjacent positions. So in this case, the base (NH2^-) would abstract a proton that's adjacent to Br. But wait, the adjacent positions to Br (C1) are C2 and C6. C2 has a D, so perhaps the base abstracts a H from C6, which is adjacent to C1, but that's two positions away from the leaving group. Wait, but in E2, the H and leaving group need to be anti. So maybe that's not possible on the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is in position 2, and the Br is in position 1. So when the base abstracts H from position 3, that's adjacent to position 2 (D) but not directly adjacent to the Br. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The compound is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps it abstracts a proton that's adjacent to the Br. But the only adjacent positions to Br are C2 and C6. C2 has a D, so perhaps the base abstracts a H from C6. Then, the elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, if Br is leaving, and a H from C6 is abstracted, then the double bond would be between C1 and C6? No, wait, elimination forms a double bond between the adjacent carbons. So if H is abstracted from C6, which is adjacent to C1, then Br leaves, and the double bond forms between C1 and C2? No, wait, no, elimination forms a double bond between the carbon where the H was abstracted and the carbon where the leaving group was. So H from C6, Br from C1. Then, double bond between C1 and C6? But that would make a transannular double bond, which isn't possible on a benzene ring because the ring is already conjugated. Oh wait, but forming a triple bond is possible if it's between adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2. But wait, C2 has a D, not H. So the base can't abstract that. So the only option is to abstract a hydrogen from another position, but perhaps not adjacent to Br.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the possible products. If elimination occurs, it would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, because Br is on C1, and the D is on C2. So, when the base abstracts the D, which is on C2, and the Br leaves, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, wait, no, if the base abstracts a hydrogen, not a deuterium. Because D is a different isotope, perhaps the base can't abstract it as easily. So maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a different position. Let's say the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (which has D). But that's not adjacent to the Br on C1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But substitution would require a nucleophile, but in this case, the solvent is ammonia, which is a weak nucleophile. So substitution with NH2^- is possible, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so perhaps elimination is favored.

Wait, but wait, another thought: if the base abstracts a hydrogen that's adjacent to the Br, and the Br leaves, forming a benzyn intermediate. But in this case, if the abstracted hydrogen is on C2 (but it's D), which can't be abstracted. So maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But that seems unlikely because the ring is already conjugated. Alternatively, perhaps after elimination, a triple bond forms between C1 and C2, but since C2 has D, that complicates things.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about what the product would look like. If elimination occurs, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but that would require losing both Br and D. But wait, that's not possible because D isn't a leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps only Br leaves, and a hydrogen is abstracted from C2 (the D), but that would result in a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. NaNH2 is a strong base, it's used in dehydrohalogenation of haloarenes. For example, 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene treated with NaNH2 would lose H and Br to form a triple bond between C1 and C2, making benzyne, which is a benzene ring with a triple bond. But in this case, the substituent is a deuterium on C2.

So in this scenario, when the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2, but wait, C2 has a deuterium, not a hydrogen. So perhaps the base can't abstract it. Then, the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, but where?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3. But that's not adjacent to Br. So elimination won't occur, because the H and Br need to be on adjacent carbons for elimination.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction isn't elimination, but a deprotonation leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, which might undergo some kind of rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. The Br could be replaced by something else. But with NaNH2 in ammonia, the solvent is NH3, which is a weak nucleophile. So substitution would be less likely, unless it's a very good leaving group. Br is a good leaving group, but the base is strong, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, but in the case where the base can't abstract the deuterium, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking about the number of products. So maybe the base can abstract a hydrogen elsewhere, leading to elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction forms two different products because of the possibility of forming different regioisomers or stereoisomers. But in this case, since the starting material is a single isomer, elimination would form a single product.

Wait, but wait, the starting material has a deuterium in the ortho position to Br. So when the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to Br (like from C6), elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, but that's not possible because in a benzene ring, all bonds are conjugated. So maybe elimination leads to a triple bond between C1 and C2, but that would require losing Br and the D, but D isn't a leaving group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the reaction doesn't proceed as I'm thinking. Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the reaction, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, leading to elimination of Br and forming a triple bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring allows for some resonance, so the elimination can occur anywhere, but in this case, the only available position is C6, which is adjacent to C1. So elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, but since C2 has D, that's a problem. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (D). Then, elimination would form a double bond between C2 and C3, but that's not adjacent to the Br on C1, so the Br wouldn't be involved. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the base is abstracting a hydrogen that's not adjacent to the Br, so the Br can't leave.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible products based on elimination. Let's say elimination occurs, but where? The only adjacent positions to Br are C2 and C6. But C2 has D, so maybe the base can't abstract a hydrogen from there. So the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to Br. Then, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, but that's not possible in a benzene ring. Alternatively, it forms a triple bond between C1 and C6, but that's across the ring and not adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the ring isn't planar anymore, but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe the deuterium in position 2 allows for some kind of isotope effect, making the elimination possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate. Maybe it's a substitution where Br is replaced by something else. But with NaNH2 in NH3, substitution would require the amide ion as a nucleophile. So the product would be a benzene ring with NH2^- attached where Br was. But that would be a substitution product.

Wait, but the reaction is in a strongly basic condition, so elimination is more likely than substitution. Substitution usually occurs under nucleophilic conditions, but if the base is strong, it might favor elimination.

But wait, in this case, perhaps substitution is possible. Wait, if the Br is replaced by NH2, the product would be aniline (but with a deuterium at position 2). So that's one product.

Alternatively, if elimination occurs, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2, that would be another product.

So the question is, how many products are formed? If substitution and elimination both occur, there are two products. But I'm not sure if substitution is feasible under these conditions.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base, so I think elimination is more favorable. So perhaps only one product is formed, which is the aryne (triple bond) compound.

But wait, the molecule has a deuterium in position 2. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6 (adjacent to Br in position 1), elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. But that's not possible in a benzene ring because the triple bond would require a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a triple bond between C1 and C2, but since C2 has a D, that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps the D is just a substituent, and the base abstracts a H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. But in benzene, that's not possible because the ring is already conjugated; a triple bond would require a different structure.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about known reactions. For example, when 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene is treated with NaNH2, it forms benzyne via elimination. The presence of the deuterium might not affect the reaction much, as the base would abstract a H from position 6, adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but in this problem, the substituent is a D, not another halogen. So perhaps the base can't abstract a D because it's less acidic. But maybe in the reaction conditions, it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is a red herring, and the reaction proceeds as if it were a hydrogen. So the base abstracts a H from position 6, adjacent to Br, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2, but with a D on C2.

Wait, but then the structure would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, with a D on C2. So that's one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a different position, leading to different elimination products. But where else could the base abstract a hydrogen adjacent to Br? Only C2 and C6.

But C2 has a D, so if the base abstracts a H from C6, then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. But that's not possible in a benzene ring, as the ring can't have a triple bond between non-adjacent positions.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Perhaps I should think about this differently. The reaction of o-bromobenzene with NaNH2 would form benzyne, which has a triple bond between C1 and C2. But in this case, C2 has a D. So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, and a D on C2. But wait, the triple bond is between C1 and C2, so the D would be on one of the carbons involved in the triple bond. That would make the structure o-deutero-benzyne.

So only one possible product is formed from this reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract the D, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond. But since D is less acidic, the base might not abstract it, so the reaction doesn't proceed. But the problem states that the reaction is happening, so perhaps the base can abstract the D, leading to elimination.

In that case, the product would have a triple bond between C1 and C2, but since the D was on C2, perhaps it's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the D is eliminated along with Br, which forms a triple bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about possible organic products. So if elimination occurs, only one product is formed. If substitution occurs, another product is formed. So how many products are there?

Wait, but under the given conditions, which is more favorable? Elimination requires the base to abstract a hydrogen adjacent to Br, but if that hydrogen is a D, which is less acidic, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed. So maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, leading to elimination elsewhere. But that's impossible because the Br is on C1, so the hydrogen must be on C2 or C6.

So, another possibility: the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question says it's treated with NaNH2, so some reaction must happen.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts the D from C2, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond. So that would give a product with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but since the D was on C2, maybe it's lost. Or perhaps the D remains. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a meta product. But I don't think that's possible here.

Another angle: the reaction could form a benzene ring with a triple bond, but the D is in position 2. So that's the only possible product. So the number of products is 1.

Wait, but wait. Could the reaction form more than one product due to different sites of elimination? For example, forming triple bonds in different positions. But in this case, the only possible elimination is between C1 and C2 because that's where Br and D are. Or is Br on C1 and D on C2, so elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2.

So, only one product is possible.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (which has D). Then, elimination would occur between C2 and C3, but the Br is on C1, so that's not possible. So elimination can't occur there.

Therefore, the only possible elimination is between C1 and C2, but since C2 has D, perhaps that's not possible. So maybe the reaction doesn't eliminate and instead undergoes substitution, replacing Br with NH2.

If substitution occurs, the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene.

So, that's another product.

Wait, but then we have two possible products: one from substitution (aminobenzene with D) and one from elimination (triple bond between C1 and C2 with D on C2). Are both possible?

But NaNH2 is a strong base, so elimination is favored over substitution. So the major product would be the elimination product. But if substitution is possible, then there would be two products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only forms the elimination product, so one product.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, so elimination is more likely. So the product is the aryne (triple bond) between C1 and C2, considering the D is on C2.

Wait, but wait, the D is on C2. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6 (which is adjacent to C1), then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. But that's not possible because the ring is six-membered, and triple bonds can only form between adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in benzene, the positions are all adjacent in a ring, so C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. But that would require a structure that's not possible in a benzene ring. So perhaps the elimination can only occur between C1 and C2.

But C2 has a D, so the base can't abstract a hydrogen there. So maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (D), but that's not adjacent to Br, so elimination can't occur.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but that can't be right because the question implies it does.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the reaction, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to Br on C1. So elimination occurs, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But in a benzene ring, that's not possible, so the product is a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the ring opens, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, regardless of the D.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another angle: in the reaction of a dihalobenzene with a strong base, elimination occurs to form a triple bond. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with NaNH2 gives benzyne. So in this case, we have 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2 (but it's D), which it can't, then elimination can't occur. So the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not possible because the question gives options.

Alternatively, perhaps the D doesn't interfere, and the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6. But that's not possible because the ring can't have a triple bond in that position.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. That could mean that it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the structure is Br at position 1 and D at position 2. When treated with NaNH2, a strong base, the base would abstract a proton adjacent to the Br. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a D, which isn't abstractable. So the base abstracts a proton from position 6. Then, Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2. Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to C1, so elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6. But that's not possible in a benzene ring. So that can't happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (D), but that's not adjacent to Br on C1. So elimination can't occur.

Hmm, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question says it does. So perhaps the deuterium is just a substituent and the reaction proceeds as if it were a hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, and Br leaves, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But that's not possible. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but again, that can't be.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts the D from C2, leading to elimination of Br. That would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, but since D is removed, perhaps that's possible. So the product would be a triple bond between C1 and C2, with no D on C2.

Wait, but the starting material has a D on C2. So if the base abstracts the D, then C2 would lose H (D), and Br leaves, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but without the D on C2. So that's a possible product.

Alternatively, perhaps the D stays, and the triple bond forms elsewhere, but I don't think that's possible.

So, is the product a deuterated benzyne or not?

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. If the base abstracts the D from C2, then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, but the D is gone. So the product is benzyne, which is 1,2-didehydrobenzene, but without the D on C2.

Wait, but that would mean the D is lost, but perhaps the reaction conditions don't allow for that. Or maybe the D is a good enough leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't abstract the D, but another H, leading to no elimination. But then, what happens?

I'm getting really stuck here. Maybe I should think about the number of products. The options are 4,1,2,3.

If the reaction forms only one product, the answer is B)1.

If it forms two products, substitution and elimination, then C)2.

But under the reaction conditions, which is more likely: substitution or elimination?

Since NaNH2 is a strong base, elimination is favored. So perhaps only one product is formed.

But wait, could there be more than one product due to different sites of elimination? Like, if the base abstracts a H from C6, leading to a triple bond between C1 and C6, but that's not possible. So only one possible product.

So the answer should be 1 product, option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (1-bromo-2-deutero benzene) with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, typically favoring elimination reactions. The molecule has bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring.

Key considerations for the reaction:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, where bromine is at position 1 and deuterium (a hydrogen isotope) is at position 2. This arrangement makes the bromine and deuterium adjacent to each other.

2. **Reaction Conditions**:  
   NaNH₂ in ammonia is a strongly basic environment, favoring elimination (dehydrohalogenation) over substitution. The base abstracts a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of bromine and the formation of a triple bond (benzyne).

3. **Elimination Mechanism**:  
   - The base can abstract a deuterium from position 2 or a proton from position 6 (adjacent to bromine at position 1).  
   - If the base abstracts the deuterium from position 2, elimination of bromine occurs, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.  
   - If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, elimination of bromine would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. However, this is not possible in a benzene ring due to its conjugated structure.  
   - Thus, the only feasible elimination product is a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, resulting in benzyne (o-benzyne).

4. **Substitution vs. Elimination**:  
   Substitution reactions require a nucleophile, but under the given conditions, elimination is strongly favored due to the strong base (NaNH₂) and the stability of the benzyne intermediate.

5. **Possible Products**:  
   - The elimination reaction produces a single product: a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2 (benzyne).  
   - Substitution is unlikely under these conditions, as the strong base favors elimination.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   Only one product is formed in this reaction, which is the elimination product (benzyne). The deuterium at position 2 does not significantly interfere with the reaction, as the elimination occurs between positions 1 and 2.

Answer: B
