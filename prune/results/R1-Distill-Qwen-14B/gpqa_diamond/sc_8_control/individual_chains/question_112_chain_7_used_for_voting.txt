Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem starts by giving a state vector |alpha> for an electron. It says that |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, the word 'proportional' probably means we'll have to normalize this vector. Right, because any quantum state must be normalized to 1.

Then, the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, let me think about this matrix. So for a 2x2 matrix (since it's spin-1/2, probably), the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal (i=j) would be zero, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) would be hbar/2.

So the matrix A would look like [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If i is different from j, Aij is ħ/2. So for a 2x2 case, A is:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

So it's a 2x2 matrix with zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Hmm, that's interesting. So this operator has eigenstates that we need to find. Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in the eigenbasis.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So first, I think I need to find the eigenstates of A.

But maybe there's a smarter way. The operator A looks like it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So A = (ħ/2) * X. Because X has 1s off-diagonal.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of X. Because if A is a scalar multiple of X, their eigenvectors are the same. The eigenvalues of X are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), so ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. So the possible outcomes when measuring A are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients when |alpha> is expressed in the eigenbasis of A.

So, first, I need to find the eigenstates of operator A, then express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, and calculate the probabilities.

But perhaps, given that A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which I know has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, the eigenstates of the X operator. So the eigenstates of A would be the same |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2.

Alternatively, maybe the operator A is actually (ħ/2) σ_x. Because σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. So yes, A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x. So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2, perhaps. Wait, let's check that.

Wait, the eigenstates for σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2. Right? Because σ_x |+x> = +|+x>, etc.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x. So if I can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

But let's get back to |alpha>. The given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So first, let's normalize it.

Wait, the state is given as proportional, so I'll have to compute the normalization factor. Let me compute the squared norm: |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Wait, |a + ib|^2 is a^2 + b^2. So |1+i|^2 is 1^2 +1^2=2. |2 -i|^2 is 2^2 + (-1)^2=4 +1=5. So the squared norm is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, I need to express this in terms of the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> of operator A.

As I said, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, we can write:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

So let's compute a and b.

We can write |up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2),
and |down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2).

Substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) + (2 -i) (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Factor out 1/sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(7):

= [ (1+i + 2 -i) |+x> + (1+i - (2-i)) |-x> ) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Compute the coefficients:

Coefficient for |+x>:
(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) ) = 3 + 0i = 3.

Coefficient for |-x>:
(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 +2i) |-x> ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

But wait, no, because I think I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the substitution.

Wait, the substitution is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) + (2 -i) (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7).

So let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from both terms:

= [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)).

Now, expand this:

= [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x> ) ] / (sqrt(14)).

Now, group the |+x> and |-x> terms:

|+x> [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] + |-x> [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Compute each bracket:

For |+x> coefficient:
(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) ) = 3 + 0i = 3.

For |-x> coefficient:
(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So now, |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / sqrt(14).

Wait, sqrt(14) is sqrt(2*7) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(7). So yes, that's correct.

So the amplitudes a and b for |+x> and |-x> are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14), respectively.

Wait, but the state must be normalized, right? Because |alpha> is already normalized. So the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of a and b should be 1.

Compute |a|^2 = (3)^2 /14 =9/14.

Compute |b|^2: [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4) /14 =5/14.

So total |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. Correct.

So the probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is |a|^2 =9/14 ≈0.6429.

Probability of |-x> is |b|^2=5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64. And 5/14 is ~0.357, which is ~0.36. So the probabilities would be approximately 64% and 36%. So that matches option A for the first two numbers.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the coefficients. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I substituted |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, perhaps I got the signs wrong.

Wait, the standard eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, is that correct? Or is it |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|down> - |up>)/sqrt(2) ), which would be (|-up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)? Hmm, wait, no, the standard eigenstates are:

The Pauli X eigenstates are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/√2 and |-x> = (|0> - |1>)/√2 when |0> is |down> and |1> is |up>, depending on how you define it. Alternatively, some sources define |up> as spin up along z, which would correspond to eigenstate of σ_z.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this substitution more carefully.

Wait, in any case, perhaps a better approach is to find the eigenstates of the matrix A.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Its eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λ I)=0.

Which would be (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ^2 - (ħ^2/4) =0 → λ^2 = ħ^2/4 → λ= ±ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The eigenvectors can be found for each eigenvalue.

For λ= ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I ) = [ [-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2} ].

The equations are:

(-ħ/2) x + (ħ/2) y =0 → -x + y =0 → y =x.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1). So |+x> = (1,1)/sqrt(2).

Similarly for λ= -ħ/2:

(A + (ħ/2) I ) = [ [ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, ħ/2} ].

Equations: (ħ/2)x + (ħ/2)y=0 → x + y=0 → y = -x.

Eigenvectors proportional to (1, -1). So |-x>=(1, -1)/sqrt(2).

So now, to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So |alpha> is ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7).

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>.

So let's calculate c1 and c2.

We can write:

c1 = < +x | alpha >,
c2 = < -x | alpha >.

Because |+x> and |-x> are orthonormal.

So compute c1:

c1 = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * |alpha> / sqrt(7).

|alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, scaled by 1/sqrt(7).

So,

c1 = [ (1/sqrt(2)) * ( [ (1+i) (<up|up>) + (2 -i)(<up| down> ) ] ) ) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute inner products directly.

| +x > = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
so < +x | = ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So,

c1 = < +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

The product:

= (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up| down> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down| down> ].

Since <up|down> =0, and <down|up>=0, this simplifies to:

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(1) ] 
= (1/(sqrt(14))) [1 +i +2 -i]
= (1/(sqrt(14))) [3]
= 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, c2 is < -x | alpha >.

| -x > = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2),
so < -x | = ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2).

Then,

c2 = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Multiply out:

= (1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (1+i) <up| down> - (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down| down> ].

Again, cross terms are zero, so:

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)(1) - (2 -i)(1) ]
= (1/(sqrt(14))) [1 +i -2 +i ]
= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (-1) + 2i ].

So c2 = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

So the amplitudes are c1 = 3/sqrt(14), c2= (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

The probability of measuring +ħ/2 is |c1|^2 = (3)^2/(14) =9/14 ≈0.6429.

Probability of measuring -ħ/2 is |c2|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1+4)/14=5/14≈0.3571.

Hmm, so the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%. Looking at the options, option A gives 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, the third part is the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is Hermitian, the average can be found as the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by their probabilities.

Eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, with probabilities 9/14 and 5/14.

So:

<A> = ( ħ/2 * 9/14 ) + ( (-ħ/2) *5/14 )
= (9 ħ/28) - (5 ħ/28)
= (4 ħ)/28
= ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7.

Looking at option A, the average is ħ/7, which matches.

So option A says the probabilities are 0.64, 0.36, and average is ħ/7.

Wait, what about the options? Let me check.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7.

Yes, that's what I got.

Other options:

Option B: 0.54, 0.46, 3ħ/sqrt(7) → no, because the average is ħ/7.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 → no, that's 2/7 and 5/7, which are different.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 → no.

So the correct option is A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The squared norm of the state is calculated as:

\[
|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This operator is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( \sigma_x \), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \), which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we get:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{3|+x\rangle + (-1+2i)|-x\rangle}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The coefficients are determined as:

\[
c_1 = \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_2 = \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |c_1|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |c_2|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated using the eigenvalues and their probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)P(+x) + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)P(-x).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{14} - \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
