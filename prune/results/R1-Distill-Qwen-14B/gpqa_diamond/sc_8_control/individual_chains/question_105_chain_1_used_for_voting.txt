Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let's read it carefully and break it down.

The question is about a star with some spots and how it's similar to an exoplanet causing brightness variations. The setup is that we have a star with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing the star's brightness to vary. This is similar to what an exoplanet would do when it transits in front of the star. The question is asking, if there were no spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Hmm. So, the problem is about comparing the brightness variations caused by a planet transiting a star versus brightness variations caused by star spots due to rotation.

I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is calculated using the formula (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. That's because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But in this case, the star has spots, so the brightness variation isn't due to blocking light but due to the spots being cooler. So when the spots rotate into and out of view, the star's overall brightness changes because the spots are darker.

Wait, but the question says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So, it's producing a similar signal in the photometric data. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation should be the same as what a planet would cause.

So, to find the radius of the hypothetical planet that would cause the same amplitude, we need to compute the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and set that equal to the fractional change caused by a planet transit.

Let me think about the star's brightness variation due to spots. The star's brightness when spots are visible is a bit less than when they are not because spots are cooler and emit less light.

The star's total brightness is the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area. The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is spots, and the rest is normal.

Wait, but since it's one hemisphere, the entire hemisphere's brightness will vary as it rotates. Wait, no, the star is being observed as it rotates, so the spots on one hemisphere will come into view and then go out of view as the star spins. So the brightness variation is periodic, modulated by the rotation period.

But how does the brightness change when the spots are visible? Let's model the star as having a certain fraction of its surface covered by cooler spots.

The flux from the star without spots is L = 4π R^2 σ Teff^4. But when spots are present, part of the surface is emitting less. The total flux then becomes L = (1 - f) * 4π R^2 σ Teff^4 + f * 4π R^2 σ (Teff - ΔT)^4, where f is the filling factor. Wait, but the filling factor here is 20% per hemisphere. So since one hemisphere is spotty, the total filling factor is 0.2, because only that part is covered. So, the entire surface isn't covered; it's just one hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor f is 0.2 for the spotted hemisphere. So, the total area covered by spots is f * (2π R^2) (since a hemisphere is 2π R^2), but perhaps I should model it differently.

Alternatively, the total flux when the spots are on one side is:

Flux = (1 - f) * L_unspotted per unit area + f * L_spotted per unit area.

Wait, the star's total luminosity without spots is L = 4π R^2 σ Teff^4.

When spots are present on a fraction f of the surface (here, f=0.2), the luminosity becomes L = (1 - f) * L_unspotted + f * L_spotted.

The unspotted area emits at Teff, and the spotted area at Teff - 1000 K.

So,

L_unspotted_per_area = σ Teff^4,

L_spotted_per_area = σ (Teff - 1000)^4.

So,

L_total = (1 - f) * 4π R^2 σ Teff^4 + f * 4π R^2 σ (Teff - 1000)^4.

Wait, but wait, the star's surface area is 4π R^2. So if f is the fraction of the surface that is spots, then the total flux is:

L_total = (1 - f) * L0 + f * L1,

where L0 = σ Teff^4,

and L1 = σ (Teff - 1000)^4.

Wait no, because L0 and L1 are per unit area. So,

L_total = 4π R^2 [ (1 - f) L0 + f L1 ]

So, the change in flux compared to no spots is:

ΔL = L_total - L0 * 4π R^2

= 4π R^2 [ (1-f) L0 + f L1 ] - 4π R^2 L0

= 4π R^2 [ -f L0 + f L1 ]

= 4π R^2 f (L1 - L0 )

So, ΔL = 4π R^2 f (L1 - L0 )

But since L1 is less than L0, ΔL is negative. So when the spots are on the side we see, the flux is lower by ΔL.

The observed flux variation is between L0 (when no spots are visible) and L0 + ΔL (when spots are visible). Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view, so the flux drops by |ΔL|.

Wait, no. When the spots are on the side facing us, the flux is L_total which is less than L0. When spots are on the far side, the flux is L0.

So the flux variation is from L0 to L_total, which is L0 - |ΔL|.

So the fractional change in flux is (L0 - (L0 - |ΔL| )) / L0 = |ΔL| / L0.

But wait, I think the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

In the case of spots, the maximum flux is when no spots are visible (L0), and the minimum is when spots are fully visible (L_total = L0 - |ΔL|.

So the amplitude is L0 - (L0 - |ΔL|) )= |ΔL|.

So the fractional amplitude is ΔL / L0.

But in the case of a planet transit, the dip in flux is when the planet blocks some of the light. The amplitude is the fractional drop: (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is π Rp^2, and the star's area is 4π Rstar^2. So the fractional change is (π Rp^2) / (4π Rstar^2) )= (Rp^2)/(4 Rstar^2) ), but wait, wait, no.

Wait, when a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's disk. The fraction of the star's light blocked is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area is π Rp² / π Rstar² = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, the area of the planet's disk is π Rp², and the star's area is π (2 Rstar)^2? No, no, wait. The star's radius is Rstar, so its area is 4π Rstar². The planet's disk area is π Rp^2. The fractional area is (π Rp^2)/(4π Rstar²) ) = (Rp^2)/(4 Rstar²) ), so the fractional change is (Rp/(2 Rstar))^2.

Wait, no. Wait, the fraction is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is (Rp/Rstar)^2 * (star's area). So the fractional drop in flux is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The star's area is π (2 Rstar)^2 = 4 π Rstar²? No, wait, the area of a circle is π R². So the star's area is π (Rstar)^2 * 2 (since it's a sphere), wait no, no. Wait, no, the star is a sphere, but when you observe it, you see the area as a disk. The area of the disk is π Rstar². So the total number of photons coming from the star is proportional to the area (π Rstar²) times the flux per unit area (which is σ Teff^4, but that's a constant for the star).

So, when a planet with radius Rp transits, it blocks a disk of area π Rp². The fraction of the star's light blocked is (π Rp²) / (π Rstar²) )= (Rp / Rstar)^2.

Thus, the fractional change in brightness is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So the amplitude of the light curve dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

In the case of the star with spots, the amplitude of the brightness variation is |ΔL| / L0.

So, I need to calculate |ΔL| and then find (Rp/Rstar)^2 = |ΔL| / L0.

Let me compute ΔL.

ΔL = 4π R^2 f [ L1 - L0 ]

But L1 is the flux per unit area of the spots, which is σ (Teff - 1000)^4.

Similarly, L0 is σ Teff^4.

So, substituting:

ΔL = 4π R^2 f [ σ (Teff - 1000)^4 - σ Teff^4 ]

= 4π R^2 σ f [ (Teff - 1000)^4 - Teff^4 ]

Wait, but let's compute the fractional change.

|ΔL| / L0 = [4π R^2 σ f ( (Teff - 1000)^4 - Teff^4 ) ] / (4π R^2 σ Teff^4 )

Simplify:

= f [ ( (Teff - 1000)^4 - Teff^4 ) ] / Teff^4

= f [ ( (Teff - 1000)/Teff )^4 - 1 ]

Since (Teff - 1000) is less than Teff, this becomes negative, but since we have the absolute value, we can take the magnitude.

So the fractional change is:

ΔF_spot = |ΔL| / L0 = f [ 1 - ( (Teff - 1000)/Teff )^4 ]

Wait, let me compute that.

Let me compute (Teff - 1000)/Teff = (6000 -1000)/6000 = 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.48225.

So,

ΔF_spot = 0.2 * [ 1 - 0.48225 ] = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So around 10.355% fractional change.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it exactly.

Wait, let me compute (5/6) exactly.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296.

Let me compute 625/1296.

Approximately, 1296 ÷ 625 is about 2.0736. So 625/1296 is approximately 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by f=0.2 (20%): 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.103549.

So about 10.35% fractional change in brightness.

Now, this is the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots. But wait, the question says "the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So, the planet would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2 = same as 0.103549.

Wait, wait. No. Because when a planet transits, the amplitude is a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. But the brightness variation due to spots is a dip of about 10.35% when the spots are on the visible side.

Wait, but in the case of the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So setting that equal to 0.103549.

So,

(Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.103549

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.103549) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. The brightness variation due to spots isn't just a dip, it's a modulation as the spots rotate. But the question is about the amplitude of the variation, which would be the peak-to-peak change.

Wait, no, the problem says that the brightness variations due to rotational modulation (i.e., the spots coming into view and going out) have an amplitude that can resemble an exoplanet. So the maximum dip is 10.35% of the star's brightness, and the planet would cause the same dip when it transits.

Wait, but when the star's spots are on the far side, the brightness is L0. When they're on the near side, it's L_total = L0 + ΔL, which is lower. So the dip is ΔL / L0 = 10.35%, so the amplitude (peak-to-peak) is 2 * 10.35%? Or is the dip just 10.35%?

Wait, no. The peak-to-peak amplitude is the maximum minus the minimum. So when the spots are on the near side, the brightness is L0 - |ΔL|. When on the far side, it's L0. So the peak-to-peak is |ΔL|.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The brightness without spots is L0. With spots, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is L_total = (1 - f) L0 + f L1 = L0 - f (L0 - L1) = L0 - f (σ Teff^4 - σ (Teff-1000)^4 ) * (4π R^2).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider fractional change.

The fractional dip when the spots are facing us is [ (L0 - ΔL) - L0 ] / L0 = (-ΔL) / L0 = -f [ (Teff^4 - (Teff-1000)^4 ) ] / Teff^4.

Wait, no, the L_total is (1-f) L0 + f L1, so the fractional brightness is [ (1-f)L0 + f L1 ] / L0 = (1-f) + f (L1 / L0 )

Which is = 1 - f + f ( (Teff -1000)/Teff )^4.

So the dip when spots are visible is 1 - [1 - f + f ( (Teff-1000)^4 / Teff^4 ) ].

Wait, no, the dip is the decrease in brightness. So when the spots are visible, the brightness is [ (1-f) + f * ( (Teff -1000)/Teff )^4 ] times the original.

So the dip is 1 minus that factor.

Wait, dip = 1 - [ (1-f) + f * ( (Teff -1000)/Teff )^4 ]

Which is 1 - 1 + f [ 1 - ( (Teff - 1000)/Teff )^4 ]

= f [ 1 - ( (Teff - 1000)/Teff )^4 ]

Which is the same as before: 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * (1 - 625/1296) = 0.2 * (671/1296) ≈ 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035.

So the dip is about 10.35% of the star's brightness. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is 10.35%. So the planet would need to cause a dip of the same percentage.

So, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.32, which is very close.

Wait, but wait, the answer options are about the exoplanet's radius relative to the star. So the calculation gives approximately 0.32.

So the correct answer is D, ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we compare the fractional change in brightness caused by the exoplanet transit to the fractional change caused by the star's spots.

### Step 1: Fractional Brightness Change Due to Spots
The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor \( f = 0.2 \). The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \). The fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible is given by:

\[
\Delta F_{\text{spot}} = f \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{eff}} - \Delta T}{T_{\text{eff}}}} \right)^4 \right]
\]

Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \):

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eff}} - \Delta T}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.8333
\]

\[
\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.4823
\]

\[
\Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left[ 1 - 0.4823 \right] = 0.2 \times 0.5177 \approx 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
\]

Thus, the fractional brightness change due to the spots is approximately \( 0.1035 \).

### Step 2: Fractional Brightness Change Due to a Planet Transit
The fractional brightness change caused by an exoplanet transiting the star is given by:

\[
\Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

To produce the same amplitude in the light curve, we set \( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \Delta F_{\text{spot}} \):

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
\]

### Step 3: Compare with Options
The closest option to \( 0.3217 \) is \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

### Final Answer
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \).
