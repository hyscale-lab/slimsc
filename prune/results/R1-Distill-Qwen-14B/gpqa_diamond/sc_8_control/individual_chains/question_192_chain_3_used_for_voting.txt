Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's try to think it through.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity with radius r, and the center of the cavity is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The conductor is uncharged, but then someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. I'm supposed to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor, which is a distance L from the conductor's center. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both bigger than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember that in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero because charges rearrange to cancel internal fields. But wait, since there's a cavity, maybe that's different. Oh right, when there's a charge inside the cavity of a spherical conductor, the conductor's interior (the cavity) has induced charges, but the conductor itself outside the cavity remains neutral. So the conductor's outer surface has no net charge, but the inner surface must have a charge equal and opposite to the cavity's charge.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, it induces a charge -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must then have +q to balance it. But wait, no, because the conductor as a whole was uncharged. So the conductor's initial charge is zero. The cavity has +q, so the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have -q. Then the outer surface must have +q so that the total conductor's charge is zero (because the cavity is part of the conductor's interior but the conductor itself is neutral). Wait, no, I think that's correct. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface +q. But wait, the outer surface's charge is +q, so when you look at the exterior, it's as if there's a charge +q at the center of the outer sphere.

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think. The conductor is neutral. When you place a charge +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge of -q, induced by the +q. Because the conductor itself must remain neutral (since it's uncharged), the outer surface must have a charge of +q. So yes, the outer surface has +q.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So when you're outside a charged sphere, the electric field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q.

Wait, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The conductor's outer radius is R, so L is definitely outside, since L > R. So the electric field at P is as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. That would mean E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L^2) * r̂, where r̂ is the unit vector pointing from the conductor's center to P.

Wait, but wait. The point P's distance to the cavity's center is l, and the angle is theta. Hmm, does that affect anything? Because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere of radius R, so the charge +q is effectively at the center of the conductor. So any point outside the conductor (like P) should see the field as if the charge is a point charge at the center of the conductor.

But wait, where is the cavity's center? It's at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. So when the +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (which is at radius R) will have a charge distribution. But the outer surface will have a charge +q, but it's symmetric because the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, and the electric field outside is the same as a point charge at the center.

So regardless of where the cavity is, the outer surface's charge is +q. Therefore, the electric field at point P (outside the conductor) depends only on the distance from the conductor's center. So the answer should be option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L^2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is that. But wait, no. Because the point P's distance from the cavity's center is l, and the angle theta. So is there any effect of where the charge is placed inside the cavity on the external field?

Wait, no. Because the conductor's outer surface charge is determined by the total induced charge. The conductor is neutral, so inner surface is -q, outer is +q. The distribution of the outer charge is uniform because the conductor is a sphere. So the electric field outside is as if all the charge is at the center of the conductor.

But wait, if the cavity's center is not at the center of the conductor, does that affect the outer field? Let me think. The conductor is a sphere, so when the inner surface is induced, the charges arrange themselves in such a way that the field inside the conductor (the material of the conductor) is zero. The conductor's outer surface must produce a field that, when combined with the inner surface's field, cancels inside the conductor.

Let me try to model this. The cavity has a charge +q at some point not at the center of the conductor. The inner surface of the conductor (radius R) will have a charge distribution of -q. But since the conductor is a sphere, the inner surface's charge distribution is such that the field inside the conductor due to the inner surface is zero. Hmm, no, wait. The inner surface's charge is induced by the charge +q in the cavity. So the inner surface's charge is -q, but arranged in a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges in the inner surface would arrange themselves to cancel the field from the cavity charge within the conductor's material.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The conductor is a conducting shell. Inside the cavity is a charge +q. The inner surface of the shell (conductor) must have a charge of -q, because the conductor must remain neutral. The outer surface, as a result, will have +q. Now, the inner surface's charge distribution is not uniform because the cavity's charge isn't at the center. So the inner surface's charge would be more in some areas than others. But the outer surface, being a spherical shell, will have a uniform charge distribution because any asymmetry in the inner surface would not affect the outer surface's symmetry. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform, regardless of where the inner charge is.

So, the electric field outside the conductor (radius R) is as if all the charge +q were located at the center of the conductor. So, the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. Therefore, the electric field at P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L^2) multiplied by the unit vector pointing from the conductor's center to P.

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is E = [1/(4πε₀)] * q/(L^2). The other options involve l and theta. Why are those present?

Ah, maybe I'm missing something. The problem says the point P is outside the conductor, but the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle is theta. So perhaps the field from the outer charge is being affected by the position of the cavity? No, because the outer charge is uniformly distributed, so the field outside depends only on the distance from the conductor's center, not the cavity's position.

Wait, unless the conductor is not a perfect sphere or the inner cavity's position affects the outer field. But no, the conductor is spherical, so the outer field is determined by the total charge, which is +q, and the distance from the center.

So, I think the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is separated by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is $r$, where $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is a distance $L$ from the conductor's center. The distance from $P$ to the cavity's center is $l$, and $l, L > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Charge Distribution in the Conductor**:  
   Since the conductor is initially uncharged and the cavity contains a charge $+q$, the inner surface of the conductor (at radius $R$) will have an induced charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor, being a spherical shell, will have a uniform charge distribution of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and the distance from the conductor's center. Since the outer surface has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, the electric field at a point $P$ outside the conductor (at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center) is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge $+q$ located at the conductor's center.

3. **Irrelevance of the Cavity's Position**:  
   The position of the cavity (determined by $s$, $l$, and $\theta$) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor, and the field outside depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option B**: Correct. The electric field at $P$ is given by $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which matches the field produced by a point charge $+q$ at the center of the conductor.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$ is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the form $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2}$ is correct for a point charge, it does not account for the distance $L$ from the conductor's center, which is the correct reference point.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
