Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, things get a bit tricky because of how velocities add and energies combine.

So first, let's tackle the relative speed. The astronauts are moving in the same direction, both in the positive x-direction. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c. Wait, but when you're dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the Lorentz factor. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²), but wait, actually, which one is u and which is v here? Let me think. If the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5 c²)/c² ). Oh wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the relative speed when one is moving at u and another at v in the same direction would be (u - v) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So let's plug in the numbers: u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 minus (0.6*0.5) which is 1 minus 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed should be around 0.14c. Let me see the options: option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, for the total energy. Total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of each astronaut is given by gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc² for each, but wait, the masses here are 2m and 3m, right?

So for the first astronaut, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is gamma * m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, no. Wait, each astronaut's rest mass is 2m and 3m, so the energy for each is gamma * m_i c², where m_i is their mass. So for the first astronaut, 2m * gamma. Wait, no. The formula is E = gamma * m * c², where m is the rest mass. So for the first, m1 = 2m, v1 = 0.6c. So gamma1 is 1.25, so E1 = 1.25 * (2m) c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, the second astronaut has m2=3m, v2=0.5c. Gamma2 is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy E_total is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct energy is about 5.96 mc².

So putting it together, the relative speed is 0.14c and the energy is 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C matches both.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction with speeds \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). The relative speed is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\( m_1 = 2m, v_1 = 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\( m_2 = 3m, v_2 = 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations, the relative speed is \( 0.14c \) and the total energy is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
