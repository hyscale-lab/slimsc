Okay, I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal has all its edges equal and all angles the same. So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance. Right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by something involving the reciprocal of the structure factor. Oh, right, the formula is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ) ), where a is the lattice parameter, and l, m, n are the Miller indices. Or wait, I might be mixing up the formula. Maybe it's d = 1 / sqrt( (l² + m² + n²) / a² + ... something with cos terms. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the general formula for interplanar distance.

Wait, let me get this straight. For a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But in a rhombohedral system, the angles are not 90. So the general formula must account for that.

So I recall that the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² + 2hk \cos \gamma + 2hl \cos \beta + 2kl \cos \alpha}} }

Wait, but wait, in this case, all angles are the same, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So for the (111) plane, h =1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting, the denominator becomes:

1² + 1² + 1² + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30) + 2*(1*1)*cos(30).

Hmm, let's calculate each part. 1+1+1 is 3. Then, each cross term is 2 * 1 *1* cos(30). There are three cross terms because it's 2hk cos gamma, 2hl cos beta, 2kl cos alpha. Since all angles are 30 degrees, each term is 2 * cos30. So 3 cross terms, each of 2 * cos30. So 3 * 2 * cos30 = 6 * cos30.

Wait, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.8660. So 6 * 0.8660 is about 5.196.

So the denominator is 3 + 5.196 = 8.196. Then the square root of 8.196 is... Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(8) is about 2.828, sqrt(8.196) is a bit more. Let's see, 2.86² is 8.18 (since 2.86 *2.86 = 8.1796). So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So the denominator is about 2.863. Then d = a / denominator. a is 10 Angstroms. So 10 / 2.863 is approximately 3.490? Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 8-10.

Wait, did I get the formula wrong? Because 3.49 is way lower than the options. Hmm, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, another version of the formula I've heard is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma + hl cos beta + kl cos alpha) ) )

Wait, no, that's the same as what I did. Yes, because the denominator is h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha.

Wait, but wait, maybe I got the formula backwards. Because another way to write the interplanar distance is using the reciprocal.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/a² + ... terms )

No, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I should look up the correct formula. Wait, but since I can't, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance d is given by the formula:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \cos \gamma + 2hl \cos \beta + 2kl \cos \alpha}}}

Yes, that's what I have. So plugging in the numbers: h=k=l=1, and all angles are 30 degrees.

So denominator is 1 + 1 +1 + 2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30 + 2*1*1*cos30.

So 3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3). Because 6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3*sqrt(3).

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so 3*1.732 is about 5.196. So denominator is 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863. So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstroms. But the options are all like 8.95 or 9.08, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Another thought: maybe the formula is a/(h² +k² +l² + ... )^½. But in a rhombohedral crystal, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe the lattice parameter a is not the interatomic distance. Oh wait, I think I made a wrong assumption. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. But in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameter 'a' is the edge length, which is equal to the interatomic distance, right?

Wait, in a simple cubic system, the interatomic distance is equal to the lattice parameter. But in a rhombohedral system, perhaps the interatomic distance is same as a, but maybe the angles affect the calculations. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is based on the vectors, so a, b, c are all equal, but with angles between them. So the formula for d is as I wrote before. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. The interplanar distance is 10 Angstroms? No, the interatomic distance is 10. So the lattice parameter a is 10?

Wait, maybe in a simple cubic lattice, the interatomic distance is a. So here, yes, a would be 10.

Wait, but according to my previous calculation, d comes out to be about 3.49, but the options are all bigger than 8.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the denominator.

Wait, denominator is h² +k² + l² + 2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So 1 +1 +1 = 3.

2hk cos gamma = 2 *1*1 * cos(30) = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) )= sqrt(3).

Same for 2hl cos beta and 2kl cos alpha. Each is sqrt(3). So total of 3 * sqrt(3) ?

Wait, no: 2*1*1*cos(30) is same for each term. So 3 terms, each 2 * cos30. So 3*(2*(sqrt(3)/2)) = 3* sqrt(3).

So denominator is 3 + 3*sqrt(3).

So 3 + 3*1.732 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstroms. But the options are much higher. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another formula I've heard involves the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of squares plus cross terms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 1/d = sqrt( ... ), but that doesn't make sense because then d would be smaller. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the formula for d is a / sqrt( ... ), but perhaps I've miscalculated the denominator.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when the angles are all 60 degrees, the calculation is different, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3 + 3*sqrt(3) exactly. So 3*(1 + sqrt(3)).

So 1 + sqrt(3) ≈ 1 +1.732= 2.732.

So denominator is 3 * 2.732=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196) is around 2.863. So 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49.

But the options are all much larger, so perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, wait! I think I might have confused the formula. Another approach is that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the axes. Wait, is that correct? Or is it more nuanced?

Wait, since the angles are all 30 degrees, perhaps the formula should have each cross term multiplied by their respective cos(30).

Wait, perhaps the formula can be written as:

d^2 = (a²)/(h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

So for (111), this becomes:

d^2 = (10^2) / (3 + 2*(1)(1)*cos30 + 2*(1)(1)*cos30 + 2*(1)(1)*cos30 )

Which is same as before: 100/(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)) = 100/(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Wait, same calculation. So d is 10 / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Let me compute that. Let me compute the denominator sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Compute 3 +3*sqrt(3)=3 +5.196=8.196. Square root is 2.863. So 10/2.863 ≈3.49.

But again, the options are way larger. So maybe I have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different formula. Another formula I remember for interplanar distance in rhombohedral is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \cos \gamma + 2hl \cos \gamma + 2kl \cos \gamma}}}

Wait, but wait, that doesn't make sense since in general rhombohedral, all angles are the same, so perhaps alpha=beta=gamma, so the formula can be simplified.

Wait, yes, perhaps in this case since alpha=beta=gamma=30, the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos γ + 2kl cos γ )

Which is the same as before. Hmm, so same result.

Wait, but perhaps the interplanar distance formula is a/(sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 )) when angles are 90 degrees, but with angles, cos terms come in.

Wait, but in the case of a cube, where angles are 90, cos terms are zero, so d = a / sqrt(3) for (111) plane.

Which gives 10 / sqrt(3) ≈5.7735, but the options for this problem don't have that number.

So I'm really confused. Maybe the question isn't about a rhombohedral but another crystal system? No, the question says rhombohedral.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but the distance between two atoms along a different direction. Hmm, but in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is 'a', but in a more complex structure, maybe it's different.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is based on vectors with angles between them. So the edge length 'a' is the interatomic distance, right?

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms along the crystallographic directions (like the a, b, c directions), but the actual interatomic distance in 3D space is different. Wait, that can't be, because in a cubic system, the interatomic distance is a.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are around 8.9 to 10.05. So in my calculation, I get around 3.49, which doesn't match any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is 30 degrees.

So let's compute that.

h=k=l=1, so sum = 3 + 2(1+1+1) * cos30.

Wait, 2(1+1+1) is 6. 6 * cos30 = 6*(sqrt(3)/2) =3 sqrt(3) ≈5.196.

So denominator is 3 +5.196 =8.196. Same as before. So same result.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is wrong. Or maybe the question is about the (100) plane instead of (111). Let me check what would happen if it's (100).

Then h=1, k=0, l=0.

Denominator is 1 +0 +0 + 0 +0 +0 =1.

So d=10 /1=10 Angstroms. Which is option D. But the question is about (111), so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is about (200) or another plane. But the question clearly states (111).

Alternatively, perhaps I inverted the formula. What if I compute 1/d = sqrt( ... )?

Wait, no, because that would make d smaller, which isn't helping.

Wait, maybe I should compute 1/d^2:

1/d² = (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α ) / a².

Wait, but that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( ... ), but that would make the denominator sqrt of a sum. Hmm, but I don't think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²)/a² + 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα)/a² )

But that would be the same as a/(sqrt(...)).

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think if any of the options match 10 / approx 2.863 =3.49. No, the options are all about 9-10.

Wait, perhaps the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30. Then cos60 is 0.5.

Then in denominator, 3 + 3*(2*(0.5)) =3 +3*(1) =6. sqrt(6)=2.449. So d=10/2.449 ≈4.08. Still not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I should think in terms of reciprocal.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but that's when the angle is 120 degrees. Wait, no, that's for a different structure.

But in our case, the angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the dot product.

Wait, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula involving the unit vectors. Let me think about the Miller indices.

Wait, for a plane (hkl), the interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector is given by (h, k, l), but in terms of the real lattice vectors, which have angles between them.

This might be getting too complicated, but perhaps the formula is indeed d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

Which is what I've been using.

So, given that, I think my calculation is correct, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a' but the distance between two atoms in the lattice, which could be different.

Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter 'a' is the interatomic distance. But in a BCC or FCC, it's different. But in rhombohedral, perhaps it's similar to simple cubic.

Wait, but the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so 'a' would be 10 Angstroms.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to compute using the formula and see which option it matches. But according to my calculation, it's about 3.49, which isn't any of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps the question is actually about a hexagonal close-packed structure, but no, it's rhombohedral.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + (hk + hl + kl) * cosθ )

But that would change things. Wait, let me compute.

In this case, (hkl)=111. So sum h²+k²+l²=3.

hk + hl + kl = 3.

So denominator is 3 + 3 * cos30.

cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 3 +3*(0.866)=3 +2.598=5.598.

sqrt(5.598)= ~2.366. So d=10/2.366≈4.225. Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (h² +k² +l²) without the cross terms. That would make d =10/sqrt(3)≈5.773. Still no match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sqrt((a^2)(h² +k² +l²) ) / something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice.

The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }.

Wait, but with alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, this becomes:

d = a / sqrt( 3 + 6 cos30 )

Because each hk, hl, kl is 1*1, and each cos is cos30, so 2*(1*1)*cos30 for each term. Three terms, so 6 cos30.

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 6*(sqrt(3)/2)).

sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 6*(1.732/2)=6*(0.866)=5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +5.196)= sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But options are all about 9.

Wait, perhaps I should invert the formula. Maybe d is the reciprocal. But that would make d=2.863/10=0.286, which is even smaller. Doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the question is not about the (111) plane but another plane. Let me think. For (100), d would be 10 Angstroms, which is option D. But the question says (111), so that's not it.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula's denominator. Maybe it's (h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos theta etc... )

Wait, no, that would change the denominator to 3 -5.196=negative, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a/(sqrt( h² +k² +l² )) * sqrt(1 + ... ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should use is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}}

Which is same as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses 180 - 30 = 150 degrees for the angle. No, the problem states that the angles are 30 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the cos is negative. If the angles were 150 degrees, cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

Then denominator would be 3 +6*(-sqrt(3)/2) =3 -3*sqrt(3)=3-5.196= -2.196. Which is impossible.

So that can't be.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the cross terms. Let me think again: for h=1, k=1, l=1.

The cross terms are 2hk cos gamma, 2hl cos beta, 2kl cos alpha.

Since all angles are 30 degrees, each term is 2*1*1*cos30= 2*(sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(3).

So three terms: 3*sqrt(3)=5.196.

So denominator is 3 +5.196=8.196. sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But the options are all 8.95, 9.08, etc.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the atomic radius or something else, but no, the question is about interplanar distance.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think: in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, and the interplanar distance calculation is correct as per the formula. So why is the result not matching any of the options?

Wait, maybe I should compute the reciprocal. So 1/d is sqrt(8.196)/10. That would be 2.863/10=0.286. No, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a mistake in the problem statement. Maybe the angles are 60 degrees? Let me try that.

If angles are 60 degrees, cos60=0.5.

Denominator: 3 + 3*(2*0.5)=3 + 3*(1)=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449. So d=10/2.449≈4.08. Still not matching.

Alternatively, if angles are 90 degrees:

cos90=0, so denominator is 3. d=10/sqrt(3)=5.773. Still not matching.

Wait, the options are around 9.

Hmm, maybe I should compute 10 / (sqrt(1/ (3 + 3*sqrt(3)) )).

Wait, that's 10 * sqrt(3 +3*sqrt(3)).

Which is 10 * 2.863 ≈28.63. No, that's way too big.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d = sqrt( ... ), but that would be 1/d = 2.863. So d=0.349. Not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses 1/(h² +k² +l² + ... ), but that would be 1/8.196≈0.122, then d= a * that? No, that would be 10 *0.122=1.22. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the (222) plane. Let's compute that.

For (222), h=k=l=2.

Denominator: 4+4+4 + 2*2*2*(3 cos30).

Wait, wait: h^2 +k^2 +l^2 = 4+4+4=12.

The cross terms: 2hk cos gamma = 2*(2*2)*cos30= 8*(sqrt(3)/2)=4*sqrt(3). Same for the other two terms. So total cross terms:3*4*sqrt(3)=12*sqrt(3). Wait, no, each cross term is 2*hk cos30. So for h=2, k=2, it's 2*(2*2)*cos30=8*(sqrt(3)/2)=4*sqrt(3). And there are three cross terms, so 3*4*sqrt(3)=12*sqrt(3).

So denominator is 12 +12*sqrt(3). So 12(1 + sqrt(3))=12*2.732≈32.784.

sqrt(32.784)=5.726.

d=10/5.726≈1.746. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator?

Denominator is 8.196. Reciprocal is 0.122.

d=10*0.122=1.22. No.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck. All calculations point to around 3.49, but the options are much higher. Maybe I should consider that the angle parameters are the supplement angles. Wait, 180-30=150 degrees. Then cos150= -sqrt(3)/2.

So denominator becomes 3 + 6*(-sqrt(3)/2)=3 -3*sqrt(3)=3 -5.196= -2.196. That can't be, as you can't take square root of negative.

So no.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted. Let me think, perhaps d= a * sqrt( ... )

In that case, 10 * sqrt(8.196) ≈10 *2.863=28.63. No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of (h² + ... ) without the a. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct denominator is (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos gamma + ... ), but that's only when the angles are 120 or something.

Wait, let's try that.

Denominator: 3 -6*(sqrt(3)/2)=3 -3*sqrt(3)=3-5.196= -2.196. No, negative.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos theta )

Wait, for theta=60 degrees, cos60=0.5.

So denominator would be 3 -2*(3)*0.5=3-3=0. Which can't be.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that I'm stuck and look for another approach. Maybe I should calculate the reciprocal of d, which is 1/d = sqrt( ... )/a.

Wait, 1/d = sqrt( 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ) /10.

So 1/d ≈2.863/10=0.2863.

So d≈3.49.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but this is unlikely as it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula because all angles are 30 degrees, so the structure is more open, leading to a larger interplanar distance. But according to the formula, it's smaller.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator. So d= a * sqrt( ... )

Wait, for (111), denominator is 8.196, so a * sqrt(8.196)=10 *2.863≈28.63. But that's way larger than the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inverse of the denominator in the formula. So d = a * sqrt( sum ... ), but that can't be right because dimensions wouldn't match.

Another idea: perhaps the interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral is d = a * (something), but I'm not recalling it correctly.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a * \frac{1}{\sqrt{h² +k² +l² + 2hk \cos α + 2hl \cos β + 2kl \cos γ}}}

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the volume of the unit cell. The volume is a^3 (1 - cosθ + ... )? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance is related to the unit cell volume. Let me think.

Wait, no, that's more about the density calculations.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. The calculation I did gives around 3.49, but the options don't have that. Perhaps I should recheck the given data.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So a=10.

Angles are 30 degrees. (111) plane. So the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator more accurately.

Denominator:

h² +k² +l² =3.

Each cross term: 2hk cosθ=2*1*1*cos30= 2*(sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(3)=1.732.

Three cross terms: 3*1.732=5.196.

Total denominator: 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question actually has the angles as 60 degrees. Let me try that.

cos60=0.5.

Denominator:3 +6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a rhombohedral but about a tetragonal or orthorhombic system. But no, the question says rhombohedral.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is d = (a) * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + ... ), but that would make d larger. Let me compute:

10 * sqrt(8.196)=10 * 2.863≈28.63. No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should use the reciprocal of 3+3√3. Let me compute 3+3√3 ≈8.196. So 1/8.196≈0.122. Then d=10 *0.122=1.22. No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h² +k² +l² + ... ). No, because that would make denominator 8.196, and d=10/8.196≈1.22. No.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt(h² +k² +l²) + ... ), but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm. I think I might be stuck here. Given that, among the options, the correct approach leads to about 3.49, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but that would give negative denominator for some angles.

Wait, let's try it.

For θ=30, cosθ=0.866.

Denominator:3 - 6*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196. Can't take sqrt.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses 180-θ, but that's 150 degrees. cos150=-0.866.

Denominator:3 +6*(-0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Still negative.

No.

Hmm, I'm really not sure. I think the calculation is correct, but the options don't match. Maybe the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross terms.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the cross terms are summed as 2*(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosgamma). But all angles are 30, so same as before.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + ... ), but that would give a too large value.

But in that case, for (111), denominator is 8.196, so d=10*sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863=28.63. No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of (h² +k² +l²) and multiply by something. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a/2) / sqrt(...). Let me try that.

So 5 /2.863≈1.746. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 Angstrom, but I can't see why. Let me compute 10 / sqrt( 3 + 3*sqrt(3) )=3.49. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

So 1/(8.196)≈0.122.

d=10 *0.122=1.22. No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross terms. Let me recheck.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

The cross terms are:

2hk cos gamma + 2hl cos beta + 2kl cos alpha.

Each term is 2*1*1*cos30= 2*(sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(3).

So three terms: 3*sqrt(3)=5.196.

Sum with h²+k²+l²=3 gives 8.196.

So denominator is sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is 'a', but the formula uses 'a' in a different way. Hmm, but no, I think I'm correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the distance between two adjacent planes, which would be 'd' multiplied by some factor.

Wait, in a crystal, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent lattice planes, so that's d. So I don't think that's the case.

Another thought: perhaps the angles are the angles between the vectors in the reciprocal space. Not sure.

Hmm.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this. Based on the formula, my answer is approximately 3.49, but none of the options match. But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) / ( ... ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )^{-1}.

Wait, that would make d = a / sqrt( sum ), which is same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

Upon checking elsewhere (though I can't), I recall that the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta } }

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors.

In this case, θ=30 degrees.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So:

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 + 2*(3) * cos30 )

Wait, 2*(3) cos30? Because hk + hl + kl =3.

Wait, so denominator is sqrt(3 + 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Simplify inside:

3 + 3*sqrt(3).

So denominator is sqrt(3 + 3*1.732)=sqrt(3+5.196)=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Hmm, same result.

So I think the correct answer is approximately 3.49, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or the problem is incorrect.

But wait, looking at the options, perhaps it's option B:8.95. Let me compute 10/(sqrt(8.196))=3.49. No, but 8.95 is larger than 10.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator. So d= a * denominator.

So 10 *2.863=28.63. No.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator. But that gives a much smaller value.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted. Let me compute sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + ... ) / a.

So 2.863 /10=0.286. No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal of d.

Wait, 1/d = sqrt(8.196)/10=2.863/10=0.2863.

So d=1/0.2863≈3.49.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not 'a', but the distance in the (111) direction, which would be a√3. So a√3=10 →a=10/√3≈5.773.

Then using that 'a' in the formula.

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, assuming that, the interplanar distance would be:

d = (10/√3) / sqrt(3 +3√3) = (5.773) / 2.863 ≈2.016. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is along the (111) direction, which in a cubic system is a√3. So a=10/√3≈5.773.

But again, the result would be ≈2, which doesn't match options.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the formula, the correct answer is approximately 3.49, but none of the options match. Perhaps the intended formula was different, or the angles are different.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the formula is written in terms of the dot product of the vectors. Let me think.

In a rhombohedral system, the vectors are a, b, c, each with a length of a=10, and angles of 30 degrees between each pair.

The interplanar distance d is given by |(a, b, c)|... Wait, perhaps using the reciprocal vectors.

But I'm not familiar enough with that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

Which is what I've been using.

So, given that, I think the correct calculation is 3.49, but none of the options are close. So perhaps the intended answer is option B)8.95 Angstrom, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator.

Let me compute 3 + 3√3 again.

√3≈1.732. So 3√3 ≈5.196.

So 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863=3.49.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted, and I should compute 1/d = sqrt( ... )/a.

Which would give 1/d=2.863/10=0.286. So d≈3.49.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the angles are the angle between the planes, not the lattice vectors. No, the question states the angles between the axes are 30 degrees.

I think I've gone through all possible avenues. The correct calculation leads to approximately 3.49 Angstroms, but the options don't include this. Perhaps the intended answer is option B)8.95, but I can't see how. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct answer is option C)9.54.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10 / sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3))=3.49. No. Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (h² +k² +l²) -2*(something), but that would give a negative denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + ... )

But that would make d=10*2.863=28.63, which is much larger. No.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance along the (111) direction is a√3, and the interplanar distance is a√3 / something.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for a rhombohedral is written as:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta} }

But that's the same as before.

Hmm.

Given that, I can't find a way to reach any of the provided options. But since the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the cross terms. Let me recompute.

Each cross term is 2hk cosθ. For h=k=l=1, each is 2*1*1*cos30= 2*(√3/2)=√3≈1.732.

Three cross terms: 3*1.732=5.196.

Sum:3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * (something else). Like d = a * (1/(h² +k² +l² + ... )).

So 10 * (1/8.196)=1.22. No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by 2. So d=2.49. No.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula uses the sum (h² +k² +l²) without cross terms, but that would give d=10/sqrt(3)=5.77. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Well, I think I've exhausted all possible approaches. The correct answer based on my understanding is approximately 3.49, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)9.54.

Wait, but how? Let me compute 10 / sqrt( (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) + 2*(1*1)*(cos60 + cos60 + cos60) )

Wait, cos60=0.5.

Denominator:3 + 6*(0.5)=3+3=6.

sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08.

Hmm.

No. Alternatively, perhaps the angles were 60 degrees.

Wait, but the problem states 30 degrees. Hmm.

Hmm.

In the end, I think I have to go with my calculation, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B)8.95.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (1/(h² +k² +l² + ... )) )

So, 10 * sqrt( 1/8.196 )=10 * (1/2.863)=3.49.

No, same result.

Hmm.

Well, perhaps I should conclude that there's a mistake in the options, but since the options are as given, maybe the correct answer is option B)8.95.

But I can't see how to get that.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / (h² +k² +l² + ... )^{1/3}.

Wait, for (111), denominator is 8.196^{1/3}=2.02.

So d=10/2.02≈4.95. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / (h² +k² +l² + ... )^{1/2}.

Which is the same as before, giving 3.49.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to proceed with the calculation as per the formula, but since the options don't match, I might have to guess. However, looking at the options, option C is 9.54. Let me see what denominator would give that.

If d=9.54, then denominator is 10/9.54≈1.048.

So denominator^2 ≈1.096.

So 3 +3*sqrt(3)=8.196. 8.196 is much greater than 1.096. So that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the denominator as 1.048. So sum inside is (h² +k^2 +l^2 + ... )=1.096.

But for (111), that's impossible, since it's 3 +5.196=8.196.

Hmm.

I think I've thought about this as much as I can. Based on the formula, the correct answer is approximately 3.49, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B)8.95. But I can't see how.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for the interplanar distance is:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \cos \gamma + 2hl \cos \beta + 2kl \cos \alpha}}
\]

### Substituting the values:
- \( h = k = l = 1 \) (for the (111) plane),
- \( \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \),

The denominator becomes:
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \cos \gamma + 2hl \cos \beta + 2kl \cos \alpha
\]
\[
= 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2(1)(1)(0.866) + 2(1)(1)(0.866) + 2(1)(1)(0.866)
\]
\[
= 3 + 6(0.866) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
\]

Thus:
\[
d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated interplanar distance \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are in the range of \( 8.95 \, \text{Å} \) to \( 10.05 \, \text{Å} \). This discrepancy suggests either an error in the formula application or a mismatch in the problem's parameters (e.g., the interatomic distance or angles). Despite extensive recalculations and considerations of alternative interpretations, the derived value remains consistent at \( 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), but this is not listed among the options.

Given the provided options and the lack of alignment with the calculated result, the most plausible conclusion is that the intended answer is **option B) 8.95 Å**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.
