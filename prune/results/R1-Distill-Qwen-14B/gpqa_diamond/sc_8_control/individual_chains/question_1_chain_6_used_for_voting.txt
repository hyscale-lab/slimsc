Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2, and their lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of an energy level is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ/2, maybe? So the formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, because that's the time it exists before decaying or something. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by (2 times the lifetime). But wait, since we have two different lifetimes, maybe each state has its own uncertainty.

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Let me think. So the energy levels have their own lifetimes. The energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. To resolve them, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Otherwise, the energy levels might not be distinguishable.

Wait, no, perhaps it's about the energy uncertainty. So each state has an uncertainty in energy, and for them to be resolvable, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The energy levels have a certain lifetime, which relates to their energy uncertainty. So for each state, ΔE = ħ/(2τ), where τ is the lifetime. So for E1, τ is 1e-9 sec. So ΔE1 is ħ/(2e-9). For E2, τ is 1e-8 sec, so ΔE2 is ħ/(2e-8).

Wait, but wait, no, the energy uncertainty for each state would be ΔE_i = ħ/(2τ_i). So for E1, with τ=1e-9, ΔE1 is higher (since τ is smaller), and for E2, ΔE2 is lower (since τ is larger).

But the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Let me denote ΔE = E2 - E1. To be distinguishable, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of both states. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum, the states might overlap in their energy distributions, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is approximately ħ/(2τ). So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2).

If the energy difference between E2 and E1 is much larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the states are well-separated and can be distinguished. So the condition is that ΔE > max(ΔE1, ΔE2). But wait, let me think about that. Because if ΔE is much larger than both, then clearly there's a separation. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties. Hmm.

Let me compute the uncertainties. Let's pick ħ as approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So for E1, τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * τ1) = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) )= (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) = approx 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = (6.582e-16)/(2e-8) = 6.582e-16/(2e-8) = 3.291e-8 eV.

Wait, so E1 has a larger uncertainty because its lifetime is shorter. So to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or perhaps larger than the larger of the two uncertainties.

Wait, let's think about the energy distributions. Each state's energy has a spread of ΔE_i around it. So the energy E1 is in the range [E1 - ΔE1, E1 + ΔE1], and E2 is in [E2 - ΔE2, E2 + ΔE2]. For these two ranges not to overlap, the energy difference E2 - E1 must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the difference is bigger than the sum of the spreads, there's no overlap.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try an example. Suppose E1 is 10 eV, ΔE1 is 2 eV. E2 is 12 eV, ΔE2 is 1 eV. So E1 is in (8, 12), E2 is in (11,13). The difference is 2 eV, which is less than ΔE1 (2) + ΔE2 (1) =3. So the ranges would overlap between 11 and 12 eV. So E1 and E2 can't be distinguished because their energy ranges overlap.

But if the difference is bigger than the sum, say E2 is 14 eV, then E1 is (8,12), E2 is (13,15). No overlap, so they're distinguishable.

So the condition is that for them to be clearly resolved, ΔE must be greater than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, but in the question, the options are given as the energy differences. So we need to compute ΔE = E2 - E1, which should be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let's compute ΔE1 and ΔE2. Using the numbers I had earlier.

ΔE1 ≈ 3.291e-7 eV.

ΔE2 ≈ 3.291e-8 eV.

So sum is 3.291e-7 + 3.291e-8 = approx 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than 3.62e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV. That's way bigger than 3.62e-7 eV, so it would satisfy the condition.

Other options: A is 1e-9, which is smaller than 3.62e-7, so not enough. Option B is 1e-11, way too small. D is 1e-8, which is about 3.29e-8. Wait, 3.29e-8 is less than 3.62e-7 (which is 3.62 x 1e-7 = 3.62e-7). So option D (1e-8 eV) is 0.1 times ΔE2. So 1e-8 is 0.1 times 1e-7, which is less than 3.62e-7. So D is not enough.

So the correct option is C, 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) that can be clearly resolved, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the product of the energy uncertainty (\( \Delta E \)) and the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of a state is approximately \( \hbar / 2 \), where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For each state, the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E_i = \frac{\hbar}{2 \tau_i}
\]

For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

Now, we compare this threshold with the given options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it does not satisfy the condition.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it does not satisfy the condition.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is significantly larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it satisfies the condition.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it does not satisfy the condition.

Thus, the energy difference must be \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to ensure the two energy levels are clearly distinguishable.
