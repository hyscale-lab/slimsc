Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. So, the setup is a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, so that's the β2 case.

Wait, but stability constants are for the formation of complexes. So each β represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ions. So β1 would be for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, etc.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, so that's the species with two SCN- ligands. So I need to find the fraction of Co in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Hmm. I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution of the species depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions involved.

In general, the fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations. The formula for the fraction f_n of the complex with n SCN- ligands is given by:

f_n = (β_n [Co] [SCN]^n) / Σ (β_k [Co] [SCN]^k) for k=0 to 4

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The total concentration of all species is the sum of each complex's concentration. Since the problem gives the total cobalt concentration as [Co] = 1e-2 M, and each complex is a different form of Co, the sum of the concentrations of all the complexes equals [Co]_total.

Wait, but each complex has a different number of SCN- ions. So, for the nth complex, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co]_free [SCN]^n.

But the total [Co] is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n], where n ranges from 0 to 4 (since β4 is given). So [Co] = [Co]_free (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but wait, no. For each complex, like [Co(SCN)_n], the concentration is β_n [Co]_free [SCN]^n. So the total Co is [Co] = [Co]_free (sum from n=0 to 4 of β_n [SCN]^n )

Wait, but β_0 is 1, since [Co]_free is the concentration when n=0. Because β_0 would be the stability constant for the complex with zero SCN- ions, which is just the free Co^2+ ion. So β_0 =1.

So the equation is:

[Co]_total = [Co]_free (β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which simplifies to:

[Co]_total = [Co]_free (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

From this equation, I can solve for [Co]_free.

Once I have [Co]_free, the concentration of each complex is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co]_free [SCN]^n.

So the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co]_total.

Wait, no. Because [Co]_total is the sum of all [Co(SCN)_n], including [Co]_free. So [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co]_free [SCN]^n. So the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co]_total.

But [Co]_total = [Co]_free (1 + β1 [SCN] + ... + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n [Co]_free ) / ( [Co]_free (sum terms) )) ) = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (sum terms )

So, f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / sum_{k=0 to 4} (β_k [SCN]^k )

Ah, that's the formula. So I can compute the sum denominator for each n and find the fraction.

So, let's compute each term:

First, [SCN] is 0.1 M.

Compute each β_n [SCN]^n for n=0,1,2,3,4.

n=0: β0=1, [SCN]^0=1 → 1 *1 = 1.

n=1: β1=9, [SCN]=0.1 → 9*0.1=0.9

n=2: β2=40, [SCN]^2=0.01 → 40 *0.01 = 0.4

n=3: β3=63, [SCN]^3=0.001 → 63 * 0.001 = 0.063

n=4: β4=16, [SCN]^4=0.0001 → 16 *0.0001 =0.0016

Now, sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063= 2.363

2.363 +0.0016= 2.3646

So the denominator is 2.3646.

Now, for each n, the numerator for f_n is β_n [SCN]^n.

We are interested in n=2 (blue dithiocyanato complex), so f_2 is (β2 [SCN]^2) / sum → 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let me compute that: 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.4 / 2.3646.

Let's calculate 0.4 ÷ 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 is approximately 2.3646.

So dividing 0.4 by that.

Hmm, 2.3646 times 0.169 is about 0.399, since 2.3646 * 0.169 ≈ 0.4.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169.

Wait, but wait, 0.169 is about 16.9%. But wait, that's the fraction for n=2.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

0.4 ÷ 2.3646.

Well, 2.3646 × 0.169 ≈ 0.4.

Wait, let's compute 2.3646 × 0.169:

0.169 * 2 = 0.338.

0.169 * 0.3646 ≈ 0.169 * 0.36 ≈ 0.06084, and 0.169 * 0.0046 ≈ 0.0007774. So total ≈ 0.06084 + 0.0007774 = 0.0616174.

So 0.338 + 0.0616174 ≈ 0.3996.

Which is approximately 0.4, so 0.169 is correct.

So f_2 ≈ 0.169, which is around 16.9%, so option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because sometimes the order of the β's can be confusing. Wait, the problem states β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So n=1: β1=9, n=2: β2=40, n=3: β3=63, n=4: β4=16.

Wait, but when I computed the terms for n=2, I used β2=40, which is correct. So the calculation for n=2 is 40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

Wait, but wait, the sum is 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 +0.0016 = 2.3646.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%, so option D.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

But wait, another thought: sometimes, the formation constants are given for different complexes. So for example, β1 might be for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc. So in that case, the formula would correctly use β2 for the dithiocyanato complex.

So according to this, the fraction is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait a second, could I have made a mistake in the sum? Let me re-calculate the sum.

n=0: 1 → 1.

n=1: β1=9, [SCN]=0.1 → 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: β2=40, [SCN]^2=0.01 → 40 *0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3=63, [SCN]^3=0.001 → 63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4=16, [SCN]^4=0.0001 → 16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 1 + 0.9 = 1.9.

1.9 +0.4 =2.3.

2.3 +0.063 =2.363.

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

Yes, correct.

And the numerator for n=2 is 0.4.

So 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169 → 16.9%.

So, the correct answer should be D) 16.9%.

But wait, looking at the options again, the options are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So option D is 16.9%, which matches my calculation.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations. The stability constants are β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16, and the concentrations are [Co] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M.

The fraction of each cobalt complex is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
\]

Here, the denominator is the sum of all terms \(\beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k\) for \(k=0\) to \(k=4\). The numerator corresponds to the term for \(n=2\), which represents the dithiocyanato complex.

### Step 1: Calculate each term in the denominator
- \(n=0\): \(\beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \(n=1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
- \(n=2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4\)
- \(n=3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063\)
- \(n=4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016\)

Summing these terms gives the denominator:
\[
1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction for \(n=2\)
The numerator for \(n=2\) is \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 0.4\). Thus, the fraction is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex is:
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.
