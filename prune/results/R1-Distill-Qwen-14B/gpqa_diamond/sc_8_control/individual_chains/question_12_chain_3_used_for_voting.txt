Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the decay of a pion. Hmm, let me think. The question is finding the kinetic energies of the product particles when a Pi(+) at rest decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion's rest mass is given as 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each listing two energies. 

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So after decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to balance each other out.

The pion's rest mass is higher than the muon, so the decay must produce some kinetic energy. But how much?

First, let's think about the energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the pion's rest energy, which is m_pi c², but since everything is in MeV/c² units, I can ignore the c terms because they just boil down to factors that cancel out when using MeV units for energy.

So, the initial energy is m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass, so its energy is gamma * m_mu c². The neutrino is massless (or at least considered so for these calculations), so its energy is just its momentum times c.

But wait, neutrinos have very tiny masses, but in problems like this, I think we assume they're massless for simplicity. So the neutrino's energy is |p_nu| * c.

Conserving energy: m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

And since momentum is zero initially, the momenta of mu and nu must cancel. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|, and their directions are opposite.

But the muon's momentum is p_mu = gamma * m_mu * v, and since E_mu = gamma m_mu c².

Alternatively, E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2.

So, let's set the neutrino's momentum as p. Then the muon's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction. So the total momentum is zero.

So, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c. The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units are a bit tricky. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p.

The initial energy is m_pi, so:

m_pi = E_mu + E_nu
= sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Let me write that equation:

m_pi = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p.

I need to solve for p. Let me rearrange:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p.

Squaring both sides:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2.

Left side: p^2 + m_mu^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranging:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2.

So,

p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi).

Let me plug in the numbers:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV
m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

Calculate numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Hmm, what's 139.6 squared? Let's compute.

139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2: Let's see, 100^2 = 10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2= 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Denominator is 2*139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2. Let me approximate.

279.2 * 30 = 8376 (because 279.2 * 20=5584; + 79.6*10=796 → 5584+796=6380, but wait, 30×279.2=8376. Hmm, 8376 is larger than 8315.67.

So 29.8 * 279.2 is around 8315.67?

Wait, let me compute 279.2 × 29.8:

279.2 ×30 = 8376.

But since it's 29.8, which is 0.2 less than 30.

So 29.8 = 30 - 0.2.

So 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2*(30) - 279.2*(0.2) = 8376 - (55.84) = 8376-55.84=8320.16.

Wait, our numerator is 8315.67, which is a bit less than 8320.16.

So 29.8 gives 8320.16, but we need 8315.67. The difference is 8320.16 -8315.67=4.49.

So, to find p, since 279.2 × x = 8315.67, and x is about 29.8 - some small delta.

Calculating: 4.49 /279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So x ≈29.8 -0.016=29.784.

Approximately around 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, p is 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, in the equation, p is (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) which is 8315.67 /279.2 ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu is equal to p, so the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78^2 ≈ 886.8 (since 30^2=900, minus 13.2 → approx 886.8).

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

Adding 886.8 + 11172.49 = 12059.29.

Square root of that is sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

Wait, that's the KE for muon. The neutrino's KE would be its energy since it's massless. Because the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its entire energy is kinetic. So neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

Wait wait, but wait the options have the first value as KE for mu(+) and the second for nu? Or the other way around?

Wait the question says, "KE of product particles in Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu." So the products are mu and nu. So the KEs are for mu and nu.

Wait, the problem is asking for the KEs of the product particles. So mu's KE is 4.11 MeV, and nu's KE is 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which matches our calculations.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Another way is to compute the total energy.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So mu's KE is 109.81 - 105.7 =4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p=29.78 MeV, and since it's massless, all of that is KE.

So the KEs are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8, which is very close.

But wait, let me make sure that I didn't mix the order. The problem says "KE of product particles in Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu." So the first value is mu's KE, the second is nu's.

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing: the initial pion is at rest. The muon and neutrino must go in opposite directions, so their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the muon's momentum is p_mu = gamma m_mu v, but since the neutrino is massless, its momentum is p_nu = E_nu / c. Wait, but in units where c=1, E_nu = p_nu.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the pion's rest frame.

Alternatively, another approach: the total energy is m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

The total momentum is zero, so p_mu = -p_nu.

For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2? Wait, no, E is in units of MeV, so perhaps it's E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c )^2 + (m_mu c^2 )^2 ) /c²? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with units.

Alternatively, let's use natural units where c=1, so E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p_nu.

Since p_mu = - p_nu, their magnitudes are equal. So p_mu = p, p_nu = p.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), E_nu = p.

So, m_pi = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Which is the same equation as before.

So solving for p again gives p=(m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi) = ( (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 )/(2*139.6).

Calculating numerator:

(139.6)^2 = 139.6 *139.6.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

139.6 * 139.6:

Break it down as (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7^2 = ?

105.7 *105.7:

Calculate 100 *100 =10000.

100 *5.7 =570, 5.7 *100=570, 5.7 *5.7=32.49.

So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 2*(100*5.7) + 5.7² = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

Denominator is 2 *139.6=279.2.

So p=8315.67 /279.2 ≈29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu =p=29.78 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78^2:

29.78^2 ≈ (30-0.22)^2=900 - 2*30*0.22 + (0.22)^2=900 -13.2 +0.0484=886.8484.

m_mu^2=105.7^2=11172.49.

So sum is 886.8484 +11172.49=12059.3384.

Square root of that: sqrt(12059.3384)= approx 109.81 MeV.

So mu's KE is E_mu - m_mu c² =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

So the KEs are 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is very close.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the kinetic energies of the products in the decay of a stationary pion, we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino, with the following given rest masses:

- Rest mass of the pion: \( m_\pi = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Rest mass of the muon: \( m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy, \( E_\pi = m_\pi c^2 \). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy \( E_\mu \) and the neutrino's energy \( E_\nu \):  
   \[
   m_\pi = E_\mu + E_\nu
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the muon's and neutrino's momenta are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   p_\mu = p_\nu = p
   \]

3. **Muon Energy**:  
   The muon's energy is given by:  
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2}
   \]

4. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p
   \]

### Solving for Momentum \( p \):
Substituting \( E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} \) and \( E_\nu = p \) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
m_\pi = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} + p
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} = m_\pi - p
\]
\[
p^2 + m_\mu^2 = (m_\pi - p)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + m_\mu^2 = m_\pi^2 - 2 m_\pi p + p^2
\]
\[
m_\mu^2 = m_\pi^2 - 2 m_\pi p
\]
\[
2 m_\pi p = m_\pi^2 - m_\mu^2
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_\pi^2 - m_\mu^2}{2 m_\pi}
\]

Substituting the values \( m_\pi = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \):  
\[
p = \frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \cdot 139.6}
\]

Calculating the numerator:  
\[
(139.6)^2 = 19488.16, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49
\]
\[
m_\pi^2 - m_\mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2
\]

Denominator:  
\[
2 m_\pi = 2 \cdot 139.6 = 279.2 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Thus:  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   Since \( E_\nu = p \):  
   \[
   E_\nu = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Muon Energy**:  
   Using \( E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} \):  
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}
   \]
   \[
   (29.78)^2 = 886.8484, \quad (105.7)^2 = 11172.49
   \]
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{886.8484 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.3384} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

3. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_\mu = E_\mu - m_\mu c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final KE Values:
- Muon's kinetic energy: \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Neutrino's kinetic energy: \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \)

### Matching with Options:
The closest match is **Option D**: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \).

Answer: D
