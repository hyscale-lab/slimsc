Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the uncertainty in P_z given the state of the system. Hmm, I remember that uncertainty is calculated using the variance formula, right? So the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z.

Wait, but first, I need to find the expectation values. Oh, right, the state is given as a column vector. The state is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]. So that's the state vector.

The operator P_z is given as a matrix. Let me write that down. The matrix for P_z is diagonal with entries [ħ, 0, -ħ], right? So, the diagonal elements are for the eigenstates. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, this should make calculations easier.

So to find <P_z>, I need to compute the expectation value, which is ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. Let me compute each component.

The state has components a, b, c. So a is -1/2, b is 1/sqrt(2), c is -1/2.

So <P_z> = a * (ħ a) + b * (0 * b) + c * (-ħ c). Because the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues. So:

= ħ (a² - c²) because the middle term is zero.

Wait, let's compute each term. a squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, c squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So a² - c² is (1/4) - (1/4) = 0. So <P_z> is zero? That's interesting.

Then, I need to find <P_z²>. Since P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element, which would be [ (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 ] → [ ħ², 0, ħ² ].

So <P_z²> is a² ħ² + b² * 0 + c² ħ². Which is (a² + c²) * ħ².

Calculating a²: (1/2)^2 = 1/4. c²: same, 1/4. So a² + c² = 1/2. So <P_z²> = (1/2) ħ².

Wait, but wait, no. Because the state is a column vector, when you compute <P_z²>, you need to take ψ† P_z² ψ. Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal and ψ is in the eigenbasis, it's the same as the sum of |ψ_i|^2 times (P_z)_{ii} squared.

Yes, because ψ is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component is an eigenvalue. So the expectation of P_z squared is sum |c_i|^2 (p_ii)^2.

So let me compute each term:

The first term is |a|^2 * (ħ)^2: |(-1/2)|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * ħ² = ħ²/4.

Second term: |b|^2 * (0)^2 = 0.

Third term: |c|^2 * (-ħ)^2. But (-ħ)^2 is ħ², so |c|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So another ħ²/4.

Adding these together: ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So <P_z²> is ħ²/2.

Wait, but earlier I found <P_z> is zero. So the variance is <P_z²> - (<P_z>)^2 → which is (ħ²/2) - 0 = ħ²/2.

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance, so sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the state vector. The state is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So when computing |a|^2, it's (1/2)^2? Because (-1/2)^2 is 1/4. Similarly for c. So yes, each contributes 1/4, which adds up to 1/2. So that's correct.

Another way to think about it: the state is a superposition of |+z> and |-z> states. The coefficients are each 1/2 (but with signs). But since the state is normalized, let's check: (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/2 +1/4 = 1. So yes, it's correctly normalized.

So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \cdot p_{ii},
\]

where $c_i$ are the components of the state vector and $p_{ii}$ are the diagonal elements of $P_z$. Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, so its diagonal elements are $\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \cdot p_{ii}^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$.

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
