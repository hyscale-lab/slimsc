Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. It's represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The setup is that Ay satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. The matrix Ay is given as c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0).

I need to find the correct statement among the options A to D about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's break this down.

First, I should figure out what the matrix Ay looks like. The constant c is h/(4π), so multiplying that by S. Let's write out matrix S first. So S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, c·S would be:

[ 0*(h/(4π))   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))    0*(h/(4π)) ]

So Ay matrix is:

[ 0           (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0          ]

Wait, the h is Planck's constant. But wait, in quantum mechanics, sometimes ħ (h-bar) is used, which is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. Because ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. Oh right, because ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s, whereas h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, so h/(4π) is the same as ħ/(2). So c = ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

Wait, but S is a spin matrix. Oh wait, S here is probably the Pauli matrices. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and have similar structures. Let me think: the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The standard σ_y matrix is:

[0  -i]
[i  0]

Which is exactly what S is. So S is σ_y. So Ay = c σ_y, where c = ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Now, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's recall that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay is:

[0           (-i ħ/2) ]
[ (i ħ/2)     0       ]

So the matrix Ay - a I is:

[ -a        (-i ħ/2) ]
[ (i ħ/2)   -a       ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i ħ/2)(i ħ/2) ). Let's compute that.

First term: a².

Second term: (-i ħ/2)(i ħ/2) = (-i)(i) * (ħ²/4) ) = ( (-i^2) ) * (ħ²/4) ). Since i^2 is -1, so (-i)(i) is ( - (i^2) ) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (1) * (ħ²/4).

So determinant is a² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

Solving for a: a² = ħ² /4 → a = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. But wait, ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π) * (h/(4π)) ? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute:

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues are a = ± (ħ/2). Since ħ is h/(2π), then ħ/2 is h/(4π). So a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, no. Wait, ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. Because when you solve a² = (ħ/2)^2, you get a real ±.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. Because the determinant was a² - (ħ/2)^2, because (iħ/2)( -i ħ/2 ) is (i*-i)*(ħ^2/4) ) = (1) * ħ²/4. So the equation is a² - (ħ/2)^2 = 0 → a= ± ħ/2.

So eigenvalues are real: ± ħ/2. So in terms of h, it's ± h/(4π). So they're real numbers.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh or –2πh, real parts are ± h/(4π). Wait, but we just found the eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts are zero. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are purely real. So B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Well, A is the angular momentum operator. The components satisfy [A_x, A_y] = i A_z, etc. So the eigenfunctions of A_x, A_y, and A_z are different. However, the square of the angular momentum operator, A², commutes with any component. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's also an eigenfunction of A². Because A² is the Casimir operator and commutes with all components. So option C's first part is correct. But the second part says they're not eigenfunctions of Az. That is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay generally aren't eigenfunctions of Az. Because the components don't commute. So Option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the basis functions are the eigenvectors. So D is saying that the eigenvectors form the basis. Well, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors (if they are two) would span the space, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but can both C and D be correct? Let me think again.

Looking back, the options are each statements, and I have to choose which is correct.

So, the eigenvalues are real numbers, ± ħ/2. So option B is incorrect. Option A is incorrect because eigenvalues are real, so imaginary parts are zero. So A and B are incorrect.

Now, C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which I agree with. Because A² and Ay commute (since A² is the Casimir operator and commutes with all components). So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². But it's not an eigenfunction of Az, because Ay and Az don't commute.

So C is correct.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so it's in a 2-dimensional space. The eigenvectors should form a basis if they're two linearly independent vectors. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That seems correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A². But since Ay and Az don't commute, eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, any 2x2 operator with two eigenvalues (like this one) will have a complete set of eigenvectors, which form a basis. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, the choices are mutually exclusive. Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, another approach: Let's look for which of these statements is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix is 2x2, and if it has two eigenvalues, then the eigenvectors (assuming they're non-degenerate, which they are here since the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which are distinct) form a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So yes, the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator, which is a 2x2 matrix. So D is correct.

So now, I have options C and D as potentially correct. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the problem statement, the matrix S is given as the first row (0, -i), second row (i, 0), which is the Pauli Y matrix. So the operator Ay is proportional to the Pauli Y matrix. So the eigenvalues are ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real.

Now, looking at the options again.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² commutes with Ay, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So this part is correct. However, they are not eigenfunctions of Az because Az and Ay don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct, but the options are multiple-choice, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine option D.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So, the matrix operator is 2x2, which acts on a two-dimensional space. The eigenvectors of Ay form a basis for this space, so yes, they are the basis functions. So D is correct.

Wait, but the eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors. So perhaps option D is correct.

So, which of the options is correct? Let's go through each option again.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's not matching our eigenvalues of ±h/(4π). Unless h is taken as 1, which I don't think it is. So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Correct.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice, so perhaps more than one option is correct. But in the given options, only one is correct. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating D.

Wait, what is a basis function for a matrix operator? The basis vectors are the eigenvectors if the matrix is diagonalizable. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues, it's diagonalizable, so the eigenvectors form a basis. Therefore, option D is correct.

But then, the problem states that which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D are correct? But looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is incorrect. Let me think again about option C. The statement says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum, which would have eigenvalues l(l+1)ħ². For an electron or muon, which are spin-1/2 particles, l=1/2, so A² has eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2 +1) ħ² = (3/4) ħ². So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² as well. So C is correct.

But then why is D correct? Because the eigenvectors form a basis, so their statement in D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the wording of option D is incorrect. It says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay." Wait, the basis functions refer to the basis in which the matrix is represented. But the matrix is already given in a particular basis, perhaps the computational basis. But the eigenvectors are in another basis.

Wait, no. The matrix of Ay is given in the standard basis (assuming S is in the Pauli matrix form, which is usually given in the z and x basis). Wait, no, the Pauli Y matrix isn't diagonal in the computational basis. So the eigenvectors of Ay are in a different basis. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions for that operator, but perhaps the statement in D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space.

Hmm, but perhaps the issue is that the operator's matrix is given in a specific basis, and the eigenvectors are in another basis. So the statement in D is correct because the operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the space, regardless of the original basis.

So both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C and D are both correct, but let me see the options again. The options are A, B, C, D, and I have to choose the correct statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming all 2x2 matrices have two eigenvectors. For a 2x2 matrix, if it's diagonalizable, then yes. Since Ay has two distinct eigenvalues, it is diagonalizable, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But let's read the options again. Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's also correct.

Wait, but which is correct during the calculation. So both C and D are correct? That can't be, because in multiple-choice questions, usually only one option is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, the question is about the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So during that calculation, which statement is correct?

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So, that's correct because, as I said before, A² commutes with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are the same. But Az does not commute, so they don't share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So perhaps, in the context of the matrix given, the basis functions are the eigenvectors. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but I have to choose the one that is correct.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix is given as a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvectors form a basis for that space. So the statement in D is correct.

So, if both C and D are correct, but the options are presented as four options, then perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps only one is correct. Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, the matrix operator has the form Ay = c·S, where S is a 2x2 with first row (0 -i) and second row (i 0). So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. Because S is Hermitian, Ay is Hermitian since c is real. Therefore, Ay has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are incorrect.

Now, considering option C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

As A² commutes with Ay, their eigenfunctions are the same, so C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So yes, the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2x2 space, so D is correct.

Hmm. But in the options, I can only choose one correct statement.

Wait, the problem is a multiple-choice question, so perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the statement in D is incorrect. Because the basis functions of the matrix operator refer to the basis in which the matrix is diagonal, which are the eigenvectors. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions, so D is correct.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach.

Let me compute the eigenvectors to see what they look like.

The eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π).

For a = h/(4π):

We have (Ay - a I) |ψ> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -a      (-i ħ/2) ]
[ (i ħ/2)  -a      ]

Plugging a = ħ/2 = h/(4π), because ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 = h/(4π).

So the matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2      (-i ħ/2) ]
[ (i ħ/2)   -ħ/2     ]

Multiply through by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ -1      -i ]
[ i      -1 ]

So the equations are:

-1 * x -i y = 0 → -x -i y = 0 → x = -i y.

The eigenvectors can be written as (x, y) where x = -i y. So the eigenvector can be taken as (1, -i), up to a scalar multiple.

Similarly, for a = -ħ/2, the matrix becomes:

[ ħ/2      (-i ħ/2) ]
[ (i ħ/2)   ħ/2      ]

Again, multiply by 2/ħ:

[ 1      -i ]
[ i      1 ]

Equations: x -i y = 0 → x = i y. So the eigenvector can be (1, i).

So the eigenvectors are (1, -i) and (1, i), which form a basis for C².

So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are these vectors, which form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Now, what about option C? The eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. So C is correct.

But I can't have both as correct since the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps the matrix operator is given in a particular basis, and the eigenvectors are in another basis. So the basis functions (of the operator) are the eigenvectors, but perhaps D is saying that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is correct because they form a basis.

So, the correct statements would be C and D. But in the options, only one is correct. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing.

Wait, perhaps option C is incorrect. Let me think again about whether the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of Az.

Wait, no. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are not the same. So part of option C is correct. But A² does commute with Ay, so the eigenfunctions are the same for both. So C is correct.

Option D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, so the eigenfunctions are the basis functions.

But if the question is which statement is correct, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the operator A is the angular momentum operator, which is a vector operator. So A² would be the sum of the squares of the components, and for spin-1/2, A² = (3/4) ħ² I. So the eigenvalue of A² is the same for all eigenstates of Ay. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Since the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors, D is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C and D, but the options may not have both. So I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but the problem is, in the calculation, which statement is correct.

So during the calculation, when we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

For example, during the calculation, you might find that the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are incorrect. Then, when looking at the properties of the eigenfunctions, you find that they are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So C is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought D was correct. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Let's look at each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. That is correct because they form a basis.

But the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one is an option.

Alternatively, perhaps only one option is correct. Let me think about the problem again.

Another approach: The problem statement says that the matrix S is given, and the operator is Ay = c·S. The matrix S is given as [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli Y matrix are ±1. So when multiplied by c = ħ/2, the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are real, so A and B are wrong.

Now, eigenvectors of the Pauli Y matrix are (1, -i) and (1, i), which are orthogonal. So they form an orthonormal basis for C².

So, the eigenfunctions are indeed the basis functions of the operator, so D is correct.

Moreover, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², because A² commutes with Ay. So C is also correct.

But since the options are multiple-choice, and only one is correct, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That is correct because the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D seem correct, but I can only choose one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because the question is about the calculation process. So during the calculation, when you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you find that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So C is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix \( A_y \) is therefore:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). The matrix \( A_y - aI \) is:

\[
A_y - aI = \begin{bmatrix} -a & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\ \frac{i h}{4\pi} & -a \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
\]

Solving for \( a \), the eigenvalues are:

\[
a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are real: \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

### Eigenvectors of \( A_y \)
For \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector satisfies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} -\frac{h}{4\pi} & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\ \frac{i h}{4\pi} & -\frac{h}{4\pi} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

This simplifies to \( x = -i y \). Choosing \( y = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector satisfies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{h}{4\pi} & -\frac{i h}{4\pi} \\ \frac{i h}{4\pi} & \frac{h}{4\pi} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]

This simplifies to \( x = i y \). Choosing \( y = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvectors are \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{bmatrix} \), which form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{C}^2 \).

### Analysis of Options
1. **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real: \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).

2. **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning their eigenfunctions are the same. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{bmatrix} \) form a basis for \( \mathbb{C}^2 \), the space on which \( A_y \) acts.

### Conclusion
Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, **option C** is the most relevant because it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), which is a key aspect of the calculation.

Answer: C
