Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, parallax is usually denoted by the symbol 'π' or 'plx' sometimes. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. That means N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So distance is related to parallax. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, but wait, in what units? Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1 / d (parsecs). So if distance d increases, parallax decreases.

So parallax plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. So if I have N proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting d in terms of plx, that would be N ∝ d^5?

Wait, because let's see. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, N increases with the fifth power. But wait, wait. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, r). Hmm. So I think that relates to the density of stars, maybe the number per unit volume or something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance r, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. When you look at a certain region of the sky, the number of stars you can see depends on how far away they are. But the way the question is phrased, the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So in that region, N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant.

I need to find how N changes with distance. So let's write N as a function of distance d. Since plx = 1/d, N = k * (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. So when the distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because, if you go further away, shouldn't the number of stars decrease because they are dimmer and farther? Or maybe in this specific region, the density of stars is such that more stars are present at larger distances.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Wait, wait, the number of stars per unit volume in the galaxy doesn't necessarily stay constant; maybe it varies. But the question is about a specific region of the sky, so the count is based on how many stars are at that distance.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's about the number of stars varying with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a fixed region, as parallax decreases (so as distance increases), the number of stars increases as plx^-5, which with d = 1/plx, becomes d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

But wait, that seems odd because when you look further away, you can see more stars, but in reality, the number of stars visible in a region of the sky decreases with distance because they get fainter. Unless the density of stars increases with distance, which is not the case in our galaxy. Our galaxy's stellar density decreases with distance from the galactic center, but that's a different matter.

But the question is a hypothetical scenario where the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So we take it at face value.

So the number of stars N is proportional to d^5. So when d increases, N increases as the fifth power. So the number of stars per unit distance would be the derivative of N with respect to d. Wait, but the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Hmm, per unit range. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N with d is ΔN = 5d^4 Δd. So the number of stars per unit distance (d) would be proportional to d^4.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential. The number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+Δd is N = k d^5. So the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the density of stars (number per parsec) increases with d^4. So the rate of change is proportional to d^4.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So maybe we're considering the number of stars in a certain shell thickness. So if you have a region at distance r, then the number of stars in a thin shell at r would be proportional to r^5 multiplied by the solid angle, but the question seems to be about a specific region of the sky, so solid angle is fixed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this again. The given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So N increases as d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., dN/dr).

So, if N = k d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the change in the number of stars with distance is proportional to d^4.

Wait, but the answer options are in terms of r^something. So the rate of change (per unit distance) would be proportional to r^4.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

So option C is r^4. So that would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the differential number of stars. If N(r) is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell dr at radius r is N = (dN/dr) dr = 5k r^4 dr. So, the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is proportional to r^4.

Hence, the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range) as r^4. So the answer is option C.

The question states that the number of stars \( N \) in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) as \( \text{plx} = 1/d \), substituting this relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \). If \( N = k d^5 \), then \( dN/dd = 5k d^4 \). This shows that the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( d^4 \). 

Thus, the number of stars in the region changes with distance per unit range as \( r^4 \). Among the given options:

- **A) \( r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is not cubic.  
- **B) \( r^5 \):** Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars, not the rate of change.  
- **C) \( r^4 \):** Correct, as the rate of change of the number of stars with distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).  
- **D) \( r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is not quadratic.

The correct answer is **C**, \( r^4 \).
