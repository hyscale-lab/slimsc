Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let's look at the target molecule. The substituents are ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. Wait, benzene rings are numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, but wait, does that make the numbering correct? Because 1 is adjacent to 2 and 3. Alternatively, maybe it's better to draw the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions in a certain arrangement.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, benzene ring with substituents in the 1, 2, 3 positions. Let me try to imagine that. So, numbering the ring, substituents at positions 1, 2, 3 in a clockwise or anti-clockwise manner.

Now, how do I build this from benzene? The steps likely involve multiple substitution reactions, but considering that benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution, and each substitution can direct the next.

Let me think about the directing effects. Nitro groups are strong meta directors, ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a bulky group, but since it's an alkyl group, it's an activating, ortho/para director. Wait, but tert-butyl is a bulky group—so perhaps when adding substituents, steric factors might play a role in where they add.

Wait, but in Friedel-Crafts, bulky groups can lead to para preference because of steric hindrance. So, for example, when you have a bulky group like tert-butyl attached to benzene, the next substitution is more likely to be para to it, but I'm not entirely sure.

Now, the target has three substituents. So, the order in which they're added matters because each step affects where the next substituent can go.

Let's think about the substituents in the target:

1. Ethoxy (OEt) is at position 1.
2. tert-Butyl is at position 2.
3. Nitro is at position 3.

Wait, but in my mind, if I start adding substituents, each will direct the next. So, perhaps the order of addition needs to be such that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

Alternatively, maybe it's possible to introduce the substituents in a certain order that allows each to direct correctly.

Let me think about each substituent's directing effect.

Ethoxy is an activating group, so it's an ortho/para director. Nitro is a deactivating, meta director. tert-Butyl is a bulky activating group, so it's ortho/para, but more likely para because of bulk.

Wait, but the target has the nitro group at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl) and position 4. Hmm, perhaps the nitro group is meta relative to the ethoxy.

Wait, maybe I should think about the order of adding substituents. Let's consider the steps:

First, adding the tert-butyl group. Then, the ethoxy. Then, the nitro group. Or maybe another order.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so it would deactivate the ring, making subsequent substitutions harder. So, perhaps it's better to add nitro last, when the ring is already substituted with activating groups, but that might not be possible because nitro is meta, and if added early, it would affect the positions where other groups are added.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added as the first substituent. But nitro is a meta director, so adding it first may lead the next substituent to add in meta positions relative to it, but that doesn't seem to fit the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first. Let's see. If I add ethoxy (OEt) as the first substituent, then the next substitution would be ortho or para to it.

Wait, but the target has both ethoxy and tert-butyl adjacent (positions 1 and 2). So, after adding ethoxy, perhaps I add tert-butyl in the ortho position.

But let's think about how to add substituents in the correct positions. Let's consider the steps required:

1. Adding ethoxy group: This would require a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps via a nitration and then reduction? Wait, no. Ethoxylation is typically done via an electrophilic substitution. So, perhaps using ethyl bromide with a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3, in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, ethyl groups can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts, but in practice, it's often difficult because ethyl is a primary alkyl halide and tends to undergo carbocation rearrangements. Alternatively, sometimes people use tosylates or other methods. Wait, but in the options, looking at the steps, I see "NaOH/EtBr" which is a typical condition for an SN2 substitution, but that would be for alkanethiols, but maybe that's a different case.

Wait, no, perhaps ethoxy can be introduced via an ether formation. Oh, wait, wait a second. Another way to introduce an ethoxy group is via a nitration followed by some kind of displacement? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, benzene can undergo alkylation via Friedel-Crafts. So, benzene with AlCl3 and ethyl chloride. But wait, ethyl chloride would undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which would add an ethyl group. But we need an ethoxy group, which is an ether. So, maybe the first step is to introduce an ethyl group, and then convert it to ethoxy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via an etherification reaction. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after a nitration. For example, if I have a nitro group, which is a meta director. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me step back. Let me think about the target structure. The substituents are ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, perhaps the order of substituents is:

1. Add tert-butyl group.
2. Add ethoxy group.
3. Add nitro group.

But wait, adding nitro (a meta director) after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl—would that get the nitro in the correct spot? Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: nitro first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy.

Wait, if I add nitro to benzene first. Let's say step one is nitration. Nitro is a meta director. Then, add tert-butyl. Where would that go? tert-Butyl is an activating group, so it would go ortho or para to nitro. But nitro is deactivating, so it's meta directing. Wait, but the ring is activated by the tert-butyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. Once a nitro group is present, the ring is deactivated, so any subsequent substitution would be directed by the nitro group. So, after nitration, the next substitution would be meta to the nitro group.

So, if I add a tert-butyl group next, it would go meta to nitro, which would be position 3 if nitro is at position 1, for example. But how does that fit into the target structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, adding it last would prevent it from affecting the positions of the earlier substituents.

Wait, but the target has three substituents, so perhaps the steps are:

1. Add ethoxy group. (But how?)

Wait, perhaps the steps involve nitration, then alkylation, then another nitration? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the options provided and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options, each option is a series of reactions. Each starts with benzene and goes through several steps.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the options. Let me parse each step.

Wait, each option lists steps i to ix. Let's take option D, for example.

Option D steps:
i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
ii) Fe/HCl (maybe hydrolysis of some nitro group? Or maybe a reduction. Fe/HCl is acidic and can cause some reactions, perhaps reduction of a nitro group to amine, but under certain conditions.
iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation)
iv) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration)
v) NaNO2/HCl (nitrous acid, perhaps diazotization)
vi) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation)
vii) dilute H2SO4 (maybe acid workup)
viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat (maybe acid)
ix) NaOH/EtBr (SN2 displacement?)

Wait, this seems like a lot. Let me think about each step.

Wait, but I'm trying to figure out which option correctly builds the substituents in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the order in which substituents are added and the directing effects.

So, the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups at positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Let me imagine the benzene ring:

Positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a row.

So, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3.

Now, the order of addition could be:

First add ethoxy, which is activating, then tert-butyl, which is also activating, but then how do you add nitro in the correct position?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first. Let's see.

If I first nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene (nitro at position 1). Then, perhaps add tert-butyl. Since nitro is a meta director, the next substituent (tert-butyl) would go meta to nitro, which would be position 4. But in the target, tert-butyl is at position 2. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, the tert-butyl is added in a different position. Wait, but once nitro is present, the next substitution would be directed by the nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add tert-butyl first. Because tert-butyl is a bulky group, when adding the next substituent, it would prefer para.

Wait, let's think: benzene first undergoes alkylation with tert-butyl chloride in presence of AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts). The product is tert-butylbenzene. Now, the next substituent would be directed by the tert-butyl group.

tert-butyl is an activating group, so substituents would add ortho or para to it. But because tert-butyl is bulky, the para position is more favored.

So, adding ethoxy next: perhaps via another Friedel-Crafts, but wait, ethoxy is an ether, not an alkyl. Alternatively, perhaps using a different method to introduce the ethoxy group.

Wait, another approach: Friedel-Crafts isn't suitable for introducing ethers, as that's typically done via nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but benzene isn't nucleophilic enough for that. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution on a nitro group, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after forming a nitro group. For example, if you have a nitro group and a leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson-type synthesis, but that's typically for forming ethers from alcohols and alkyl halides, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced through an SN2 displacement after forming a good leaving group. Wait, perhaps if the benzene ring has a nitro group, which can be converted into a good leaving group, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires strong activating groups, which nitro is not.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but using an ethyl group, and then converting the ethyl group to ethoxy. But how?

Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation would add an ethyl group to the benzene ring. Then, perhaps under certain conditions, the ethyl group is oxidized to a ketone, but that doesn't help with getting an ethoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether formation using benzene bromide and an alkoxide. Wait, no, that's not the right approach.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the steps in the options and see which makes sense.

Looking back at the target structure: positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Wait, perhaps the order is:

Add tert-butyl first. Then, add nitro. Then, add ethoxy. Or another order.

Wait, when tert-butyl is added first, the next substituent (say, nitro) would go meta to it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the substituents in the order they are added. Let's take option D. Step i is nitration, so first substituent is nitro. Then step iii is adding tert-butyl. So, after nitration, adding tert-butyl would be directed by the nitro group, which is meta. So, the tert-butyl would go meta to nitro. Then, step iv is another nitration. But wait, the target only has one nitro group, so option D's step iv would add another nitro, which is not desired.

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me look for another option.

Option B: Steps are i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) HNO3; iii) Fe/HCl; iv) HNO3; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) H3O+/H2O; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) SO3; ix) H2SO4.

Wait, let me parse this.

Step i: add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts, so benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

Step ii: nitration. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, the nitration would occur ortho or para. But the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to tert-butyl (position 2). So, nitro would be at position 3, which is meta to tert-butyl? No, because tert-butyl is at position 2, and nitro is at 3, which is adjacent. Wait, no, if tert-butyl is at position 2, then nitro at 3 would be ortho to it. Because in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 3 are adjacent.

Wait, but tert-butyl is an activating group, so nitro would go ortho or para. If the tert-butyl is at position 2, then the nitro can go at position 1 (para) or 3 (ortho). So, after step ii (nitration), we have tert-butyl at position 2 and nitro at position 3.

Wait, but then the target has nitro at position 3, which matches. So, after step ii, we have positions 2 (tert-butyl) and 3 (nitro).

Now, step iii is Fe/HCl. Fe in HCl can be a catalyst for reduction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is used in the hydrolysis of nitro groups to amines, but that's under acidic conditions. Wait, maybe it's a reduction. Oh, wait, Fe in HCl (like in HCl with Fe) is sometimes used to reduce nitro groups to amines. But in this case, step iii is after nitration. So, maybe step iii is a hydrolysis, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe step iii is a work-up step. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps step iii is something else.

Wait, perhaps step iii is a reduction of nitro group to amine? But if we have nitro at position 3, reducing it would give an amine group at 3. But the target requires nitro at 3, so maybe this isn't right.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. After step ii (nitration), we have a nitro group at position 3. Then, step iii is Fe/HCl, which perhaps is for something else, like demethylation or another substitution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me proceed.

After step iii, step iv is another nitration. But the target only has one nitro group, so adding another nitro would not fit. So perhaps option B is not the correct one.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation (adds a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong meta director.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has a tert-butyl group and a sulfonic acid group. The sulfonic acid is a strong meta director. So, where would the nitro group go?

Wait, the tert-butyl is an activating group, ortho/para director. The sulfonic acid is deactivating, meta. So, the nitration would be influenced by the strongest director. Sulfonic acid is stronger (deactivating), so the nitration would be directed meta to it. But I'm not sure how that would fit into the target structure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the target structure again. We have ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but benzene isn't nucleophilic enough. Another thought: perhaps introducing the ethoxy group as an electrophilic substitution using an ether.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after activating the ring. Alternatively, maybe via a Grignard reagent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nitration followed by a substitution. Wait, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkylation followed by a substitution. For example, Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an ethyl group, then a substitution reaction converts it to ethoxy.

But for that, the ethyl group would have to be activated as a leaving group. For example, via a nitration of the ethyl group. Wait, perhaps converting the ethyl group to a nitro group and then displacing it with an oxygen nucleophile. But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. If the ring has a strong activating group, like an amino group, then a nitro group can be converted to a leaving group. But this is getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps in each option and see which leads to the correct substituents.

Let me look at option D:

i) Nitration → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl to the ring, but where?

After nitration, the ring has a nitro group, which is a deactivating, meta director. So, if I reduce nitro to amine (which is a strong activating, ortho/para director), then add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. The amine group would direct the tert-butyl to ortho or para.

Wait, let me go through this step by step.

Step i: Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine, so phenylamine.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl chloride → since phenylamine is a strong activating group, the tert-butyl would add ortho or para to it.

So, if phenylamine is at position 1, then tert-butyl would add at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Wait, but the target has tert-butyl at position 2 and ethoxy at 1. So, if phenylamine is at position 1, and tert-butyl is added at position 2, then that matches.

So, after step iii, we have substituents at 1 (amino) and 2 (tert-butyl).

Then, step iv: nitration. Now, the ring has amino (strong activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). So, the next nitration would be directed by the amino group.

But wait, the target has a nitro group at position 3. So, if the amino is at 1, and tert-butyl at 2, then the next nitration would be at position 3 (ortho to amino, which is at 1), but that's adjacent to tert-butyl at 2. Is that possible?

Alternatively, the amino group is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2. The nitration would be at position 3 (ortho to amino), which would be adjacent to the tert-butyl. So, that's a possibility.

But then, after nitration, the structure would have amino at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. But the amino group is activating, so nitration occurs.

But then, in the target, we have ethoxy at 1, not amino. So, perhaps after nitration, the amino group is converted into something else.

Looking at step v in option D: NaNO2/HCl → this is typical for diazotization. So, if we have an amino group, treating with NaNO2 and HCl (dilute) at low temp would form a diazonium salt.

Then, step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. But I'm not sure how that plays in.

Alternatively, perhaps the diazonium salt undergoes a substitution reaction. For example, under certain conditions, it can be replaced by another group.

Wait, if step vi is sulfonation, that would add a sulfonic acid group, which is a strong deactivating group. But that's not helpful for the target structure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps after the diazonium salt is formed, it's treated with something else. For example, heating with H2O would lead to hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to a phenol.

Wait, but in the options, for option D:

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonating.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → maybe acid workup.

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → perhaps hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps an SN2 displacement.

Wait, maybe after forming the diazonium salt, when treated with SO3, perhaps some kind of substitution occurs. But I'm not familiar with that exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a way to introduce the ethoxy group. Let me think: if the amino group is converted to a diazonium salt, and then treated with ethanol, it would substitute with an ethoxy group. For example, diazonium salt + ethanol → replacement of amino with ethoxy.

But in option D, step vi is sulfonation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm not looking at this correctly. Let me think about each step.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro group at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to amino).

iv) Nitration → nitro group at position 3 (ortho to amino group, which is at 1).

v) NaNO2/HCl → forms diazonium salt at position 1.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonates the benzene ring. Hmm, where would the sulfonic acid group go? The ring now has substituents at 1 (diazonium, which is about to undergo substitution), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

Wait, sulfonation would add a sulfonic acid group. But the ring is already substituted, so the sulfonic acid would go where? The strongest director would be the nitro group at 3, which is a meta director. So, sulfonic acid would add at position 6 (meta to nitro at 3), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonating agent is adding under the influence of the tert-butyl group and nitro group. Hmm.

After that, step vii is dilute H2SO4. Maybe it's a workup.

Step viii: H3O+ and H2O/Heat → hydrolysis? If the diazonium salt (from step v) is subjected to heat and acid, perhaps it decomposes. Diazonium salts in H+ and heat typically undergo hydrolysis to form phenol.

So, after step viii, the amino group (position 1) would become a hydroxyl group (phenol).

But the target has an ethoxy group at position 1, not a hydroxyl. So, perhaps in step ix, which is NaOH and EtBr, it's an SN2 displacement of the hydroxyl group with ethyl bromide.

So, let's put it all together.

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to amino at 1.

Step iii: add tert-butyl at 2.

Step iv: nitrate to add nitro at 3.

Step v: form diazonium salt at 1.

Step vi: sulfonate. Hmm, but I'm not sure where.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try a different approach. Let's map the substituents after each step.

After step i: benzene → nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce nitro (1) to amino (1).

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → tert-butyl adds at 2 (ortho to amino).

So, after step iii: substituents at 1 (NH2) and 2 (tert-butyl).

Step iv: nitration → nitro at 3 (ortho to amino at 1).

So, substituents at 1 (NH2), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (NO2).

Step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazonium at 1.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Where? The ring has substituents at 1 (diazonium), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (NO2).

The nitro group is a strong meta director. SO3 adds where? The most activated position would be para to the nitro, which is position 6. But that's not in the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the amino group (now diazonium) is a good leaving group, and sulfonating would occur where? Maybe it's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonating step is to activate a position for substitution, but I'm not certain.

Then, step vii: dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis of the diazonium group. Diazonium salt in H+ and heat would decompose to form a phenol. So, substituent at 1 becomes OH.

After step vii: substituents at 1 (OH), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (NO2).

Step viii: H3O+ and H2O/Heat → maybe the same as step vii.

Wait, perhaps step viii is the same as vii, but I'm not sure.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → this is a typical condition for an SN2 reaction. So, the OH group at 1 would react with EtBr in NaOH to form OEt (ethoxy) via an SN2 mechanism.

So, after step ix: substituents at 1 (OEt), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (NO2). Which matches the target.

So, option D's sequence leads to the desired product.

Wait, but let me check if all steps in option D make sense.

Option D steps:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro (1) to amino.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → adds tert-butyl at 2.

iv) Nitration → adds nitro at 3.

v) Diazotization → forms diazonium at 1.

vi) Sulfonation → adds sulfonic acid? But in our analysis, we thought this would be at position 6, which doesn't fit the target. So, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, because after step v, we have a diazonium at 1, which is a good leaving group. So, when we sulfonate, the sulfonic acid would add where? Since the ring has a diazonium (good leaving group) at 1, and tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

The nitro group is a strong meta director. So, the sulfonating agent would add in a position meta to nitro. Nitro is at 3; meta would be position 6. But I'm not sure if the sulfonating step is necessary.

Wait, perhaps the sulfonating step is not part of the target structure, which would mean that this option isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate is removed later.

Hmm, but the target doesn't have a sulfonate group. So, this would be a problem. So, perhaps option D is incorrect.

Wait, but in the analysis, after step vii, the substituent at 1 is OH, and step viii is H3O+ and heat, which might not change anything. Then step ix is SN2 with EtBr to get OEt.

So, perhaps the sulfonate is a red herring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate is part of the process, but it doesn't end up in the target molecule. Maybe it's a protection step or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is removed in a later step. But looking at the options, there's no desulfonation step. So, if the target doesn't have a sulfonate, then option D is incorrect.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think of another approach.

Another way to look at this is to consider the positions where each substituent is added based on the directing effects of the existing substituents.

The target molecule has substituents in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

So, the order of addition should allow each substituent to be added in the correct position relative to the others.

Let me think about adding substituents in the order: tert-butyl first, then ethoxy ortho to it, then nitro meta to ethoxy.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So, if ethoxy is added ortho to tert-butyl, and then nitro is added meta to ethoxy, perhaps it would end up in the correct position.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl → position 2.

2. Add ethoxy → position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl).

3. Add nitro → position 3 (meta to ethoxy, which is at 1).

But how would the nitro end up at position 3?

Wait, ethoxy is an ortho/para director. So, after adding ethoxy to position 1, the next substitution (nitro) would be directed ortho/para to ethoxy. But the target has nitro at 3, which is meta to ethoxy (since ethoxy is at 1, positions 2 and 4 are ortho and para, and 3 is meta).

So, that doesn't fit. So, perhaps that order is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy → position 1.

2. Add tert-butyl → position 2 (ortho to ethoxy, since ethoxy is ortho/para director.

3. Add nitro → position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. But wait, ethoxy is an activating group, so the nitro would be para or ortho to ethoxy. But the target has nitro at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy.

So, that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Then, the other substituents are added in positions directed by the nitro.

Wait, let's say first nitration occurs, adding nitro at position 1.

Next, add tert-butyl. Nitro is a meta director, so tert-butyl would go to position 4 (meta to nitro at 1). But target has tert-butyl at 2, which is ortho to nitro (position 1). So, that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me go back to the options.

Looking at option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate. Now, since tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director, the nitro would go at ortho or para to it. Let's say position 3 is ortho to tert-butyl at 2.

So, after step ii, substituents at 2 (tert-butyl) and 3 (nitro).

Step iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Sulfonic acid is a strong meta director.

Then step iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

Step v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

Step vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → more hydrolysis.

Step vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Step viii) Fe/HCl → ?

Step ix) HNO3 → nitrate again.

This seems complicated, and I'm not sure if it leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is the right one.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate. Now, tert-butyl and sulfonic acid groups.

tert-butyl is activating, SO3 is deactivating. So, next substitution would be directed by SO3, which is meta.

Step iii) HNO3 → nitrate. So, nitro would go meta to SO3. Let's say SO3 is at position 4, then nitro would go to position 1 or 7 (but benzene is a ring, so position 1 is adjacent to position 2).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me imagine the substituents.

tert-butyl at 2, SO3 at 4. Then, nitro would be meta to SO3, which is positions 1 or 7. Since benzene is a ring, position 7 is position 1.

So, nitro at position 1.

But the target has nitro at 3, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps option C is not the correct one.

Let me think about option B.

Option B steps:

i) tert-butyl chloride → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate. Nitro would go ortho (3) or para (4) to tert-butyl.

Assuming it's at 3.

So, substituents at 2 (tert-butyl) and 3 (nitro).

Step iii: Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

Step iv: HNO3 → nitrate again. But the target has only one nitro group, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Looking back, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the ethoxy group last via a substitution after forming a good leaving group, such as a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitro group at 1.

2. Add tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts → but wait, nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work. So, this step is not possible.

Hmm, that's a problem. Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. So, if I have a nitro group (deactivating), I can't do Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl. So, that pathway is blocked.

So, the only way to add tert-butyl is before adding any deactivating groups.

So, tert-butyl must be added before nitro.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy after nitro? Because nitro is deactivating, making substitution difficult. Unless we have a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution of a nitro group. For example, if we have a nitro group, which can be converted into a nitroso, then into an amine, then into a good leaving group like a tosylate, and then substituted with ethoxide.

But that seems complicated, and I don't see such steps in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via another method, like using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic alkylation after activating the ring with another group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the options.

Looking back, option D's steps:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduction → amine at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl at 2.

iv) Nitration → nitro at 3.

v) Diazotization → form diazonium at 1.

vi) Sulfonation → sulfonic acid added somewhere.

vii) Dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis to phenol.

viii) Acid and heat → same as before.

ix) NaOH and EtBr → substitute phenol with ethoxy.

But wait, after step ix, the substituents are:

1 (OEt), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (NO2), and possibly a sulfonic acid group from step vi.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so option D can't be the right answer.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the sulfonate group is removed. But I don't see any steps in option D that remove the sulfonate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the sulfonate is added. Maybe the sulfonate is added elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate is part of the process but doesn't end up in the final product.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the correct order of steps.

Since tert-butyl must be added before any deactivating groups (like nitro), because Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups.

So, steps should be:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro (now, nitro is meta to tert-butyl).

3. Add ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy after nitro?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added before the nitro group.

Wait, let's think: first add ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts, but that's tricky because ethoxy is an ether, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, not an ether.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution on a nitro group, but I don't think that's feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Grignard reaction, but that's not applicable here.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the correct answer based on the options.

Option D's steps:

After adding the nitro groups and the tert-butyl, the final substitution is replacing the amino group with ethoxy.

If the amino group is at position 1, and after substitution becomes OEt, then the substituents are OEt (1), tert-butyl (2), and nitro (3). Which matches the target.

But the issue is the sulfonate group added in step vi. Unless the sulfonate is somehow removed, but that's not in the steps.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount option D's steps.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine at 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts with t-butyl chloride → add t-butyl at 2.

iv) Nitration → nitro at 3.

v) Diazotization → form diazonium at 1.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonating; perhaps adds a sulfonic acid group.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis to phenol.

viii) H3O+ and H2O/Heat → same as vii.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitute OH to OEt.

So, after step ix, the substituents are OEt (1), t-butyl (2), nitro (3), and sulfonic acid somewhere.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So, this suggests that option D is incorrect.

Hmm. Maybe the sulfonate is a by-product or somehow eliminated. But I don't see any desulfonation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate is added to a position that's not part of the target, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm incorrect in assuming where the sulfonate is added. Maybe the sulfonate is added in position 6, but that's not part of the target.

This is getting too complicated. Let me think about which option correctly places the substituents.

Looking at the other options, option D's final steps result in the correct substituents except for the sulfonate group. But perhaps the sulfonate is a red herring, and the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps the sulfonate is added and then removed. But there's no step for that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the sulfonate group is part of the synthesis but not present in the final product.

Wait, perhaps the sulfonate is added but then removed in a later step. But looking at the steps, I don't see that. So, perhaps option D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonate group. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is not added. Let me re-examine option D's step vi.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4. That's sulfonation. So, to sulfonate the aromatic ring. But where?

After step v, we have substituents at 1 (diazonium), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Now, when we sulfonate, the ring has a strong deactivating group (nitro) at 3, which is a meta director. So, where would the sulfonic acid group add?

Nitro at 3 directs meta, which would be position 6. So, sulfonic acid at 6.

But that's not part of the target.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate is added elsewhere. Let me think, the amino group (now diazonium) is a good leaving group, but I don't think that affects the sulfonate addition.

Wait, perhaps the sulfonate is added para to the nitro group. Nitro is at 3, so para would be position 6 again.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed to the conclusion based on the initial analysis.

After step ix in option D, the substituents are OEt (1), t-butyl (2), nitro (3), and sulfonic acid (6). But the target doesn't have the sulfonic acid. So, option D can't be the correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D, ignoring the sulfonate group, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the sulfonate is somehow removed during the steps, but it's not indicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the feasibility of each step. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. The order of addition of these substituents is critical because each substituent influences the positions of subsequent substitutions.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: tert-butyl chloride with AlCl₃ adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, but the directing effects of tert-butyl and subsequent steps do not align with the target structure.
3. **Step iii**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
4. The sequence does not lead to the correct positions of the substituents in the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: tert-butyl chloride with AlCl₃ adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group. However, the nitro group would be directed to positions inconsistent with the target structure.
3. **Step iii**: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine, which is not part of the target molecule.
4. **Step iv**: A second nitration step is unnecessary, as the target molecule has only one nitro group.
5. This sequence does not lead to the correct product.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: tert-butyl chloride with AlCl₃ adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, but the directing effects of the sulfonic acid group would place the nitro group in an incorrect position.
4. The sequence does not align with the target structure.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group at position 1.
2. **Step ii**: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine at position 1.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds the tert-butyl group at position 2 (ortho to the amine).
4. **Step iv**: Nitration adds a nitro group at position 3 (meta to the amine).
5. **Step v**: NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt at position 1.
6. **Step vi**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
7. **Step vii**: Dilute H₂SO₄ hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol at position 1.
8. **Step viii**: H₃O⁺ and heat do not alter the structure significantly.
9. **Step ix**: NaOH and EtBr replace the phenol with an ethoxy group at position 1 via an SN2 reaction.

After step ix, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), matching the target molecule. However, the sulfonic acid group introduced in step vi is not part of the target molecule, which raises questions about its role in the sequence. Despite this, the overall sequence correctly positions the substituents in the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
Option D provides the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize the target molecule, despite the inclusion of a sulfonic acid group that is not part of the final product. This discrepancy may be due to an oversight in the problem setup or an additional step not explicitly mentioned.
