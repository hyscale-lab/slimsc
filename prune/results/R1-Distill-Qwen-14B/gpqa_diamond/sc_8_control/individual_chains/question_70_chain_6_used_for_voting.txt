Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and think step by step.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving several substances, and the question is about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Alright, let's break down the reactions. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. So, 8 equivalents suggest a 1:8 molar ratio. Hmm, bright red product... that makes me think of something like a transition metal compound. Maybe a sulfide or oxide? Wait, sometimes solid A could be a metal and B could be a halogen or something else.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C plus D gives E. E is dangerous, perhaps a toxic gas or something like that.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, when C is in water, it breaks down into A and two acids. Since F is strong and G is weak, maybe F is like H2SO4 (sulfuric) and G like HNO2 (nitrous) or something else. But I'm not sure yet.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D and B combine in 1:1 to make H, a solvent. Common solvents... maybe something like H2O (but D and B would be O and something else?), or maybe an alcohol like ethanol (but that would require B to be something else). Alternatively, maybe H is something like HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Wait, D and B reacting in 1:1... D is a gas, same as B. So perhaps B is Cl2 and D is something else. Or maybe B is O2 and D is O3? Not sure yet.

Let me try to figure out what each substance could be.

Starting with C reacting with water to produce A, F, and G. If F is a strong acid, maybe sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and G is a weak acid, perhaps nitrous acid (HNO2) or something like acetic acid (but that's more organic). Alternatively, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, when a solid reacts with a gas to form a bright red product, I think of copper reacting with sulfur to form Cu2S, which is black, not red. Wait, maybe iron(III) oxide is reddish, but that's solid. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide. Oh, wait, maybe A is FeS, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, B is Cl2, and C is a chloride. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: bright red products in reactions could be related to sulfur. Like, perhaps A is elemental sulfur, but that's a solid. Or maybe a compound like CuO is black, not red. Wait, maybe A is a metal, B is Cl2, and C is the metal chloride. Not sure.

Alternatively, the bright red product C could be lead dioxide, PbO2, which is dark brown, not red. Hmm. Maybe it's something else. Let's think about the third reaction, where C with water gives A, F, and G. So it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Suppose C is a salt that breaks down in water into the metal hydroxide (which is A) and two acids. Let me think of a metal that when its salt is hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For example, maybe a metal that forms a sulfate and a nitrate? Or maybe a sulfite and something else.

Wait, another angle: product E is extremely hazardous. What reactions produce dangerous substances? Maybe E is a gas like phosgene (but that's more from carbonyl chlorides), or something like sarin gas, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, E could be a highly toxic metal cyanide, but I'm not sure.

Wait, think about the second reaction: C reacts with D (a gas) in 2 equivalents. So, perhaps C is a chloride, and D is Cl2? No, because then B would be Cl2 and D would be Cl2, but they reacted to form H as a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the fourth reaction: D and B combine in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Solvents are often simple molecules. Common examples include H2O (water), ethanol, methanol, etc. But D and B are both gases. So possible reactions for gases combining to form a solvent.

If H is H2O, then D and B would have to combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O. So, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2? But O2 is a diatomic gas. So 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2. Then 2 O2 + 4 H2 → 4 H2O? No, that doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio.

Wait, maybe H is something else. Like, if B is Cl2 (gas) and D is something else that combines in 1:1. Wait, looking for a diatomic gas reacting with another diatomic gas in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. For example, Cl2 and O2 don't form anything, but maybe HCl and H2O? No, that's not right.

Wait, another idea: what about H being NH3? But NH3 is a gas at standard conditions, but it can be a solvent. Wait, but how would B and D react to form NH3? Maybe if B is N2 and D is H2, but they'd need to combine under certain conditions, like in the Haber process: N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. That's a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the possible structures of E. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Symmetry groups are associated with the shapes of molecules. For example:

- C2: a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis, like H2O2 (but H2O2 has C2 symmetry).
- D4h: a molecule with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirrors, like methane doesn't, but something like octahedral structures. Wait, no, methane is Td. Maybe something like a square planar molecule with a center of inversion? Or a molecule with a four-fold axis and mirror planes.
- D∞h: this is the symmetry of a linear molecule with a center of inversion and two-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the main axis. So like CO2 or H2O (but H2O isn't linear). Wait, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. So if E is a linear molecule, its symmetry group would be D∞h.
- C2v: a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. For example, H2O has C2v symmetry because it's bent with a C2 axis and two planes of symmetry.

So the possible options for E's symmetry are one of these.

Now, what is E? Let's think about the reactions again.

In the second reaction, C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. So, what are some extremely hazardous compounds? Maybe something like phosgene (COCl2), chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), or something like sarin gas. But let's see.

Wait, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. Its structure is linear, so its symmetry group would be D∞h. Alternatively, if E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent, then its symmetry group would be C2v.

Alternatively, maybe E is ClF3. ClF3 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule, similar to NH3. Its symmetry group is C3v, which isn't one of the options here. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a highly toxic gas like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which is linear. HCN is linear, so its symmetry group would be D∞h. That fits option C.

But wait, how do the reactions lead to HCN?

Let me backtrack. Let's try to figure out what each chemical is.

Suppose reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). Suppose D is F2 and B is H2O? No, F2 is a gas, but H2O is a liquid. Maybe D is H2O and B is F2? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's say that H is a common solvent. Water is a solvent, but in reaction 4, B and D are gases that react to form H. So, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2, but as I thought earlier, their reaction would need the right conditions, but the ratio is 2:1 for H2O production, which doesn't fit 1:1.

Wait, another possibility: B is Cl2 and D is something else. For example, D could be H2. Then, Cl2 + H2 → 2 HCl. So, 1:1 ratio. HCl is a gas, but not a solvent. But maybe under certain conditions, it's a solvent? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: product C when reacted with water gives A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak. Let's suppose that C is a sulfite salt. For example, if C is (NH4)2SO3, then upon hydrolysis, it would produce NH4OH (which is weak, but NH3 is weak base; maybe not), but perhaps it's more like a metal sulfite. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitrate.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate. No, when nitrates hydrolyze, they can produce NO3^- which is not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If C is a metal chloride, then reacting with water might produce HCl (a strong acid) and the metal hydroxide. But the problem states that F and G are two different acids. So, if C is a salt of two different acids, e.g., a salt where the anion is a conjugate base of a weak acid and a strong acid.

Wait, for example, suppose C is NaHSO4. Then, it would dissociate into Na+ + HSO4^-. But when it reacts with water, it would produce H+ (from HSO4^-) and NaOH. Wait, but that would give a strong acid (H2SO4, if HSO4^- acts as an acid) and a base (NaOH). But F and G are acids, so maybe a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like NH4NO3. When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into NH4OH (a weak acid) and HNO3 (a strong acid). So, in that case, F would be HNO3 (strong), G would be NH4OH (weak). But then, what is A? Because in the third reaction, C reacts with water to reform A plus F and G. So if C is NH4NO3, adding water would produce NH4OH and HNO3, but what is A? Maybe A is NH4NO3 itself, but that doesn't make sense because the reaction is reforming A.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't really do much unless there's an acid. But in this case, C is reacting with water to produce A, F, and G. So perhaps C is a metal bicarbonate. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, perhaps C is a double salt. Like NaHSO4, which when dissolved in water gives H+ (from HSO4^-), Na+ (which forms NaOH?), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, like FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it doesn't do much, but when it reacts with acid, it produces H2S. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, let's think about E. If E is HCN (hydrogen cyanide), which is a linear molecule, then its symmetry group is D∞h (option C). How would we get E from C and D?

So, if E is HCN, then C + 2 D → HCN.

But where does HCN come from? Let's think about the possible reactions.

HCN can be produced by the reaction of cyanide salts with strong acids. For example, KCN + H2SO4 → KHSO4 + HCN. But in this case, D would be the acid. So, if D is H2SO4 (a strong acid, gas?), wait, H2SO4 is a liquid under standard conditions, not a gas. So maybe D is another strong acid like HCl.

Wait, D is a gas. So, if D is HCl, and C is something that reacts with HCl to produce HCN. But that seems a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a product of C reacting with D, which is a halogen. For example, if D is Cl2, and C is a compound containing C≡N (nitrile group), then adding Cl2 might do something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider another possibility. Suppose E is a molecule with D∞h symmetry, like CO2 or HCN. Let's focus on E being CO2. CO2 is linear, so symmetry group D∞h.

But how would we get CO2 from the reactions? Let's see.

If C reacts with D (gas) in 2 equivalents to form CO2. So, what reaction produces CO2? Maybe combustion? But C would need to be a carbon-containing compound.

Wait, if C is carbon (solid), but then reaction with 8 equivalents of gas B would form CO2? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. But I'm not making progress on this front.

Wait, going back to the first reaction: solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. What solid reacting with a gas in such a high ratio?

Wait, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, sodium (Na) reacts with chlorine (Cl2) in a 1:1 ratio (2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl). But that's 1:1, not 8:1. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2. If A is Fe, then Fe + O2 → FeO (but FeO is not bright red). Alternatively, Fe reacts with sulfur (S8) to form FeS (black) or FeS2 (also not red). Hmm.

Wait, bright red product... could it be something like a permanganate? No, those are usually purple or dark. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a nitrate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound like mercury(I) chloride, which is a bright red solid. Wait, mercury(I) chloride is red. So, if A is Hg, and B is Cl2, then Hg + Cl2 → HgCl2 (red). But the stoichiometry would be 2 Hg + Cl2 → 2 HgCl. Wait, no, 2 Hg + Cl2 → 2 HgCl2? So, 1 mole Cl2 reacts with 2 moles Hg. But the question says 8 equivalents, so 1 mole A to 8 moles B. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms an 8:1 ratio with B. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps B is a diatomic gas, say Cl2, and A is Fe. Then, Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So, 2:3 ratio. But the question states 8 equivalents, which would be a 1:4 ratio, since 8 is 8 times the amount of B per A.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should focus on the symmetry group options. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule, it's D∞h. If it's a bent molecule, it's C2v. If it's a molecule with a two-fold axis and a mirror plane, it's C2 or C2v.

Wait, let's think about another molecule. Ozone (O3) is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. So, if E is O3, then its symmetry group would be C2v (option D). How would we get O3 from C and D?

But O3 is formed from O2 via photolysis, but I'm not sure how that would fit into the given reactions.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a planar molecule with D∞h symmetry, but that's if it's linear. Wait, no, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is linear, so D∞h.

But how would that fit into the reactions? Let's think: C + 2 D → COCl2. So, if D is Cl2, then C would have to have an O and maybe another Cl. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like ClF3, which has a trigonal pyramidal structure, but that wouldn't fit any of the given symmetry groups.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible products for each reaction.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red).

Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous).

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

Reaction 4: B (gas) + D (gas, 1:1) → H (solvent).

So, H is a solvent formed from B and D in 1:1 ratio.

Looking at reaction 4, possible solvents from gases combining in 1:1.

Another thought: Maybe B is O2 and D is H2. They react to form H2O (solvent). But the stoichiometry is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So, 2:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is F2 and D is H2O? No, H2O is liquid. Or B is H2O and D is F2, but they don't react to form a solvent.

Wait, another idea: B is NH3 (a gas) and D is HCl (a gas). They react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, B is CO2 and D is H2O? No, but they don't react in 1:1 to form a solvent.

Alternatively, B is H2O and D is another gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps H is something like ethanol. But how would that be formed from B and D?

Wait, another angle: Maybe H is H2O. Then, B and D would have to combine to form H2O in a 1:1 ratio. So, for example, B is H2 and D is O2, but as I thought earlier, that's 2:1. Alternatively, B is O3 and D is H2O? No, O3 is a gas, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2O. That doesn't make sense because H2O is a liquid.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about E again. If E's symmetry group is D4h, it would have a four-fold axis. So, maybe E is a tetrahedral molecule, but that's usually Td symmetry. Alternatively, maybe a square planar molecule.

Wait, another possibility: E is a molecule like SO3, which is trigonal pyramidal (but I think it's planar). Wait, SO3 is a trigonal planar molecule with D3h symmetry. Not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, E could be a molecule like ClO3^- or something else, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a linear molecule like CO (carbonyl), which has D∞h symmetry. CO is a gas, but is it extremely hazardous? Well, it's toxic, yes. So if E is CO, then D∞h is the symmetry group (option C).

How would we get CO from C and D?

If C is a carbonate and D is something like carbon monoxide, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide, and D is a reducing agent. For example, if C is FeO and D is carbon, but then the reaction would produce Fe and CO. But D is a gas, so perhaps D is CO gas? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. When C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. So, this suggests that C is a salt that, when dissolved, provides two different anions which are the conjugate bases of strong and weak acids. For example, suppose C is a sulfite salt. When it hydrolyzes, it produces H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and another strong acid. Wait, but that's not quite fitting.

Alternatively, suppose C is a nitrate salt. For example, sodium nitrate. When it dissolves in water, it produces Na+ and NO3^- which doesn't directly form an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfate salt, but that might not produce two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: C is a mixed salt, like sodium sulfato-nitrate. But I'm not familiar with such a compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. When C is a carbonate, say Na2CO3, it hydrolyzes in water to form 2 NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (a weak acid, but CO2 is a gas). But in the problem, F and G are acids, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a sulfonate salt. For example, if C is NaHSO4, then it would dissociate into Na+ and HSO4^- in water. HSO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+ to form SO4^2-). So, when NaHSO4 dissolves, it can produce H+ and SO4^2-, but in a solution, it's more like H+ (from HSO4^-) and NaOH? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. If C is something like NaNO2, then in water, it could hydrolyze to produce HNO2 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), but again, the problem says F and G are acids.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to approach it differently. Let's consider the possible E options.

If E is a highly dangerous gas with a linear structure, then D∞h symmetry is likely. So, possible E is HCN or CO.

Let's go back to the reactions.

Suppose E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. So, if E is COCl2, then what would C and D be?

COCl2 is produced by the reaction of CO with Cl2 in presence of a catalyst, perhaps. But the reaction would be CO + Cl2 → COCl2. So, that would require one equivalent of CO and one of Cl2, but the problem says 2 equivalents of D. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is COCl (which is phosgene?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: Suppose C is a chloride, and D is something else. Let me think about reaction 2: C + 2 D → E.

If E is O3 (ozone), which is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry, then that's option D. Ozone is a toxic gas, which fits the extremely hazardous description.

But how would O3 be formed? Ozone is formed by the photolysis of O2: 2 O2 → 2 O3. But that doesn't involve a reaction with C and D. Alternatively, perhaps C is O2, and D is O, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps C is OClO (chlorine dioxide), which is a bright red gas, but that's speculative.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the symmetry options.

If E is a linear molecule, its symmetry is D∞h (option C). The only linear molecules among the options are CO, HCN, etc. So, if E is such a molecule, the answer is C.

Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule like H2O or O3, the symmetry is C2v (option D).

But what reaction would produce O3? Probably not from the given setup.

Given that the problem involves E being produced from C and D in a 2:1 ratio, and considering the symmetry options, I'll tentatively think E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form a bright red product C. The high stoichiometric ratio (1:8) suggests A and B are likely a metal and a diatomic gas, respectively. The bright red color of C hints at a compound like mercury(I) chloride (HgCl₂) or a transition metal compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E is a toxic gas or highly reactive compound. Possible candidates include phosgene (COCl₂), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), or carbon monoxide (CO), all of which are linear molecules with D∞h symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to form a metal hydroxide (A) and two acids. For example, if C is NaHSO₄, it could hydrolyze to form H₂SO₄ (strong acid) and NH₄OH (weak acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: Gas B and gas D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Common solvents like water (H₂O) or ethanol suggest B and D could be H₂ and O₂, but their reaction (2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O) has a 2:1 ratio, which does not fit. Other possibilities include B as O₂ and D as H₂, but this remains unclear.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The molecular symmetry group of E depends on its structure. If E is a linear molecule like HCN or CO, it has D∞h symmetry. If E is bent, like O₃, it has C₂v symmetry. Considering the options and the likely identity of E as a highly hazardous gas, the most plausible candidate is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry.

Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.
