Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question talks about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. It's given that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c times S. Oh wait, c is h divided by 4π. And the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y.

Wait, wait. So first, I should probably write out the matrix A_y. Since A_y = c * S, let me compute that. The value of c is h/(4π), right? So each element of S will be multiplied by this c.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So A_y would be:
[ 0*(h/4π)   (-i)*(h/4π) ]
[ i*(h/4π)   0*(h/4π) ]

Which simplifies to:
[ 0      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue. So the matrix (A_y - a I) is:

[ -a      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ ( (-i h)/(4π) ) * ( (i h)/(4π) ) ] 

Calculating each part:
(-a)(-a) = a²

The second part: multiply (-i h/(4π)) and (i h/(4π)). Let's compute that.

(-i)(i) = -(i²) = -(-1) = 1. So ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) = (h²)/(16 π²) ) * 1 

So the determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0.

Setting this to zero: a² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots: a = ± h/(4π)

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)) ?

But wait, h is Planck's constant. Oh, but in quantum mechanics, we often use ħ, which is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Hmm, but the options don't seem to have that exactly.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/4π. That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues for angular momentum should be real. So A can't be right because it implies complex eigenvalues.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That also doesn't make sense, because the eigenvalues should be real. So this is probably wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum don't commute, so if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of both Az and A². Wait, but A² is the square of the total angular momentum, which commutes with each component. So eigenfunctions of A² are simultaneous eigenfunctions of all components. But if the system is two-level, maybe it's a spin-½ particle. Then, for spin-½, A² would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)^2 * something. Wait, actually, for spin s, the square is ħ² s(s+1). For s=1/2, that would be ħ²*(3/4) = 3ħ²/4.

Wait, but if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². That's possible because A² commutes with any component, including Ay. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A² as well. But they can't be eigenfunctions of Az because [Ay, Az] ≠ 0. So option C's statement is correct. So that's a possibility.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Hmm, not sure. The basis functions for a 2x2 matrix would typically be the standard basis vectors, like |+> and |-> for spin-up and spin-down. But the eigenvectors of Ay would not necessarily be the standard basis vectors, unless Ay's eigenstates happen to align with those. Let me think about what the eigenvectors are.

So from earlier, the eigenvalues are ± (h/(4π)). Let's compute the eigenvectors.

For eigenvalue a = h/(4π):

We have the matrix equation (A_y - a I) |v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ -a      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a ]

Substituting a = h/(4π):

[ -h/(4π)   (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -h/(4π) ]

Let me write this as:

Row 1: (-h/(4π)) v1 + (-i h/(4π)) v2 = 0
Row 2: (i h/(4π)) v1 + (-h/(4π)) v2 = 0

Let's divide both equations by h/(4π) to simplify:

Row 1: -v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2
Row 2: i v1 - v2 = 0 → i v1 = v2

Substituting v1 from row 1 into row 2:

i*(-i v2) = v2 → (i*(-i)) v2 = v2 → (1) v2 = v2 → 0=0. So the equations are consistent.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [v1, v2] = [-i v2, v2]. Let me choose v2 =1, so the eigenvector is [-i, 1]. Or, in terms of complex conjugate, perhaps normalized.

Wait, but the matrix S given is:

[0 -i
i 0 ]

Wait a second, the matrix S looks familiar. It's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i. Because the Pauli Y matrix is:

[0 -i
i 0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is usually written as:

[0   -i]
[i    0]

Which is exactly the S matrix given here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So A_y = c S = (h/(4π)) * Y.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So the eigenvalues of A_y would be c * (+1) and c * (-1). So that's (h/(4π)) * (+1) and (h/(4π))*(-1).

But wait, the Pauli Y matrix has eigenvalues ±1. So this would make the eigenvalues of A_y ± h/(4π).

Wait, but the eigenvalues of the Y component of angular momentum should be ± ħ/2. Because for spin-½ particles, any component of angular momentum has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, but ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. So yes, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4π). So that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So looking back at the options:

Option A says eigenvalues have imaginary parts. So no, A is incorrect.

Option B's eigenvalues are real, but the values don't match. Because B says imaginary parts are ±1/2, which doesn't fit. So B is wrong.

So the correct eigenvalues are real: a = ± h/(4π), which is ± ħ/2.

So looking at the options, none of the options A or B talk about real eigenvalues. Wait, wait, the problem says that the multiple-choice has option C and D about other statements. So the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So the question is, which statement is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As I thought earlier, A² commutes with Ay, so they can share eigenfunctions. But since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So the statement in C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. Well, the basis functions for a 2x2 matrix are typically the standard basis vectors, e1 and e2. But the eigenvectors of Ay are not e1 or e2 unless the matrix is diagonal in that basis. But Ay is not diagonal in the standard basis because S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is not diagonal. So its eigenvectors are not the standard basis vectors. So D is incorrect.

So the correct statement is C.

The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), which is represented by the matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the given \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Form of \( A_y \):**  
   Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:

   \[
   A_y = 
   \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\
   i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**  
   To find the eigenvalues \( a \), solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). The determinant is:

   \[
   \det(A_y - aI) = a^2 - \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2 = 0.
   \]

   Solving this gives the eigenvalues:

   \[
   a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
   \]

   Since \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \), the eigenvalues can also be expressed as \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), which are real.

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** This suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** This suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** This states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so they share eigenfunctions. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** This states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not the standard basis vectors, as \( A_y \) is not diagonal in the standard basis.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \).
