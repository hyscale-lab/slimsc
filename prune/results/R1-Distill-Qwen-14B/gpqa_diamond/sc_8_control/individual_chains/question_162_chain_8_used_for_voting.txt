Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I remember that in general relativity or differential geometry, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime or a manifold. The area of a surface often involves integrating something like the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, multiplied by some differentials.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a two-dimensional metric. So it's probably describing a 2-dimensional surface, maybe a pseudosphere. Oh wait, pseudosphere is a term I think is related to hyperbolic geometry, like the tractricoid or something.

Wait, the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So I need to figure out the area using this metric. How do I compute the area with a given metric? I think the area element dA in 2D is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Or wait, the metric is written in terms of dx² + dy², so the determinant might be straightforward.

Let me write the metric in matrix form. The metric tensor g has components g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_yy = same as g_xx, and g_xy = 0. So the determinant of the metric tensor g would be (32/(4 -x² -y²)) * (32/(4 -x² -y²)) minus 0, so det(g) = (32)^2 / (4 -x² -y²)^2.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the diagonal terms. So det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2. So the square root of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. So the area would be the integral of dA over the region where the metric is defined.

What's the domain of x and y? The denominator 4 -x² - y² must be positive because otherwise the metric's coefficients would be negative or undefined, leading to a singular metric. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² <4. So the region is a circle of radius 2 in the xy-plane.

Wait, but since the metric is in 2D, perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space? Or more accurately, this might represent a two-dimensional surface with a certain curvature. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface in three dimensions, but maybe here we're considering a two-dimensional surface embedded in another space. Alternatively, perhaps this is a conformally flat metric, which is common in certain solutions like the Schwarzschild metric, but that's in 4D.

Alternatively, maybe this is a 2D surface with a specific metric, and we need to find its area.

Wait, but the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So perhaps the area can be found using some formula related to that.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution of a tractrix) with radius r is something I vaguely recall. But I'm not exactly sure. Another approach is to compute the integral of the area element over the allowed domain.

So, the area A is the double integral over x and y, within x² + y² <4, of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me try that.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So x² + y² = r². The area element in polar coordinates is r dr dθ, but we also have the sqrt(det g) part. So the integrand becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first: ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So substituting, the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] * [ (-du/2) ].

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral is 32 * ∫ from u=4 to u=0 [ (-1/2) du/u ].

Which is 32*(1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du, because the negative flips the limits.

Wait, the integral becomes (32/2) ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du. But wait, when r goes from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0, so the substitution makes the integral go from 4 to 0. But we have a negative sign from du, so we can write it as ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du, multiplied by (32/2).

Wait, let me re-calculate.

The substitution:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r^2)] dr from 0 to2.

u =4 - r² → du= -2r dr → r dr= -du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (1/u) * (-du/2) from u=4 (when r=0) to u=0 (when r=2).

Which is 32 * (1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du.

But the integral of 1/u is ln |u|, which from 4 to 0 would be ln(0) - ln(4). Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. Oh wait, but as r approaches 2 from below, u approaches zero from above. So when r approaches 2, u approaches 0+.

So the integral becomes (16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity, so the integral becomes (16) ( -infinity - ln4 ), which is negative infinity? Wait, that can't be right. But wait, the integrand [32 r/(4 - r²)] is positive in the interval r=0 to2, so the integral should be positive. But according to substitution, it's giving a negative infinity. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution signs.

Wait, let me re-express:

Integral from r=0 to r=2:

(32 r dr)/(4 - r²) = 32 ∫ [ r dr ]/(4 - r²).

Let u=4 - r² → du= -2 r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes 32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u)(-du/2).

Which is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

Which is -16 ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du.

But integrating from 4 to 0 is the same as - ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du, so:

-16 * (- ∫(0^4) (1/u) du ) → 16 ∫(0^4) (1/u) du.

Integral of 1/u from 0 to4 is [ln u] from 0 to4 → ln4 - ln0.

But ln0 is negative infinity. So this becomes ln4 - (-infty) → which is +infty.

Wait, so the integral ∫ [32 r dr/(4 - r²)] from 0 to2 is 16*(infinite) → infinite.

Wait, that's a problem. So the area integral is divergent. So the area would be infinite, which would correspond to option D) +infty.

But wait, that can't be right. Because the pseudosphere is a finite area surface. Or is it? Wait, no. Because in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a pseudosphere (which actually is a surface with infinite extent, like a horn torus but with negative curvature) would have infinite area.

Wait, the pseudosphere as a surface in 3D is actually a surface of infinite area. Because as you go towards the 'equator', the circumference increases, and the surface extends infinitely. So the area would be infinite. Hmm.

So according to the calculation, the area integral diverges. So the area is +infty. So the correct answer would be option D.

But let me think again. The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²). So in polar coordinates, this is [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

The area element would be sqrt(det g) dr dθ. Wait, no, in 2D, the area element is sqrt( g_rr g_θθ - g_rθ² ) dr dθ.

Wait, no, wait. The metric is diagonal in polar coordinates as well. Because the given metric in Cartesian coordinates is diagonal (dx² + dy²) scaled by 32/(4 - x² - y²). So in polar coordinates, the metric would be:

g_rr = 32/(4 - r²)
g_θθ = (32 r²)/(4 - r²)
g_rθ = 0.

So the determinant is g_rr * g_θθ - 0 = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32)^2 r²/(4 - r²)^2.

So the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ = [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

So the area is ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

The integral over θ is just 2π. So the area becomes 2π * ∫ (0 to2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Which is 64π ∫ (0 to2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, substituting u=4 - r² → du= -2r dr → r dr= -du/2.

When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (4 to 0) [ (-du/2) / u ].

Which is ∫ (4 to 0) (-1/(2u)) du = (1/2) ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du.

Which is (1/2) [ln u ] from 0 to4 → (1/2)(ln4 - ln0) → (1/2)(ln4 - (-infty)) → which is infinity.

So the area is 64π * (infinite) → infinite. So the area is infinite.

So the correct answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional surface. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we use the area element in 2D, which is \( dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy \). The metric tensor \( g \) is diagonal, with components \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), and \( g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0 \). Thus, the determinant of \( g \) is 

\[
\det(g) = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2.
\]

The square root of the determinant is 

\[
\sqrt{\det(g)} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}.
\]

In polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta, y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes 

\[
dA = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The region of integration is determined by the condition \( 4 - r^2 > 0 \), which implies \( r^2 < 4 \) or \( r < 2 \). Thus, the area is given by the integral:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, integrate over \( r \). Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \) or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln u \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). This indicates that the area integral is infinite. Since the pseudosphere has infinite extent and the area element increases without bound near \( r = 2 \), the total area is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is \( +\infty \).
