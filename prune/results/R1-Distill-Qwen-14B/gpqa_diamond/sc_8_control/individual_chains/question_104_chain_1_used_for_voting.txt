Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, let me think about what I remember.

So, the setup is that there are two stars, both with masses similar to the Sun. Each has a planet, both Neptune-like masses. The planets are in circular orbits. They detected the planets using the RV method, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, what determines the RV signal? Oh right, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance between the star and planet (the semi-major axis). But wait, the formula, I think it's K = (v) which depends on (M sin i)/(M star^(1/3)) ... Or wait, maybe I should recall the formula for the RV method.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/1) * ... Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ) ), assuming that M_p << M_star, which is the case here since Neptune is much less massive than the Sun. So the star's mass is about the same as the Sun's, and the planet is Neptune-like, so M_p << M_star. So that simplifies things.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_star is the same for both. And both planets have similar masses, so M_p is the same for both.

Wait, but wait— the RV method detects the star's wobble. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, the (1 + M_p/M_star) term is approximated as 1, so it can be ignored. So K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( c^(1/3) * M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p and sin i are the same for both planets (as they have similar masses, and assuming i is 90 degrees for both, which is the most probable case), the ratio K1/K2 can be written as (P2/P1)^(1/3), because all other factors are the same.

Wait, let me think again. Let's denote variables:

K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, K2 for planet 2.

Given that M_p1 ≈ M_p2, M_star1 ≈ M_star2, and assuming sin i is the same (like both edge-on), then the ratio K1/K2 would be proportional to (P2/P1)^(1/3) / (P1/P2)^(1/3)? Wait, no, maybe I should invert it.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = [ (M_p1) / (M_star1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ) ] / [ (M_p2) / (M_star2^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ) ]

Since M_p1 ≈ M_p2 and M_star1 ≈ M_star2, then K1/K2 ≈ (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

Which is (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But wait, in the problem, the detected shifts are the K values. So K1 = 5 milliangstroms, K2 =7. So K1/K2 =5/7.

So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (5/7)³ = P2/P1 → P2/P1 = (5/7)^3.

Wait, 5/7 is approximately 0.714, so 0.714 cubed is 0.714 * 0.714 = 0.51, then *0.714 is about 0.364.

So P2 = 0.364 * P1. So the orbital period of planet 2 is about 0.364 times that of planet 1. So the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. That would be P2/P1 = ~0.364, so P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is smaller, P is larger. Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so if K1 < K2, P1 > P2.

Wait, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1 < K2. So using the formula, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3. Wait, but that's 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

But the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So P2 is shorter, so it's less than 1 times. So the ratio P2/P1 is about 0.364. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which would imply that P2 is 0.36 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

But wait, the question is phrased as "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if the period is shorter, then it's less than 1 times. So the answer is ~0.36, which is option A.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the proportionality.

Because K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

So K1 = (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P2^(1/3) )

So K1 / K2 = [1/(P1^(1/3))] / [1/(P2^(1/3))] ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

5^3 is 125, 7^3 is 343. So 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Thus, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So planet #2's period is 0.364 times that of planet #1, which is shorter. So the answer is ~0.36, which is option A.

The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The semi-amplitude of the RV signal, \( K \), is proportional to \( \frac{M_p}{M_{\text{star}}^{2/3} P^{1/3}} \), where \( M_p \) is the planet's mass, \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the star's mass, and \( P \) is the orbital period. Since both stars have similar masses and the planets have similar masses, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) depends only on the orbital periods of the planets:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}.
\]

Substituting into the proportionality:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
