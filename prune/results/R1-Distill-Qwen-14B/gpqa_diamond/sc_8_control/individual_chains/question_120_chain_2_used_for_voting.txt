Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to the Earth's movement around the Sun. The formula I recall is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, but I'm a bit confused about what that means. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So, the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

Wait, but how does that translate into the number of stars per unit parallax? Parallax is 1/d, so the distance d is 1/plx. Let me think about it.

If stars are uniformly distributed, then the number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV would be n * dV. 

But when we talk about parallax, we're looking at stars at a certain distance, so maybe I should think in terms of a thin shell at a distance d. The volume of a thin spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But since parallax plx = 1/d, I can express d as 1/plx. So substituting, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, the negative sign just comes from differentiation, but maybe I can ignore it for now since we're looking for the dependence.

So the number of stars per unit parallax (like a small range in plx) would be the number in the shell divided by the change in plx. So let's see: 

Number of stars in shell: N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd)
But dd = (dd/plx) * (d plx) ? Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, dd/d plx = -1/(plx^2). So a small change in plx, d plx, corresponds to a change in d of -d plx / plx². So the thickness in distance is proportional to d plx. 

So number of stars per d plx would be N = n * 4π (d)^2 * (dd). Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = - (d plx)/(plx²) = - d plx / plx².

Putting it all together:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx²) )

Wait, because dd is proportional to d plx, which is a small change in plx. So,

N = n * 4π * (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2)

Because dd = (d plx) * (-1/plx²), but since we're looking for the number per unit plx, maybe we can take the absolute value and ignore the sign.

So N ∝ (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) * d plx. Wait, that would be 1/plx^4.

Wait no, wait. Let me re-calculate.

Let me write N as the number of stars between plx and plx + d plx.

So the distance d is 1/plx. The distance for plx + d plx is approximately 1/(plx + d plx) ≈ 1/plx - d plx / plx², assuming d plx is small.

So the shell at distance d has a thickness dd = [1/plx - 1/(plx + d plx)] ≈ (d plx)/(plx²).

Wait, that makes sense. Because plx is small when d is large (since plx=1/d). So the shell's thickness in distance is about (d plx)/(plx²).

The volume of the shell is 4πd² dd.

Substituting d=1/plx and dd≈d plx/(plx²):

Volume ≈ 4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx²) ) =4π (d plx) / plx^4.

Since the number of stars is n times the volume, N ≈ n * 4π d plx / plx^4.

But the question is about the number per unit plx range, so N per d plx is n * 4π/(plx^4) * d plx / d plx. Wait, no; the way I set it up, N is the number in the range d plx. So N = n * 4π (d^2) * dd. Which is n *4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx / plx^2) ) = n *4π d plx / plx^4.

So the number per unit plx (d plx) is (n *4π d plx / plx^4) ) / (d plx) ) → (n *4π ) / plx^4. 

So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as plx increases, but the way it scales is 1 over plx to the fourth power.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, which matches. Hmm, but I thought maybe it would be 1/plx^2 because of the area. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: think about the volume per unit parallax. The question is about how the number of stars depends on plx when considering a small range of plx.

Since the number of stars is uniform in space, the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a given volume depends on that volume.

But if we consider a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + d plx, what's the corresponding volume?

Each star at a distance d has a parallax plx = 1/d. So stars with parallax between plx and plx + d plx are at distances d and d + dd, where dd = 1/plx - 1/(plx + d plx) ≈ (d plx)/(plx^2) as before.

The volume between these distances is 4π d^2 dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd ≈ (d plx)/(plx^2), the volume is 4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx)/(plx^2) ) =4π d plx/(plx^4).

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer should be option A: ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes it's presented as 1/plx squared. Oh, maybe I'm mixing it with the number of stars per unit volume, but here it's per unit plx, which involves a different scaling.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the number of stars per unit volume is n, which is constant. The number of stars in a shell between d and d + dd is 4πd² dd * n. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so dd = -d plx / (plx)^2 = - (d plx)/(plx^2). So substituting, the number is n *4π (1/plx^2) * (d plx)/(plx^2) ) = n *4π d plx/(plx^4). So per unit plx (d plx), it's n *4π/(plx^4). So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant, denoted as \( n \).

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{d \, d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \) (since \( dd \) corresponds to a small change in \( \text{plx} \)), the volume becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{d \, d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4\pi \, d \, d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then proportional to the volume, so:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto \frac{4\pi \, d \, d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)), we divide by \( d\text{plx} \), resulting in:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit } d\text{plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).
