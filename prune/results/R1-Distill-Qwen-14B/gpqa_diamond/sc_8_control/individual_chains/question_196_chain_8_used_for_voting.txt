Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, the question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a 1D scenario. Let me think about what I know.

First, in the classical case, like without relativity, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? Because when the mass passes through the equilibrium point, all the potential energy (½ k A²) is converted into kinetic energy, so ½ mv_max² = ½ k A², which simplifies to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That would be option C, but wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so that can't be the case here.

Relativity comes into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So we can't use the classical equations anymore. The problem mentions that the speed of light is c, so we have to consider relativistic effects.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is ½ k x², but when relativistic effects are considered, maybe the equations change a bit.

Wait, the problem says it's a relativistic oscillator. So the potential energy in relativity might not be the same as in the classical case. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, perhaps the system is treated using relativistic mechanics, so the energy expressions would involve gamma.

But wait, another approach: the system is a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx, but in a relativistic context. So maybe the equations of motion are modified. I'm not exactly sure about the exact form, but perhaps considering energy conservation in the relativistic scenario would help.

In the relativistic case, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x = A), all its energy is potential, and when it's at x=0, all its energy is kinetic. So the total energy E should account for both the rest mass energy and the potential energy.

Wait, no, because the oscillator is in motion, but the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) would be equal to the total relativistic energy minus the rest energy. Hmm, perhaps I should think about it differently.

Wait, let me clarify. In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is E = ½ k A², and this equals the kinetic energy at x=0. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy would be E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) mc². So the total energy would be E_total = gamma mc², which is equal to the sum of rest energy plus kinetic energy. But when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all energy is potential, which is ½ k A². So equating these, perhaps?

Wait, maybe not. Because in the relativistic case, the potential energy could be different. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is still ½ k x², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So, let's model this. At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. So E_potential = ½ k A². But in the relativistic case, the total energy E_total would be gamma mc², but at x=A, the velocity is zero, so gamma is just 1. So E_total = mc². But that can't be right because when the mass is at maximum displacement, all the energy should be potential, which is ½ k A². So perhaps the total energy is E = mc² + ½ k A²?

Wait, that makes sense. So the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E_total = mc² + ½ k A².

When the mass is at the equilibrium position (x=0), all the energy is kinetic, so E_kinetic = E_total - mc². But wait, in relativistic terms, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So setting that equal to E_total - mc² gives:

(gamma - 1) mc² = E_total - mc².

But E_total is mc² + ½ k A². So substituting that in:

(gamma - 1) mc² = (mc² + ½ k A²) - mc².

Simplifying the right side: ½ k A². So,

(gamma - 1) mc² = ½ k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma - 1 = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, α for simplification. So,

gamma = 1 + α,

where α = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + α.

Square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + α)^2.

Take reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2.

v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + α)^2].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2.

That's equal to [ (1 + α)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + α)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2α + α²) -1 = 2α + α².

So,

v² = c² * (2α + α²) / (1 + α)^2.

Substitute α = (k A²)/(2 m c²):

v² = c² [ (2*(k A²)/(2 m c²)) + ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ] / [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Simplify numerator:

First term: 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c²).

Second term: (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So numerator is [ (k A²)/(m c²) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ].

Denominator is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor:

The denominator (1 + α)^2 = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about which option matches this expression.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, perhaps that's not the same as what I have. Let me think again.

Wait, let me go back to the expression for v_max squared:

v² = c² [ (2α + α²) ] / (1 + α)^2.

But α is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max² = c² [ (2α + α²) ] / (1 + α)^2.

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

2α + α² = α(2 + α).

Denominator is (1 + α)^2.

So,

v² = c² [ α (2 + α) ] / (1 + α)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me compute 1 - v²/c².

We had:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2.

Alternatively,

v²/c² = [ (1 + α)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + α)^2.

Which is [1 + 2α + α² - 1] / (1 + α)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [2α + α²]/(1 + α)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can find an expression that matches one of the options.

Let me look again at the options.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m) ) )

Wait, but that seems to have something with (k A^2)/(2m), but in our case, the denominator has (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)), because alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier steps.

Wait, let me recheck my reasoning.

The total energy E is mc² + ½ k A².

At x=0, all energy is kinetic. So,

E = gamma mc² = mc² + ½ k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (½ k A²)/(m c²).

Wait, no, ½ k A² is the potential energy. So,

gamma = (mc² + ½ k A²)/ (mc²) ) = 1 + (½ k A²)/(m c²).

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, my earlier substitution was correct.

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha, with alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha.

Squaring both sides,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ]/(1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, no, 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2] = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me compute 1 - (1/(1+alpha)^2):

= [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expand numerator: 1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

v² = c² (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, I can factor the numerator:

= c² [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But I'm not seeing an immediate way to simplify that into any of the options.

Looking at the options again.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

Wait, that seems to involve a square root of (1 + ...), but our expression is v_max squared is c² times (2 alpha + alpha²)/(1 + alpha)^2.

Let me compute the expression under the square root in option B.

Let me compute the term inside the square root: 1 + [1/(1 - x)] where x is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, x is alpha multiplied by c²/(k A²) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 1 + 1/(1 - x), where x would be (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, 1 + 1/(1 - x) = [ (1 - x) + 1 ] / (1 - x ) = (2 -x)/(1 -x).

But that doesn't seem to match our expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express our v_max² in terms of (something squared) and see.

Alternatively, perhaps I should make a substitution for alpha.

Let me say that alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (something).

Let me write the denominator in the v_max² expression.

We have:

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²)/(1 + alpha)^2.

We can factor out alpha from numerator.

= alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps factor as:

alpha (2 + alpha) = alpha ( (1 + alpha) + 1 )

= alpha(1 + alpha) + alpha.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps think about 2 + alpha = (1 + alpha) + 1.

So,

v²/c² = [ alpha ( (1 + alpha) + 1 ) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= alpha [ (1 + alpha) + 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= alpha [ 1 + alpha + 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= alpha [ 2 + alpha ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should try to plug in the expression into the options to see which one matches.

Wait, let me look for an option that when squared gives v² = c² * [ 2 alpha + alpha² ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

So, v_max = sqrt( [2 alpha + alpha² ] / (1 + alpha)^2 ) * c.

Hmm, that would be c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha).

Alternatively, factor numerator as alpha(2 + alpha):

= c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha).

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's compute each option:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m) ) )

Wait, denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m)), but in our case, alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c²), so this denominator isn't the same. So this might not be the correct option.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Wait, that's 1 + 1/(1 - x), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is (1 + [1/(1 - x)]) = [ (1 - x) + 1 ] / (1 - x ) ) = (2 - x)/(1 - x).

So, option B's expression is sqrt( (2 - x)/(1 - x) ), multiplied by c.

Wait, how does that compare to our v² expression?

Our v² is c² (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha = x, since x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = alpha.

So,

[2 alpha + alpha^2]/(1 + alpha)^2 = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ]/(1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, and option B's v_max squared would be c² (2 - alpha)/(1 - alpha).

So, unless these are the same, but I don't think so.

Wait, option B's expression:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2 - alpha) / (1 - alpha) ) ]

But our expression is [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

These don't look the same. Let me plug in alpha =0 to see.

At alpha=0 (k A^2=0), our v_max should be sqrt(k A^2/m) =0, which matches option C, but since this is relativistic, option C isn't correct because in the non-relativistic case, it's correct. So, option B when alpha=0 would have v_max= c*sqrt( [2]/[1] )= c*sqrt(2), which is wrong because when k A^2 is zero, the speed should be zero.

Wait, that's a problem. So option B gives a nonzero speed when k A² is zero, which is incorrect. So option B can't be correct.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Wait, let's compute the term inside.

1 - [1/(1 + x )^2 ] where x is (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So,

1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 = [ (1 + x )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x )^2.

Which is [1 + 2x + x² -1 ] / (1 + x)^2.

= (2x + x²)/(1+x)^2.

Which is exactly what our v²/c² is. So,

v² = c² (2x +x²)/(1 +x)^2.

Which would make v_max = c sqrt( (2x + x²)/(1+x)^2 ) ).

That's the same as sqrt(2x + x^2)/(1+x) * c.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2x +x²) )/(1+x ).

Which can be written as c * sqrt( x (2 +x) ) / (1 + x ).

Hmm, but in any case, this matches option D's expression under the square root.

Wait, option D's expression is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ) where x is (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

But 1 - 1/(1 +x )^2 = (2x + x²)/(1 +x )^2.

So, the entire expression inside the sqrt is (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2.

Therefore, option D is v_max = c * sqrt( (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2 ), which is correct.

Wait, but let me compute what option D says.

Option D is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which is exactly our expression for v_max squared.

Wait, no, the square root in option D is over the entire (1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ), which is (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2.

So, option D's expression is sqrt( [2x + x²]/(1 +x )^2 ) multiplied by c.

Which is the same as our expression for v_max.

So, option D seems to be correct. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about it, I thought it was option B, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-express the final v_max expression.

v_max = c * sqrt( (2x + x²)/(1 +x )^2 )

= c * ( sqrt( x(2 +x) ) ) / (1 +x )

But perhaps I can factor this differently.

Alternatively, I can write it as c * sqrt( x (2 + x) ) / (1 +x )

Hmm, but regardless, according to the options, option D is the one that has this expression.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Another approach: when the kinetic energy is maximum, the velocity is maximum.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

At maximum velocity, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So,

Potential energy at maximum displacement is ½ k A².

So,

(gamma -1) mc² = ½ k A².

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which is the same as before.

So,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2)=1 + x, where x is (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + x.

Then, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + x).

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + x)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2 = [ (1 +x)^2 -1 ] / (1 +x)^2.

Which is (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2x + x²)/(1 +x )^2 ) = c * sqrt( (2x +x²)/(1 +x )^2 )

Which is the same as option D.

Yes, this matches exactly with option D.

So, the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:

\[
E_{\text{kinetic}} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
v^2/c^2 = \frac{(1 + \alpha)^2 - 1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Expanding the numerator:

\[
v^2/c^2 = \frac{1 + 2\alpha + \alpha^2 - 1}{(1 + \alpha)^2} = \frac{2\alpha + \alpha^2}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{\frac{2\alpha + \alpha^2}{(1 + \alpha)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
