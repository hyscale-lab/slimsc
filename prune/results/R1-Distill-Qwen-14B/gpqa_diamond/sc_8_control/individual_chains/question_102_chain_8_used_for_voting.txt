Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up when they look at the mice under the confocal microscope. Let me go through the problem step by step.

First, I'll try to understand the setup. They've created this bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So in this vector, there are two ORFs: one for the ligand and another for the receptor. 

The ligand ORF is at the 5' position and is fused to mCherry. Wait, no, wait—wait, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, but it's fused to mCherry? Or is mCherry a separate marker? Hmm, actually, the way it's written: the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, I think that means the ligand is expressed as a fusion protein with mCherry, and the receptor is a fusion with eGFP. But the question is about the eGFP not showing up.

The vector uses loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. So between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop cassette with lox2272. So, when Cre is expressed, which Cre variant would excise the stops? LoxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for Cre. LoxP is the wild-type site, and lox2272 is a variant that Cre can't flip unless it's a site-specific recombinase.

Wait, so the ligand's stop cassette is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. So, when Cre is introduced, which stops are excised? Cre would recognize the loxP sites and cause the stop cassette to be excised, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, for the lox2272 sites, perhaps another Cre variant or a different setup is needed? Or maybe the same Cre can work on both?

Wait, no, the vector is a bicistronic construct, meaning both ORFs are in the same transcript. So the ligand is first, followed by the receptor. Between ligand and mCherry is a stop cassette with loxP, so without Cre, the ligand would be expressed with mCherry? Or wait, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the ligand's ORF is at 5', and it's fused to mCherry. That implies that ligand and mCherry are expressed as a single protein—so the ligand is at the N-terminal, and mCherry is at the C-terminal. Similarly, the receptor is at the 3' end and is fused to eGFP, so receptor-eGFP is a single protein. But for that to happen, the stop cassettes must be excised.

Wait, but the way the vector is described: the ligand ORF is followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed as a separate ORF, and the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Or is the mCherry part of the ligand construct? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the vector is set up so that the ligand is under the control of the CBA promoter. Then, after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette, and then mCherry. Then, the receptor is after an IRES element, which allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed in a separate reading frame. But wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so perhaps the CBA promoter drives the expression of both ligand and receptor, but the IRES allows for the receptor to be expressed as a separate protein. Hmm, maybe the vector is designed so that in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry, and the receptor as a fusion with eGFP. But when Cre is introduced (like in the presence of Cre mice), the stop cassettes are removed, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed as separate proteins. Or wait, no: no, wait, the stop cassettes are between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Then, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop cassette with loxP, then mCherry. So the ligand and mCherry would be co-expressed only if the stop is removed, right? Similarly, the receptor is after the IRES element, and the receptor ORF is followed by a stop cassette with lox2272 and then eGFP. So without Cre, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed as a fusion, and the receptor and eGFP as another fusion. But when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing for the expression of mCherry and eGFP independently. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the setup.

Wait, let me try to diagram this:

The vector is a bicistronic construct, so perhaps it's a single transcript with two ORFs. So the structure is:

CBA promoter --> ligand ORF --> loxP-stop-loxP --> mCherry ORF --> IRES --> receptor ORF --> lox2272-stop-lox2272 --> eGFP ORF.

Wait, but IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF without the need for a stop in between. So maybe the first ORF is ligand, then after the stop, mCherry is another ORF, but with the stop cassette, perhaps co-expressed with the ligand. Alternatively, the IRES comes after the stop cassette. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two ORFs are in the same transcript, and the IRES allows the receptor to be translated without the need for a stop. So in that case, the ligand is expressed as a fusion to mCherry (with the stop cassette), and the receptor as a fusion to eGFP (with another stop cassette). So, in the absence of Cre, you'd have ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP expressed. But when Cre is present (like in the presence of Cre transgene), the stop cassettes are removed. So the ligand and mCherry are expressed as separate proteins, and the receptor and eGFP as separate. But perhaps in the absence of Cre, the mCherry is not expressed because the stop cassette is present.

Hmm, but the problem says that the ligand is under the CBA promoter. So the CBA promoter would drive the expression of the ligand and the receptor, with the IRES allowing the second ORF to be expressed.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand at 5' under CBA, then the stop cassette, then mCherry, then IRES, then receptor at 3', with a stop cassette and eGFP. So the idea is that without Cre, the ligand and mCherry are expressed as a single fusion (ligand-mCherry), and then the receptor and eGFP are expressed as a single fusion (receptor-eGFP). But when Cre is introduced, the stop cassettes are excised, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed separately, and receptor and eGFP to be expressed separately.

But in the problem, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So when the mice are crossed, the SOX10-Cre would induce recombination.

So the Cre is expressed, and it should excise the loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. So the ligand and mCherry would now be expressed as separate proteins (ligand and mCherry), and the receptor and eGFP would be expressed as separate proteins (receptor and eGFP). But in the experiment, after the offspring is born, they look under the confocal and don't see a green signal. The green is from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. So why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Possible reasons:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Hmm, paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But in this case, the construct is in the same cell, so the proteins should be expressed in the same cells. So I'm not sure how this relates.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So the GFP isn't reaching the cell surface, so it doesn't fluoresce. That's a possibility. But why would this happen? Maybe because of a stop or incorrect processing.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the construct is under the CBA promoter. If the enhancer is missing, perhaps they are not expressed. But the question says that the vector was transfected into primary astrocyte culture, and they tested Western blot, which showed signals proportional to actin. So the proteins are being expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse model, the expression is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. So perhaps the expression is fine.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop cassette is excised, the receptor and eGFP would be expressed as separate proteins. But if during recombination, the reading frame is shifted, the eGFP might not be expressed correctly, leading to no signal.

Wait, but the stop cassette is lox2272, and the Cre used in the SOX10-Cre is a standard Cre (loxP). Oh wait, no. The lox2272 is a variant that requires Cre-P (a mutant version of Cre) or is it the other way around. Wait, no, loxP is recognized by wild-type Cre. lox2272 is a mutated site that Cre can still recognize but requires a longer sequence. Wait, actually, I think that lox2272 is a variant that only allows for directional recombination. So standard Cre can recognize both loxP and lox2272 sites, but perhaps in this setup, the lox2272 stop cassette is not being excised because the Cre doesn't work on it.

Wait, but the construct is in a mouse that's homozygous for the construct. Then crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is a standard Cre. So the SOX10-Cre should induce recombination at both loxP and lox2272 sites.

Wait, but wait: the ligand stop cassette is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. So when Cre is introduced, it should excise both. So the ligand and mCherry should be expressed as separate proteins, and the receptor and eGFP as separate.

But why is the eGFP not showing up?

If the stop cassette for the receptor-eGFP is lox2272, and maybe Cre can't excise it, then the stop would remain, meaning eGFP isn't expressed. Oh wait, no, I thought Cre can excise both loxP and lox2272. So perhaps the problem is that the stop cassette isn't properly excised.

Wait, but the vector is designed so that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the lox2272 stop is still present. So why?

Wait, another possibility is that the lox2272 site isn't correctly flanking the stop cassette. So when Cre is introduced, it can't recognize it, so the stop cassette remains, and eGFP isn't expressed. Or perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells where the receptor is expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working. The IRES is upstream of the receptor, so perhaps the receptor isn't being expressed as a separate ORF, but in the presence of the stop cassette, the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they tested the expression. They used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So presumably, the ligand and receptor are expressed. But the Western blot would show the proteins, regardless of whether the fluorescent proteins are expressed. So perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette for the receptor isn't being excised, so the eGFP isn't made.

But why would that be the case? Because the lox2272 stop cassette isn't being recognized by the Cre used.

Wait, perhaps the Cre used is not compatible with the lox2272 site. Because standard Cre might not be efficient at excising lox2272. Oh wait, no, I think that lox2272 is recognized by Cre but requires a longer recognition sequence. So perhaps the construct's lox2272 site isn't correctly designed, so Cre can't excise it. So the stop cassette remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette is in the wrong orientation. For loxP and lox2272, the orientation matters. If the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation, then Cre can excise them. But if they're in opposite orientations, perhaps it doesn't. So if the vector has lox2272 in the wrong orientation, the stop cassette won't be excised.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. So the most likely reason is that the stop cassette isn't being excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking back at the options, which one matches this scenario.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. That would imply that when the stop is excised, the eGFP is out of frame, so not expressed. But that would require the stop cassette to be excised, which it isn't. Or perhaps the reading frame is disrupted.

Wait, no. When the stop is excised, the receptor and eGFP are in the same frame. If they're not in the same frame, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the vector is designed such that when the stop is excised, the two ORFs are in frame. So if the reading frame is shifted, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette wasn't properly excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But why wouldn't the stop be excised? Because the lox sites aren't recognized by Cre.

Wait, the vector uses loxP and lox2272. SOX10-Cre is a standard Cre. So perhaps the lox2272 sites are not being cut because Cre can't recognize them. Or maybe the lox2272 is in the wrong orientation.

But I think standard Cre can cut lox2272 sites, but with lower efficiency. Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 sites are in a configuration that prevents recombination.

Or perhaps the IRES isn't allowing the expression of eGFP.

Wait, but the eGFP is after the receptor ORF. If the stop cassette isn't excised, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So in that case, the green signal wouldn't show up.

Another thought: perhaps the vector wasn't correctly recombined in the mouse, so the construct is not in the right place. But the question says the mice are homozygous for the construct, so probably the construct is present.

So the issue is that the stop cassettes aren't being excised. Why?

If the vector uses lox2272 for the receptor's stop, and the Cre used is a standard Cre, which can recognize it but... Wait, I think that lox2272 is a variant that isn't efficiently cut by Cre. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused about that. I think lox2272 is a site that is recognized by Cre but is more efficiently recombined when paired with another lox2272 site. Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 requires a specific Cre variant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The stop cassette for the receptor is lox2272. So when Cre is present, it should excise that stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But if the Cre can't recognize the lox2272 site, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So why would the Cre not recognize the lox2272 site? Because it's a different site. Wait, no, standard Cre can recognize lox2272, but maybe it's less efficient. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the same orientation, but the vector's design is such that the lox2272 sites are inverted, so Cre can't recombine them. So the stop cassette remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem states that the ligand ORF is at 5' and under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. The stop cassettes are between them and the fluorescent proteins. So the vector is set up so that Cre should excise both stops, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the lox2272 site is not being cut, so the stop remains. So why isn't the lox2272 site being cut?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not functioning, so the receptor isn't expressed. Wait, but the IRES allows for the receptor to be expressed independently, so without the IRES, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the construct is designed with the IRES upstream of the receptor.

Wait, but in the absence of the stop cassette, would the IRES allow the receptor to be expressed along with eGFP? I'm a bit muddled here.

Looking back at the options, which ones could explain the lack of eGFP:

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop cassette is excised, the reading frame is wrong, and eGFP isn't made. But if the stop is excised, the receptor and eGFP should be in frame. So perhaps the vector's design has them out of frame, making eGFP not expressed. But that would be a design issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette wasn't properly excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the problem is the mouse model. The Cre is provided by the SOX10-Cre mice. So in the offspring, the Cre should activate and excise the stops.

If the eGFP is not expressed, perhaps the lox2272 stop is not being excised. Why? Because the Cre doesn't recognize it, or perhaps it's not present.

Wait, but in the vector, the stop cassettes are present. So the other possibility is that the lox2272 site is not flanking the stop correctly. Or perhaps the lox2272 is in the wrong orientation.

Alternatively, maybe the lox2272 is a 'floxed' stop, meaning that the stop is between the lox2272 sites. When Cre is present, it excises the stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed. But if the lox2272 sites are not correctly placed (like in reverse orientation), the stop isn't excised.

Wait, but the problem says that the stop is in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, the stop is excised, and the eGFP is expressed.

So the issue must be that in the current setup, the Cre isn't excising the lox2272 site, hence the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

But why would that be? If the construct was made correctly, the Cre should excise the lox2272 sites. So perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 site is not correctly recognized by the Cre.

Wait, I think that lox2272 is a site that is recognized by Cre but requires a longer sequence. So perhaps the construct's lox2272 isn't correctly designed, making it unrecognizable by Cre. Or perhaps the Cre used (SOX10-Cre) doesn't recognize lox2272, which is unlikely because standard Cre should.

Alternatively, maybe the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation, making them unable to be recombined, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. But then the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, but their expression wouldn't affect the eGFP.

But in the Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin. So maybe the proteins are expressed, but the eGFP isn't, so in the confocal, they don't see the green.

Wait, another possibility is that the eGFP isn't being transported to the cell surface. But the question doesn't indicate any issues with the ligand-receptor interaction or trafficking. So I think the more likely issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed.

So looking at the options again:

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from being on the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But why would it be stuck? Maybe because the eGFP is not correctly folded or the receptor isn't trafficking properly. But this would be a problem in the cell biology of the protein, not the expression construct.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't excised, this wouldn't matter. But if the stop is excised, and the ORF isn't correctly in frame, then eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So perhaps the vector's design causes this.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 sites are not correctly placed, so the stop isn't excised, meaning eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the construct uses loxP and lox2272. The ligand's stop is loxP, which should be excised by Cre. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which should also be excised. So both stops should be removed, meaning both mCherry and eGFP should be expressed.

But if the lox2272 site isn't being cut, the eGFP isn't expressed. Why? Because the Cre can't recognize it. But I thought Cre can recognize both loxP and lox2272, but perhaps in this setup, the lox2272 isn't properly designed, or the Cre isn't compatible.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B, that the eGFP is stuck in the Golgi, but that's more about protein trafficking.

Wait, another angle: the IRES allows for the expression of the receptor and eGFP. So if the stop cassette is not excised, then the eGFP isn't expressed. But the construct is in the mice, which are homozygous, so perhaps the IRES is not functioning correctly, so the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But without knowing, perhaps the most likely answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but why wouldn't they be in frame? Because the stop cassette is not excised, they are in frame, so eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

When the stop cassette between the receptor ORF and eGFP is excised, the receptor and eGFP become separate ORFs. If the reading frame is correct, eGFP is expressed. If not, it isn't.

If the reading frame is incorrect, perhaps the eGFP isn't produced. So why would the reading frame be incorrect? Because the vector wasn't designed properly, so when the stop is excised, the frames are misaligned.

But in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no green signal. So option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette wasn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop wasn't excised because of the lox2272 site.

But why wouldn't the stop be excised?

Because the lox2272 site isn't recognized by the Cre. But SOX10-Cre is a standard Cre, which should recognize lox2272.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed in a way that the eGFP is not expressed because the IRES is upstream, and without the stop being excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But I'm getting too deep without a clear answer.

Looking at the options, the most plausible reason for eGFP not being expressed is that the stop cassette isn't being excised, which would mean the eGFP isn't made. So why isn't the stop being excised? Because the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another possibility: the vector uses a lox2272 site for the receptor, and the Cre used is not the correct type. But I think SOX10-Cre uses standard Cre.

So perhaps the problem is that the Cre isn't active in the cells where the receptor is expressed. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells. So the Cre would be active in those cells.

Wait, but in the experiment, the mouse is homozygous for the construct, and they're crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is expressed in neural crest-derived cells, which would excise the stop cassettes in those cells.

But perhaps the eGFP is expressed only in other cells. Wait, but the question says they visualize the mice under the confocal. So the eGFP should be expressed in neural crest derivatives, like astrocytes or other cells.

Wait, another thought: the ligand and receptor are expressed in a paracrine manner, meaning they act on neighboring cells. So the ligand is expressed in one cell, the receptor in another. But the construct is a bicistronic vector, so both would be expressed in the same cell. So the ligand and receptor are in the same cell, making it autocrine, not paracrine. So option A is probably not correct.

Wait, but the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. So perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to no eGFP expression.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the vector is designed as a bicistronic construct. The first ORF is ligand, under CBA, followed by stop, then mCherry. The second ORF is receptor, under IRES, followed by stop and eGFP.

So without Cre, ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP are expressed as fusion proteins. When Cre is present, the stops are excised, and the ligand, mCherry, receptor, and eGFP are expressed separately.

But in the mouse, after Cre is introduced, the eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

If the eGFP stop is lox2272, and the Cre can't excise it, then eGFP isn't expressed.

But if the vector doesn't have the correct lox sites, perhaps the Cre can't excise.

Wait, another possibility is that the vector uses a loxP site for the receptor's stop, but the question says the ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's stop is lox2272. So the Cre should be able to excise both.

But perhaps the vector uses a stop cassette that isn't flanked by lox sites properly. For example, perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong order, so Cre can't excise the stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the same orientation, which is required for Cre to excise them. For a stop cassette, the lox sites should be in the same orientation to allow for their excision. So if the lox sites are in opposite orientations, the stop wouldn't be excised.

Wait, perhaps the lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation. That would prevent the stop from being excised, so eGFP isn't expressed.

In the vector, the stop cassette is lox2272-stop-lox2272. So the lox sites are in the same orientation (both same direction), which is correct for Cre to excise. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette for the receptor is between the receptor and eGFP, making it a 'floxed' stop. So when Cre is present, the stop is excised, and the eGFP is expressed. But if the stop is not excised, eGFP isn't expressed.

So why isn't the stop being excised? Because Cre isn't present, but the mice are supposed to have Cre from the SOX10-Cre line.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning that the Cre is present in the mice. So the stop should be excised.

Wait, perhaps the Cre is not active in the cells where the receptor is expressed. For example, maybe SOX10-Cre isn't active in the cells that express the receptor.

But the question states that the construct is initially expressed in neural crest cells, which are where SOX10 is active. So the Cre should be active there.

I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is excised, then the receptor and eGFP would be in frame, so expressed as separate proteins. So if they're not in frame, eGFP isn't expressed. But why would they be out of frame? Because the vector's design caused a frame shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette is not correctly flanked. For example, perhaps an extra nucleotide was added, causing the reading frame to shift. But that's a vector design issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't properly recombined, so the stop isn't excised. But the problem states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so perhaps the vector is correctly inserted.

Another thought: perhaps the lox2272 site is more efficiently recombined when paired with another lox2272 site. But in this case, the construct only has lox2272 sites in the receptor's stop cassette, so perhaps the Cre isn't cutting them efficiently.

Wait, but in the presence of Cre, both stops should be excised, regardless of the type of lox sites. So perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 sites are not properly recognized, leading to the stop cassette remaining.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, the most likely correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But if the stop was excised, and the ORFs are out of frame, then eGFP isn't expressed either.

Wait, but the Western blot doesn't test for eGFP; it uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins (ligand and receptor). So the Western shows that the ligand and receptor are expressed. But the eGFP isn't, so the confocal doesn't show green.

So the problem is that the eGFP isn't being expressed, but the proteins are. So the issue is with the eGFP expression, not the presence of the receptor.

So perhaps the stop cassette wasn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed. Why? Because the lox2272 stop wasn't excised. So perhaps the stop isn't flanked by the correct lox sites, making the Cre unable to excise.

But I don't know the exact details of the lox2272 and Cre recognition.

An alternative approach: the IRES comes before the receptor ORF. So perhaps the IRES is not working, meaning the receptor isn't expressed unless the stop is excised. Wait, but the IRES allows for the expression of the second ORF in a bicistronic construct. So if the IRES is functional, the receptor would be expressed regardless of the stop. But in the presence of the stop cassette, the eGFP might not be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is after the stop cassette. So the stop is before the receptor ORF. So in the absence of Cre, the stop remains, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed as a fusion. When Cre is present, the stop is excised, allowing the IRES to drive the expression of the receptor and eGFP as separate proteins.

But if the stop isn't excised (because the lox2272 isn't being cut), then the IRES might not function properly, and the eGFP isn't expressed.

But I'm not certain.

Given all this, I'm going to make an educated guess. The problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette wasn't excised, which is due to the lox2272 site not being correctly recognized by the Cre. But since the Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is a standard Cre, perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 stop cassette isn't in the correct orientation or isn't properly designed.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the vector uses loxP and lox2272. The ligand's stop is loxP, and the receptor's is lox2272. The Cre used is standard Cre, which can cut both. So when Cre is introduced, both stops are excised. Thus, the eGFP should be expressed. But in the experiment, it's not. So perhaps the problem is that the IRES is not functioning, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot shows the ligand and receptor are expressed.

Wait, the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the ligand and receptor are expressed, their presence would show up on the blot. So the issue is with eGFP specifically.

Thus, the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette isn't being excised. The reason for that could be that the lox2272 isn't recognized by the Cre, so the stop remains.

But why would the Cre not recognize the lox2272? Perhaps because the lox2272 sites are in the wrong configuration.

Wait, another thought: the loxP and lox2272 sites are designed in a way that they form a loxP-like site when paired, but perhaps the specific Cre used here (SOX10-Cre) doesn't recognize lox2272 efficiently.

But I think that standard Cre can recognize lox2272 sites, but perhaps not as efficiently as loxP. So in the presence of SOX10-Cre, the loxP site is efficiently cut, but the lox2272 isn't, leading to the ligand's stop being excised, but the receptor's stop remaining. Thus, mCherry would be expressed, but eGFP wouldn't.

But the problem states that the mouse was homozygous for the construct, meaning that the vector is in the genome. The Cre is from the SOX10 line, which should be active in neural crest-derived cells.

So if the ligand's stop (loxP) is excised, mCherry is expressed. The receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, the mouse would show mCherry fluorescence but not eGFP.

But the question is why there's no green signal. So the answer would be that the lox2272 stop wasn't excised, preventing eGFP expression.

But why wasn't it excised? Because the Cre can't recognize the lox2272 site.

So looking at the options, none directly address this. The closest option would be option D, if the stop wasn't excised because the reading frame is wrong. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If that's the case, the eGFP isn't expressed even if the stop is excised.

But then why would mCherry be expressed? Because the stop for the ligand was excised.

But the question is why eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is about the eGFP expression, not the mCherry.

Given all that, I think the most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to no eGFP expression.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing, but the CBA promoter is strong, so that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functioning, so the receptor isn't expressed, but the Western blot shows the receptor is expressed.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is after the stop cassette, so without the stop being excised, the IRES can't function, and the receptor isn't expressed. But the Western blot shows the receptor is expressed, so that can't be.

Wait, the Western blot shows that the overexpressed proteins (ligand and receptor) are present. So the construct is working for the ligand and receptor, but not for the fluorescent proteins.

So the problem is solely with the eGFP expression.

In that case, perhaps the stop cassette isn't being excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Which would mean that the lox2272 site isn't being recognized by Cre.

But why would that happen? Because the lox2272 site is in a different orientation, or the Cre doesn't recognize it.

But I'm not sure.

Given the options, I think the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely certain.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and a receptor, with fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP) fused to them. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites flank the fluorescent proteins, allowing Cre to excise them and enable independent expression of the ligand, receptor, mCherry, and eGFP. The issue arises when no green signal (eGFP) is observed after crossing the mouse model with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between them.  
   - The receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between them.  
   - Cre recombination is expected to excise the stop cassettes, allowing independent expression of mCherry and eGFP.

2. **Western Blot Results**:  
   - The Western blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, confirming that the ligand and receptor are expressed. This indicates that the vector is functional and that Cre is active in the cells.

3. **No eGFP Signal**:  
   - The absence of a green signal suggests that eGFP is not being expressed. This could be due to the stop cassette for eGFP (lox2272) not being excised, preventing its expression.

4. **Possible Reasons for Failure**:  
   - **Option A (Paracrine Relationship)**: This is unlikely because the ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cell (autocrine relationship), as the vector is bicistronic.  
   - **Option B (Receptor-eGFP Stuck in Golgi)**: While possible, there is no evidence in the problem suggesting issues with protein trafficking.  
   - **Option C (Enhancer Missing)**: The CBA promoter is strong and does not rely on additional enhancers, making this explanation unlikely.  
   - **Option D (Receptor and eGFP Out of Frame)**: If the stop cassette is excised but the reading frame is disrupted, eGFP would not be expressed. This could result from improper vector design or misalignment during recombination.

5. **Most Likely Explanation**:  
   - The absence of eGFP expression is due to the stop cassette not being excised. This could occur if the lox2272 site is not recognized by Cre, possibly due to incorrect orientation, improper design, or inefficiency in recombination.  
   - Alternatively, even if the stop is excised, if the receptor and eGFP are out of frame, eGFP would not be expressed. This aligns with Option D.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing eGFP expression. This could result from improper vector design or failure of the stop cassette to excise correctly.
