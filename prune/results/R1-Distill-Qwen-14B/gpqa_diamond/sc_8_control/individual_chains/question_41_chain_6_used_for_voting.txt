Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. And the options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in physics, when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, especially involving light, you have to consider special relativity. But wait, what's the situation here? The glass is moving, and the light is inside it. So the speed of light in the glass is normally c/n in the rest frame of the glass, right? But here, the glass is moving, so we need to see how that affects the observed speed in the lab frame.

Wait a minute, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The usual addition like v' = v + u/(1 + vu/c²) applies when you're transforming velocities between frames. But here, the medium itself is moving, which complicates things because the speed of light isn't just additive. Oh wait, but light speed is always c in any inertial frame, according to Einstein's postulate. So does that mean that regardless of the glass's movement, the speed of light in the lab frame is still c? But wait, no, because the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Or wait, no—the question says, "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory?" So, that would be the speed as measured in the lab frame.

But wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So maybe we need to perform a velocity transformation from the glass's frame to the lab frame.

Right, velocity addition in relativity. Let me recall the formula. If an object has velocity u in the frame S' (which is moving at velocity v relative to frame S), then in frame S, the velocity u' is given by (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(c²)).

Wait, but in this case, the light's velocity in the glass's frame is u = c/n (since the index of refraction n reduces the speed). So substituting into the velocity addition formula, the observed speed u' would be (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/n)*v/(c²)).

Wait, let's compute the denominator. (c/n)*v / c² is (v)/(n c). So the denominator is 1 + (v)/(n c).

So the overall formula becomes (c/(n) + v) / (1 + v/(n c)).

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to simplify:

Numerator becomes c^2 + n v c.

Denominator becomes n c + v.

Wait, let's factor it: numerator is c(c + n v), denominator is n c + v. Hmm, but let's see, the denominator is n c + v, which is the same as the numerator's denominator. Wait, perhaps I can factor it differently.

Wait, let me think again. The initial formula after substitution is (c/n + v) / (1 + (v/(n c))).

Let me compute this:

Let me write it as [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

Because 1 is (n c)/(n c), so the denominator is (n c + v)/(n c).

So the division becomes [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify this: (c + n v) * n c / [n (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancels: (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Which is [c (c + n v)] / (n c + v )

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity addition formula. Let me double-check. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

In this case, u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the direction here. Because the glass is moving toward the observer, so let me make sure about the signs.

Wait, the direction matters. Let me set up the coordinate system. Suppose the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards them. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer.

So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v. So when we apply the velocity addition, the light's velocity in the lab frame will be higher than c/n, but wait, no, because of the direction.

Wait, perhaps I should be careful with the signs. Let's say in the lab frame, the glass is moving in the positive x-direction at velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light's velocity is u = c/n in the positive direction. So when we transform to the lab frame, the velocity u' is (u + v) / [ 1 + (u v)/c² ]

Wait, that's correct. So substituting u = c/n, we get:

u' = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c )

So, denominator is (n c + v) / (n c ), because 1 = n c/(n c), so 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v) / (n c )

So the entire expression becomes:

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ (n c )/(n c + v) ) ]

Which simplifies as:

(c + n v)*n c / [n (n c + v) ) ]  → the n cancels out.

So u' = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), which when multiplied by c would be c*(n v +1)/(n +v ). But in our case, the numerator is c (c +n v ), denominator is (n c + v ), which is c (n + v/c ). Hmm, not matching any of the options.

Wait, the options are given with c=1. So let me substitute c=1.

Then u' becomes (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Because the previous expression when c=1 is:

(1 * (1 + n v )) / (n * 1 + v ) → (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Which matches option A exactly. So the speed would be (1 + n v )/(n + v )

Wait, but wait a second. According to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, its speed relative to the lab should be c, regardless of the glass's motion. But that doesn't seem to fit with the options. Or did I make a mistake?

Wait, in this scenario, the light is inside the moving medium, which is glass. So the speed of light in the medium is c/n in the medium's frame. Then, when the medium is moving, the observed speed from the lab isn't c, because the medium itself is moving. But wait, according to special relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame must still be c, regardless of the medium's motion. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the question is a bit ambiguous. It asks, "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory?" Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the glass's rest frame. But when the glass is moving, the observer in the lab measures the speed of the light as it propagates through the moving glass. So according to relativity, the speed should still be c. But that's not among the options except for option B, which is 1 (since c=1). So why is that not the case?

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. It says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory." Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking for the speed of the light as measured in the lab, which would still be c regardless of the glass's motion. But why then are the options different? Because the options include 1, which is c, but let's see.

Wait, but that can't be. Because the light is moving through a moving medium. Wait, no. According to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light in a vacuum is c in all inertial frames. But in this case, the light is in a medium (glass). So the speed of light in the medium is c/n in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, the speed as observed in the lab frame would not necessarily be c. Because the medium is not a vacuum. So perhaps the velocity addition formula applies here.

So, going back, the speed of light in the glass's frame is u = c/n. Then, using the velocity addition formula, the lab frame will see the light moving at u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² )

Substituting u = c/n, so u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c v)/(n c²) )

Which simplifies to (c + n v)/n divided by (1 + v/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c:

Numerator becomes (c + n v) * c

Denominator becomes n c + v

So the entire expression is (c (c + n v)) / (n c + v )

Since c=1, this becomes (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

But wait, this conflicts with my earlier thought that the speed of light should always be c. But I think the confusion arises because the light is in a medium that's moving. In a vacuum, yes, the speed is c regardless. But in a medium, the speed depends on the frame. So the velocity addition formula applies here. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but another thought: If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then the light's speed as observed in the lab would be greater than c/n. But according to this calculation, it's (1 +n v )/(n + v ). Let me plug in some numbers to see.

Suppose n=1 (vacuum), and v is some value. Then the formula gives (1 + v)/(1 + v )=1. Which makes sense because in vacuum, the speed is always c, regardless of the frame. So that checks out.

Another example: n=2, v=1 (assuming c=1). Then the speed would be (1 + 2*1)/(2 +1 )=3/3=1, which is c. Hmm, that's interesting. So when n=2 and v=1, the speed is c. But why?

Wait, but for a medium with n=2, the speed in the medium is c/2. So if the medium is moving towards the observer at speed v=1, perhaps the observed speed is c. So the calculation makes sense.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about when v is significant compared to c. Suppose v is approaching c. Then, the denominator would be n +v, and the numerator 1 +n v. But that's a big number, but in reality, because in relativity, velocities can't exceed c. So perhaps the formula is only valid for v << c. But in this problem, since c=1, v can be up to 1.

Wait, but according to the calculation, when n=2 and v=1, the observed speed is 1, which is c. That makes sense because the medium's velocity is adding constructively. But in reality, according to relativity, no object can reach beyond c, so the observed speed can't be more than c. Let me check.

Wait, let's take n=1, v=0.5. Then the observed speed is (1 +1*0.5)/(1 +0.5 )=1.5/1.5=1. So correct again.

Another test: n=3, v=0.5. Then (1 +1.5)/(3 +0.5 )=2.5/3.5 ≈ 0.714, which is less than c=1. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. If the medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, wouldn't the observed speed be higher than c/n?

Wait, but when the medium is moving towards us, the light's speed in the medium is c/n. So according to the formula, the observed speed is (c/n +v)/(1 + (c v)/(n c^2) ) = (c/n +v)/(1 + v/(n c) )

But when v is positive (since it's moving towards the observer), and n is positive, the denominator is 1 + something positive, so the observed speed is (c/n + v) multiplied by 1/(something larger than 1), so the observed speed is less than (c/n +v ). But in our earlier example, when n=3, v=0.5, the observed speed is 0.714. But c/n is 1/3≈0.333, so 0.333 +0.5=0.833. 0.714 is less than that. So that makes sense.

But wait, if the medium is moving with v=0.5, and the light is moving in the same direction, the observed speed should be higher than c/n. But according to the formula, it's (1 + 3*0.5)/(3 +0.5 )= (2.5)/(3.5)=5/7≈0.714. Which is higher than c/n=1/3≈0.333. So yes, it is higher. So the formula works.

So, from all that, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum and \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. 

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), the formula becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression for \( u' \) becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify further:

\[
u' = \frac{c^2 + n v c}{n c + v}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem), this simplifies to:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. 

### Key Observations:
1. The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer is not simply \( c/n \), as the glass is moving. Instead, the relativistic velocity addition formula must be applied.
2. The result \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) ensures that the observed speed is consistent with relativistic principles and depends on both the refractive index \( n \) and the velocity \( v \) of the glass.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
