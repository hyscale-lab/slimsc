Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. So, I remember that when metal ions are in solution with ligands, they form complexes with different stoichiometries, and stability constants (beta values) tell us how stable each complex is.

The given data: [Co(II)] is 1e-2 M, [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with the order of the complex. So Co(SCN)_1 would be β1=9, Co(SCN)_2 is β2=40, and so on up to β4=16? Wait, that last one is lower than β3. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I'm getting the indices wrong.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given in order from β1 to β4. So each βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So the complexes would be Co(SCN)1^2+, Co(SCN)2^2+, Co(SCN)3^2+, Co(SCN)4^2+. But wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that's strange because β4 is lower than β3. Usually, the highest stability constant is for the most stable complex. So maybe I need to think about the complexes in terms of their stepwise formation constants.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the overall stability constant. So the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. For example, Co^2+ + SCN^- → CoSCN^+ (β1=9), then CoSCN^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2 (β2=40), and so on. So for each step, the stability constant is multiplied. So the overall β for Co(SCN)_n would be the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The overall stability constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of the stepwise formation constants. So for Co(SCN)_2, β_total = β1 * β2. Similarly, for Co(SCN)_3, β_total = β1 * β2 * β3, and so on.

But in this problem, the given β's might be the cumulative stability constants, meaning each βn is the overall constant for the complex with n ligands. Wait, that's another possibility. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 is for Co(SCN)_2, etc. So the problem says that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, but that would mean that the formation constant for the fourth complex is lower than the third. That seems odd, but perhaps the fourth complex is less stable than the third. So perhaps the most stable complex is Co(SCN)_3^2+ with β3=63.

Wait, but the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ligands. So the blue ones are probably the Co(SCN)_2 complex. But I'm not sure; sometimes different complexes have different colors. But the question specifically says the blue dithiocyanato complexes, so that's Co(SCN)_2^2+.

So the problem is to find the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in the solution. To do that, I need to calculate the distribution of all possible cobalt species in solution.

The approach I remember is to use the stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. The fractions depend on the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^- and the stability constants.

The general approach is to write the expressions for each complex's concentration, then sum them up to get the total concentration of cobalt, and then find the fraction of each complex.

The species present are: Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3^2+, Co(SCN)_4^2− (maybe?).

Wait, but with each complex having a certain number of SCN ligands. So:

- Co^2+ → [Co] = c
- Co(SCN)^+ → c1 = [Co][SCN]β1
- Co(SCN)_2^2+ → c2 = [Co][SCN]^2 β2
- Co(SCN)_3^2+ → c3 = [Co][SCN]^3 β3
- Co(SCN)_4^2− → c4 = [Co][SCN]^4 β4

Wait, but wait, for each complex, the overall formation constant is the product of the stepwise constants up to that point. So, for example, the overall β for Co(SCN)_2^2+ is β1 * β2. Similarly, for Co(SCN)_3^2+, it's β1 * β2 * β3, and for Co(SCN)_4^2−, it's β1*β2*β3*β4.

Wait, but in the problem statement, each β is the cumulative constant for that complex. Or perhaps it's the stepwise constant. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem states the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. But if β1 is the first step, β2 is the second, etc., then the overall β for each complex is the product up to that step.

So for Co(SCN)_1: β_total = β1 =9
Co(SCN)_2: β_total= β1*β2=9*40=360
Co(SCN)_3: β_total= 9*40*63= 9*40=360 → 360 *63= 22680
Co(SCN)_4: β_total= 9*40*63*16=22680 *16= 362880

Wait, but that would make the overall β for the fourth complex much higher than the third, but the given β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the given β's. Maybe each β is the stepwise formation constant for adding another ligand. So β1 is the first step, β2 is the second, etc.

So the formation of Co(SCN)_2^+ from Co(SCN)^+ and SCN^- would have a β2=40.

Wait, but then the overall β for Co(SCN)_2 would be β1*β2=9*40=360.

Similarly, Co(SCN)_3 would have β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

And Co(SCN)_4 would have β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but that would mean the β for the fourth complex is very high, which seems more plausible since the more ligands, the more stable the complex (but that may not always be the case, but for the sake of this problem, let's proceed).

So, the plan is to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the total cobalt concentration.

The total cobalt concentration is c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^2+] + [Co(SCN)_3^2+] + [Co(SCN)_4^2−].

But wait, [Co^2+] is the free ion, and the others are the complexed forms.

So, let's denote the free [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentration of each complex can be written in terms of x and the ligand concentration (which is 0.1 M for SCN^-).

Wait, but wait, the ligand concentration is given as [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. But in reality, when complexes form, the free [SCN^-] would decrease. However, considering that the concentration is quite high (0.1 M), and the formation of complexes might consume some of it, but for an approximate calculation, perhaps we can assume that [SCN^-] remains approximately 0.1 M because the ligand is in excess. I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption, but given the problem statement, I think that's what we'll have to do.

So, assuming [SCN^-] = 0.1 M for all complexes.

So, [Co(SCN)]^+ would be x * [SCN] * β1 = x * 0.1 * 9.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ = x * (0.1)^2 * β1*β2 = x * 0.01 * 360.

[Co(SCN)_3]^2+ = x * (0.1)^3 * β1*β2*β3 = x * 0.001 * 22680.

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− = x * (0.1)^4 * β1*β2*β3*β4 = x * 0.0001 * 362880.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the β for each complex is the product of all the stepwise βs up to that point. Alternatively, perhaps each given βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth ligand, so the overall β for each complex is the product up to that n. So for Co(SCN)_1, β1=9, Co(SCN)_2, β_total=9*40=360, Co(SCN)_3, 9*40*63=22680, Co(SCN)_4, 9*40*63*16=362880.

So, the fractions:

Each complex's concentration is x multiplied by [SCN]^n multiplied by the β_total up to n.

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = x * (0.1)^n * (β1 * β2 * ... βn).

Wait, but wait, no. Because for each step, the complexation is stepwise. So the expression for each complex is:

For Co(SCN)_1: [Co(SCN)] = β1 * [Co][SCN]

For Co(SCN)_2: [Co(SCN)_2] = β1 * β2 * [Co][SCN]^2

Similarly, Co(SCN)_3: β1 * β2 * β3 * [Co][SCN]^3

And Co(SCN)_4: β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * [Co][SCN]^4

So, the concentrations of each complex can be written as:

c1 = β1 * x * (0.1)

c2 = β1 * β2 * x * (0.1)^2

c3 = β1 * β2 * β3 * x * (0.1)^3

c4 = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4 * x * (0.1)^4

And the free [Co^2+] is x.

Now, the total cobalt concentration is x + c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 = 1e-2 M.

So, let's compute each term numerically.

Compute each c1, c2, etc., in terms of x.

c1 = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x

c2 = 9 *40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x

c3 = 9 *40 *63 *x * (0.1)^3 = 22680 x * 0.001 = 22.68 x

c4 =9 *40 *63 *16 *x * (0.1)^4 = 362880 x * 0.0001 = 36.288 x

Wait a minute, let's compute each step:

Compute β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute c1: β1 * x * [SCN] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9x.

c2: β1*β2 * x * [SCN]^2 = 9*40 x * (0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x.

c3: 9 *40 *63 x * (0.1)^3 = 9*40=360, 360*63=22680; 22680 * x * 0.001 = 22.68 x.

c4: 9*40*63*16 x * (0.1)^4 = 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880; 362880 x * 0.0001 = 36.288 x.

So, total [Co] = x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68 x +36.288 x = x (1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288) = x * (1 + 0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468).

So, x * 64.468 = 1e-2 M.

Solve for x: x= (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Now, with x known, compute each concentration:

c1=0.9x ≈ 0.9 *1.551e-4 = 1.396e-4 M.

c2=3.6 x ≈ 3.6 *1.551e-4 ≈ 5.583e-4 M.

c3=22.68 x ≈22.68 *1.551e-4 ≈ 3.522e-3 M.

c4=36.288 x ≈36.288 *1.551e-4 ≈ 5.623e-3 M.

And x is 1.551e-4.

Now, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complexes, which is c2.

So, the fraction of Co(SCN)_2 is c2 / (x + c1 + c2 + c3 +c4) → but wait, the denominator is the total [Co], which is given as 1e-2 M. Wait, but since x is the only free Co^2+, and the complexes are all part of the total, maybe I can just compute c2 divided by the total [Co].

Wait, the total [Co] is 1e-2 M, so each concentration is a part of that.

So, the percentage is (c2 / (1e-2)) * 100%.

c2 is approximately 5.583e-4 M.

So, (5.583e-4 / 1e-2) *100% = (5.583e-4 / 0.01) *100 = (0.05583) *100 = 5.583%.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. The options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%. Hmm, that's way off.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement. Let me read it again.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Are these the overall stability constants for each complex, or the stepwise constants?

Wait, perhaps I was wrong in using the product of all previous βs for the complex concentrations. Maybe each βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth ligand. So, the formation of Co(SCN)_n would have the overall constant as the product of β1 to βn.

Alternatively, perhaps each βn represents the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n.

Wait, but that can't be because β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. So, perhaps the scenario is that the most stable complex is the third one, and the fourth is less stable, perhaps due to some other factors.

Wait, but regardless, perhaps I should proceed with the initial assumption that βn are the stepwise constants, and the overall β for each complex is the product up to that n.

Wait, but when I did that, the c2 ended up being about 5.58e-4, which is 5.58% of the total, but that's not matching any options. So maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the βn given are the overall stability constants, not the stepwise. So, for each complex:

Co(SCN)_1: β1=9 → [Co(SCN)] = β1 [Co][SCN]

Co(SCN)_2: β2=40 → [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co][SCN]^2

Wait, but no, that can't be because the overall β for Co(SCN)_2 would be higher than Co(SCN)_1. Wait, perhaps each βn is the overall constant for the complex with n ligands.

So, for Co(SCN)_1: β1=9 → [Co(SCN)] = β1 [Co][SCN] =9 x *0.1.

Co(SCN)_2: β2=40 → [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 x (SCN^-)^2 =40 x (0.1)^2.

Co(SCN)_3: β3=63 → [Co(SCN)_3] =63 x (0.1)^3.

Co(SCN)_4: β4=16 → [Co(SCN)_4] =16 x (0.1)^4.

But wait, if that's the case, then the β for Co(SCN)_4 would be lower than Co(SCN)_3, which is 63. So in this case, the fraction would be computed as:

Total [Co] = x + 9*0.1 x +40*(0.1)^2 x +63*(0.1)^3 x +16*(0.1)^4 x.

Compute each term:

x = x

c1=9*0.1 x=0.9x.

c2=40*(0.01)x=0.4x.

c3=63*(0.001)x=0.063x.

c4=16*(0.0001)x=0.0016x.

So sum is x +0.9x+0.4x+0.063x+0.0016x = x*(1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646).

So 2.3646 x =1e-2 → x =1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.228e-3 M.

Hmm, that's a higher x than before. Now compute each:

c1=0.9x=0.9 *4.228e-3 ≈3.805e-3.

c2=0.4x ≈1.691e-3.

c3=0.063x ≈2.66e-4.

c4=0.0016x≈6.76e-6.

Wait, the total is 4.228e-3 +3.805e-3=8.033e-3; plus 1.691e-3=9.724e-3; plus 2.66e-4=9.99e-3; plus 6.76e-6≈1.000676e-2, which is close to 1e-2.

Now, the percentage of Co(SCN)_2 is (c2 / 1e-2) *100 = (1.691e-3 /1e-2) *100 = 16.91%.

Looking at the options, D is 16.9%. So that's a possible answer.

But wait, wait, why did I get a different answer when making a different assumption about the stability constants?

Ah, because I initially thought that βn were the stepwise constants, but if the problem states that each βn is the overall constant for the complex with n ligands, then the calculation proceeds as above and gives approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But the options include 38.1% as option C, 42.3% as A, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the βn are the overall constants. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each complex's concentration using the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the general formula for the fraction of each species.

In the case where each βn is the stepwise formation constant for the nth ligand, the overall β for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn.

So, for Co(SCN)_2, β_total=β1 * β2=9 *40=360.

Similarly, Co(SCN)_3 is β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

And Co(SCN)_4 is 9*40*63*16=362,880.

Then, the concentration of each complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n] = [Co^2+] * [SCN^-]^n * β_total_n.

So, the fractions are calculated as:

Each fraction f_n = ([Co] * (0.1)^n * β_total_n) / ([Co] * (sum over all m of (0.1)^m * β_total_m) )) 

Wait, because [Co^2+] is x, and summing over all species.

So, the denominator is x * sum_{m=0}^4 (0.1)^m * β_total_m.

But β_total_0 is 1 (since it's [Co^2+]).

So, the fraction for Co(SCN)_n is ( (0.1)^n * β_total_n ) / sum_{m=0}^4 (0.1)^m * β_total_m.

Wait, but wait, this seems correct.

Let me compute each term's numerator and sum them.

Compute each (0.1)^n * β_total_n for n=0 to 4.

n=0: (0.1)^0 * β0 = 1 *1=1.

n=1: 0.1 *9=0.9.

n=2: 0.01 *360 =3.6.

n=3:0.001 *22680=22.68.

n=4:0.0001 *362880=36.288.

Sum these up: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So, the fraction for n=2 (dithiocyanato, Co(SCN)_2) is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0557, or 5.57%.

But that's nowhere near the options given. So this approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the βn given are the overall constants for each complex, not the stepwise. So for Co(SCN)_1, β1=9 → [CoSCN^+]=9 [Co][SCN].

Co(SCN)_2: β2=40 → [Co(SCN)_2]=40 [Co][SCN]^2.

Co(SCN)_3: β3=63 → [Co(SCN)_3]=63 [Co][SCN]^3.

Co(SCN)_4: β4=16 → [Co(SCN)_4]=16 [Co][SCN]^4.

So, the concentrations are:

c0 = [Co] = x.

c1 =9 x (0.1).

c2=40 x (0.1)^2.

c3=63x (0.1)^3.

c4=16 x (0.1)^4.

So, the sum x +9x(0.1) +40x (0.01) +63x (0.001) +16x (0.0001) =1e-2.

Compute each term:

x =x.

c1=0.9x.

c2=40 *0.01 x=0.4x.

c3=63 *0.001 x=0.063x.

c4=16 *0.0001 x=0.0016x.

So, sum is x +0.9x+0.4x+0.063x+0.0016x= x*(1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646).

So, 2.3646 x =1e-2 → x= (1e-2)/2.3646 ≈4.228e-3.

Now, the concentration of Co(SCN)_2 is c2=0.4x=0.4*4.228e-3 ≈1.691e-3.

The percentage is (1.691e-3 /1e-2)*100=16.91% → which is option D (16.9%).

So, the correct answer would be D.

But wait, when I assumed the βn are the overall constants, I get about 16.9% which is option D.

Another alternative is that the βn are the stepwise constants, but then the scenario gives a percentage of about 5.5%, which isn't any of the options.

So, perhaps the correct approach is that the given βn are the overall constants for each complex.

Hence, the answer should be D) 16.9%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)₂²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants and concentrations. The problem specifies that the stability constants β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16 represent the overall stability constants for the complexes Co(SCN)₁⁺, Co(SCN)₂²⁺, Co(SCN)₃²⁺, and Co(SCN)₄²⁻, respectively. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Concentrations of Complexes**:
   The concentration of each cobalt complex is given by:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = [\text{Co}] \cdot [\text{SCN}^-]^n \cdot \beta_n
   \]
   where \( [\text{Co}] \) is the free cobalt ion concentration, \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), and \( \beta_n \) is the stability constant for the complex with \( n \) ligands.

   - Free cobalt ion: \( [\text{Co}] = x \)
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_1^+] = 9x \cdot 0.1 = 0.9x \)
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] = 40x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4x \)
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^{2+}] = 63x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063x \)
   - \( [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}] = 16x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016x \)

2. **Total Cobalt Concentration**:
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
   \[
   [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = x \cdot (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x \cdot 2.3646
   \]
   Given \( [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), we solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.228 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

3. **Concentration of Co(SCN)₂²⁺**:
   Using \( x \approx 4.228 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \), the concentration of Co(SCN)₂²⁺ is:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] = 0.4x = 0.4 \cdot 4.228 \times 10^{-3} \approx 1.691 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Percentage of Co(SCN)₂²⁺**:
   The percentage of Co(SCN)₂²⁺ is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}]}{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{1.691 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \right) \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)₂²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.

Answer: D
