Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric provided is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit strange. I remember that the metric usually has components that define the geometry, like in spacetime. But here, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which makes me think of a sphere's equation, maybe? Because x² + y² + z² = r², but here we're missing z.

Wait, so the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), so maybe this is a two-dimensional surface? Or is it embedded in three dimensions? I'm not entirely sure, but the metric is written in terms of dx² and dy², so it's a two-dimensional metric. But pseudosphere—oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface in Anti-de Sitter space or something similar. Or maybe it's a 2D surface with negative curvature.

Wait, but the question mentions a pseudosphere of radius r=2. I think the pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere is finite, right? Like how a sphere has a finite area. But wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere (which is a tractricoid) has finite area but infinite surface area? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about the metric. The given metric is:

ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²)

Let me see. The denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)). So 4 is (2)^2, so the denominator is like 2² - (x² + y²). So the condition is x² + y² < 4. So this is a metric defined for points where x² + y² < 4. So it's a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But the metric coefficients are functions of x and y.

Wait, this seems similar to the metric of a sphere, but with a negative curvature. Because if I have ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + dθ²), where f(r) is some function, that's a metric for a surface with constant curvature. For a sphere with radius a, the metric in polar coordinates is ds² = a² (dr² + r² dθ²), but here the function f(r) would be a. But in our case, the metric is different.

Wait, but in our case, the metric is written as [32/(4 - (x² + y²))](dx² + dy²). So it's dx² + dy² scaled by 32/(4 - (x² + y²)). But for a sphere, the metric in polar coordinates (r, θ) would be something like ds² = (a²/(r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's when you have a sphere-like scaling.

Alternatively, maybe this metric is for a hyperbolic space. In 2D, hyperbolic space can be represented in several coordinate systems, like the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk has a metric ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk (r < 1). Comparing that to our metric, which is 32/(4 - (x² + y²)) times (dx² + dy²). Oh, wait, because if x² + y² = r², then 4 - r² is the denominator, which would be 4*(1 - (r/2)^2). So perhaps the metric is that of a hyperbolic space with a different curvature.

So the Poincaré disk has a metric where the curvature is negative. The area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is finite. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, but perhaps when we're talking about the area in the metric given, it's a 2D surface with hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. So, I think the area of a pseudosphere is 4π, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the area is 8π, but I don't remember exactly.

Wait, let me approach this from another angle. If the metric is given in terms of x and y, but the area is to be computed, perhaps we need to compute the area using the metric. So the area element would be sqrt(det g) dx dy.

The metric tensor g in this case is diagonal, with components g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant det g is (32/(4 - r²))², where r² = x² + y².

So the area element dA = sqrt(det g) dx dy. But sqrt of (32/(4 - r²)) squared is 32/(4 - r²). So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

So the total area would be the integral over all x and y where x² + y² <4. So the area A is the integral over the disk of radius 2 of [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ, since in polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ.

So let me set up the integral:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this step by step. First, the integral over θ is straightforward; it's 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Hmm, let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du)/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / u ] dr = 32 ∫ (u=4 to u=0) [ (1/u) * (-du/2) ) ]

Which is 32 * (1/2) ∫ (u=4 to 0) (1/u) (-du) )

Wait, the integral ∫ (u=4 to 0) (1/u) (-du) is the same as ∫ (u=0 to4) (1/u) du.

So the integral becomes 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du = 16 [ ln u ] from 0 to4.

Wait, but ln u evaluated at u=0 is negative infinity. So this integral diverges. That would mean the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. How can the area be infinite for a pseudosphere? Or is it because the metric is singular at r=2 (the edge of the disk), leading to infinite area?

Wait, in the case of the Poincaré disk model, the area is finite. The metric there is [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), and the area of the entire hyperbolic plane would be infinite, but a pseudosphere is a finite area surface. But perhaps when the radius approaches 2 in this metric, things diverge.

Wait, but in the given metric, when r approaches 2, the denominator (4 - r²) approaches zero, making the area element blow up. So that suggests that the area is actually infinite. Which would make the answer D) +infty.

But wait, the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps r=2 isn't the edge, but perhaps this is a different parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the integral. Let me check.

Wait, the integral we have is 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du. So that's 16 [ln u] from 0 to 4. At u=0, ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral is 16 (ln4 - (-infty)) which is positive infinity. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but if the pseudosphere is a finite area surface, this result contradicts that. Hmm. So why is this the case?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric. Maybe the given metric isn't for the whole space, but a part of it. Or perhaps the coordinates are not covering the entire pseudosphere. Wait, another thought: perhaps the given metric is for a sphere in a particular space, but the area ends up being finite or infinite.

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because I'm mixing up the area of the surface in 3D space with the area computed via the metric. The metric given is a 2D metric, so the area computed via it would be the intrinsic area of the 2D surface. But if the metric has a singularity at r=2, which is the boundary of the disk, integrating up to r=2 would give an infinite area.

So in this case, the area is infinite. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty, so that would be the answer.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is defined for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2. The metric represents a 2D surface with hyperbolic geometry, as the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) suggests a constant negative curvature.

To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we calculate the area element \(dA\) using the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric is diagonal, with components \(g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). In polar coordinates (\(r, \theta\)), where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), the determinant of the metric is:

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - r^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area \(A\) is obtained by integrating \(dA\) over the disk of radius 2:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \, r \, dr.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 32 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, (-du) = 32\pi \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln u\) approaches \(-\infty\) as \(u \to 0\). This indicates that the area is infinite. The singularity at \(r = 2\) (where the denominator \(4 - r^2\) approaches zero) causes the area element to blow up, leading to an infinite total area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.
