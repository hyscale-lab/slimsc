Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. Let me see if I can break this down step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Hittig reaction, but wait, no, actually, the Hittig reaction uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyllithium. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, red phosphorus with iodine is part of theWolff-Kishner reaction. No, wait, that's for ketones. Hmm, wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI could be used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a deoxygenation reaction. Wait, no, red phosphorus with HI is often used for the substitution of hydroxyl groups in alcohols. Oh right! The Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but wait, that's for ketones to alkanes. No, red phosphorus and HI is for the reduction of ketones or aldehydes? Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where an ester or acid is converted. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the starting compound first.

Looking at the IR and NMR data given for Compound X. Let's start with the IR.

IR Data:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: That's a broad peak, probably an OH stretch. But wait, in which region? Alcohols are usually around 3300-3500, maybe. But this is a broad peak, which could suggest an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Because O-H in carboxylic acids are usually broader and appear around 2500-3300. Wait, but 3400-2500 is a range, so maybe it's an aliphatic OH, like an alcohol. Alternatively, could it be an amide or something else? No, probably not. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Esters, ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids. Since 1720 is a bit higher than a ketone (which is around 1700-1750), esters also around there. Wait, but if there's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 cm-1, but often a bit lower. Wait, 1720 might be more ester or aldehyde. Hmm.

- 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1: These are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring, perhaps substituted.

So putting that together, maybe the compound has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, perhaps an ester or acid. If the IR has a broad peak in 3400-2500, which could be an O-H, but is it a carboxylic acid or an alcohol? Also, there's the 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester or maybe a ketone.

Looking at the NMR now.

1H NMR:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very downfield peak. A broad singlet. That's characteristic of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 10-12 ppm. But the description says it's a broad singlet. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid O-H. Or perhaps an aldehyde. Alternatively, an acidic proton like in a phenol? No, phenols are usually around 5-7 ppm. So maybe 10.5 is a carboxylic acid O-H.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with substituents in the para positions. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. The coupling would be two doublets for para substituents, like two substituents opposite each other. So in the NMR, when two substituents are para, each set of protons (like two protons next to each substituent) would split into a doublet. So perhaps an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions, but wait, each substituent is in the para, but the protons would be on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent in position 4, so the ring has substituents in positions 1 and 4? Wait, no, that would not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent in position 1 and another in position 4 of a benzene ring. Wait, perhaps it's attached to a benzene ring, with substituents in the meta positions? No, because then the coupling would be different. Wait, the integration is 2H each, so maybe two substituents on the ring, such as two groups that cause splitting into doublets.

Wait, the 8.0 ppm is a d (doublet) integrating for 2H. Similarly, 7.2 is a d for 2H. So perhaps a para-disubstituted benzene ring. For example, if the substituents are in positions 2 and 5 (but that's meta), but wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other. So for example, substituents in positions 1 and 4. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so substituents in 1 and 4 would actually be adjacent if the ring is drawn with substituent in position 1 and 4, which would be across from each other.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is in position para, so if you have a substituent at position 4, the ring would have protons at positions 2 and 6 as one set, and positions 3 and 5 as another. But that's getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent in position 4, and another group attached elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with an ester group or a ketone. Let me think about the NMR.

Looking for other peaks:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for 1H. Maybe a CH group adjacent to something, perhaps a carbonyl. Like in a CH2CH2 group, but it's a multiplet.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet for 2H. Maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 or a carbonyl.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating for 3H. That's probably a CH3 group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group (since the splitting is a doublet), or maybe a CH2CH3.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for 3H, which is typically a terminal CH3 in an ethyl group.

Putting this together: The NMR suggests an aromatic ring (the peaks around 7-8 ppm) with substituents, and then a chain attached. The 0.9 triplet suggests an ethyl group (CH2CH3), the 1.4 doublet suggests a CH(CH3) group, perhaps. Let me try to imagine the structure.

So perhaps the structure is an aromatic ring with an ester group attached, or maybe a ketone. Wait, but the IR has 1720, which could be an ester (around 1740 typically, but can vary) or a ketone (around 1700-1750). Wait, another thought: 1720 is often in the range for an ester or a ketone. But the presence of a carbonyl in the NMR?

Wait, in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is that a proton attached to a carbonyl, like an aldehyde? No, because aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. But a carboxylic acid O-H is around 10-12, but that's a broad peak. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, let me think again. If it's a benzoic acid, the O-H would be around 10-12, which matches the 10.5 peak. Then the 1720 cm-1 in IR would be the carbonyl of the acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, but can vary. Alternatively, maybe the IR peak is from an ester, in which case the O-H from the acid would be missing. But then why the 10.5 peak in NMR?

Wait, perhaps the compound is a benzyl ester, but then the O-H would be from an alcohol, which might not appear at 10.5. Hmm.

Alternative approach: Let's try to interpret the NMR in more detail.

The aromatic region: two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if you have a substituent in position 4, the adjacent protons (positions 3 and 5) would be one set, and the opposite protons (positions 2 and 6) would be another. Wait, so if the substituent is in position 4, then the protons in positions 3 and 5 (para to substituent) would be equivalent and show as a doublet, and the protons in 2 and 6 would be another set, also equivalent.

So, for example, if substituent is in position 4, the NMR would show two doublets. The coupling between the protons would lead to a doublet. So let's say the substituent is at position 4, making it a para-substituted benzene. So the substituent is at position 4, and perhaps the other substituents are part of a side chain.

In the NMR, the aromatic peaks are 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). The downfield shift suggests that the substituent is electron-withdrawing. For example, a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester, would cause the ring protons to be downfield.

So, the substituent at position 4 is likely an electron-withdrawing group, which could be a carbonyl group. So maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent at position 4, which is a carbonyl-containing group, like an ester, ketone, or acid.

Now, looking at the other NMR signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Could be a carboxylic acid O-H, but that's a broad signal. If the compound is a benzoic acid, that would make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but that's a bit lower than typical.

Wait, but if it's a benzoic acid, the OH would be around 10, and there would be no ester carbonyl, but a carboxylic acid carbonyl at around 1700 cm-1. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is higher. Hmm, maybe that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzophenone or an aryl ester.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an ester group. So the structure would be something like Ph-CO-O-R. But then the carbonyl would be an ester, which would be around 1720, matching the IR. The O-H in the IR would be from an alcohol, but in that case, maybe another part of the molecule.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 peak is a singlet and broad. Could that be something else?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone. So the structure is, say, 4-phenylbutan-2-one or something. But the aromatic signals would be different.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a phenyl ester. For example, methyl benzoate would have a carbonyl at about 1700, but let me think about the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene. So, like Ph-CO-R, where R is some alkyl chain.

Wait, let's look at the other NMR peaks again:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for 1H. Maybe a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, like in R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Or perhaps a CH group next to an oxygen.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet for 2H. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl or CH.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): Doublet for 3H, which is a CH3 attached to a CH group, perhaps in an isopropyl group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): Triplet for 3H, which is likely a terminal CH3, like in CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the chain seems to be CH2CH3 (from the triplet), attached to a CH2 (from the multiplet at 1.7), which is attached to a CH (from 2.9), which is attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, that would make a structure like Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, but the NMR doesn't quite add up.

Alternatively, considering the CH3 at 1.4 ppm doublet, which is a CH(CH3) group. So perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, maybe it's Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-2. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. No, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH which is attached to something else. So perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, let me think about the numbers. The CH at 2.9 ppm (1H), CH2 at 1.7 (2H), CH3 at 1.4 (3H, d), and CH2CH3 at 0.9 (3H, t). So the chain is probably CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be a pentyl group? No, that's four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps it's a branched chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that would have a CH(CH3)2 group, which would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups attached to the same carbon. But in the NMR, the CH3 is at 1.4 (d) and 0.9 (t). So maybe it's a chain with an ethyl group and an isopropyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-O-R, where R is an ethyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. For example, the substituent is a propyl group where the middle carbon is attached to another CH3. So perhaps it's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- something.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, that would have a CH(CH3)2 group. The NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If it's an ester, then the structure would be Ph-O-CO-R. But that would have an O-Phe-O-R structure, but I don't see how that would fit the NMR.

Wait, let's try to think of the substituent as a propyl group with a branch. For example, the substituent is (CH2)2CHCH3.

Wait, the NMR shows:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): This is a terminal CH3, like CH2CH3.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): This is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is maybe part of an isopropyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then the CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups, but in the NMR, we have a doublet at 1.4, which suggests a coupling with one neighboring proton. So that's more like a CH(CH3)- group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. No, that seems too long.

Wait, another approach: The coupling between the 1H at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) and the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) suggests a chain. Let's think about a four-carbon chain. For example:

Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would have more than four carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a straight chain: Ph-CO-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2. But then the CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet, which isn't matching the NMR.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to think about the possible options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the question is about the product after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So first, I need to identify what Compound X is, and then determine what the product would be after that reaction.

Wait, the reaction conditions: red phosphorus and HI. Oh! I think I remember now. When an alkyl halide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a substitution reaction. Wait, no, actually, that's the hydrolysis of alkyl halides. Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction for the reduction of carbonyl groups. Oh wait, no, the Wolff-Kishner is for converting carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) into methylene groups, using hydrazine, then heating with strong base and P. But in this case, it's red phosphorus and HI. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, not HI. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a deoxygenation of an ester or a ketone. For example, if Compound X is an ester, perhaps the reaction reduces it to an alkane.

Wait, but wait, another thought: in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, alkyne oxides can decompose, but that's probably not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think that when an acid (like a carboxylic acid) is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can lead to the elimination of the acid group. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, all are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings. So perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl group to a methylene group.

Wait, for example, if Compound X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester), the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce it to a CH2 group.

Wait, but the options don't show any carbonyl groups. Let me look again.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a carboxylic acid.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a substituted toluene.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Again, a substituted toluene.

So, the product is either another substituted benzene or a benzoic acid.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Let me think about the reactivity again. Red phosphorus and HI are often used for the dehydrohalogenation of alkenes, but more likely, the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps it's the formation of an ylide? No, I think that's in the Hittig reaction with triphenylphosphine and alkyl halides. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction, such as an SN2, but without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But then, why use red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, another thought: when a ketone is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can undergo a reaction called the Arndt-Eistert synthesis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a di-iodination, but that's probably not the case here.

Hmm, perhaps I should go back to identifying Compound X first. Let's try again.

Looking at the NMR:

The aromatic ring is para-substituted with an electron-withdrawing group. So substituent is at position 4.

The substituent is likely a carbonyl group, maybe as part of an ester, ketone, or acid.

The other parts of the NMR suggest a chain attached to the carbonyl.

Looking at the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), that's a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, 0.9 is a terminal CH3, the 1.4 is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2. So perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, because then the CH(CH3)2 would be a singlet. But the 1.4 is a doublet, which suggests coupling to one proton. So perhaps it's CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, because that would have more protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Hmm.

Wait, the substituent is probably a sec-butyl group. Let's think: a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- no, that's not right. Let me think: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to something. Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's say the substituent is Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, maybe it's Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2. No, that would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So that would be a isopropyl group attached to a CH2 group.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's try to think about the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Benzoic acid would have a carbonyl group (around 1700 cm-1 in IR), which matches the 1720 cm-1 (close enough). The O-H in the IR would be from the carboxylic acid (broad peak around 3400-2500 cm-1). The NMR would have a peak around 10.5 ppm for the O-H, which matches.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be Ph-COOH with a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the substituent is -C(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring. Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, no, wait: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, no. Let me clarify.

The structure of a sec-butyl group is: the butyl group is four carbons, with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The structure of a sec-butyl group is:

The butyl group is four carbons: the first carbon is attached to the ring, the second is connected to the first, and the third is a branching point. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, I think I'm getting tangled. Let me write it as:

The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. No, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH2CH(CH3)-. Hmm, perhaps it's best to think of the substituent as:

The substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group, but that would be a tert-butyl group if branching is on the third carbon. Maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely the terminal CH3 of an ethyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, perhaps part of a branch. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group. So perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that would have more carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch. Let me think: the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's five carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), but that would be a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with an isopropyl branch. So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. That would be a neopentyl group. But the NMR shows a triplet for the terminal CH3, a doublet for the CH3 attached to CH, and a multiplet for the CH and CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So, substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3) attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but then the NMR would show the CH(CH2CH3) as a multiplet, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), which would be a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent as a propyl group with a methyl branch on the middle carbon.

So, substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)-. But then the structure would be Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)- something.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- something.

Wait, perhaps it's Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2. That would have a CH(CH3)2 group, which would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups. But the NMR shows a doublet at 1.4 ppm for the CH3, which suggests coupling with one proton.

So, perhaps it's Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. That would make a four-carbon substituent. Let's see:

Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

In this case, the CH(CH3) is attached to a CH2CH3. The structure would be Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, that's a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

In the NMR, the CH2CH3 (ethyl) group would have the triplet at 0.9 ppm (the terminal CH3), and the CH2 next to it would be a quartet, but the NMR doesn't show a quartet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH3. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. So, Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. That would be a four-carbon substituent.

In this case, the CH(CH2CH3) would have the CH3 at 1.4 ppm as a doublet (coupled to the adjacent CH), and the CH2CH3 would have the triplet at 0.9 ppm.

The CH2 next to the carbonyl would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), and the CH2 between carbonyl and CH would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). That seems to fit.

So, the structure would be Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, because that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3. No, that doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is Ph-CO-CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. So, it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, in that case, the substituent would be -(CH2)CO-Ph-CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's not right.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to match the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring, and the ring has a COOH group.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-Ph(CH2)2CH(CH3)

Wait, no, the substituent is at position 4. So, the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches the data.

The substituent (sec-butyl) would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring. No, wait, that's not correct. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is:

The butyl group has four carbons, with the attachment on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So, substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

But wait, that would be a pentyl group if it's four carbons. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons, so:

The substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. So, it's a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon group, which would make the substituent a sec-butyl group.

In this structure, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 group adjacent to the ring would be around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), perhaps.

- The CH(CH2CH3) group would have the CH3 groups at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Wait, but in the substituent -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, the CH2 next to the ring would be attached to the CH, which is attached to the CH2CH3.

So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the NMR would have:

- The CH(CH2CH3) group: the CH would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

The CH2CH3 group would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The CH2 adjacent to the ring would be at around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), perhaps.

So that matches the NMR data.

So, in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ring, and the ring also has a carboxylic acid group. So, the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Looking back at the IR data, the 1720 cm-1 peak would correspond to the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid, which is around 1700 cm-1. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm is the O-H of the acid.

So, Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, what happens when a benzoic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, I'm trying to recall. When a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can lead to the formation of an alkyl iodide. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, but that usually requires heat.

Alternatively, another possibility: the reaction could reduce the carboxylic acid group. But how?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used in the reduction of nitriles to amines, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a substitution reaction where the carboxylic acid is converted into a methyl group. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester, but in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a decarboxylation to form an alkane.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a dehydration of the acid to form an acid chloride, but that's not likely with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an iodide. For example, the acid could lose CO2 and form a methyl iodide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. Carboxylic acids can react with iodine in presence of a base to form acyl iodides, but I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI would do that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more straightforward. Red phosphorus and HI are used for the synthesis of alkenes via the dehydrohalogenation, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the -OH of the acid is replaced by I-, but that would require activating the acid.

Wait, another approach: when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and a reagent like red phosphorus, it can lead to the elimination of the acid group and the formation of an alkene. For example, in the presence of a base, the acid can lose CO2 to form an alkyl iodide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methylene group. For example, using a strong reducing agent like HI and red phosphorus, the -COOH group is converted into -CH2-.

Wait, if the -COOH is reduced to -CH2-, then the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which is option B or D.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Structure would be a benzene ring with substituents at 1 and 4 positions: isobutyl and methyl.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So substituents at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl).

But in our case, the substituents after reaction would be only the sec-butyl group and possibly a methyl group if the COOH is reduced.

Wait, if the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid to a methylene group, which would be -CH2-.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, that's a benzene with substituents at 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl). That would require the COOH group to lose the oxygen and become a methyl group, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH into a methyl group, which would require decarboxylation.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be the formation of an acid chloride, which would then undergo some reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an iodide. For example, replacing the -OH with iodide, but that's not likely under these conditions.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are often used together in the presence of alcohols to form alkenes via elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction converts the carboxylic acid into an aldehyde. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, where the acid is converted into a methyl iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the acid to a primary alcohol. But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. For example, the acid could react with HI to form RCOI, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the acid into an ester, but I don't see how that would happen with red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure about the product after the reaction. But given the options, perhaps the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid group to a methyl group.

So, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the -COOH is converted to -CH2-.

Wait, that would form 4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would have substituents at positions 1 and 4: sec-butyl and methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction reduces the acid group to a methyl group, and the substituent would be at position 4. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, substituents at 1 and 4: sec-butyl and methyl. That would suggest that the reaction added a methyl group to the ring in addition to the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, which then undergoes some reaction, but I don't see that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by iodide, but that's not likely.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the Staudinger reaction with azides, but that's probably not relevant here.

Hmm. Maybe the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an alkyne. But I don't know.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzyl iodide. If the -COOH is converted into an I, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, I think I'm stuck, but perhaps I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

The product options are either substituted benzoic acids or substituted toluenes.

If the reaction is the reduction of the -COOH group to a CH2 group, then the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group where the COOH was, and the substituent.

But looking at the options, option C is the starting material, and the others are different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent but transforms the acid into something else. If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the esterification of the acid, but that would require an alcohol, which isn't present.

Hmm. Given the time I've spent and the uncertainty, perhaps I should make an educated guess. The product is likely to be option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Because the reaction conditions might be reducing the acid group to a methyl group, and the substituent remains as sec-butyl in another position.

Wait, but the starting substituent was at position 4, and the product would have substituents at 1 and 4. That doesn't make sense unless there's some ring reorientation.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent shifts positions during the reaction, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the -COOH into a methyl group, leading to a structure where the substituent is at position 4, and the methyl is at position 1.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to go with option C as the starting compound, and the reaction reduces the -COOH to a CH2 group, leading to 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, but that's not in the options. Therefore, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH of the acid is replaced by something else.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI can be used as a reducing agent for esters. For example, an ester can be reduced to a primary alcohol. But in this case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

In that scenario, the product would be RCOI, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should conclude that the starting material is option C, and the reaction reduces the -COOH to a CH2 group, leading to 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituent and the product is option C. But that doesn't make sense because the reaction is given.

Wait, maybe the reaction is just a substitution where the -COOH is converted into a methyl group, leading to option D, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl).

Thus, the product would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data to deduce the structure of Compound X.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a broad O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, suggesting a substituted benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of the O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, suggesting a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, indicating a terminal CH₃ group in an ethyl chain.

From the NMR data, the compound is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The para-substituted benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. In this case, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is reduced to a methyl group (-CH₃). The sec-butyl group remains unchanged. The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, where the substituents are at positions 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl).

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.
