Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

So the scenario is Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because that improves electron microscopy by reducing scattering, right? But even with that vacuum, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1, based on factors like the sample compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. Mean free path... Oh right, the mean free path (λ) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on the pressure and temperature. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. So lower pressure means longer mean free path, higher pressure means shorter.

But then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is, why? The temperature is the same, so T hasn't changed. So what else affects λ?

Wait, the presence of the electron beam could be a factor. The electron beam is high-energy, right? At 1000 kV, that's 1,000,000 eV. Those electrons are moving really fast. Do they interact with the gas molecules in the compartment?

I think when high-energy electrons pass through a medium (even a vacuum with some gas), they can cause various effects. One possibility is that the electrons collide with the gas molecules more frequently because the electrons are moving so fast. Wait, but electrons are much lighter than gas molecules, so maybe the collision dynamics are different.

Wait, another idea: when the electron beam is on, it might ionize the gas molecules. Because when the electrons hit the gas molecules, they can knock off electrons from the gas atoms, creating ions. So the gas becomes ionized. Now, ions have a different behavior. They can be influenced by electric fields, but in a vacuum, maybe the main effect is that their mean free path changes.

Wait, but how does ionization affect the mean free path? Well, when gas molecules are ionized, they can form charged particles which might have different interaction rates. Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam increases the rate of collisions for the gas molecules because the electrons transfer energy or something.

Alternatively, maybe when the electron beam is on, it causes more frequent collisions between the gas molecules. Because the beam's presence could increase the number of collisions, thus reducing the mean free path.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The mean free path is calculated based on the number of collisions. Under normal conditions, when just considering the gas molecules' movement, λ1 is determined. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules have more interactions because the beam's electrons are hitting them, which could change the effective collision rate.

Wait, but wait. The mean free path usually considers collisions between gas molecules. The electron beam's electrons are not part of the gas, so maybe the gas molecules don't collide with the electrons in the same way. Or do they?

Alternatively, perhaps when the electron beam is on, it causes the gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which might change their effective cross-sectional area for collisions. Or maybe the gas molecules become charged, affecting their movement and thus the mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam interacts with the gas, causing some of the gas molecules to be removed from the compartment. But the question says that the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path in the presence of an electron beam. The electrons in the beam are moving at a high speed. The gas molecules might be moving slowly in comparison, but collisions between the gas and the electrons could contribute to the effective scattering. Or perhaps the electron beam's presence increases the effective pressure, leading to a shorter mean free path.

But wait, the mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. So if something increases the effective n or σ, λ would decrease.

Another thought: when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being excited or ionized, which could change the effective cross-section σ. For example, if the gas becomes ionized, the ions have a larger cross-section for collisions (since they have a charge, maybe they interact more strongly), thus increasing σ and reducing λ. Or perhaps the ions have a different behavior, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause the gas to heat up, but the question says the temperature remained the same. So that's probably not the case.

Wait, but Mike's observation is about the mean free path based on electron scattering. So the electrons in the beam are scattering off the gas molecules, and he's measuring that. So perhaps the presence of the electron beam affects the scattering process, leading to a different mean free path for the electrons.

Wait, but the mean free path for the gas molecules is λ1 when the beam is off, and λ2 when the beam is on. Or is it that the electrons are scattering off the gas, which affects their path? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused about whose mean free path is being discussed. The question says that Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2, so I think it's the gas molecules' mean free path that changes.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because the mean free path of the gas is determined by their own collisions, which shouldn't be affected by the presence of the electron beam unless the beam introduces additional factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to collide because the electrons are providing a source of energy. Could it be that the gas becomes more ionized, leading to a different effective pressure?

Wait, no—because the pressure is already ultra-low. The presence of the beam might cause more ionization, but ionization doesn't necessarily change the number of gas molecules; it just changes their charge. So perhaps the density n is the same, but the cross-section σ changes.

Alternatively, the electron beam might cause the gas molecules to be more likely to interact with each other. Or perhaps in the presence of the beam, the gas molecules are being "pushed" by the beam's electric field, but I don't think that's a significant factor.

Wait, another possibility: the electron beam's energy could cause the gas molecules to become excited or even break apart (if they're not noble gases), which could change their size or the number of particles. But if the gas is, say, helium, which is inert, maybe that's not the case. Or perhaps the gas is a polyatomic that breaks into smaller molecules, increasing the number density.

But the question doesn't state that the gas is being dissociated, so perhaps that's not the main factor here.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to move more, which would increase the collision rate. But the temperature is the same, so their average kinetic energy is the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the vacuum pumps to work less effectively, but the question says the temperature remains the same, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the question says temperature remains the same. So that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be ionized, and those ions are then accelerated by the electric field in the microscope, leading to more frequent collisions.

Wait, but if the ions are accelerated, their velocity could be higher, which would increase the rate of collisions, thus decreasing the mean free path.

So, if the gas molecules are ionized, their mean free path would decrease because the effective speed is higher (since ions could be accelerated by the electric field), leading to more collisions and a shorter λ. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence increases the pressure in the compartment, but that seems unlikely because the pumps are still running.

Wait, but the mean free path is calculated based on the gas's own properties. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, which could cause more frequent collisions between gas molecules. Because electrons have a small cross-section, but they might be hitting the gas atoms, causing them to move more, leading to more molecular collisions.

Wait, but the mean free path for the gas is about how often gas molecules collide with each other, not with electrons. So maybe the presence of electrons doesn't directly affect the gas's own mean free path. Then why is Mike observing a different mean free path?

Wait, perhaps the gas is getting heated by the electron beam, which would increase the temperature. But the question says the temperature remained the same. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces additional factors into the calculation of the mean free path. For example, the electron beam might cause the gas to become more ionized, which affects how the mean free path is calculated.

Wait, maybe the electron beam increases the effective pressure by causing more ion-molecule collisions. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to stick to the walls of the compartment, thus reducing the effective number of gas molecules in the compartment. But that would change the pressure, which would change λ. But the question says that the compartment's temperature remains the same, but the pressure might change?

Wait, but Mike accurately determined λ1 based on the initial conditions. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the effective pressure increases, perhaps because the beam is somehow causing more gas to be present or because the gas is being heated. But the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature is the same, so pressure might not change, but perhaps the ionization changes the way the mean free path is calculated.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be in a different state, effectively increasing the effective density. Or perhaps the electron beam causes X-ray emission, which further ionizes the gas, but I'm not sure how that affects the mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to have a higher effective pressure because the beam's energy is depositing into the gas, heating it. But if the temperature remains the same, then maybe the pressure doesn't change. So λ1 and λ2 would be the same, which would suggest option B, but that's probably not the case because the question says Mike found a change.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for the electrons is being considered, not the gas. Oh! Wait, perhaps Mike is observing the mean free path of the electrons through the gas. So the electrons' mean free path would be affected by the gas.

Wait, the question says Mike made an observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. So perhaps he's measuring the mean free path for the electrons, not the gas.

Wait, that changes things. So λ1 was determined based on the gas's own properties. But when the electron beam is on, he's measuring the mean free path of the electrons through the gas, which would be different because electrons have a different mass and charge.

So, the electron's mean free path depends on the gas's properties and the electron's energy. The formula for the electron's mean free path would involve the electron's velocity and the gas's properties.

But wait, the mean free path for the electron beam would be λ_e = (something involving electron's velocity and gas's properties). If the gas's pressure is the same, then the mean free path for electrons would be longer or shorter than that of the gas molecules.

Wait, but the mean free path for the electrons (λ_e) would be longer than that for the gas molecules (λ1), because electrons are much lighter and thus move faster. So the time between collisions for electrons is longer, meaning a longer mean free path.

But in the problem, Mike found that when the electron beam is on, the mean free path (presumably of the electrons) is no longer λ1. So perhaps λ2 is the electron's mean free path, which is longer. But the options given are about λ2 compared to λ1.

Wait, but the question says Mike determined the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ1) based on sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. Then, upon initiating the electron beam, he observed that the mean free path (presumably of the electrons) was λ2. But the question says he's considering the mean free path based on the electron scattering, which is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to have a shorter mean free path. But why?

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be more likely to collide because the electrons' energy is transferred to them, causing more frequent collisions. Or perhaps the electron beam's presence introduces more ion-molecule collisions, which could affect the mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas is being heated by the electrons, but the temperature remains the same, so that can't be it.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is off, the mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, the electrons are passing through, and their presence could cause the gas molecules to scatter more, thereby reducing the mean free path. But this is for the electrons, not the gas.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the mean free path is of the electrons. So without the beam, the electrons don't exist, so λ1 is the gas's mean free path. When the beam is on, the electron's mean free path is λ2.

But then, the question says that Mike connected the pumps to create a vacuum, and some gas particles remained. He determined the gas's mean free path as λ1. But when the electron beam is on, he's observing a different mean free path (presumably of the electrons).

Wait, maybe in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules are being ionized, leading to a different effective cross-section for electron-gas interactions. So the electrons' mean free path (λ2) would be affected.

But how? Let's think about electron mean free path in a gas. The formula for electron mean free path is λ_e = ( (ε * m_e) / (2 * π * n * e^4 * lnΛ) ) )^(1/2) ) * something, but I'm not very sure. Alternatively, the mean free path for electrons depends on the electron's velocity and the interaction cross-section with the gas.

But the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to become ionized. So, when the gas is ionized, the electrons are already charged, and perhaps the scattering cross-section changes. Or maybe the presence of free electrons in the gas affects the scattering.

Wait, but the gas was already in a vacuum, so perhaps the presence of the beam's electrons doesn't significantly change the gas's ionization state. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization increases the effective number of collisions for electrons, thereby reducing their mean free path.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to summarize.

The question is: When Mike starts the electron beam, the mean free path (λ) changes from λ1 to λ2. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2?

Options are whether λ2 is greater, less than, same as λ1, etc.

If the mean free path is for the gas molecules, and the electron beam doesn't affect their own collisions, then λ2 would be the same as λ1, but the question says Mike noticed a change, so option B (λ2=λ1) would be a discrepancy, which is probably not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path for the gas is the same (λ1) but the electron's mean free path changes. But the question says Mike is observing the mean free path based on electron scattering, implying he's measuring the electron's mean free path.

So, if the electron's mean free path is λ2, then how does it compare to λ1?

Electrons are much lighter than gas molecules, so their velocity is much higher. So their mean free path would be longer than that of the gas molecules. Because, higher velocity means covering more distance between collisions. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Wait, but the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules when the electron beam is on. Or is it about the mean free path of the electrons?

The question says, "he found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2, even though the sample compartment temperature remained the same."

So, the mean free path of the gas molecules is now λ2. Why would this change when the electron beam is on?

Hmm, perhaps because the presence of the electron beam causes ionization of the gas, which could change the effective cross-sectional area for collisions between gas molecules.

Wait, but if the gas becomes ionized, the ions have a larger charge, so perhaps the cross-section for collisions increases, which would decrease the mean free path (because more collisions happen). So λ2 would be less than λ1, making λ2 < λ1, which would be option C.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, maybe the effective pressure increases because the ions are more likely to stick to the walls or something? But I'm not sure.

Another angle: when gas is ionized, it becomes charged, and perhaps the ions are more likely to stick to the walls of the compartment, reducing the number of gas molecules in the compartment. If the number density n decreases, the mean free path λ increases, because λ ~ 1/(n σ), so lower n leads to higher λ.

Wait, that's possible. If the ionized gas is being pumped out more effectively, or if they stick to the walls, then n decreases. So λ would increase.

So that would make λ2 > λ1, which would correspond to options A or D.

But how does the presence of the electron beam cause ions to stick to the walls? Well, in an electric field, charged particles (ions) would be accelerated towards the walls. The electron beam is at a high voltage, so the sample is under a strong electric field. So the ions could be accelerated towards the walls and pumped out more effectively, thus reducing the number of gas particles in the compartment.

This would lower the pressure, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Wait, but earlier when Mike set up the vacuum, the pressure was already <1e-9 Torr. If ionized gas is being removed more effectively, the pressure would decrease even further. But the question states that the pumps are running, so perhaps the pressure doesn't change significantly. Or perhaps in the presence of the beam, the pressure effectively changes.

Alternatively, the mean free path is determined by the gas in the compartment. If the electron beam causes gas to be removed, the number density decreases, n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1, making option A (λ2 >=1.22 λ1) correct.

Wait, but why 1.22? That number is familiar... Oh, that's the factor for the mean free path when considering the velocity component along the direction of motion. Wait, no, wait. The mean free path formula sometimes involves sqrt(2) factors when considering random versus directed motion.

Wait, the mean free path λ is defined as the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The mean speed is v_avg = sqrt(8 k T / (pi m)). The mean free path is λ = (v_avg) * τ, where τ is the mean time between collisions.

Alternatively, another formula for λ is (k T)/(√2 π d² n), where d is the collision diameter, and n is the number density. So, if n decreases, λ increases.

So, if the electron beam causes n to decrease, λ increases. Hence, λ2 > λ1.

So, the correct answer would be that λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1. But why 1.22?

Wait, 1.22 is approximately sqrt(2)/sqrt(3/2) ? No, wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the mean free paths under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps 1.22 is the factor when considering the mean path in a particular direction, like in a beam.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.22 factor comes into play when considering the motion of a molecule versus the beam. Wait, I'm not sure. But the question isn't about that, it's about λ2 compared to λ1.

So, if λ2 is greater than λ1, then the options are A or D. Option A says λ2 >=1.22 λ1, and D says λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1.

But why would λ2 be 1.22 times λ1? That would be the case if the beam somehow caused the gas to have a lower effective pressure by a certain amount, but I don't have the exact data.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.22 factor is a distractor, and the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so option A.

Wait, but another possibility. When the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ions could be accelerated away from the sample due to the electric field, thus reducing their number in the compartment. This would lower the pressure, hence increase λ2.

So, the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the square root of pressure (since λ ~ 1/sqrt(P)), because P = n R T, and λ ~ 1/(n σ), and σ is proportional to d^2, where d is the diameter. So, lower pressure (n decreases) leads to longer λ.

But the initial pressure was already very low. So, if the presence of the electron beam leads to a further decrease in pressure, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So, the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >=1.22 λ1, which would be correct if λ2 is significantly larger. But why 1.22?

Wait, maybe the mean free path for the electron beam is considered, not the gas. Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas, and their mean free path is being measured. Since electrons are much lighter, their mean free path would be longer than that of the gas molecules.

The mean free path for electrons would be λ_e = ( (m_e) / (m) )^(1/2) * λ1, where m is the mass of the gas molecule. Electrons are about 1/1836 the mass of a proton, so much lighter. So their mean free path is much longer.

Wait, but the question states that Mike found the mean free path was λ2, which would be the electron's mean free path. So, λ2 is longer than λ1, so option A would be correct, as it says λ2 >=1.22 λ1.

But I'm not exactly sure about the 1.22 factor. Alternatively, perhaps the 1.22 factor isn't relevant, and the answer is λ2 > λ1, so option A is correct.

Wait, another thought: the mean free path of the electron beam in the gas is given by λ_e = ( (m_e) / (m) )^(1/2) * λ1, since electrons are lighter. So if the gas is, say, helium (mass ~4 atomic mass units), then m_e/m ~ (9.1e-31 kg) / (4 * 1.66e-27 kg) ) ≈ 9.1e-31 / 6.64e-27 ≈ ~1.37e-4. Taking square root, sqrt(1.37e-4) ≈ 0.0117. So λ_e ≈ 0.0117 λ1. Wait, that would make the electron's mean free path much shorter, which doesn't make sense because electrons are moving faster.

Wait, no wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. The mean free path for electrons should be longer because they're moving faster. Let me think about the formula again.

The mean free path λ is given by λ = (v * τ), where v is the velocity and τ is the mean time between collisions.

For gas molecules, the velocity v is sqrt(8 k T / (pi m)), where m is the mass. For electrons, their velocity is much higher, because they are much lighter. So v_e is much larger than v_m (molecule velocity).

But the time between collisions τ depends on the number density n and the collision cross-section σ. So for electrons, τ_e = 1/(n σ_e), where σ_e is the cross-section for electron-gas interactions.

Assuming σ_e is much smaller than the cross-section for gas-gas interactions (since electrons are much smaller), then τ_e would be longer, but v_e is much larger. So overall, λ_e = v_e * τ_e would be much larger than λ_m (the mean free path of the gas molecules).

Wait, so if λ_m is the gas's mean free path, then λ_e would be much longer. So λ2 (electron's mean free path) > λ1 (gas's mean free path). So the correct option would be A) λ2 >=1.22 λ1.

But why 1.22? Hmm, perhaps the factor comes from the fact that the electrons are moving much faster, so even if the cross-section is smaller, the product could be larger. Alternatively, perhaps 1.22 is a standard factor used in certain contexts.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path of electrons in a gas is given by the formula λ_e = ( (m_e)/(m) )^(1/2) * ( (2 π)/(sqrt(3)) )^(1/2) * λ1.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1.22 factor is when considering the velocity component. For example, the mean free path for a directed beam (like the electron beam) would be λ * sqrt(2), because in a random direction, the component along the beam is larger.

Wait, no, I think in the case of a beam, the mean free path would be the same as the gas's mean free path in their own motion. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, when considering the electron's motion in a particular direction, their mean free path is longer because their velocity is higher. The factor could be sqrt(m_e / m), which is much larger than 1, so λ_e would be much larger than λ1.

But the question is about the observed λ2. If Mike is measuring the mean free path of the electrons, then λ2 would be much larger than λ1, which would make option A correct (λ2 >=1.22 λ1).

But this is getting a bit too speculative. Another way: if the mean free path for the gas is λ1, and when the electron beam is on, the mean free path for the electrons is λ2, which is longer, then the answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1.

So looking at the options, option A says λ2 >=1.22 λ1, which would be the case if λ2 is significantly larger. Option C says λ2 < λ1.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber when an electron beam is introduced. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path of the gas molecules as λ1 under UHV conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a new mean free path, λ2, which is different from λ1. The task is to determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Basics**:  
   The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. For gas molecules, it depends on the number density (n), collision cross-section (σ), and is inversely proportional to the pressure (P). The formula is:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot n \cdot \sigma}
   \]  
   where \( n = \frac{P}{kT} \), \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:  
   When the electron beam is introduced, it interacts with the gas molecules. High-energy electrons (1000 kV) can ionize the gas, creating charged particles (ions). Ionization can alter the effective pressure in the chamber because ions may stick to the walls or be removed more efficiently by the vacuum pumps. This reduces the number density (n), which increases the mean free path (\( \lambda \propto 1/n \)).

3. **Comparison of λ1 and λ2**:  
   - Initially, λ1 is determined based on the gas molecules' collisions under UHV conditions.  
   - When the electron beam is on, ionization likely reduces the effective number of gas molecules in the chamber, lowering the pressure and increasing the mean free path. Thus, λ2 > λ1.  

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (λ2 ≥ 1.22λ1)**: This suggests that λ2 is significantly larger than λ1. The factor 1.22 could arise from differences in the effective pressure or ionization effects, leading to a notable increase in λ2. This is plausible.  
   - **Option B (λ2 = λ1)**: This implies no change in the mean free path, which contradicts the problem statement that λ2 ≠ λ1.  
   - **Option C (λ2 < λ1)**: This would require an increase in the collision rate or pressure, which is unlikely under the given conditions since the electron beam reduces gas density.  
   - **Option D (λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1)**: This suggests a small increase in λ2, but the problem implies a more significant change due to ionization effects, making this less likely.

### Conclusion:
The presence of the electron beam likely reduces the effective number of gas molecules in the chamber, increasing the mean free path. This makes λ2 greater than λ1, and the factor 1.22 could represent the magnitude of this increase. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
