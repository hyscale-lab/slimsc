Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and see what it's about. Hmm, it's about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The question is about the orbital periods of two planets around two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Both planets are similar in mass to Neptune. 

The key data given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I think I need is the one that relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the orbital period (P), mass of the planet (M_p), mass of the star (M_s), and the distance between them (a). 

Wait, but wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:
K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2 * π * a)^(1/3)) ) ? Hmm, maybe that's not the exact equation. Alternatively, I think it's more like K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_s)^(2/3) ) ). Or perhaps another approach. Maybe it's better to recall the relationship between K and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is K = ( (M_p) sin i ) / (M_s^(2/3) ) * ( (G * P ) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Let me think about the relationship between K, the velocity, and the orbital period. Since the two stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), maybe I can find a way to relate their orbital periods based on the RV shifts.

Wait a second, the RV shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_s + M_p) * (P/(2π))^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) ) / c

But wait, that might be complicated since P is the period. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) ) * ( (1/(2π a c) ) )^(1/3) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a more straightforward way is to consider that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_s) * (1/P)^(1/3) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe another approach. The RV shift is caused by the Doppler effect, so K (the semi-amplitude) is the star's velocity. The star's velocity in its orbit is given by v = (2π a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbit). But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4π² a³) / (G(M_s + M_p)) ). Since M_p is much less than M_s, M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So, P² ≈ (4π² a³)/(G M_s), so a³ = (G M_s P² )/(4 π² ). 

Then, the star's velocity is v = (2 π a ) / P. Substituting a from above: a = [ (G M_s P² )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ). So,

v = (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_s P² )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute that. Let me write it as:

v = (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_s P² ) ]^(1/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Simplify the denominator: (4 π² )^(1/3 ) = (2^2 π² )^(1/3 ) = 2^(2/3) π^(2/3)

So,

v = (2 π / P ) * (G M_s )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / ( 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) )

Combine terms:

Let's compute 2 π / (2^(2/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) π = 2^(1/3) π.

Similarly, P is in denominator with exponent 1, and multiplied by P^(2/3) → P^( -1 + 2/3 ) = P^(-1/3 )

So,

v = [ 2^(1/3) π ] * (G M_s )^(1/3) / ( 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) ) * P^(-1/3 )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me factor this out more clearly.

Wait, let's take it step by step.

v = (2π a) / P

But a = [ (G M_s P²/(4 π² )) ]^(1/3 )

So, substituting a into v:

v = (2π / P ) * [ (G M_s P²)/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me write this as:

v = (2 π) / P * [ G M_s P² / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Factor out the exponents:

= (2 π) / P * ( G M_s )^(1/3) P^(2/3) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Now, let me combine the terms:

The denominator in the fraction is (4 π² )^(1/3 ) = 2^(2/3) π^(2/3 )

So,

v = (2 π) / P * ( G M_s )^(1/3) P^(2/3) / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) )

We can separate the factors:

= 2 π (G M_s )^(1/3) P^(2/3) / [ P * 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify the exponents:

P^(2/3) / P = P^(2/3 - 3/3 ) = P^(-1/3 )

2 / 2^(2/3) = 2^(1 - 2/3 ) = 2^(1/3 )

π / π^(2/3 ) = π^(1 - 2/3 ) = π^(1/3 )

Putting it all together:

v = [2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) ] * (G M_s )^(1/3) / P^(1/3 )

Which can be written as:

v = [ (2 π G M_s ) ]^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 )

Wait, wait—let me check the exponents again. Because 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3) is (2 π )^(1/3 ), and (G M_s )^(1/3 ), so together:

v = (2 π G M_s )^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 )

Which can be combined as:

v = [ (2 π G M_s ) / P ]^(1/3 )

Hmm, but wait, let's check units. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me re-express the initial substitution.

Wait, another approach. Let me think of the formula for K. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_s + M_p )^(1/3) ) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2 π c) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the exact formula. From memory, the formula is:

K = ( (v) ) = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_s + M_p) )^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / (2 π c )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P )^(1/3) )

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should instead use Kepler's third law and the relationship between velocity and period.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4 π² a³) / ( G (M_s + M_p) )

Since M_p is much less than M_s, this becomes:

P² ≈ (4 π² a³) / ( G M_s )

So, a³ = ( G M_s P² ) / (4 π² )

The star's velocity is v = 2 π a / P

Substituting a:

v = (2 π / P ) * [ ( G M_s P² )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me compute that:

v = (2 π / P ) * ( G M_s )^(1/3) * P^(2/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Simplify the denominator: (4 π² )^(1/3 ) = 2^(2/3) π^(2/3)

So,

v = (2 π ) / P * ( G M_s )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / ( 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) )

Which becomes:

v = (2 π / P ) * ( G M_s )^(1/3) P^(2/3) / ( 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) )

Now, let's handle the factors:

2 π / (2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) * π^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3) π^(1/3)

P in the denominator is P^(1), multiplied by P^(2/3) gives P^(2/3 - 3/3) = P^(-1/3 )

So,

v = [2^(1/3) π^(1/3) ] * ( G M_s )^(1/3) / P^(1/3 )

Which can be written as:

v = [ (2 π G M_s ) ]^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 )

Hmm, that's better. So, v is proportional to ( G M_s )^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 )

But wait, in this equation, v is the velocity of the star, which is what the RV method measures. So, K (the semi-amplitude) is proportional to ( G M_s )^(1/3 ) / P^(1/3 )

But wait, G and M_s are constants for both stars, since both stars have the same mass as the Sun. So, the ratio of K between the two planets will depend only on the cube root of 1/P.

Wait, but K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3 )

So, if K1 is for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then K1 / K2 = (1/P1^(1/3 )) / (1/P2^(1/3 )) ) → (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

But the question gives the shifts as K1 =5 milliangstroms, K2=7. So, K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, wait. So, K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3 ), which implies that if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is larger than P1? Or wait, let me think again.

Wait, because K is proportional to (something ) / P^(1/3 ). So, higher K implies lower P, because when P increases, 1/P^(1/3 ) decreases, hence K would decrease.

Wait, no. Let me think: Let's say P increases.

If P increases, P^(1/3 ) increases, so 1/P^(1/3 ) decreases, so K would be smaller.

So, higher K implies smaller P.

So, in this case, K2 is higher than K1 (7 >5). So, planet 2's period is shorter than planet 1's? Hmm, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if K2 is higher, P2 is shorter, which would make P2 / P1 < 1. So, the ratio would be less than 1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but let me double-check. K1 =5, K2=7, so K2/K1=1.4.

Since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3 ), then K2/K1 = (1/P2^(1/3 )) / (1/P1^(1/3 )) ) = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

So,

K2/K1 = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 ) → 7/5 = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(7/5 )^3 = P1 / P2

So,

P1 / P2 = (7^3)/(5^3 ) = 343 / 125 ≈ 2.744

So,

P2 = P1 / (343/125 ) ) = P1 * (125/343 )

Which is approximately 0.364 times P1.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So, the period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1. So, the orbital period of planet 2 is 0.36 times that of planet 1. So, how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's? It's shorter, so the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? 

So, if P2 is 0.364 * P1, then P2 is 0.364 times P1, which is shorter than P1. So, the period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1. So, the ratio P2/P1 is approximately 0.364 → 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse the ratio. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3 ), so higher K means shorter period. So, planet 2 has a higher K (7) than planet 1 (5), so planet 2's period is shorter than planet 1's.

So, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. Since it's shorter, it's less than one times, so the answer is 0.36 times, which is option A.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula earlier. Let me re-express the relationship.

We have K ∝ (1/P )^(1/3 ). So, K = C * (1/P )^(1/3 ), where C is a constant depending on other factors (like M_s and G, which are the same for both stars).

So, (K1)/(K2) = (1/P1 )^(1/3 ) / (1/P2 )^(1/3 ) ) → (K1/K2) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Because:

K1 = C / P1^(1/3 )

K2 = C / P2^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = (1/(P1^(1/3 )) ) / (1/(P2^(1/3 )) ) ) → K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So, (5)/(7 ) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So, (5/7 )^3 = (P2/P1 )

So, 125/343 ≈ 0.364 → P2 = 0.364 * P1.

So, P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So, the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364. So, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So, the period of planet 2 is 0.36 times that of planet 1. So, how many times longer is planet 2's period than planet 1's? It's 0.36 times, which is shorter. So, the answer is 0.36 times. Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

So, the correct answer should be option A.

To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we use the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., 

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}.
\]

Given that the two stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the constant of proportionality is the same for both planets. Let \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) represent the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of planet #1 and planet #2, respectively. The ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4.
\]

From the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), we can write:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{P_1^{1/3}}{P_2^{1/3}}.
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is **0.36**.
