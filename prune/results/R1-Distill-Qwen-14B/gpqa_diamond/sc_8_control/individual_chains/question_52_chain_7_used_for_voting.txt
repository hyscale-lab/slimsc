Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures when spots are present and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting. So spots are cooler regions, right? They make the star appear dimmer and cooler overall.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes. So I need to find the ratio (R) when there are no spots divided by the ratio when there are spots.

Wait, the ratio is N1/N2, the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2. And this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star is spotted, R decreases, meaning R when no spots (R1) is higher than when there are spots (R2). So the factor is R1/R2 = ?

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the ratio of N1/N2. So N1/N2 would be the inverse of that. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ).

But in this problem, the transition between the two levels is at a wavelength of about 1448 Å. So that's in the near-ultraviolet or perhaps far-ultraviolet? Well, the exact wavelength might not be directly relevant unless it's about the ionization or something else. But the key is that this transition corresponds to a particular energy difference between the levels.

Wait, the energy difference (delta E) can be calculated using the relation E = hc/lambda. But maybe I don't need to compute the exact value because it might cancel out in the ratio.

Wait, but let me think. The problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels when the star's temperature changes. When spots are present, the overall Teff drops, but wait, the spots are cooler, but the photosphere that's not spotted is hotter? Wait no, the overall Teff decreases when spots are present. So the entire photosphere's effective temperature is lower.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the spots are cooler regions. So part of the star's surface is cooler (spots) and the rest is at 6000 K? Or is the entire photosphere's average temperature lower?

Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the total emission is such that the effective temperature is 5500 K. So the average temperature is lower, but the non-spotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spots are at a lower temperature, say T_spot.

But maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can model the average temperature as 5500 K, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the effective temperature as if it's the temperature of the entire photosphere, so when there are spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K.

Wait, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases, so the effective temperature (which is a blackbody measure) is lower. But the star's photosphere includes both the spotted and non-spotted regions. So the overall Teff is a combination of the two regions.

But wait, the problem states that when the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the star's overall emission is lower because 40% of the surface is darker (cooler) spots.

But for the purpose of this problem, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. So when the star has spots, the photosphere's average temperature is lower. So for the Boltzmann equation, the temperature used is the effective temperature of the photosphere, which is 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but perhaps the temperature of the photosphere in the non-spotted regions is still 6000 K, but the spotted regions are cooler, say T_spot. Then the total flux would be a combination of the two areas. But the problem is that the question says the effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So perhaps the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K, but that's a bit confusing because the star's actual photosphere isn't all at 5500 K; some parts are at 6000, others cooler.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things and treating the photosphere as being at the effective temperature. So for the calculation, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, and when it doesn't, it's 6000 K. So for the ratio N1/N2, we can use these two temperatures.

Wait, but the transition is at a particular wavelength, so the energy difference E2 - E1 is related to that wavelength. Let me think about that.

E = hc / lambda. Let's calculate delta E: E2 - E1 = hc / lambda.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light. Let me compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J s
c = 3e8 m/s
lambda is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = ?

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but each photon has that energy. But for the Boltzmann factor, we need delta E divided by k*T.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So delta E/(k*T) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T).

T is in Kelvin.

Let me compute this for T = 6000 K (no spots) and T = 5500 K (spots).

Wait, but wait, 1.373e-18 / (1.38e-23 * T) = (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 / T.

1.373/1.38 ≈ 0.995, so approximately (1e5) / T.

So for T=6000 K: 1e5 /6000 ≈ 16.667.

For T=5500 K: 1e5 /5500 ≈ 18.18.

So delta E/(k*T) is higher at lower temperatures. Because when T decreases, the denominator is smaller, so the ratio increases.

Wait, but let's get back to the ratio N1/N2.

The Boltzmann equation says N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g1 and g2 are the same, or that their ratio is 1, which I think is a reasonable assumption unless stated otherwise. So the ratio simplifies to exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, but wait, E2 is higher than E1 because the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so E2 > E1. So E2 - E1 is positive. Therefore, the exponent is positive when we have N1/N2.

So the ratio N1/N2 increases with higher T because (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so exp is smaller, so N1/N2 is smaller. Wait, no: wait, if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes smaller. So exp(x) is smaller when x is smaller. So for higher T, N1/N2 = exp( x ), where x is smaller, so N1/N2 is smaller. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ). So when T is higher, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller, so exp becomes smaller. So N1/N2 is smaller when T is higher. But wait, that would mean that when T increases, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Because if T is higher, the thermal energy is higher, so more atoms are in the higher energy level (level 2), so N2 increases, N1 decreases. So N1/N2 would decrease as T increases.

Wait, but this seems to be the opposite of what the question says. The question says that when the star has spots (lower Teff), the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Wait, no, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower, so T is lower. Let me see: when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent is bigger, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases. So N1/N2 increases when T decreases. So when the star has spots (Teff drops to 5500 K), N1/N2 is higher than when it's 6000 K.

But the question states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that's conflicting. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me clarify: the Boltzmann distribution is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So N2/N1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) when g2/g1 is 1.

So when T increases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number (since E2-E1 is positive, and we have a negative sign), so exp becomes smaller. So N2/N1 decreases as T increases.

Which means N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would increase as T increases.

Wait, that's correct. So when T increases, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which increases as T increases because (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is smaller. So N1/N2 is higher when T is higher.

Wait, wait, let's plug in some numbers. Suppose T is higher, say T doubles. Then (E2-E1)/(k T) is half as much. So exp of that is higher because as the argument decreases, exp(x) increases? No, wait, exp(x) when x is small is higher than when x is large and positive. Wait, no: for x positive, exp(x) increases as x increases. So if (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller when T is higher, then the exponent is smaller, so exp is larger. So N1/N2 ratio increases when T increases.

Wait, that makes sense because at higher temperatures, more atoms can be excited to higher energy levels. So N2 increases, but wait N1 is the lower level. No, wait, higher T means more atoms in higher levels. So N2 is higher, so N1 is lower. So N1/N2 would be lower when T is higher. Wait, this is conflicting with the previous conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I had the formula inverted. Let me get this right.

The Boltzmann equation: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when E2 > E1, the exponent is negative. So as T increases, the denominator k T increases, making the exponent less negative. So exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is higher when T is higher. So N2/N1 increases with T.

So N2/N1 increases as T increases. So N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1) would decrease as T increases.

Ah, that makes more sense. So when T is higher, more atoms are in higher energy levels (N2 increases), so N1/N2 decreases.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So I must have made a mistake in the initial steps.

Let me re-express this carefully.

Boltzmann factor: the probability of being in a higher energy state is proportional to exp( - (E)/(k T) )

So for two energy levels 1 and 2, with E2 > E1.

The ratio N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative. So exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases. So N2/N1 increases as T increases.

So N1/N2 is 1/(N2/N1) = 1 / [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) ]

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, because 1/exp(-x) is exp(x).

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) in N1/N2's formula decreases. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases as T increases, because the exponent is smaller, but positive.

Wait, no, wait. If E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive, and when T increases, this ratio becomes smaller.

So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is a positive number that increases as T decreases.

Wait, because when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp of a larger positive number is larger. Wait, no.

Wait, for T increasing, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So exp of a smaller positive number is smaller. So for example, exp(10) is much larger than exp(5). So as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases. Therefore, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which decreases as T increases.

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier conclusion. I think I'm getting confused here.

Let me take an example. Let's say E2-E1 is 10 units, k is 1 for simplicity, and T is 1000 K. So (E2-E1)/(k T) = 10/(1000) = 0.01. So exp(0.01) ≈ 1.01005.

If T is 2000 K, (E2-E1)/(k T)=5/1000=0.005. exp(0.005)≈1.00501.

So as T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp of it decreases. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ... ), so N1/N2 decreases as T increases.

Wait, that's correct. So higher T leads to lower N1/N2. So when the star's Teff is 6000 K (no spots), N1/N2 is lower than when it's 5500 K (spots).

But the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 decreases. Wait, according to this, when the star has spots (Teff lower), N1/N2 is higher. Because when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp of it is larger, so N1/N2 is larger.

But the problem statement says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That contradicts our conclusion. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T decreases, N1/N2 increases. But according to the problem, when T decreases, N1/N2 decreases. So perhaps I have the ratio inverted in my calculations.

Wait, wait. The problem says: when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 to level 2 (N1/N2) decreases.

So for the same star, when Teff is 6000 K (no spots), N1/N2 is higher than when Teff is 5500 K (spots).

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) increases, making N1/N2 larger. So when T is lower (5500 K), N1/N2 is higher. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that when T is lower, N1/N2 is lower. That's a contradiction. So what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I got the levels inverted. What if level 1 is higher energy than level 2? No, the problem says level 1 and level 2, but it's not specified which is higher. Wait, the transition is from level 1 to level 2 emitting a photon of 1448 Å. So the transition is from a higher energy level to a lower one, meaning E2 < E1.

Wait, that's a possibility. Oh wait, that's a crucial point. So when an atom emits a photon, it goes from a higher energy level to a lower one. So level 1 is higher energy than level 2. So E1 > E2. So E2 - E1 is negative.

Wait, that's a big mistake I made earlier. So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = negative. So when I plug that into the equation, the exponent becomes (E2 - E1)/(k T) = negative.

So let's go through this again.

If E1 > E2, then E2 - E1 = - (E1 - E2). So the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp( -x ) increases as x decreases. Because x is (E1 - E2)/(k T), which is positive, because E1 > E2.

Wait, let me think again. (E1 - E2) is positive, so (E1 - E2)/(k T) is positive. So exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = exp( - positive number ), which is a positive number less than one. So when T increases, (E1 - E2)/(k T) decreases, so -(positive small) is less negative. So exp(-smaller positive) is larger than exp(-larger positive).

So as T increases, (E1-E2)/(k T) decreases, so -(E1-E2)/(k T) becomes less negative. Therefore, exp(-x) increases as x decreases (since x is positive). So N1/N2 increases as T increases.

Wait, no, wait. Let me try plugging some numbers.

Suppose E1 - E2 = 10 units, k=1, T=1000 K.

Then (E1-E2)/(k*T) = 10/1000 = 0.01.

So exp(-0.01) ≈ 0.99005.

If T increases to 2000 K, (E1-E2)/(k*T)=5/1000=0.005.

exp(-0.005)≈0.99501.

So exp(-x) is larger when x is smaller. So as T increases, x decreases, so exp(-x) increases. So N1/N2 increases as T increases.

But wait, our conclusion earlier was that when T increases, N1/N2 increases. But the problem states that when T decreases (due to spots), N1/N2 decreases. Which would mean that when T is lower, N1/N2 is smaller.

But according to this, when T is lower (e.g., 5500 K), (E1 - E2)/(k T) is larger, so exp(-x) is smaller. So N1/N2 would be smaller when T is lower. Which would align with the problem statement that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases.

Ah, that makes sense now.

So correcting the earlier mistake: E2 is lower than E1 because the transition is from level 1 to level 2, with emission at 1448 Å. So level 1 is higher in energy, level 2 is lower.

So the ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E1 - E2)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, making exp(-x) larger. So N1/N2 increases as T increases.

When T decreases, (E1-E2)/(k T) increases, so exp(-x) becomes smaller, leading to N1/N2 being smaller.

So when the star has spots (lower T), N1/N2 is smaller than when it's without spots (higher T).

Which matches the problem statement.

So the question is: what's the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So factor = (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_spots.

Because when the star doesn't have spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and when it has spots, Teff is 5500 K.

So the factor is [ (g1/g2) exp( - (E1-E2)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( - (E1-E2)/(k * 5500) ) ]

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, so factor = exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k * 5500) ) - (E1-E2)/(k * 6000) ) ] )

= exp( (E1-E2)/(k) [ 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ] )

Factor = exp( (E1-E2)/(k) [ (6000 - 5500) ) / (5500 * 6000) ] )

= exp( (E1-E2)/(k) * (500) / (5500*6000) )

Let me compute the exponent.

First, compute (500)/(5500 * 6000) = 500/(33,000,000) = 5/(330,000) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So exponent is (E1-E2)/(k) * 1.515e-5.

Now, E1 - E2 is the energy difference, which is hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So E = hc/lambda = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = ?

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

So E1 - E2 = 1.373e-18 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So (E1-E2)/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) ≈ 9.95e4 ≈ 1e5 (approx 99500).

So exponent is 99500 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99500 * 1.515e-5.

Let me compute that:

99500 = 9.95e4.

1.515e-5 = 0.00001515.

Multiply them: 9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.95 * 1.515) * 1e-1.

9.95 * 1.515 is approximately 15.08.

So 15.08 * 0.1 = 1.508.

So exponent is approximately 1.508.

So factor = exp(1.508).

What's exp(1.508)? Let's calculate.

I know that exp(1) ≈ 2.718, exp(1.6) ≈ 4.953, exp(1.5) is around 4.4817.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

e^1.508.

We can compute it as e^(1.5 + 0.008) = e^1.5 * e^0.008.

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.008 ≈ 1.008038.

So e^1.508 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.008038 ≈ 4.516.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Taylor expansion around 1.5.

But for an approximate value, 4.5 is close.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which would be the factor.

So the factor by which the ratio changes (no spots / spots) is approximately 4.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the exponent calculation.

Wait, (E1-E2)/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) = (1.373 /1.38) * 1e5.

1.373 / 1.38 ≈ 0.995. So 0.995e5 = 99500.

So 99500 * (500)/(5500*6000) = 99500 * (500)/(33,000,000) = 99500 * (5/(330,000)).

5/330,000 = 1/66,000 ≈ 1.515e-5.

So 99500 * 1.515e-5 = (99500 / 66000) * (1.515e-5 * 66000) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 99500 * 1.515e-5.

99500 * 1.515e-5 = (99500) * (1.515e-5) = 99500 * 0.00001515.

Compute 99500 * 0.00001515.

99500 * 0.00001 = 0.995.

99500 * 0.00000515 = ?

First, 99500 * 0.000005 = 0.4975.

99500 * 0.00000015 = 0.014925.

Adding them: 0.4975 + 0.014925 = 0.512425.

So total is 0.995 + 0.512425 = 1.507425.

So exponent is about 1.507.

Exp(1.507) is approximately e^1.507.

e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^1.507 is e^(1.5 + 0.007) = e^1.5 * e^0.007.

e^0.007 ≈ 1.007049.

So 4.4817 * 1.007049 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.007 ≈ 4.513.

So factor is approximately 4.51.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_1 - E_2}{kT}\right)
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(E_1 > E_2\) (since the transition corresponds to emission at 1448 Å), \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference**: The energy difference between the two levels is calculated using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting the values:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Temperature Values**: When the star has no spots, \(T = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and when it has spots, \(T = 5500 \, \text{K}\).

3. **Ratio of Ratios**: The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k \cdot 6000}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k \cdot 5500}\right)}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} \left(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\right)\right).
   \]

4. **Simplifying the Exponent**:
   - Compute \(\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \cdot 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
     \]
   - Compute \(\frac{E_1 - E_2}{k}\):
     \[
     \frac{E_1 - E_2}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500.
     \]
   - Multiply:
     \[
     \text{Exponent} = 99500 \cdot 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.508.
     \]

5. **Final Factor**: The factor is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.508) \approx 4.51.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
