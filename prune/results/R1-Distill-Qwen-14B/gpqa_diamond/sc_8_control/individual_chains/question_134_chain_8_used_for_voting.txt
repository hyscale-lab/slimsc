Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the problem states that we have three solutions being mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change for this reaction.

Wait, wait. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but I guess this problem is about the specific case here.

First, I think I need to find out how much acid and base are present because the amounts will determine the extent of the reaction.

Let me break down each solution's contribution to H+ and OH- ions.

Starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

So for HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. The first dissociation is complete, giving two H+ ions per molecule. Wait, wait, no: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete, giving H+ and HSO4^-; the second is also strong, so HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-. So each mole of H2SO4 gives two moles of H+.

So for H2SO4: volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- because it's Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2OH^-.

So Ba(OH)2 volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. OH- ions from Ba(OH)2 = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. So the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

The total H+ from acids is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

The total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ and OH- reacts in a 1:1 ratio.

So the moles that will react are the smaller of H+ and OH-.

Wait, wait, let me calculate:

H+ total: 0.28 mol.

OH- total: 0.2 mol.

So OH- is the limiting reactant. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So the amount of H+ left after reaction: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid but in solution, it's fully dissociated into 2 H+ per molecule. So the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 moles. Similarly, HCl gives 0.1.

So the total H+ is 0.28.

The OH- is 0.2.

So reaction: 0.2 moles H+ + 0.2 moles OH- → 0.2 moles H2O.

But wait, the reaction is neutralization, so the heat released is based on the moles of H+ and OH- that react.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization per mole is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), since it's exothermic.

So the total enthalpy change (q) is -57 kJ/mol * 0.2 mol → q = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh wait, units are important here. The options have some in kcal and some in kJ.

Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization". So, typically, the enthalpy is per mole of reaction. But in this case, the reaction is between these specific amounts.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total heat released.

Alternatively, maybe we're considering the total moles of H+ and OH- neutralized.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again.

The reaction is acid + base → salt + water.

The neutralization enthalpy is usually given per mole of acid or base. But in this case, because there are multiple acids and a base, perhaps I should find the total H+ and OH- and see how much neutralization happens.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the moles of H+ and OH-:

Total H+ from all acids = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- from base = 0.2 mol.

The neutralization is the sum of H+ and OH- reacting in a 1:1 ratio, so the amount that can react is the minimum of H+ and OH-, which is 0.2 mol.

So 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH- will react, producing 0.2 mol of H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction would be 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have some in kJ and others in kcal.

Looking at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, if the calculation is -11.4 kJ, that would be approximately -11.4 kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is in kcal? Because 57 kJ is about 13.64 kcal (since 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 1 kJ is about 239 cal, so 57 kJ is 57,000 J. 57,000 /4.184 ≈ 13,600 cal, which is 13.6 kcal).

So, per mole, the neutralization is -57 kJ/mol or approximately -13.6 kcal/mol.

Wait, so if 0.2 moles react, q = 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.68 kcal. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused with the units.

Wait, 1 kJ is 239.006 cal. So 57 kJ is 57 * 239.006 ≈ 13,643 cal, which is 13.643 kcal.

So per mole, the enthalpy is -57 kJ/mol or -13.643 kcal/mol.

So, if 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is equivalent to approximately -2.68 kcal.

Wait, but that's not an option. Because option A is -2.72 kcal. Which is very close.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value. Let me compute 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have that. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 * 239 cal. Wait, no, wait: 1 kcal is 1000 cal. No, wait again. 1 kJ ≈ 239.006 cal. So 1 kcal is 1000 cal. So 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.71 kcal.

Wait, so 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.71 kcal. Which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal). But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is more than 11 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's compute the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the limiting reagent.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+ (since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+).

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol → Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^- → 0.2 mol OH^-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the neutralization of H+ and OH- will proceed until one is used up.

Since OH- is 0.2 mol and H+ is 0.28, the OH- is limiting. So all 0.2 mol OH- will react, consuming 0.2 mol H+.

So the reaction is 0.2 mol H+ + 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O.

The enthalpy change for this is 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

So this is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.71 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. That's a lot. So perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the total enthalpy change in kJ. So option D is -16 kJ, which doesn't match our calculation. But our calculation is -11.4 kJ, which isn't an option either.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the solution is considering only the first dissociation, but I don't think so. H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ are fully dissociated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see whether the neutralization is complete or not.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total equivalents of acid and base.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+ → 0.1 eq.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol → 0.18 eq.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 eq.

Total acid equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

Total base equivalents: 0.2 eq.

So the base is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 eq will neutralize 0.2 eq of acid.

So the neutralization is 0.2 eq, which releases 0.2 * 57 kJ (if considering magnitude) but negative because exothermic.

Wait, but the exact value is -57 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized.

So 0.2 mol * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So that would be the enthalpy change. But looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M → 0.5 *0.2=0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M → 0.3 *0.3=0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 *2 = 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL =0.2 L. 0.5 M → 0.2 *0.5=0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → gives 0.2 mol OH-.

So, that seems correct.

So, the moles of H+ and OH- are as I calculated.

So, the neutralization is 0.2 mol, leading to -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options except D is in kJ, and D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is taking the standard enthalpy of neutralization as -57 kcal/mol.

Wait, no, that would be way too high. Because 57 kJ/mol is about 13.6 kcal, but if they were using 57 kcal/mol, that would be way too much.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the exact conversion.

Wait, 1 kcal is 4184 J. 1 kJ is 1000 J. So 1 kJ = 1000 J. 1 kcal = 4184 J.

So, 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal: 57,000 /4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

So, 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 * (1000 J) = -11,400 J.

In kcal: -11,400 J /4,184 J/kcal ≈-2.72 kcal.

Ah, so that would be about -2.72 kcal, which matches option A.

Wait, but why is the enthalpy change calculated in kcal?

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ, and perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the standard value.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering only the H+ from HCl and not from H2SO4, but that doesn't make sense because H2SO4 is a strong acid and fully dissociates.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization reaction produces more than just H2O, but in this case, it's considering the formation of BaSO4 and other salts, but that would be more complicated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the neutralization includes all the H+ and OH- available, but considering the stoichiometry of the reactions.

Wait, let me think. When mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2, the reaction would be between the acids and the base.

But perhaps I should write the net ionic equation.

HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, so they will donate H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a base, providing OH- ions.

The neutralization reaction would be:

H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2O (l)

So, the total moles of H+ from both acids is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2.

The neutralization will involve 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have an option with -11.4 kJ. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ which is larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles.

Wait, let me double-check:

HCl: 500 mL (0.5 L) * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL (0.3 L) * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL (0.2 L) * 0.5 M = 0.1 mol → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So that's correct.

So, 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 OH- neutralize, producing water, releasing 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ.

But wait, the options don't have 11.4 kJ, but option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, because 11.4 kJ is approx 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72).

But option A is -2.72 kcal. So that would match.

So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait, why isn't the unit in kJ? The options have some in kJ and some in kcal. So perhaps the correct answer is option B if they're using kJ per mole.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) involved. So if we have 0.2 moles reacting, the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, none of the other options match this except perhaps option D (-16.0 kJ) is too far off.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Which is about -11,420 cal. To convert that to kJ: 11,420 cal * 4.184 J/cal = 11,420 * 4.184 ≈ 47,725 J, which is about 47.7 kJ. But that's much higher than what we calculated, so that can't be.

Wait, maybe I should convert the 11.4 kJ to kcal. 11.4 kJ * (1 kcal / 4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.72 kcal.

Ah, so 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the correct answer is A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions contributed by each solution:

1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   - Volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L, Molarity = 0.2 M  
   - Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \times 0.2 = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (strong acid):**  
   - Volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity = 0.3 M  
   - Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \times 0.3 = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   - Volume = 200 mL = 0.2 L, Molarity = 0.5 M  
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \)  
   - Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

Next, the total moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ are:  
- Total H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \)  
- Total OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O} \), which occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent (only 0.2 mol of OH⁻ is available to react), the reaction consumes 0.2 mol of H⁺ and produces 0.2 mol of H₂O.

The enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) for strong acids and bases. Therefore, the total enthalpy change is:  
\[
q = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

To convert this to kcal (1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal):  
\[
q = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 \, \text{kcal/kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Finally, comparing the calculated value to the options:  
- Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the result.  
- Other options are inconsistent with the calculations.

Answer: A
