Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, so the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state relative to a lower one. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor is involved here. 

The energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's a familiar number. 1.38e-23 J is actually the value of the Boltzmann constant k_B, because I remember k_B is approximately 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is equal to k_B multiplied by the temperature? Or wait, no. The Boltzmann factor is (ΔE)/(k_B T). 

The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)). But wait, in this case, the excitation is higher in star_1. So the ratio for star_1 would be higher. The question states that the number in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n1 = 2 * n2. 

Wait, but wait. The problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I'm assuming that the number in the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. So the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1? Or maybe I should think of it as the ratio of the excited to ground state or something else. Let me clarify.

Let me denote the populations as n1 and n2 for the two stars. The problem states that n1 (star_1) is twice n2 (star_2). So n1 = 2 * n2. 

But wait, the question says that the energy level is twice as excited, which I think refers to the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level to the lower one. So the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for each star is given by the Boltzmann factor. 

But wait, the question says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So that's exactly k_B (since k_B is about 1.38e-23 J/K). Oh, that's convenient. So ΔE = k_B.

So for each star, the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) is exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)) = exp(-1/(T/(k_B/k_B))) = exp(-1/(T/(1)) ), since ΔE = k_B. So it's exp(-1/T). 

Wait, no. Let me clarify the units. The Boltzmann equation: the exponent is (ΔE)/(k_B T). So if ΔE is k_B, then (k_B)/(k_B T) = 1/T. So the exponent is 1/T. 

So the ratio is exp(-1/(T)).

Now, for star_1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-1/T1). For star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = exp(-1/T2).

But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, meaning that the number in the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. So n1_upper = 2 * n2_upper. Or is it the ratio of the two stars that's 2? Hmm.

Wait, no. The problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So the ratio of the excited state to the lower state is higher in star_1. So for star_1, (n_upper)/(n_lower) is greater than that of star_2. Because if more atoms are excited, the ratio would be higher.

Wait, but the question says that the number in the specific energy level is twice as excited. Maybe I should model it as (n_upper)/(n_lower + n_upper) or something. Wait, perhaps no. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the ratio of n_upper to the total. No, I think the standard approach is to compare the number in the upper level to the lower level. So n_upper/n_lower is the ratio given by the Boltzmann factor.

So the problem states that in star_1, the ratio is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, (n_upper / n_lower) = 2 * (n'_upper / n'_lower), where n' refers to star_2.

But wait, the problem says star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio (n_upper) in star_1 is twice that of star_2, not considering n_lower. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k_B T1)) = exp(-1/(T1)). 

Similarly, for star_2: R2 = n2_upper / n2_lower = exp(-1/(T2)).

The problem says that R1 = 2 * R2. Because star_1 has twice as many in the excited state relative to the lower state as star_2.

So R1 = 2 R2.

Substituting the expressions:

exp(-1/T1) = 2 exp(-1/T2)

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(exp(-1/T1)) = ln(2 exp(-1/T2))

Simplify:

-1/T1 = ln(2) + ln(exp(-1/T2)) 

Which is:

-1/T1 = ln(2) - 1/T2 

Rearranging:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Hmm, but let's see. Let's write the equation:

-1/T1 = ln(2) -1/T2 

Move terms around:

1/T2 = 1/T1 + ln(2)

Wait, that's not looking like any of the options. The options involve T1 and T2 in various combinations. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up R1 = 2 R2. Let me go back. The problem says that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps it's that the number in the upper level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So n1_upper = 2 n2_upper. But according to the Boltzmann factor, n_upper is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)). 

Wait, but that's the number in the upper level. So for each star, n_upper is proportional to that exponential. So for star_1, n1_upper = a exp(-1/T1), and star_2, n2_upper = a exp(-1/T2). Wait, but no, because a could be different for each star. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio within each star is what's important. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the two populations (star_1 to star_2) is 2. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) / (n2_upper / n2_lower) ) = 2.

Because the problem says that star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. So the ratio of their ratios is 2.

So R1 / R2 = 2.

Which gives exp(-1/T1)/exp(-1/T2) ) = 2.

So exp( (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Take natural log: (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Which can be rewritten as (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Let me see the options again.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2).

Let me compute:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, yes. Because (1/T2 - 1/T1) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the equation is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which is option D.

Wait, let me confirm:

If 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2), then (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So the equation is:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Which is exactly option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation governs the distribution of atoms in energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the number of atoms in the upper energy level to the lower energy level is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, meaning \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the expressions for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{1}{T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{1}{T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. Therefore, the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the stars is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
