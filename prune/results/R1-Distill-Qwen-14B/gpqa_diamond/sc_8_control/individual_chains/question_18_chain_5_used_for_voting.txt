Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, let's see what the question gives me.

First, the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the masses aren't directly relevant here. Or perhaps they're a red herring? I'll keep that in mind but focus on the abundance data.

The given data includes [Si/Fe], [Mg/Si], [Fe/H], and [Mg/H] for both stars. Oh, right, the brackets here denote logarithmic abundance ratios relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So a [X/Y] of 0 means the ratio is the same as in the Sun.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0

And the Sun's photospheric composition is:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Let me clarify. The Sun's data says 12 + log(n_X/n_H) equals some value. So that means log(n_X/n_H) is that value minus 12.

So for the Sun:
- nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Now, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres, so (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2).

Let me think about how to approach this. I think I need to express n_Si in terms of n_Fe and n_H for each star, then take the ratio.

Let's start with Star_1.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5)

So, nFe_1 = 10^(-4.5) * nH_1

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = 10^(0.3)

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^(0.3) = (10^(-4.5) * nH_1) * 10^(0.3) = nH_1 * 10^(-4.5 + 0.3) = nH_1 * 10^(-4.2)

So nSi_1 = nH_1 * 10^(-4.2)

Now for Star_2.

[Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log(nMg/nH)_2 = log(nMg/nH)_sun → nMg_2/nH_2 = 10^(-5)

So, nMg_2 = 10^(-5) * nH_2

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^(0.3) → nSi_2 = nMg_2 / 10^(0.3)

Substituting nMg_2:
nSi_2 = (10^(-5) * nH_2) / 10^(0.3) = 10^(-5 - 0.3) * nH_2 = 10^(-5.3) * nH_2

So now, I have expressions for nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of their respective nH.

But the problem is, the hydrogen might not be the same in both stars. Wait, but how do I relate nH_1 and nH_2?

Wait, maybe I can express the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2 in terms of (nH_1 / nH_2) * (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2)

Wait, let me compute nSi_1/nH_1 and nSi_2/nH_2.

From Star_1:
nSi_1 / nH_1 = 10^(-4.2)

From Star_2:
nSi_2 / nH_2 = 10^(-5.3)

So the ratio (nSi_1 / nSi_2) = (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) * (nH_2 / nH_1)

Wait, no. Let me think: nSi_1 = (10^(-4.2)) * nH_1
nSi_2 = (10^(-5.3)) * nH_2

So the ratio is (10^(-4.2) * nH1) / (10^(-5.3) * nH2) ) = (10^(-4.2 +5.3)) * (nH1/nH2) )

= 10^(1.1) * (nH1/nH2)

But wait, do I know anything about the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2?

Hmm. The problem doesn’t give [H/Fe] or anything else. So perhaps I can assume that the total number of hydrogen is same as in the Sun? Or perhaps each star's nH is set by their own [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, wait, maybe both stars have the same [Fe/H], but in this case, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and we don't have [Fe/H]_2 given. Wait, the given data for Star_2 only includes [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H], which are 0.3 and 0, respectively. So [Fe/H]_2 isn't given, so I can't say anything about it.

Wait, perhaps I can relate nH_1 and nH_2 via the metallicity, but without [Fe/H] for Star_2, I can't. So I'm missing some info.

Wait, but maybe I can assume that both stars have the same hydrogen number density as the Sun? No, that doesn't make sense, because their [Fe/H] ratios are different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express nH in terms of nFe, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again.

For each star, the number of Fe atoms relative to H is known.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5)

Similarly, for Star_2: [Fe/H]_2 is not given. Wait, but perhaps it's not needed?

Wait, let me think: nH in a star's photosphere is related to the overall metallicity. But without knowing [H/Fe] for Star_2, I can't directly relate nH_2 to anything. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't require knowing the absolute number of H, but the ratio of Si in the two stars. Let me see.

Wait, for the two stars, I have:

nSi_1 = 10^(-4.2) * nH_1

nSi_2 = 10^(-5.3) * nH_2

So the ratio is (10^(-4.2) * nH_1) / (10^(-5.3) * nH_2) ) = 10^(1.1) * (nH_1 / nH_2)

So that's 10^1.1 ≈ 12.589 (since 10^1=10, 10^0.1≈1.258, so 10^1.1≈12.589) multiplied by (nH_1/nH_2).

But without knowing nH_1/nH_2, I can't compute this ratio. So perhaps I made a mistake in approach. Maybe I can find a way to express nH_2 in terms of nH_1.

Wait, let me think about other elements. For Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-5). Since [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, nMg_2 = 10^0.3 * nSi_2.

So nMg_2 = 10^0.3 * nSi_2 → But nMg_2 = 10^(-5) * nH_2, so:

10^(-5) * nH_2 = 10^0.3 * nSi_2 → nSi_2 = (10^(-5) / 10^0.3) ) * nH_2 = 10^(-5.3) * nH_2. Which is what I had earlier.

But that doesn't help with nH_2.

Wait, maybe the stars have the same total number of particles, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the H density through the Fe abundance.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). So nH_1 = nFe_1 / (10^(-4.5)).

Similarly, for Star_2, if I could find [Fe/H]_2, but it's not given. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Fe/H]_2 from [Mg/H]_2 = 0, and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, and [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

Wait, maybe Star_2's [Fe/H] can be determined by looking at the Solar Mg and Si.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Fe] is, let's compute that.

In the Sun, nMg/nH = 10^(-5), nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). So [Mg/Fe]_sun = log(nMg/nFe) = log( (10^-5) / (10^-4.5) ) = log(10^(-0.5)) )= -0.5.

But how does that help Star_2?

Alternatively, perhaps for Star_2, the [Fe/H] isn't needed because it's not provided, so perhaps the ratio nH_1/nH_2 can be expressed in terms of some other ratio.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Maybe I should re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem is: "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I need (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2).

From earlier:

n_Si_1 = 10^(-4.2) * nH_1

n_Si_2 = 10^(-5.3) * nH_2

So the ratio is (10^(-4.2) * nH_1) / (10^(-5.3) * nH_2 ) = 10^(1.1) * (nH_1 / nH_2) )

So unless I can find nH_1/nH_2, I can't proceed. But I don't have enough info.

Wait, perhaps I can relate nH_1 and nH_2 via the [Fe/H] of each star. Because for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which means nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun). Wait, but I think I need to model this better.

Wait, the [X/Y] notation is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = 0 implies nX/nY = nX_sun/nY_sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

Similarly, Star_2: [Mg/H] = 0 → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2.

Wait, but how does this help me find nH_1 and nH_2?

Alternatively, perhaps if I consider that the sum of the elements (hydrogen plus metals) is constant, but that's a big assumption and perhaps incorrect.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the [Fe/H] for Star_2 can be derived from the data given.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si] = 0.3. So nMg_2/nSi_2 = 10^0.3.

And for Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2 = 10^(-5) * nH_2.

So nSi_2 = nMg_2 / 10^0.3 = 10^(-5) * nH_2 / 10^0.3 = 10^(-5.3) * nH_2.

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3.

And nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1 = 10^(-4.5) * nH_1.

So nSi_1 = 10^(-4.5) * nH_1 * 10^0.3 = 10^(-4.2) * nH_1.

So, the ratio of nSi_1 / nSi_2 = [10^(-4.2) * nH_1 ] / [10^(-5.3) * nH_2 ].

Which is 10^(1.1) * (nH_1 / nH_2).

But I still have the problem of nH_1 and nH_2.

Wait, perhaps we can express the ratio of H in each star in terms of another element. But I have to figure out the relation.

Wait, for Star_2, perhaps we can find [Fe/H]_2 using the [Mg/Si] and [Si/Fe] from Star_1. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars, but that's an assumption.

Wait, but the problem doesn't state that. So that's probably incorrect.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Let me assume that the total number of particles (H + metals) is the same in both stars. That is, n_total_1 = n_total_2.

For Star_1: n_total_1 = nH_1 + nFe_1 + nSi_1 + ... other metals.

Similarly for Star_2: n_total_2 = nH_2 + nMg_2 + nSi_2 + ... other metals.

But unless I know the other metals' contributions, this approach might not work. Plus, the problem doesn't give any other elemental ratios, so that's a dead end.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the [Fe/H] for Star_2 through the [Mg/Si] ratio. Let's think.

In Star_2, nMg_2 = 10^(-5) * nH_2 (since [Mg/H] is 0).

Also, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → nMg_2 / nSi_2 = 10^0.3 → nSi_2 = nMg_2 / 10^0.3 = (10^(-5) nH_2) / 10^0.3 = 10^(-5.3) nH_2.

So, nSi_2 = 10^(-5.3) nH_2.

In Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe_1 = 10^(-4.5) nH_1.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi_1 = 10^0.3 * nFe_1 = 10^0.3 * 10^(-4.5) nH_1 = 10^(-4.2) nH_1.

So, the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 = [10^(-4.2) nH_1] / [10^(-5.3) nH_2] = 10^(1.1) * (nH_1 / nH_2).

But without knowing nH_1 / nH_2, I can't proceed. So perhaps I need to relate nH_1 and nH_2 via another element.

Wait, another approach: since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Fe/H]_sun is presumably 0 (since we're using the Sun as a reference), maybe that implies that the overall metallicity (Fe abundance) is the same as the Sun. But that would only be the case if [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which it is, so Star_1 has the same Fe abundance as the Sun. But Star_2's [Fe/H] is unknown.

Wait, but if Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, then nFe_1 = same as the Sun's nFe, scaled by nH_1. So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, if I can find [Fe/H]_2, I could relate nFe_2 to nH_2. But since I don't have [Fe/H]_2, that doesn't help.

Alternative idea: perhaps use the fact that the [Mg/Fe] ratio in the Sun is known, and in Star_2, the [Mg/Si] is given. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in the Sun, [Mg/Fe]_sun = log(nMg/nFe) = log( (1e-5) / (1e-4.5) ) = log(1e-0.5) )= -0.5.

So [Mg/Fe]_sun = -0.5.

In Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → nMg_2 = 10^0.3 nSi_2.

But I also know that in Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 → nMg_2 = 1e-5 nH_2.

So nMg_2 = 1e-5 nH_2, and nMg_2 = 10^0.3 nSi_2 → nSi_2 = 1e-5 nH_2 / 1e0.3.

Which brings us back to where we were earlier.

Wait, perhaps I can express nH_2 in terms of nSi_2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants us to assume that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars, but that's probably incorrect as that's not stated in the problem.

Wait, the problem says to use the LTE and EW method to determine the abundances, but I don't think that affects the calculation here.

Another thought: perhaps the [Fe/H]_2 can be determined via the [Si/Fe] in Star_1 and the [Mg/Si] in Star_2. Let's think.

In Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi_1 = 10^0.3 nFe_1.

In Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → nMg_2 = 10^0.3 nSi_2.

But I don't see a direct connection between these.

Wait, perhaps consider that Mg and Si are produced in the same nucleosynthetic processes (e.g., alpha elements), so their ratios might be connected.

But without knowing the exact production ratios, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express nH_2 in terms of nFe_2.

But I don't have enough info about nFe_2.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Fe/H]_2 by considering that Star_2 has [Mg/H] = 0.

Wait, in the Sun, [Mg/H] is 0, so Star_2 has the same Mg/H as the Sun. But how does that help with Fe/H?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can write expressions for the [Fe/H] of Star_2.

Wait, the [Mg/Fe] ratio in the Sun is [Mg/Fe]_sun = log(nMg_sun / nFe_sun) = log(1e-5 / 1e-4.5) )= log(1e-0.5)= -0.5.

In Star_2, [Mg/H] = 0 → nMg_2 = 1e-5 nH_2.

Also, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → nMg_2 = 1e0.3 nSi_2.

So nSi_2 = nMg_2 / 1e0.3 = (1e-5 nH_2 ) / 1e0.3 = 1e-5.3 nH_2.

In Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 → nFe_1 = 1e-4.5 nH_1.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → nSi_1 = 1e0.3 nFe_1 = 1e0.3 * 1e-4.5 nH_1 = 1e-4.2 nH_1.

So, the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2 = (1e-4.2 nH_1) / (1e-5.3 nH_2) ) = 1e1.1 (nH_1 / nH_2).

So the ratio is about 12.589 times (nH_1 / nH_2).

But without knowing the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2, I can't find the exact value.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the H density is the same in both stars? If that's the case, then nH_1 = nH_2, so the ratio would be 10^1.1 ≈ 12.589, which is option B (~12.6).

But that seems a bit of a stretch because the stars have different masses. Heavier stars might have different metallicity trends, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, it's intended to make that assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find nH_1 and nH_2 in terms of another element.

Wait, another thought: maybe the stars have the same metallicity (i.e., same [Fe/H]), but that's not given either.

Wait, in Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. So nFe_1 is same as the Sun's relative to H.

In Star_2, [Fe/H] isn't given, so perhaps it's different.

Wait, perhaps I need to find [Fe/H]_2 using the [Mg/Si] ratio.

Let me think. For Star_2, [Mg/Si] = 0.3.

In the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg/nSi) = log( (1e-5) / (nSi_sun) )

Wait, I don't know the Sun's [Mg/Si]. Hmm.

Wait, the Sun's nMg = 1e-5 nH_sun.

What about nSi in the Sun? Let me calculate it.

In the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi/nFe) = log( (nSi) / (1e-4.5) )

Wait, the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Hmm, but perhaps we can compute it from the data given.

Wait, the problem says that for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → which implies that Star_1's [Si/Fe] is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's. Because [X/Y] is the logarithm of (nX/nY) in the star minus the same in the Sun.

So [X/Y]_star = log(nX/nY)_star - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

But if Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, then nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * 10^0.3 → nSi_1 = (nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun)) * 10^0.3.

And nSi_1 / nH_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * 10^0.3.

But I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Wait, perhaps the H density in each star isn't needed because the ratio nH_1 and nH_2 will cancel out. Wait, in the ratio nSi_1 / nSi_2, if I can express both in terms of the same element, perhaps H cancels.

Wait, but I have nSi_1 in terms of nH_1 and nSi_2 in terms of nH_2. So, unless nH is same, it won't cancel.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the ratio of H isn't important because it's the same in both stars. So the answer would be ~12.6, which is option B.

But I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be determined from the fact that Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, meaning same Fe abundance as the Sun relative to H. But Star_2's [Fe/H] is unknown.

Wait, maybe I can find [Fe/H]_2 from the data given.

In Star_2, I know [Mg/H] =0 and [Mg/Si] =0.3.

So, nMg_2 = 1e-5 nH_2.

Also, nMg_2 = 1e0.3 nSi_2.

So nSi_2 = (1e-5 nH_2) / 1e0.3 = 1e-5.3 nH_2.

So, nSi_2 = 1e-5.3 nH_2.

Now, for Star_2, [Fe/Si] can be calculated if I know [Fe/Mg] or something else.

Wait, but I don't have [Fe/Si]_2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the Sun, [Fe/Mg] is known.

In the Sun, [Fe/Mg]_sun = log(nFe/nMg) = log( (1e-4.5) / (1e-5) ) = log(10^0.5) = 0.5.

So [Fe/Mg]_sun = 0.5.

In Star_2, nMg_2 =1e-5 nH_2.

nFe_2 can be expressed in terms of [Fe/H]_2.

[Fe/H]_2 = log(nFe_2/nH_2) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → log(nFe_2/nH_2) = [Fe/H]_2 + (-4.5).

So nFe_2 = nH_2 * 10^([Fe/H]_2 -4.5).

But without [Fe/H]_2, I can't proceed.

Wait, but maybe using the [Mg/Si] and [Fe/Mg] relations.

In Star_2:

nMg_2 = 1e-5 nH_2.

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / 1e0.3 = 1e-5.3 nH_2.

nFe_2 = ?

But without knowing [Fe/H]_2, I can't link nFe_2 and nH_2.

Alternative idea: perhaps Star_2's [Fe/H] can be found using the fact that in the Sun, [Fe/Mg] is 0.5.

Wait, in Star_2, if [Mg/Si] is 0.3, and [Fe/Mg] is x, then:

[Fe/Mg]_2 = log(nFe_2/nMg_2) = log( (nFe_2) / (1e-5 nH_2) )

But without knowing [Fe/Mg]_2, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps assume that the alpha elements (like Mg, Si) are enhanced relative to Fe. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the ratio of H and proceed with the calculation based on the given ratios.

Wait, going back to the initial ratio: nSi_1/nSi_2 = 10^(1.1) * (nH_1/nH_2).

But without knowing nH_1/nH_2, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the only way is to realize that the ratio of H is the same as the ratio of Fe because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Fe/H]_2 is unknown but can be connected via the [Mg/Si] and [Mg/Fe] in the Sun.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that nH_1 = nH_2, even though I'm not sure, because that's the only way to get a numerical answer.

If nH_1 = nH_2, then the ratio is 10^1.1 ≈ 12.589, which is option B.

So, the answer would be ~12.6, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the provided photospheric compositions for the Sun.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - $[\text{Si/Fe}]_1 = 0.3$ → $\log(n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_1 = 0.3$
   - $[\text{Fe/H}]_1 = 0$ → $\log(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}})_1 = \log(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\odot} = -4.5$

   From $[\text{Si/Fe}]_1 = 0.3$, we have:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_1 = n_{\text{Fe}}_1 \cdot 10^{0.3}
   \]
   Since $[\text{Fe/H}]_1 = 0$, $n_{\text{Fe}}_1 = n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot} \cdot (n_{\text{H}}_1 / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}) = 10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1$. Substituting:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_1 = (10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1) \cdot 10^{0.3} = 10^{-4.2} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1
   \]

2. **Star_2**:
   - $[\text{Mg/Si}]_2 = 0.3$ → $\log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_2 = 0.3$
   - $[\text{Mg/H}]_2 = 0$ → $\log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_2 = \log(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})^{\odot} = -5$

   From $[\text{Mg/Si}]_2 = 0.3$, we have:
   \[
   n_{\text{Mg}}_2 = n_{\text{Si}}_2 \cdot 10^{0.3}
   \]
   Since $[\text{Mg/H}]_2 = 0$, $n_{\text{Mg}}_2 = n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot} \cdot (n_{\text{H}}_2 / n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}) = 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2$. Substituting:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}}_2 = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}_2}{10^{0.3}} = \frac{10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2}{10^{0.3}} = 10^{-5.3} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2
   \]

3. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   The ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars is:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = \frac{10^{-4.2} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_1}{10^{-5.3} \cdot n_{\text{H}}_2} = 10^{1.1} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2}
   \]
   Here, $10^{1.1} \approx 12.589$. However, the ratio $\frac{n_{\text{H}}_1}{n_{\text{H}}_2}$ is not explicitly provided. Assuming the hydrogen density is the same in both stars (a reasonable assumption for this problem), we set $n_{\text{H}}_1 = n_{\text{H}}_2$, giving:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si}}_1}{n_{\text{Si}}_2} = 10^{1.1} \approx 12.6
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.
