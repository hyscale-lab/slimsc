Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the possible decay channels of this boson X. The problem gives me the Lagrangian, which tells me about the interactions. Let me see, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the notation, but I think the important part is that the boson X couples to fermions. 

Wait, the interaction term here must be something like X ψ ψ, meaning the boson X is interacting with fermions. So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. Because for a boson to decay, it needs to produce particles that are allowed by the interaction.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find all fermion pairs where the combined mass is less than 6 GeV because that's the maximum possible. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, the mass of the parent must be greater than the sum of the masses of the daughters.

Let me think about the fermion masses. The known fermions and their masses (approximate) are:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.3-1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4-5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV
- Electron (e-): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (mu-): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (tau-): ~1.78 GeV

Wait, but the tau is about 1.78 GeV, so a pair would be around 3.56 GeV. But X has 6 GeV, so that's allowed. But wait, the top quark is way too heavy—X is 6 GeV, so t and t-bar would sum to about 346 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into top quarks. So any option with t-tbar is out. Looking at the options, option C includes t-tbar. So C is out.

Now, which fermions have masses such that their pair is less than 6 GeV? Let's list all possible fermions and their pair masses:

1. Up quark pairs (u u-bar): each is ~2 MeV, so total ~4 MeV. Well within 6 GeV. So possible.
2. Down quark pairs (d d-bar): ~8 MeV. Also possible.
3. Strange quark pairs (s s-bar): each ~100 MeV, so total ~200 MeV. Possible.
4. Charm quark pairs (c c-bar): each ~1.5 GeV, so total ~3 GeV. Possible.
5. Bottom quark pairs (b b-bar): each ~4.5 GeV, so total ~9 GeV. Oh wait, 4.5 + 4.5 is 9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9, so decay into b b-bar is not possible. So any option with b b-bar is wrong. Let's look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b-bar. So if decay into b is not allowed, A is incorrect.

Option B: doesn't have b b-bar. Wait, let's check. Option B says X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So no bottom quarks here. That makes sense because 2 * 4.5 GeV is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV.

Option D: includes b b-bar. So D is also incorrect.

So now, the possible fermion pairs are u, d, s, c, and the leptons.

Wait, but what about the lepton masses? Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so tau+ tau- would sum to ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed. Similarly, mu+ mu- is ~211 MeV (each is ~105.7 MeV), so 211 MeV is much less than 6 GeV. Similarly, e+ e- is even lighter.

So the possible decay channels are:

- c c-bar (3 GeV)
- s s-bar (0.2 GeV)
- u u-bar (0.004 GeV)
- d d-bar (0.08 GeV)
- tau+ tau- (3.56 GeV)
- mu+ mu- (0.211 GeV)
- e+ e- (0.001 GeV)

But wait, the problem is the Lagrangian. What particles are involved? The interaction term is X ψ ψ, so X couples to all the fermion species. So all these fermions can be produced.

So the allowed decays are all the quarks (u, d, s, c) and the charged leptons (tau, mu, e).

Wait, looking at the options. Let me check each option.

Option A: Includes b and e. But as per above, b is not allowed. So A is out.

Option B: Doesn't have b, includes s, u, d, c, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option C: includes t and b. So no, because t is too heavy.

Option D: includes b, so incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Does X have any other couplings? The Lagrangian is given as L = -λ f ψ_f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps this is a Yukawa coupling term. So the interaction is between X and a fermion ψ_f. So for each fermion ψ_f that X couples to, X can decay into ψ_f and ψ_f-bar.

So which fermions are included? The question says ψ_f is a fermion field. So perhaps the model includes all the fermions, but their decay is possible only if the combined mass is less than X's mass.

So the possible decay products are all the fermion-antifermion pairs where 2 m_fermion < 6 GeV.

So for quarks: up, down, strange, charm. Because bottom is 4.5 GeV each, sum is 9 GeV >6 GeV. So no.

Leptons: e, mu, tau. Because e is 0.5 MeV, mu is ~100 MeV, tau ~1.78 GeV. So tau pair is 3.56 GeV, which is <6 GeV. So allowed.

So the decay channels are:

u u-bar,

d d-bar,

s s-bar,

c c-bar,

tau+ tau-,

mu+ mu-,

e+ e-.

So that's what option B lists.

Wait, option B says X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. The interaction term \(-\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y)\) indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions, allowing it to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The kinematic constraint for such decays is that the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels:
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), pair mass \( \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 5 \, \text{MeV} \), pair mass \( \sim 8 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), pair mass \( \sim 200 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), pair mass \( \sim 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), pair mass \( \sim 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e^- \)): \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), pair mass \( \sim 1 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), pair mass \( \sim 211 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
   - Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), pair mass \( \sim 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Hence, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark is much heavier (\( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \)), making \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed for the same reason as in Option A. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.
