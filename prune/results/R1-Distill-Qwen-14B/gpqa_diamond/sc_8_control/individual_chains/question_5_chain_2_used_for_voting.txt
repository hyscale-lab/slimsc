Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvalues related to their components, so this must be about angular momentum.

Wait, the problem gives P_x, P_y, and P_z matrices. Each is multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So that's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.

P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled by ħ/2.

And P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix scaled by ħ/2.

But wait, the operator we're considering is P in the direction of n. So the operator is P · n, right? Because for angular momentum, the operator in direction n is the dot product of the vector operator with n.

So n is in the x-z plane, which means it can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or something like that, but since it's in x-z, φ might be zero? Or wait, no, because in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane is the φ=0 and φ=π planes. So maybe n is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, because the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so I think n would be (nx, 0, nz) with nx² + nz² =1.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the operator P in the direction of n. The operator is P · n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because since n is in x-z, the y-component is zero, so that's why.

Wait, but the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z. So the operator is P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z, where nx² + nz² =1.

So the eigenvector we're looking for is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we have to solve (P·n)|v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Wait, but P·n is a matrix. Let me compute it.

P·n = nx * (ħ/2) * σ_x + nz * (ħ/2) * σ_z, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix and σ_z is the Pauli Z matrix.

So the matrix P·n is (ħ/2) times [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ].

Because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So multiplying by nx and nz respectively, and adding them, then scaling by ħ/2.

So P·n = (ħ/2) [ nz*[[1,0],[0,-1]] + nx*[[0,1],[1,0]] ]

Wait, no, more accurately, nx σ_x is [[0, nx],[nx,0]], and nz σ_z is [[nz,0],[0,-nz]]. So adding them:

[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

So P·n = (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

We're looking for eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

( (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Divide both sides by (ħ/2):

[[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

[nz   nx] [a]   [a]
[nx  -nz] [b] = [b]

Which gives the equations:

nz a + nx b = a

nx a - nz b = b

Let me write these equations.

First equation: nz a + nx b = a → (nz - 1) a + nx b =0 → equation (1)

Second equation: nx a - nz b = b → nx a - (nz + 1) b =0 → equation (2)

So from equation (1):

(nz -1) a = - nx b → a = [ -nx b ] / (nz - 1 )

Similarly, from equation (2):

nx a = (nz +1) b → a = [ (nz +1) b ] / nx

Wait, but we have two expressions for a. So equate them:

[ -nx b ]/(nz -1 ) = [ (nz +1 ) b ] / nx

Assuming b ≠ 0 (if b=0, then from equation (1), (nz-1) a=0. If nz=1, then a can be any value, but then from equation (2), nx a= (1+1) b → but b=0, so a can be any? Hmm, but likely the non-trivial solution is when b is not zero.

So back to the equation:

[ -nx ]/(nz -1 ) = (nz +1 ) / nx

Cross-multiplying:

-nx * nx = (nz +1)(nz -1 )

→ -nx² = nz² -1

But I know that nx² + nz² =1 because n is a unit vector. So substituting nz² =1 - nx²:

- nx² = (1 - nx²) -1 → - nx² = - nx² → 0=0.

So that equation holds for any nx, nz as long as they satisfy nx² + nz²=1. So that doesn't give any new information. So the system is consistent.

So from equation (2): nx a = (nz +1 ) b → a = [ (nz +1 ) / nx ] b.

But let's pick a parameter. Let me set b as a parameter and express a in terms of b.

But wait, let me choose a ratio for a in terms of b. Let me set b =1, then a = (nz +1)/nx.

But since a and b are components of the eigenvector, we can write the eigenvector as [ (nz +1)/nx , 1 ]^T. But we need to normalize it.

Wait, but we have another condition: nx² + nz² =1.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenvector in terms of some parameter. But perhaps a better approach is to consider the eigenvalues of the matrix [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]].

Wait, the matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvalues can be found using the trace and determinant.

The trace is nz + (-nz )=0.

The determinant is (nz)(-nz) - nx^2 = -nz² - nx² = - (nx² + nz²) = -1.

So the eigenvalues are sqrt( (0/2)^2 + determinant ) → eigenvalues are ± sqrt( -1 )? Wait, that can't be right because the determinant is -1. Wait, no, the eigenvalues are sqrt( (trace/2)^2 + determinant ), but when trace is zero, eigenvalues are ± sqrt( determinant ). But determinant is -1, so eigenvalues are ± i.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]] have eigenvalues (a+d)/2 ± sqrt( ((a-d)/2)^2 + bc ). In this case, a =nz, d=-nz. So (a+d)/2 =0.

The term under the square root is ((a-d)/2)^2 + bc → ( (nz +nz)/2 )^2 + nx^2 → (nz )^2 + nx^2 = nz² + nx² =1. So the eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, wait, no. Because a =nz, d= -nz. So a-d = 2nz. (a-d)/2 =nz. So (nz)^2 + nx^2 = (nz² + nx^2 )=1. So sqrt( 0 +1 )=1. So eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, but each eigenvalue is multiplied by (ħ/2) because the original matrix is (ħ/2) times that matrix. So the eigenvalues of the operator P · n are (ħ/2)(±1)=±ħ/2. Which matches the given eigenvalue +ħ/2. So that's correct.

So to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +1 (since the matrix [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] has eigenvalues ±1 ), we can write the equation:

[ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ] |v> = 1 |v>

So (nz -1) a + nx b =0 → (nz-1) a = - nx b → equation (1)

nx a - (nz +1) b =0 → equation (2)

So from equation (1): a = [ -nx b ] / (nz -1 )

From equation (2): a = [ (nz +1 ) b ] / nx

Set equal:

[ -nx b ]/(nz -1 ) = [ (nz +1 ) b ] / nx → divide both sides by b (assuming b≠0):

-nx / (nz -1 ) = (nz +1 ) / nx → cross-multiply:

-nx^2 = (nz +1)(nz -1 )

Which is same as earlier: -nx^2 = nz^2 -1 → but since nx² + nz²=1 → substituting nz² =1 -nx²:

-nx^2 = (1 - nx²) -1 → -nx² = - nx² → 0=0 → which is always true.

So we can choose a parameter to express the eigenvector. Let's let b =1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar). Then a = [ (nz +1 ) / nx ].

So the vector is [ (nz+1)/nx, 1 ].

But we need to normalize it. The norm squared is [ (nz+1)^2 / nx² + 1 ].

But let's compute this:

(nz+1)^2 / nx² + 1 = [ (nz+1)^2 + nx² ] / nx².

Expanding (nz+1)^2 = nz² +2nz +1.

So numerator becomes: nz² + 2nz +1 + nx².

But nx² + nz² =1, so substituting:

= 1 + 2nz +1 = 2(1 + nz).

So the norm squared is [2(1 + nz)] / nx².

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (nz+1)/nx * sqrt( nx²/(2(1 +nz)) ), 1 * sqrt( nx²/(2(1 +nz)) ) ]

Simplify the first component:

(nz+1)/nx * sqrt( nx²/(2(1 +nz)) ) = (nz+1) * sqrt( nx² )/( nx sqrt( 2(1+nz) )) )

Wait, but sqrt(nx^2) is |nx|, but since we're dealing with quantum mechanics, the components nx and nz can be positive or negative, but the direction is arbitrary. Perhaps, for simplicity, we can assume that nx is positive, so sqrt(nx^2)=nx.

So the first component becomes:

(nz +1) * nx / ( nx sqrt(2(1+nz)) )

Cancel nx:

(nz +1) / sqrt(2(1 +nz)) ) = sqrt( (nz +1)^2 / (2(nz+1)) ) ) = sqrt( (nz+1)/2 )

Similarly, the second component is sqrt( nx²/(2(1 +nz)) ) = nx / sqrt( 2(1+ nz) ) 

= sqrt( (nx^2) / (2(1+ nz)) ) 

But since nx² =1 - nz² (because nx² + nz²=1), substituting:

sqrt( (1 - nz²) / (2 (1 + nz)) ) 

= sqrt( ( (1 -nz)(1+ nz) ) / (2(1+ nz)) ) )

= sqrt( (1 -nz)/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ sqrt( (nz +1)/2 ), sqrt( (1 - nz)/2 ) ]

Wait, but that's if the first component is a and the second is b. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, no, let's recompute:

After normalization, each component is:

a_norm = [ (nz +1)/nx ] * [ 1 / sqrt( 2(1 +nz) ) / nx ]

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express the normalized vector as:

[ (nz +1), nx ] / sqrt( (nz +1)^2 + nx^2 )

But from earlier, we found that (nz +1)^2 + nx^2 = 2(1 +nz )

So sqrt( 2(1+ nz) )

Which is sqrt( 2(1 + nz) )

So the vector becomes [ (nz +1), nx ] / sqrt( 2(1 +nz) )

Which can be written as [ (nz +1)/sqrt( 2(1 +nz) ), nx / sqrt( 2(1 +nz) ) ]

Simplify the first component:

sqrt( (nz +1)^2 / (2 (1 +nz) ) ) ) = sqrt( (nz +1)/2 )

Similarly, the second component is nx / sqrt( 2(1 +nz) )

But what is nx in terms of the angle? Since n is in the x-z plane, let's say n makes an angle θ with the z-axis. So that nz = cosθ, and nx = sinθ. Because in spherical coordinates, the direction n would have components nx = sinθ cosφ, nz= cosθ, but since in x-z plane, φ=0, so nx= sinθ, nz= cosθ.

So substituting, nz = cosθ, nx = sinθ.

So the components become:

sqrt( (cosθ +1)/2 ) and sinθ / sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)).

Wait, sqrt( (cosθ +1)/2 ) is cos(θ/2). Because the identity cos^2 (θ/2) = (1 + cosθ)/2 → cos(θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cosθ)/2 )

Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2 ), and 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2 )

So the second component is [ sinθ ] / sqrt( 2 (1 + cosθ ) )

= [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / sqrt( 2 * 2 cos²(θ/2) )

Denominator: sqrt(4 cos²θ/2 )= 2 |cosθ/2 |. Since we're dealing with angles between 0 and π, cosθ/2 is positive, so denominator is 2 cosθ/2.

Thus, numerator is 2 sinθ/2 cosθ/2.

So the component becomes ( 2 sinθ/2 cosθ/2 ) / ( 2 cosθ/2 ) ) = sinθ/2.

So the second component is sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait a minute. Because the original eigenvector was [a, b], which in the matrix equation becomes [ (nz +1)/(2 sqrt(2(1 +nz)) ), ... ].

Wait, no, after substitution, the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). So the vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), and option D is (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), ...). But wait, I thought the eigenvector components are normalized already. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but the options are given in terms of hbar? No, looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))

Wait, but in our calculation, the eigenvector [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is a normalized vector, since cos² + sin² =1.

But wait, in the problem statement, the question is about the eigenvector of the operator P. The operator is P · n, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the eigenvector is a state vector, which is a column vector, and its components don't have units of ħ. Because ħ is Planck's constant, and the operator has units of ħ. The eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar. That doesn't make sense because the components can't have units of ħ; they're dimensionless.

So the correct answer should be option C, which has components without ħ.

Wait, but let me think again. The eigenvector we found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the matrices P_x, P_y, P_z are given as ħ/2 times their respective Pauli matrices. So the operator P·n is (ħ/2) times (nx σ_x + nz σ_z ), which leads to the eigenvalue equation (P·n)|v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

But when we solved for the eigenvector, we found it to be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), but the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction. So perhaps the correct normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait, in our earlier steps, the eigenvector is [ a, b ] where a is cos(theta/2 ), b is sin(theta/2). So the vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → this matches.

Option D) seems to have the components multiplied by sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar, which doesn't make sense for a normalized vector. Also, hbar shouldn't be in the vector components.

Wait, but option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), etc. So this would imply that the vector is scaled by hbar, which isn't correct because vectors are dimensionless.

So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, where $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$ are the components of the operator $\vec{P}$, and $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the components of the unit vector $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we get:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
n_z a + n_x b = a, \quad n_x a - n_z b = b.
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0.
\]

From these equations, we solve for the ratio of $a$ to $b$. Assuming $b \neq 0$, we find:

\[
a = \frac{n_z + 1}{n_x} b.
\]

Substituting this into the normalization condition $|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1$, we find the normalized eigenvector:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix},
\]

where $\theta$ is the angle that $\vec{n}$ makes with the z-axis, with $n_z = \cos\theta$ and $n_x = \sin\theta$.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This is incorrect because the components of an eigenvector are dimensionless, and the presence of $\hbar$ is invalid.
- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$: This does not match the derived eigenvector and appears unrelated to the problem.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived normalized eigenvector and is correct.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This is incorrect because the components are scaled by $\hbar$, which is invalid for a normalized eigenvector.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

Answer: C
