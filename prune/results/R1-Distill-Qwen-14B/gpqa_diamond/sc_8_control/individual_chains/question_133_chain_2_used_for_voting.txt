Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are being dissolved in 200 cm³ of water. The masses given are 1.00 g each. I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions.

Wait, I think I remember something about the phosphate buffer system. Because these two salts are related as conjugate acid-base pairs. KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (the hydrogen phosphate ion). So when they dissolve in water, they form a buffer solution.

The pH of such a buffer can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Oh wait, but the buffer here is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, let me think: H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps. The first dissociation (Ka1) gives H2PO4^- and H+. The second (Ka2) gives HPO4^2- and another H+. The third (Ka3) gives PO4^3- and H+. 

In this problem, we have KH2PO4 (which is K+ and H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which is 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water, but the water probably doesn't affect the concentrations much). 

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These two are conjugate acid and base in the second dissociation step. So the relevant Ka here is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^- because HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-. So the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So the pH can be determined using Ka2. Because the H2PO4^- ion can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Wait, yes. The solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

Now, I need to calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

First, let's find the number of moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4:
Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:
Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

The total volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.20000 L.

So, the concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007345 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.036725 M.

The concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005613 mol / 0.20000 L = 0.028065 M.

Now, using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = let's compute it. Log(6.2) is about 0.792, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So pKa2 is 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.028065 / 0.036725 )

Let me compute the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is about what? Let's see. Log(0.7) is -0.155, log(0.75) is around -0.1249, log(0.765) ≈ -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.115 ≈ 7.093.

Wait, but wait, if the pH is less than pKa2, then the acid form (H2PO4^-) is more predominant. So the HPO4^2- is the base and H2PO4^- is the acid.

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

Hmm, so now I need to find [PO4^3-]. But from the buffer, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-, which comes from the third dissociation step. But since the pH is around 7.09, which is less than pKa3 (which is about 12, since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is 11.74).

Wait, because pKa3 is about 11.74, which is way higher than our pH. So the solution isn't strongly basic enough to deprotonate HPO4^2- to PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait let me think again. The HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3- in the presence of a base. But in our case, the pH is about 7.09, which is much lower than pKa3. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because it's more favorable for HPO4^2- to remain protonated in acidic conditions.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the third dissociation. So we can model that.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is really small. So at pH 7.09, the concentration of H+ is about 10^(-7.09) ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So, Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (7.94e-8)

Let me compute that step by step.

First, multiply 1.8e-12 by 0.028065:

1.8e-12 * 0.028065 ≈ 5.0517e-14.

Then divide by 7.94e-8:

5.0517e-14 / 7.94e-8 ≈ 6.36e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = ?

1.8 * 0.028065 = approx 0.050517, so 0.050517e-12 = 5.0517e-14.

Divide by 7.94e-8:

5.0517e-14 / 7.94e-8 = (5.0517 / 7.94) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.636 * 1e-6 → 6.36e-7 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about whether this is the only source of PO4^3-.

Wait, no, because H2PO4^- can also dissociate further. But the second dissociation (H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+) is much stronger than the third. So in this solution, the primary species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But we're asked about PO4^3-, which comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. But because the pH is way below pKa3, the amount of PO4^3- is very small.

So, the main contributors to PO4^3- would be from the HPO4^2- in the solution. So the 6.36e-7 M is the concentration.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, option D is 3.97e-7, etc.

Wait, my calculation came up with approximately 6.36e-7, but the first option is 6.24e-7. Hmm, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculations.

Let me recompute the numbers more accurately.

First, let's calculate the exact moles for each:

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 136.09 = approx 0.0073447.

Volume is 0.2 L, so concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.0073447 / 0.2 = 0.0367235 M.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005613.

Concentration of HPO4^2- = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

Now, Henderson equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) → let me compute this accurately.

Log(6.2) is 0.79239. So log(6.2e-8) is 0.79239 - 8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

Ratio = [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.0367235 ≈ 0.7652.

Log(0.7652) → let's compute it accurately. Log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.7652) is around 0.7652 in log.

Wait, 0.7652 is approximately 7652/10000. Let me compute log(0.7652) using natural logs or a calculator approach.

Alternatively, I can remember that log(0.76) is approximately 0.76 is 76 * 1e-2. Let's compute more accurately.

We can use the Taylor series or known log values. Alternatively, use a more precise method.

Alternatively, I can compute it as:

We know that 10^x = 0.7652 → x = log(0.7652).

We can compute this as x ≈ (-0.115). Let me check with more precise calculation.

Using a calculator approximation:

We can note that 10^(-0.115) is about 0.765. Wait, wait, 10^(-0.1) is about 0.794, and 10^(-0.115) is about 0.765. So log(0.765) ≈ -0.115.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.115) → 7.0926.

So pH ≈ 7.093.

Now, to find [PO4^3-], we use the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

At pH 7.093, [H+] = 10^(-7.093) ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So, using the Ka expression:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+] / [HPO4^2-]

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.

[H+] = 7.94e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (7.94e-8)

Calculate numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 7.94e-8.

So,

5.0517e-14 / 7.94e-8 = (5.0517 / 7.94) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /7.94 ≈ 0.636.

So 0.636e-6 = 6.36e-7 M.

Looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close to 6.36e-7. Maybe I made a rounding error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.028065:

0.028065 is 2.8065e-2.

1.8e-12 * 2.8065e-2 = (1.8 * 2.8065) *1e-14 → 5.0517 *1e-14 → 5.0517e-14.

Divide by 7.94e-8: 5.0517e-14 /7.94e-8 = (5.0517/7.94) * 1e-6.

5.0517 ÷ 7.94 → Let's compute that division precisely.

7.94 into 5.0517: 7.94 * 0.636 = approximately 5.0517? Let me check:

0.636 *7.94 → 7 * 0.636 =4.452, 0.94 *0.636=0.59904 → total 5.05104. Exactly! So 5.0517/7.94 = 0.636.

So 0.636e-6 = 6.36e-7 M.

But the options don't have exactly this value. The closest is option A, which is 6.24e-7. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact pH more accurately.

Wait, let's recalculate the ratio: [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028065 / 0.0367235.

Let me compute that precisely: 0.028065 ÷ 0.0367235 ≈ 0.76518.

Then log(0.76518) → using a calculator, perhaps. Let's compute that more accurately.

We can use the Taylor series for log around x=0.7.

Alternatively, maybe I can remember that log(0.765)= approx -0.1146.

Wait, let me think: log(0.765) is log(7.65e-1) → log(7.65) + log(1e-1) → log(7.65) is about 0.884, so 0.884 -1 = -0.116.

Wait, but perhaps using more precise values.

Alternatively, using a calculator:

Log(0.765) ≈ -0.1146.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.1146) = 7.2076 - 0.1146 = 7.093.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact [H+] more accurately.

[H+] = 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093).

10^(-0.093) is approximately 0.872 → So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.872 = 8.72e-8 M.

Wait, that's a bit different from my initial 7.94e-8. Oh, wait, I think I miscalculated.

Wait, pH is 7.093. So [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093).

10^(-0.093) = approx 0.872? Let's compute 10^0.093.

Wait, 10^0.093 = about 1.24?

Because 10^0.1 is about 1.2589. So for 0.093, perhaps approximately 1.23?

Wait, 10^0.07 is about 1.17, 10^0.09 is about 1.23.

So 10^(-0.093) is about 0.81. So [H+] would be 1e-7 * 0.81 → 8.1e-8 M.

Wait, that changes the calculation. Let me recalculate [PO4^3-].

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.1e-8).

Let me compute the numerator again: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = 5.0517e-14.

Denominator is 8.1e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0517 /8.1) * 1e-6.

5.0517 /8.1 ≈ 0.6237.

So 0.6237e-6 → 6.237e-7 M.

That's approximately 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A.

Ah, I see. So earlier, I had a miscalculation in [H+] because I used 7.94e-8 instead of the more accurate 8.1e-8. So the correct [PO4^3-] is about 6.24e-7 M, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. So the initial approximation of [H+] as 7.94e-8 was incorrect because when I calculated pH as 7.093, [H+] is 10^(-7.093) which is approximately 8.1e-8. So that's why the earlier calculation was a bit off.

So with [H+] =8.1e-8, [PO4^3-] is (1.8e-12 * 0.028065)/(8.1e-8) = 6.24e-7 M.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), which are conjugate acid-base pairs in the second dissociation step of H₃PO₄. The relevant equilibrium constant is Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and the pH of the solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol, moles = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.007345}{0.20000} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol, moles = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Concentration = \( \frac{0.005613}{0.20000} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
The ratio of base to acid is:  
\[
\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.028065}{0.036725} \approx 0.7652
\]

The pKa₂ is:  
\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208
\]

Substitute into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.7652)
\]

Using \(\log(0.7652) \approx -0.115\):  
\[
\text{pH} \approx 7.208 - 0.115 = 7.093
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]

The equilibrium constant is \( K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). At pH = 7.093, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).

Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]

Substitute values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065)}{8.1 \times 10^{-8}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065) \approx 5.0517 \times 10^{-14}
\]

Then divide by the denominator:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.1 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
