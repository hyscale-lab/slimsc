Alright, I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Okay, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller. Like, plx = 1/distance. So, distance d = 1/plx.

Now, the distribution is uniform, so the number of stars should depend on the volume of space considered. Since stars are spread out uniformly, the number in a region depends on the volume of that region.

Wait, but how does parallax relate to the volume? Let's think about the volume element in spherical coordinates. The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr would be 4πd² dr. Because the surface area is 4πd² and dr is the thickness.

Since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that in. So d = 1/p, where p is parallax. Then dr would be the change in distance, which is related to the change in parallax. Let me see: dr = (change in d) = - (1/p²) * change in p. Because d = 1/p, so derivative dd/dp = -1/p². So, for a small change in p (Δp), Δd ≈ -Δp / p². But since we're dealing with positive distances and parallax, I'll consider magnitudes. So the thickness dr in terms of p is Δd = -Δp/(p²). But since we're looking at a small range of p, like from p to p + Δp, the change in d would be positive if p decreases, but maybe I should think in terms of how the volume element relates to p.

Wait, the volume element in terms of p might be easier. Let me think. Since d = 1/p, the volume element (dV) is 4πd² dr. But dr is the change in d, which is (1/p^2) dp, but wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me correct.

We have d = 1/p => p = 1/d. So when p increases, d decreases. The volume element in d is dV = 4πd² dr. But I need to express this in terms of p. So, dr = (change in d) = (change in (1/p)) = (-1/p²) dp. So, substituting, dV becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp? Wait, that doesn't look right because the signs might be getting muddled, but since we're dealing with absolute values for volume, perhaps I can ignore the negative sign.

Wait, let's approach it differently. Let me express dV in terms of p. The volume element is the surface area at distance d multiplied by the thickness in distance, dr. So dV = 4πd² dr. But since d = 1/p, then substituting, dV = 4π (1/p)^2 dr. But dr is in terms of p. Because p = 1/d, so dp/d = -1/d², which implies dr = - (1/(d²)) dp. But since d is 1/p, dr = -(p²) dp. So, substituting, dV = 4π (1/p²) * (p² dp) ) = 4π dp. Wait, that's interesting. So the volume element in terms of p is 4π dp. That means that each unit change in p contributes 4π volume.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of p. So the number of stars per unit p (like, per parsec of parallax?) would depend on the volume. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n (stars per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element is n * dV.

From the volume element, dV is 4π dp. So number of stars in a dp range would be n * 4π dp. So the number per unit p (since dp is the unit range) would be proportional to 1. Hmm, but the options don't have a 1, except option C which is ~1/plx^1, which is just 1/p.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about how the number of stars per unit parallax range varies with p. Since dV is 4π dp, the number of stars in a shell between p and p + dp is n * dV = 4π n dp. So the number per unit p is 4π n, which is a constant. So that would mean the number doesn't depend on p, but that's not matching the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no, wait. The question says "the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So the count per unit plx (like, per 1 arcsecond), how does that change as plx itself changes.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the exact wording. Let me re-express the problem.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density is constant. So the number of stars in a region is proportional to the volume of that region. Let's say we consider a range of parallax from p to p + dp. The corresponding range in distance is d = 1/p to d = 1/(p + dp). But dp is a small change, so for small dp, this can be approximated as from d to d - (dp)/p², since d = 1/p, so dd = -1/p² dp.

But the volume of this thin shell is 4π d² dd. Substituting dd = - (1/p²) dp, the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2) (-dp). The negative sign indicates the shell is at a lower distance as p increases, but since we're dealing with magnitude, we can take the absolute value.

So dV = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that gives the volume element as proportional to 1/p^4. But wait, earlier I thought dV was 4π dp, which would imply 1/p^0, but that must have been a mistake.

Wait, no, perhaps I messed up when changing variables. Let me try again.

Starting from dV = 4π d² dr.

But since dr = - (1/p²) dp, because p = 1/d, so dp = - (d²) dr. So dr = - dp/(d²) = - p² dp.

Substituting into dV: dV = 4π d² * (-p² dp) = 4π (1/p)² * p² dp. Because d = 1/p, so d² = (1/p)^2 = 1/p².

So, 4π (1/p²) * p² dp = 4π dp.

So, again, I get dV = 4π dp. Hmm, so that suggests that the volume element in terms of p is 4π dp. So the number of stars in a thin shell of parallax dp is n * dV = 4π n dp.

Which would mean the number of stars per unit parallax (since dp is 1 unit) is 4π n, a constant. So the number per unit p doesn't change with p. But that can't be right because that would imply the same number of stars per unit parallax in all ranges, like from p=1 to p=2, same as p=10 to p=11. But that's not correct because the volume of space increases with distance, but wait how?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the differential and the cumulative counts. Let me think about it differently. Suppose the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness in distance (dr). So the number of stars is proportional to 4πd² dr. But since d=1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. So substituting:

Number of stars N = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ) = -4π (1/p^4) dp. Since the number can't be negative, we take absolute value, so N = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in a thin shell of parallax dp is proportional to 1/p^4. Thus, the number per unit parallax (dp=1) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait, that's the number of stars in a shell of parallax between p and p+dp. So the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4.

So, the number of stars per unit range of plx (dp) is 1/(p^4) * some constant. So as p increases, the number decreases as 1/p^4.

So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but earlier I thought the volume element was 4π dp, which would lead to 1/p^0, but that seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me do it step by step.

We have p = 1/d. So, d =1/p.

The volume element dV is 4π d² dr.

But dr is the change in d. So, dr = (d(p + dp) - d(p)) ) = (1/(p + dp) - 1/p) ) ≈ (-dp)/(p²) for small dp.

So, dr = - dp/(p²) = - p² dp.

So, dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - p² dp ) = 4π * (1/p²) * (-p²) dp = 4π (-dp).

But since we take the absolute value, dV =4π dp. So the volume element is 4π dp.

But wait, that's the same as before. So substituting, N = n * dV = n * 4π dp, which would imply that N is proportional to dp, so the number per unit p is constant. That can't be right because when p is larger, the volume for the same dp would be same, but the actual volume in space is larger when p is smaller.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the number of stars in a given parallax range isn't uniform in parallax but in distance. Let me think in terms of how many stars are in a certain range of parallax.

Suppose you have two thin shells: one near p=1 and another near p=2.

At p=1, the volume of the shell is 4π (1)^2 dr, where dr is the change in distance. But dr is related to dp via dr = - (1/p²) dp. So for p=1, dr = - dp. So, the volume is 4π (1)^2 * (-dp) = 4π (-dp). Absolute value, 4π dp.

Similarly, at p=2, dr = - (1/(2^2)) dp = - dp/4. So the volume is 4π (2)^2 * (-dp/4) ) = 4π *4 * ( -dp/4 )= 4π (-dp). So the volume is the same as before, 4π dp.

Wait, but that can't be right because the volume of a shell at larger p (smaller d) would be smaller. Hmm, maybe I have a mistake in the way I'm calculating the volume element.

Wait, no. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dr. So if d is larger, the volume is larger for the same dr. But when you change variables from d to p, where p =1/d, the same dr would correspond to a different dp. So when d is larger (p is smaller), a given dr (change in d) corresponds to a larger change in p.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The number of stars in a thin shell is proportional to the volume of that shell. So the number of stars in a shell between p and p + dp is proportional to 4π d² dr. But dr is the change in d, which is -(1/p²) dp.

So substituting, N ∝ 4π d² * ( -1/p² dp ). But d=1/p, so d²=1/p².

Thus, N ∝ 4π * (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So for each thin shell of parallax dp, the number of stars is proportional to 1/p^4. So as p increases, the number of stars in each thin shell decreases as 1/p^4.

So the number per unit range of plx (dp=1) is ~1/p^4. So the number per unit plx decreases as 1/p^4.

So the correct option is A) ~1/plx^4.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( p = 1/d \). The number of stars in a thin shell at a given distance \( d \) depends on the volume of that shell, which is proportional to \( 4\pi d^2 \, dr \), where \( dr \) is the thickness of the shell in distance.

Since \( p = 1/d \), we can express \( dr \) in terms of \( dp \) as \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) into the volume element \( dV = 4\pi d^2 \, dr \), we get:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = -4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of change in distance, but for the purpose of counting stars, we consider the magnitude. Thus, the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in the thin shell is proportional to the volume \( dV \), so the number of stars per unit range of \( p \) (i.e., per unit \( dp \)) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). This means that as \( p \) increases, the number of stars per unit range of \( p \) decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \( \sim 1/p^4 \):** Matches the derived result.
- **B) \( \sim 1/p^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^2 \).
- **C) \( \sim 1/p^1 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p \).
- **D) \( \sim 1/p^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^3 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).
