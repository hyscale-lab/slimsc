Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining different numbers.

Hmm, optical isomerism refers to compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, which means they have chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has such a center, it can have enantiomers, leading to optical activity.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

Okay, this sounds a bit complex. Breaking it down, it's a biphenyl structure with substituents. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' (so on each phenyl ring), and there are nitro groups at 6 and 6'. The compound is a dicarboxylate ester, meaning both carboxylic acid groups are esterified with methyl groups.

Wait, so the central structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond). The substituents are in specific positions. Are there any chiral centers here?

Biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents around the central bond are different. So, in this case, each phenyl ring has a methyl ester group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. But wait, the substituents might be symmetrical.

Wait, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], which means the two phenyl rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring. So for each ring, there's a COOCH3 group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. Are the substituents on each ring symmetrical?

If the substituents on each ring are such that they mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule might be meso, which doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But if the arrangement isn't symmetrical, there might be axial chirality.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has COOCH3 and NO2 groups. For the 1,1'-biphenyl, substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. Are those positions symmetrical? Let me think about the numbering. On a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are across from each other (since 1 is the point of attachment). So each ring has a substituent at 2 (COOCH3) and 6 (NO2). So each ring has substituents at para positions relative to the point of attachment.

Wait, but that might mean that each ring is substituted in a way that's symmetrical. Because if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other, perhaps the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical. But perhaps the substituents on each biphenyl ring are the same, making the whole molecule symmetrical.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each ring has a COOCH3 at position 2 and NO2 at position 6. So each ring has two substituents. So the two substituents on each ring would be on opposite sides. So for each ring, the substituents are opposite each other. So each ring is disubstituted at para positions.

If the two substituents on each ring are the same, then each ring is symmetrical. But in this case, each ring has a COOCH3 and a NO2 group, which are different. So each ring has two different substituents in para positions.

Wait, but the two substituents on each ring are different, so each ring isn't symmetrical. But when you have two such rings connected, what about the overall symmetry?

Let me imagine the biphenyl structure. The two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So for each ring, substituent at 2 is COOCH3 and at 6 is NO2. But for the other ring (the 1' ring), substituents are at 2' and 6'. So the 2' position is next to the 1' (which is attached to the other ring). So the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to their own rings.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, then perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical, meaning no chiral axis, so no optical isomerism. Or maybe it's not symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the two substituents on each ring are in such a way that the rings are chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is dissymmetric, allowing for enantiomers.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back to this.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The structure of this is CH2(COOCH3)CH(OH)CH3? No, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3-C(OH)O-COOCH3? Wait, no. Let's think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or is it CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center?

Looking for a carbon with four different groups attached. Let's see each carbon:

- The central CH2OH might be connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the first CH2. So its structure is CH2(OH) connected to another CH2, which is connected to COOCH3, which is connected to methyl.

Wait, so the molecule is O

       COOCH3

       |
CH2(OH)-CH2- ?

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. It's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, so Carbon 2 is connected to two CH2 groups (Carbon 1 and 3). So the groups attached to Carbon 2 would be:

- One CH2OH (Carbon 1)
- One CH2COOCH3 (Carbon 3)
- Two H's?

Wait, no. Carbon 2 is CH2, which is connected to Carbon 1 (CH2OH) and Carbon 3 (COOCH3). So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no! Wait, propanoate is three carbons. 2-hydroxypropanoate is HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that would be three carbons in the acid. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon.

So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2CH2COOH, but wait, that's only three carbons. The structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is: the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- OH
- CH2 (from Carbon 1)
- CH2COOCH3 (from Carbon 3)
- and another CH2? Wait, no. Wait, each carbon in a chain is connected in a line. Let me number them as 1, 2, 3.

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and 3
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, but Carbon 2 is CH2, so it's connected to two CH2 groups and two H's. So Carbon 2 would have the structure: two CH2 groups (to 1 and 3), and two H's. So no, Carbon 2 isn't a chiral center because it's bonded to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups), right? So no chiral center here.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe it's CH3-C(OH)O-COOCH3? No, that doesn't fit. Another approach: the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Propanoate is C3H5O2^- when esterified. The ester formula is CH3CH2COOCH3. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have an OH on the second carbon.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Let me write the structure:

The main chain is: CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- One CH2OH group
- One CH2COOCH3 group
- Two H's.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Each carbon can only have four bonds. So the middle carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (the OH and the COOCH3 groups are on the same carbon?)

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

The correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

O

||
O-C-OCH3

attached to a CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 structure?

Wait, no. Wait, another way: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So:

CH3-C(OH)-COOH. But when esterified with methyl, it becomes CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So the structure would be:

CH3- C(OH) - COOCH3.

But wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Hmm.

Wait, so the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Now looking at the central carbon (the one with the OH), it's attached to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another CH group.

Wait, wait, no. Let's look at the central carbon (the one with OH): that's the middle carbon. It's connected to:

- CH3 (on one side)
- COOCH3 (on the other side)
- OH
- and another H? No, wait, because each carbon has four bonds.

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (one neighbor)
- COOCH3 (the other neighbor)
- OH
- and an H? No, wait. So, the four groups are:

1. CH3 (from the left)
2. COOCH3 (from the right)
3. OH
4. H

Wait, that's four different groups? Because the CH3 is a methyl group, COOCH3 is an ester group, OH is a hydroxyl, and H is hydrogen. So four different groups attached to the same carbon. That means this carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

So compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**

Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is phenyl. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone (C=O).

Does this compound have any chiral centers or axial chirality? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to O (so it's a carbonyl group). The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded, so it's not a chiral center. Also, the molecule is symmetrical as it has two identical phenyl groups attached. So the molecule is symmetrical, meaning no optical isomerism.

So compound 3 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**

Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, with two methyl esters on opposite sides of the double bond.

The structure is CH2CH(COOCH3)COOCH3 but in the trans configuration. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so its structure is HOOCCH2CH2COOH but with a double bond in the middle. Wait, no. Correct structure: HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So the diacid has a double bond between the two middle carbons. The trans (E) configuration would have the two COOH groups on opposite sides.

So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, with methyl esters on both ends. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3), but in the E configuration.

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly. Fumarate is trans, so the two ester groups (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH=CH-COOCH3 ?

Wait, no, wait. No, fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, so the diester would be (CH2CH=CH) with COOCH3 on each end. Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2=CH with COOCH3 on each end. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2?

No, wait I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is a four-carbon chain with a double bond between C2 and C3, and each end has a COOH group. The trans (E) configuration would have the COOH groups on opposite sides.

So when esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate, where the two COOH groups become COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=CH with each CH2 connected to COOCH3 groups. Wait, no:

It would be:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, no. Wait, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the double bond. Fumarate is trans, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite ends of the double bond. So the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? Or perhaps more accurately, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3 with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides.

But regardless, the question is whether this compound can have optical isomerism.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is a diester with a double bond. Now, can a double bond with substituents on each end have geometric isomerism (cis/trans), but does that lead to optical isomerism?

Wait, no, geometric isomerism is about different spatial arrangements around a double bond, but that doesn't directly lead to optical activity unless there's a chiral center or axial chirality.

Wait, but can the double bond have a configuration that makes the molecule chiral? For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents around the double bond are different on each side.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. But wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the diacid is HOOCCH2CH2COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the two COOH groups are on either end of the double bond.

So when esterified with methyl, it becomes:

COOCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. The structure should be:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but arranged in the trans configuration.

Wait, but each CH is connected to a COOCH3 group. So each CH is bonded to COOCH3, and the double bond is between them.

Wait, perhaps each CH is part of the double bond. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that can't be right as each CH would have four bonds.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that would be possible if both COOCH3 groups are on the same CH, but that's impossible as each carbon can only have four bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). But that would imply that each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 and a CH group, which isn't possible because each carbon in the double bond can only have three substituents (since the double bond takes up two bonds).

Alternatively, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's not with a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers or axial chirality.

Wait, if the molecule has a double bond and substituents on each end that are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral, then it can have optical isomerism. For example, if the substituents on each end are different and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

But in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has the same substituents: each has a COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, in the trans (E) configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So imagine the double bond as CH2-CH2, but each CH has a COOCH3 and another substituent. Wait, perhaps each end of the double bond is CH2, but that makes the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents on each end are identical, so the molecule is symmetrical. If that's the case, then it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe not. Let me think: the molecule has a central double bond with two identical groups on each end. No, wait, no. Each end has a CH2 group connected to COOCH3. So the molecule is symmetric. Because each double bond end has the same substituents. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. What if the substituents on each side of the double bond are different? For example, if each end has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration leads to a situation where the molecule is chiral. But I'm not sure. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, that can't be because that would require each CH to have three substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is actually (Z)- or (E)-butenedioate. So, each CH in the double bond is connected to COOCH3 and another CH3?

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2CH2(COOCH3)2, but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. But each CH can't have four substituents. So I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound or not.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, so it is achiral, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But I might be wrong.

Wait, another thought: some diesters can have geometric isomerism, but that's about cis/trans, not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center or axial chirality.

Wait, but for axial chirality, the molecule must have a central axis with substituents arranged in a non-symmetrical way. For example, allenes or biphenyls can have axial chirality.

Hmm, but in dimethyl fumarate, there's a double bond, not a single bond with substituents on either side. So axial chirality usually refers to structures like allenes or biphenyls, but not double bonds.

Wait, another approach: can a molecule with a double bond have optical isomerism? Yes, if the substituents on each end of the double bond are different and arranged in a way that creates chirality.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has the same substituents: each has a COOCH3 group and another CH2 group. So each end is identical. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical and has a plane of symmetry, so it's achiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because in some cases, even with identical substituents, the molecule could be chiral. For example, 1,2-dichloroethylene is not chiral, but if the substituents were different, like in trans-dichloroethylene, it could be.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the actual structure. Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, which is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that can't be because each CH in the double bond can't have more than three substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

But then, looking at the central part of the molecule, I see that each CH of the double bond has a COOCH3 and another substituent. But wait, each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So each CH has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH2.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Because if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So it's not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, but I'm not completely sure. Another thought: some diastereomers can have optical isomerism if the molecule is not symmetrical. But in this case, if the substituents are the same on both ends, symmetry would prevent optical isomerism.

So, based on this, I think compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe dimethyl fumarate can have geometric isomerism but can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the two. So, to recap: optical isomerism is about whether a molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image. That requires either a chiral center or axial chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, if the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical and cannot be chiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: if the molecule is a trans diastereomer, but it's symmetric, so no optical activity.

So, to sum up:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm not sure. Biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents on each ring are not symmetrical. In this case, each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. Are these substituents arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical? Let's say each ring has COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6. If the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, perhaps the entire molecule is symmetric, leading to no optical isomerism. But I'm not certain. Maybe it's a bit of a trick question.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, it has a chiral center. So it exhibits optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: I'm not sure. Earlier, I thought it doesn't, but perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, if the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, then the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. But another possibility is that the molecule isn't symmetrical, leading to axial chirality. Wait, no. Because the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, the molecule is symmetrical, hence no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. That structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? No, I think that's incorrect because each CH in the double bond can't have two COOCH3 groups attached.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH with each CH connected to a COOCH3 and another CH2 group. But that would make each end have the same substituents, leading to symmetry. So no optical isomerism.

So, if that's the case, then which of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism?

Compounds 2 and 4?

Wait, earlier I thought 4 doesn't, but I'm now confused.

Wait, another point: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, which is a diester. And fumarate is the trans isomer. Now, in terms of optical activity, some diesters can have cis and trans isomers, but they are geometric isomers, not optical isomers. Optical isomerism arises when a molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, but it also doesn't have axial chirality because the substituents are symmetrical.

So, back to the question.

Which compounds show optical isomerism?

1. I'm not sure. Maybe it has axial chirality.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

So, among the four, only number 2 shows optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, option A is 1,2,4. Option D is 1 and 2.

But earlier, I thought 1 may have axial chirality. Let me re-examine compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So each ring has:

- At position 2: COOCH3.

- At position 6: NO2.

In a biphenyl structure, each ring is connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions that are meta to each other, or para?

Wait, positions 2 and 6 on a benzene ring are para. Because numbering in a benzene ring goes 1, 2, 3, etc., so 2 and 6 are across from each other.

So each ring has two substituents: COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6. So in each ring, these substituents are para to each other. So each ring is 2,6-disubstituted.

Now, the entire molecule is symmetrical? Let's see.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a para fashion, and the other ring has the same substituents in the same positions, then the entire molecule may have a plane of symmetry. So, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral.

But if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks symmetry, it could be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents: COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6. So each ring is the same. Therefore, the entire molecule would be symmetrical, perhaps. So no axial chirality, meaning no optical isomerism.

So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking at the options, the only option that includes only compound 2 is not present. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and 4

C)2 and 3

D)1 and 2

Hmm. None of the options include just 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine compound 4.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH of the double bond has different substituents, leading to axial chirality.

Wait, fumarate is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate is (E)-but-2-enedioate, which is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct because that would require the central CH to have two COOCH3 groups. Alternatively, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's not a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that can't be because each CH in the double bond can only have three substituents.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me think differently. Are there any chiral centers in compound 4?

No, because the central carbons are part of a double bond, so they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, but axial chirality is possible if the molecule has a central axis with substituents arranged asymmetrically. For example, in biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are different, the molecule can have axial chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, the central axis is the double bond. Each end of the double bond has substituents. If those substituents are the same on both ends, the molecule is symmetrical, so no axial chirality. But if they're different, then perhaps it's chiral.

Wait, in this case, each end has the same substituents: each has a COOCH3 group.

So the substituents on each end are identical. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, so no axial chirality. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1.

Let me re-examine compound 1. The structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The biphenyl has two substituents on each ring: COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6.

Wait, in a biphenyl structure, the substituents can lead to axial chirality if they are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if substituents on each ring are not symmetrical.

In this case, each ring has COOCH3 at 2 and NO2 at 6. So are these substituents in a symmetrical arrangement across the biphenyl?

Wait, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring has a substituent para to another substituent. So each ring is symmetrical.

But when connected to the other ring, which also has the same substituents, would the entire molecule be symmetrical?

Hmm, perhaps. So, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Then, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is the E isomer, which is (CH2(COOCH3))(CH2(COOCH3)) across the double bond. If the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule is not chiral, hence no optical isomerism.

Another possibility: perhaps the substituents on each end are different. For example, one end has a COOCH3 and the other has a different group. Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, both ends have COOCH3. So no, that's not correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the two substituents on each end are different. For example, each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and another different group, leading to a lack of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH(COOCH3)CH2CH2(COOCH3). No, that wouldn't make sense for fumarate.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere, so perhaps I should consider the options again.

Looking for the correct answer among the options.

Option A:1,2,4

Option B:3 and4

Option C:2 and3

Option D:1 and2

If compound 2 is correct (has optical isomerism), then option D (1 and 2) would be incorrect if 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure about compound 1. Let me think again about it.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. Since 2 and 6 are para positions, each ring is disubstituted in a para fashion.

In a biphenyl structure, if the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the central bond, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the entire molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral.

But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule can be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has the same substituents in the same positions. So, the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options: only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But none of the options have just 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about compound 4.

Another angle: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, that would require each CH in the double bond to have two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2CH2(COOCH3). No, that's without a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Another approach: fumarate is the trans diasteromer of maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer. So, fumarate is (E), maleate is (Z).

In terms of optical isomerism, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. If not, it is.

But in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has the same substituents (COOCH3 and CH2 groups), so the molecule is symmetrical. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none have just 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. If dimethyl fumarate can have optical isomerism due to a different reason, like a chiral center.

Wait, no. The central carbons are double-bonded, so they can't be chiral centers. The ester groups are on the ends, but each end is symmetrical.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

But I thought compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1. Let me think: the substituents on each ring are COOCH3 and NO2. The positions are 2 and 6, which are para.

In a biphenyl, substituents in the same positions on each ring can lead to a non-symmetrical molecule if the substituents aren't identical. For example, if one ring has two different groups in para positions, and the other ring has the same arrangement, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, but if the substituents are different on each ring, but arranged symmetrically, the molecule could still be symmetrical. But in this case, each ring has the same substituents: COOCH3 and NO2. So the substituents are the same on both rings, leading to a symmetrical molecule.

So, I think compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Hmm. Maybe I should check the options again.

If compound 2 is the only one with optical isomerism, but none of the options have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake with compound 4.

Another way: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the structure is such that each end of the double bond has a CH2(COOCH3) group. So both ends are identical, making the molecule symmetrical. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4. But I thought 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Maybe it does have axial chirality.

Wait, if the substituents on each end are different, then the molecule could have axial chirality. For example, if each end of the double bond has different groups, leading to a non-symmetrical arrangement.

But in dimethyl fumarate, both ends have the same substituents (COOCH3 and CH2 groups), so the molecule is symmetrical. So no axial chirality.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that compound 4 has a chiral center elsewhere. But the only chiral centers would be in the ester groups, but those are symmetrical.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let me think again: the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has COOCH3 and NO2, which are different groups. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Wait, for example, if the substituents on each ring are such that their arrangement around the central bond is not symmetrical, then the molecule could be chiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para. So, the arrangement on each ring is symmetrical.

But when connected to the other ring, which also has the same substituents in the same positions, does the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Yes, because the substituents on each ring are mirror images of each other. So the entire molecule is symmetrical.

Thus, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back, only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A, which also includes 1 and 4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Maybe in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end are different, leading to a lack of symmetry and thus axial chirality.

Wait, but in fumarate, both ends are the same. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the substituents on each end of the double bond are arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral.

Wait, if each end has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, but in a way that they are not mirror images, then the molecule could be chiral. But if both ends are the same, then it's symmetrical.

Hmm. Perhaps in this case, dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and thus not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, after all this, I think only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake and one of the other compounds also has optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. So, each end of the double bond has a CH2(COOCH3) group. So, both ends are identical, making the molecule symmetrical. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, I think I can conclude that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But looking back at the options, I don't see any option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4). But I thought compounds 1 and 4 don't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think: the biphenyl structure with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are different substituents. So each ring has COOCH3 and NO2. So, the substituents on each ring are different. So, the entire molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but if each ring has the same substituents, but the arrangement around the central bond is such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

In other words, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions (2 and 6), but the way they're oriented around the central bond could lead to a chiral arrangement.

Wait, so perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole is not symmetrical, leading to axial chirality. So, the molecule would have two substituents on each ring, which are arranged in a way that the entire structure lacks a plane of symmetry.

In that case, yes, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in that case, compound 1 would have optical isomerism.

If that's correct, then the correct option would include 1 and 2, which is option D.

But earlier I thought that the substituents on each ring being the same would lead to symmetry, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. The two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'.

So, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, but the way the rings are connected could lead to different arrangements.

Wait, but if both rings have substituents in the same positions, wouldn't the molecule have a plane of symmetry? For example, imagine the molecule as two benzene rings connected by a single bond, each with substituents at 2 and 6. The molecule could be symmetrical along the axis of the single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the entire molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the connecting bond, leading to a non-symmetrical arrangement.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Without a clear image, it's hard to tell. But if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

Hmm. I'm stuck, but perhaps I should proceed with what I've deduced.

So, the only compound I'm certain about is compound 2, which has a chiral center and thus optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option with only 2, so perhaps I made a mistake in another compound.

Wait, I think I'm missing something about compound 4. Perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. But earlier, I thought the central carbons are part of a double bond, so no.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again: the structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that's not possible because each CH in the double bond can only have three substituents.

Wait, another approach: the correct way to write dimethyl fumarate is as the diester of (E)-fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the diester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but with the (E) configuration.

But in that structure, each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each CH has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH2.

But wait, each CH in a double bond has two substituents and two bonds in the double bond.

So, the structure would have:

COOCH3
|
CH2
|
CH=CH
|
COOCH3

But arranged in the trans (E) configuration.

In this case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each side are mirror images, then the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral.

But if the substituents on each end are different, then the molecule would lack symmetry and be chiral. But in this case, they're the same.

So, dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, back to the conclusion: only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But the options don't include that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the correct answer is option A, including 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about compound 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is a diester with a double bond. If the double bond is in the cis configuration, but that's maleate, not fumarate. Fumarate is trans.

But regardless, the substituents are the same on each end, so the molecule remains symmetrical.

So, I think I have to go with the earlier conclusion that only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires either a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2 and a NO2 group at position 6. Since the substituents are in para positions on each ring, the molecule is symmetrical and lacks axial chirality. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where Ph is a phenyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, making it a carbonyl group. Since it is not a chiral center and the molecule is symmetrical, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. The double bond is in the trans (E) configuration. Each end of the double bond has identical substituents (COOCH3 and CH2 groups), making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Among the four compounds, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the options provided in the question exclusively include compound 2. However, based on the reasoning provided, the most reasonable answer is **Option A (1, 2, and 4)**, assuming a potential oversight in the analysis of compound 1 or 4.

**Answer: A**
