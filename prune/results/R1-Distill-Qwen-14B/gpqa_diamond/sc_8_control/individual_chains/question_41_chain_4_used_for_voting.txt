Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. Let me think about it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. So the glass is moving in the same direction the light is going, but it's moving toward the observer. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me visualize this.

Imagine the lab frame where the observer is. The glass is moving, say, to the right at velocity v. The light beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving to the right. The light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving right, and the light inside it is moving right as well.

But wait, the light is also moving towards the observer? Or the glass is moving towards the observer? Wait, the question states the glass is moving toward the observer. Hmm, that might mean that from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So if the observer is on the left and the glass is moving to the right, but the light is moving through the glass to the right. Wait, but the glass is moving toward the observer? No, that's contradictory. Wait, perhaps the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. Hmm, I think I might be mixing up the directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and the beam is moving toward the observer. So the glass is moving in the direction of the beam, which is toward the observer. So the lab frame sees the glass moving toward the observer along with the light beam. But wait, the beam is in the glass, which is moving. So perhaps the beam's speed is determined by both the glass's motion and the refractive index.

Wait, the question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. So in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n, since the refractive index is n. But because the glass is moving, we have to apply a velocity addition formula, but wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up classically unless the velocities are non-relativistic.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v. I think it's assuming that v is much smaller than c, so the classical addition might apply. But I'm not sure. Let me think about it.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify that v is small, so maybe I should consider special relativity. But the question is about the speed of light in the glass from the lab frame. Hmm.

In the glass's rest frame, the light speed is c/n. If the glass is moving at velocity v, then to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula from relativity.

The velocity addition formula for two frames moving at speed u relative to each other is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame, and u is the velocity in the lab frame. Wait, no, I think I might have that backwards. Let me recall: if an object has velocity u in the lab frame, and the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to another frame S', then the object's velocity in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, the standard formula is:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² )

where u is the velocity in the lab frame (S), and u' is the velocity in the glass frame (S'), which is moving at velocity v relative to S.

Wait, so in the glass's rest frame (S'), the light's velocity is u' = c/n. But wait, no: the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but directionally, it's along the direction of the beam.

Wait, more precisely, in the glass's frame, since the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion, the velocity of light as measured in the glass's frame would be c/n towards the same direction as the glass's motion.

So in S' (glass frame), light moves at speed u' = c/n towards the same direction as the glass's motion, which is the same as the beam's direction. So from the lab frame S, which sees the glass moving at v (I think v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab), what is the speed u of the light?

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

But wait, let me get the signs right. Since u' is in the same direction as v, both are positive.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me restate: the lab frame S sees the glass moving at velocity v. The glass's frame S' is moving at v relative to S. In S', the light speed is u' = c/n in the same direction as v. So in S, what is the speed u of the light?

So substituting into the formula:

u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² )

But wait, c is the speed of light. Let me plug u' = c/n.

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ) ]

Simplify the denominator:

Denominator = 1 + (v c)/(n c²) ) = 1 + v/(n c)

So numerator is (c + n v)/n

Denominator is (n c + v )/(n c )

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

Denominator: 1 + (u' v)/c² = 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + v/(n c)

So the entire expression for u is:

u = [ (c/n + v) ] / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ]

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate denominators:

Numerator: (c + n v) * c

Denominator: (n c + v )

Wait, let me see:

Wait, u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c + n v) /n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplifying, the n cancels:

= (c + n v) * c  / (n c + v )

Which is c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, but the options given are A) (1 +n v)/(n +v ), B) 1, etc. Hmm. Let's look at the options again.

Wait, the options have expressions in terms of 1, n, v, but not in terms of c. Because the problem says c=1.

Ah, right, the problem statement says to take c=1. So c=1, so let's substitute c=1 into the expression.

So when c=1,

u = [ (1 + n v ) / n ] / [ 1 + v/(n * 1) )

Which is [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n )

Dividing by (n + v)/n is same as multiplying by n/(n + v).

So:

u = [ (1 + n v)/n ] * [ n/(n + v) ) ] 

The n cancels out:

u = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

So that's option A.

Wait, but I need to make sure I didn't mix up the direction or something. Because the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in this case, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So from the lab frame, the light's speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which would be option A.

Alternatively, wait, another approach: in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. Then, when the glass moves at velocity v in the same direction as the light, the observed speed of light in the lab frame would have to be c, because according to special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So that's confusing.

Wait, but this is the crux. If the glass is moving, it's a medium through which light propagates. But according to relativity, the speed of light in any frame is c. Hmm, so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. So the speed of light in the lab frame would be c, regardless of the glass's motion. Hence, the answer would be option B) 1.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier calculation. So which is correct?

Wait, this is a tricky point. The problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. So in the glass frame, light travels at c/n. But when the glass is moving, the speed measured in the lab is different. But according to relativity, the speed of light should still be c in the lab frame, regardless of the motion of the source or medium.

But this creates a contradiction, because in the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it. So perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the speed of light in a medium moving at velocity v shouldn't be c/n adjusted by the velocity addition formula, but in reality, light speed remains c.

Wait, but that's only when the medium is inertial. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

In the lab frame, the speed of light is always c. So regardless of the glass's movement, the light's speed is c. So the answer would be 1, option B.

But why is that? Because in the problem statement, the glass is a medium, but the speed of light in a vacuum is c, and even in a medium, from an external frame, the speed would still be c because of how relativity works.

Wait, but in the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But that's in the glass's rest frame. From the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, the speed would be different. But according to relativity, all observers measure the same speed of light in a vacuum. But in this case, the light is in a medium. So perhaps the speed of light in the medium is c/n in the medium's frame, but when the medium moves, the lab frame would measure a different speed.

But this contradicts relativity. Oh, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming non-relativistic speeds, so using the Galilean addition. In that case, the speed would be c/n + v. But since c=1, that would be (1/n) + v. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, but in the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v ). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the velocity addition from the lab frame. Let me think again.

In the glass's frame S', the light speed is u' = c/n in the direction of motion. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame S. So, according to the velocity addition formula, u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ).

Substituting u' = c/n, c=1:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n)*v ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Which is option A.

But if this is the case, then the speed isn't c. But according to relativity, shouldn't the speed of light be c in all frames? So this creates a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is not considering relativity, but using Galilean addition, but that would give u = c/n + v. But that doesn't match any option either.

Wait, but the problem says "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer". So perhaps we're not considering the speed of the light in vacuum, but the speed within the glass. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the speed of the light inside is different. But in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n in that medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, the speed as measured in the lab would be different.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame is c, regardless of the medium's motion. So that can't be. So perhaps this problem is not following relativity, or it's considering a classical approach, where the speed is c/n + v, but that doesn't match any option.

Wait, but the options are A and B. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the Doppler effect, but I don't think so. The Doppler effect is about frequency and wavelength, not speed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity addition formula. Let me recheck.

The correct formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v / c² )

So with u' = c/n, c=1,

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) v ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

That's option A.

But according to relativity, the speed of light can't be more than c. Let's see, for n>1, which glass is, and v positive.

So denominator is n + v, numerator is 1 + n v.

If v is positive (same direction as light and glass), for small v, the expression is approximately (1 +n v)/(n + v) ≈ (1/n)(1 +n v) / (1 + v/n) ) → 1/(n) (1 +n v) (approx 1/n + v )... Hmm.

Wait, but for example, if n=1 (which would be a vacuum), then u = (1 + v )/(1 + v )=1, which is correct because in vacuum, the speed is c=1 regardless of v.

Another example: Let n=2, v=0. Then u=(1+0)/(2+0)=1/2, which makes sense because light in glass with n=2 has speed c/2.

If n=2, v=0.5, and c=1. Then u=(1 +2*0.5)/(2 +0.5) = (1+1)/(2.5)=2/(2.5)=0.8. So the speed is 0.8, which is less than c=1, which is okay.

But according to relativity, regardless of the medium, the speed of light should be c in the lab frame. But according to this calculation, it's less than c when the medium is moving. So this suggests that the problem is not considering relativity, perhaps it's a classical scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the relativistic velocity addition, but in that case, the speed would still be c. So there's some confusion here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the speed of light in the lab frame, but about the speed of the light as measured in the lab. But according to relativity, it must be c.

Hmm. So the options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v )

B)1

So perhaps the correct answer is B, which is 1, because the speed is always c.

But earlier calculation with velocity addition gives A. So which is correct?

I think the key here is that the problem is about the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab. But according to special relativity, light's speed is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or medium. So, even if the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is c, so the answer is B.

But then why does the calculation give A? Because perhaps the problem is assuming a non-relativistic scenario where the medium's motion affects the speed.

Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says, the glass is moving at constant velocity, so it's in an inertial frame. So according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame must be c.

So the correct answer is B)1.

But then why would the velocity addition formula not apply correctly? Because light's speed is c regardless.

So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the speed within the moving medium, not the absolute speed. But that's probably not the case.

Wait, let me think differently: the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the glass's rest frame. But when the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, the speed of the light as measured in the lab is not simply c/n + v. Because the medium is moving, but light's speed is still c in the lab frame.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in the glass as measured in the lab is c, regardless of the glass's motion. So the answer is B)1.

So why is option A an option? Because if you apply the velocity addition formula in a non-relativistic way, perhaps you get A, but in reality, it's B.

But I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. I need to clarify.

In relativity, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the source's motion or the medium's motion. So in the lab frame, even if the glass is moving, the light's speed is c, so the answer is B.

But the initial calculation using velocity addition gives option A. So perhaps the problem is intended to be non-relativistic, but that's unclear.

The problem statement doesn't specify whether to use relativistic or classical approach. Hmm.

But given that it's a multiple-choice question, and the options are A and B, perhaps the intended answer is B)1.

Wait, but the problem says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory". So that's different from the speed of light in a vacuum. Because in the glass's frame, it's c/n, but in the lab frame, perhaps it's c, because light's speed is always c.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because if the medium is moving, the light's speed in the medium is influenced by the medium's motion. But according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. Since it's in the glass, the speed of light is c/n in the glass's frame. From the lab frame, if the glass is moving, the speed would be u = (c/n + v). But this is only valid if v is small compared to c. But in reality, according to relativity, it's not additive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic velocity addition formula, which gives option A.

But I'm getting myself really confused here. I think the correct answer is B)1, because the speed of light in the lab frame must be c. So the answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the speed of light in a glass medium relative to an observer in the laboratory. The glass has an index of refraction \( n \) and is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as \( c = 1 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in the Glass's Rest Frame**:  
   In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \). Thus, the speed of light in the glass is \( 1/n \).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:  
   To determine the speed of light in the lab frame, the relativistic velocity addition formula is applied:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Here, \( u' = 1/n \) (speed of light in the glass's rest frame), and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. Substituting \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]
   This matches **Option A**.

3. **Relativity and the Speed of Light**:  
   According to the principles of special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always \( c \) in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or medium. However, the problem explicitly asks for the speed of light **in the glass** relative to the observer in the lab. This refers to the speed of light within the medium, not in a vacuum. Thus, the relativistic velocity addition formula is appropriate for this scenario.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the result from the relativistic velocity addition formula and is consistent with the problem's context.  
   - **Option B**: \( 1 \) would imply the speed of light in the lab frame is \( c \), which is incorrect because the problem asks for the speed of light **in the glass**, not in a vacuum.  
   - **Options C and D**: These do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the problem's setup.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately reflects the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame using the relativistic velocity addition formula.
