Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think this through.

First, the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait—wait, when they say their speeds are given, are they in the same reference frame? Like, are these speeds as measured from the same inertial frame? I think so, because the problem doesn't mention anything about different frames of reference. So I guess both are moving in the same direction in the same frame.

But wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. Oh right! Because each is moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds in the non-relativistic sense. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add like that. So I'll need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, but wait again. The velocity addition formula is used when you have two frames moving relative to each other, but in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction in the same frame. So the relative speed between them would be the difference of their velocities, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no. Let me correct myself. The velocity addition formula is used to find the velocity of an object as seen from another frame that's moving at a certain speed relative to the first frame. So if I'm in the same frame as the initial measurements, then the relative speed between the two astronauts would be the difference between their speeds. But wait, that's only true in the non-relativistic case. When speeds are a significant fraction of c, we can't just subtract the speeds. So I need to calculate it using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So if both are moving in the same direction, and I'm in the same frame as the original measurement, then the relative speed between them is u' minus v, but adjusted relativistically. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it like this: from the perspective of the first astronaut (the one moving at 0.6c), what is the speed of the second astronaut (moving at 0.5c in the same direction)? Or vice versa.

Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the relative speed as seen by one of them. Hmm, the question says 'relative speed', but does it specify whose frame? Oh, I think the question is phrased as their relative speed from the perspective of the original frame. Or perhaps it's the speed between them as measured in that frame. But wait, no, the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. Because if they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted by relativistic effects.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step.

First, the velocity addition formula in special relativity. If an object is moving at speed u in a frame moving at speed v relative to the original frame, then the speed in the original frame is given by (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(c²)).

But wait, in this case, perhaps I want to find the speed of the second astronaut as observed from the first's frame. Or the other way around.

Wait, no, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the same direction in the lab frame. So from the lab frame, the first is moving faster than the second. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, how fast is the second moving?

Wait, perhaps the relative speed is the speed of the second as observed from the first's frame. So in that case, I can use the velocity addition formula. Let me think: the lab frame sees astronaut A moving at 0.6c and astronaut B moving at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, since A is moving at 0.6c in the lab frame, then to find the speed of B as seen by A, I should apply the formula where u is the velocity of B in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of A's frame relative to the lab.

Wait, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (A's frame) relative to the lab.

So in this case, u is 0.5c (B's speed in lab), and v is 0.6c (A's speed in lab). So the velocity of B as seen from A's frame is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Simplify numerator: (−0.1c).

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (−0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ −0.142857c. So the magnitude is about 0.1428c, but since it's negative, it means B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A. Wait, but that can't be right because both are moving in the same direction in the lab frame. Hmmm.

Wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. Oh, wait, no. Because in the lab frame, A is moving faster than B, so from A's perspective, B is moving backwards. So the relative speed is 0.1428c in the opposite direction. But the question probably just wants the magnitude of the relative speed, so about 0.14c.

Alternatively, maybe the relative speed is in the same direction, but I think the formula would give the correct negative value, indicating direction. But the problem doesn't specify direction, just asks for the relative speed. So the magnitude would be approximately 0.14c.

Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a clue.

Now, moving on to the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 *3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this calculation.

So the relative speed is 0.14c (so options C or D), and the energy is approximately 5.96 mc², so option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system based on the given data.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). To find the relative speed between them, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut in the lab frame),
- \( v = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut in the lab frame).

Substituting the values:

\[
u' = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
u' = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates that the second astronaut appears to move backward relative to the first astronaut. The magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass \( = 2m \),
- Speed \( = 0.6c \).

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass \( = 3m \),
- Speed \( = 0.5c \).

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
- The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), which matches options C and D.
- The total energy is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \), which matches option C.

Thus, the correct answer is:
