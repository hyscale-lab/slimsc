Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for distance in terms of parallax is usually something like distance is 1 over parallax, but wait, there's also a factor like parsecs. Oh wait, the formula is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

So the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, that would make 1/plx equal to d. So substituting that in, 1/plx^5 is (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1 over plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as the distance d increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of d.

But wait, the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. So it's the change in the number of stars as a function of distance. Oh, right, because when you observe a region, more distant regions might have more stars for some reason.

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused. So the problem states that the number of stars is inversely proportional to plx^5. So, N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that gives N = k * (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance? Like, as you go further away, how does the count per unit distance change. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to find the differential number of stars per unit distance. So, perhaps I need to express N as a function of d, find dN/dr, and see how that scales.

Wait, let's see. If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would go as r^4. Wait, but the options are in terms of r, not d. Oh, I think in this context, r is the same as d, the distance. So the change in number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d, so 1/plx^5 is d^5. Hence, N ∝ d^5. But that's the total number of stars up to a distance d.

Wait, but if I have N as a function of d, the total number up to d, then dN/dr (the number of stars per unit distance) would be the derivative of N with respect to d. So N = k d^5, so dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, that becomes N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But when considering the number per unit distance interval, it's the derivative, which is 5d^4. So the number per unit distance (i.e., the density) increases as d^4. So the correct answer would be option C, which is r^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So that would be the correct answer.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax \( \text{plx} \) as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax is inversely related to distance \( d \) (in parsecs) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the proportionality, we find \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

However, the question asks how the number of stars changes *per unit range of distance* \( r \). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( d \), which represents the number of stars per unit distance. Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( d^4 \), or equivalently \( r^4 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is **C) ~ \( r^4 \)**.
