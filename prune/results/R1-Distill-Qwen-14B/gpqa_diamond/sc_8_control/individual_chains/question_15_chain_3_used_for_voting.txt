Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting exoplanets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since it orbits faster. Both have circular orbits.

The host stars have the same radius, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as the one with Planet_2. Wait, same radius but different masses? Oh right, more massive stars can be bigger, but in this case, they have the same radius. Interesting. So, maybe the Planet_1's star is more massive but same size, which might affect the probability of transit.

I remember that the transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star. The formula for the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2, but wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The actual probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbit is more aligned with our line of sight. The probability is higher if the planet's orbital plane is more likely to cross our line of sight, which depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Oh wait, the formula I think is P = (R_star / a) because if the planet's orbital distance is much larger than the star's radius, the chances of the planet passing in front are lower. So, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), but wait, actually, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by something else... Or wait, no, the actual probability is ( (R_star) / (a) ) * (1 / (1 - (R_star/a)^2 )^0.5 ) ) or something more complicated. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think the probability of a transit is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly (R_star / a). So higher a (farther planet) would lower the probability. So the closer the planet is, the higher the chance of a transit.

Wait, but in this case, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, which means it's closer to its star than Planet_2. Because the period is shorter when you're closer. Right, Kepler's third law: P^2 is proportional to a^3 / M_star. So Planet_1's period is P, Planet_2 is 3P. So for Planet_1, a is shorter. So a1 = ( ( (P1^2) * M_star1 ) / (4π²) )^(1/3), while for Planet_2, a2 = ( ( ( (3P)^2 ) * M_star2 ) / (4π²) )^(1/3) ).

Wait, but M_star1 is 2*M_star2. Let me compute the a1 and a2.

Let me denote M2 as M, so M1 = 2M. Then:

a1^3 = ( (P1^2) * (2M) ) / (4π²) )

a2^3 = ( ( (3P)^2 ) * M ) / (4π²) )

Simplify this. Let's compute a1 and a2 in terms of M and P.

Compute a1^3 = ( (P^2) * 2M ) / (4π²) ) = (2 M P^2) / (4π²) ) = (M P^2) / (2π² )

a2^3 = (9 P^2 * M) / (4π²) ) = (9 M P^2) / (4 π² )

So a1^3 = (M P^2) / (2 π² ), a2^3 = (9 M P^2) / (4 π² )

Wait, let me compute the ratio a2/a1.

Let me compute a2^3 / a1^3 = [ (9 M P^2)/(4 π²) ) ] / [ (M P^2)/(2 π²) ) ] = (9/4) / (1/2) ) = (9/4) * (2/1) )= 9/2 = 4.5

So a2^3 = 4.5 a1^3 → a2 = a1 * (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ a1 * 1.65. So a2 is about 1.65 times a1.

So a1 = a2 / 1.65 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the exact cube roots.

Wait 4.5 is 9/2. Cube root of 9/2 is cube root of 4.5. Let me think, 1.6^3 is 4.096, which is about 4. So 4.5 is a bit higher, so cube root is about 1.65.

So a2 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So a1 is shorter, meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star.

Now, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a), because the probability is about (R_star / a) multiplied by (something else?), but I think the main factor is (R_star / a). Since both stars have the same radius, R.

So the probability for Planet_1 is (R / a1), and for Planet_2 it's (R / a2). Since a2 is 1.65 a1, then (R/a2) = (1/1.65) (R/a1).

So Planet_1's probability is higher.

But let's compute the ratio of probabilities.

P1 = R / a1

P2 = R / a2

P1/P2 = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2/a1.

From earlier, a2 = 1.65 a1 → a2/a1 = 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait, no: P1 is (R / a1), P2 is (R / a2). So P1 = (a2/a1) * P2. Since a2 is larger than a1, a2/a1 is 1.65, so P1 = 1.65 * P2.

So Planet_1 has a transit probability that's 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

So the researchers would choose to observe Planet_1 because it's more probable to transit.

Wait, but wait another thing. The RV method gives the minimum mass, but the actual mass could be higher if the inclination is not 90 degrees. But since they already know the masses, maybe the inclination is known? Or perhaps their RV detection already tells us that the planets have certain inclinations, but I think it's not directly relevant here. Because the transit probability is about the geometry, which depends on the star's size and the planet's distance.

So, given the same R_star, since a1 is smaller than a2, the probability of transit is higher for Planet_1.

So looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher than our calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Did I make a mistake in a1 and a2? Let's see.

Given:

P1 = P (since Planet_1's period is 3 times shorter than Planet_2's, so P1 = P, P2 = 3P)

M1 = 2 M2. Let me denote M2 as M, so M1 = 2M.

Using Kepler's third law:

a^3 = (G * (M_star) * P^2 ) / (4 π² )

So a1^3 = (2M) * P^2 / (4 π² )

a2^3 = M * (3P)^2 / (4 π² ) = M * 9 P^2 / (4 π² )

So a1^3 = (2M P^2) / (4 π² ) = (M P^2) / (2 π² )

a2^3 = (9 M P^2) / (4 π² )

Compute a2^3 / a1^3 = [ (9 M P^2)/(4 π²) ) ] / [ (M P^2) / (2 π²) ) ] = (9/4) * (2/1) ) = 9/2 = 4.5.

So a2 = a1 * (4.5)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65 a1.

So the ratio a2/a1 is 1.65, so a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is (R_star / a1) = R/(a1) = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 (R/a2) → which is 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's probability.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher by 1.65 times. So the researchers should choose Planet_1, which has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but another thought: is the transit probability only (R_star / a), or is there another factor? I remember that the true probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance, but adjusted for the orbital distance. Wait, the probability is actually (R_star / a) * (something else). Let me think again.

The transit probability is the fraction of the orbit where the planet's position would cause a transit. It's given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a.

So yes, our initial calculation holds.

So the conclusion is that Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, about 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So the researchers should observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says that.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters. Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (three times shorter than Planet_2), meaning it orbits closer to its host star. The host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2, but both stars have the same radius.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) of a planet's orbit is proportional to \((P^2 M_{\text{star}})^{1/3}\). For Planet_1 (\(P_1\)) and Planet_2 (\(P_2 = 3P_1\)), with \(M_1 = 2M_2\), we calculate the ratio of their semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_2^3}{a_1^3} = \frac{(3P_1)^2 M_2}{P_1^2 (2M_2)} = \frac{9M_2}{2M_2} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]

Taking the cube root, \(\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65\), so \(a_2 \approx 1.65a_1\). This means Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

The probability of a transit is approximately proportional to \(\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}\), where \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius, the transit probability for Planet_1 is:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}
\]

The ratio of probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1}}{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
