Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, I need to look at each of the given compounds and determine if they have any such centers.

The question lists four compounds: 1, 2, 3, and 4. I need to see which of these exhibit optical isomerism. The options given are A, B, C, D, each pairing some of these compounds.

Let me go through each one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, that's a mouthful. So, it's a biphenyl structure with substituents. The 6,6' positions have nitro groups, and the 2,2' positions have carboxylate groups attached as methyl esters. Biphenyls can have stereoisomerism depending on the substituents. If the substituents are in positions that allow for cis or trans arrangement, they might form geometric isomers. But for optical isomerism, we need chiral centers. Are there any carbons attached to four different groups here? The biphenyl itself doesn't have a chiral center unless the substituents are arranged in a way that creates one. Wait, the substituents are on 2 and 6 positions. If the two nitro groups are on opposite sides, but wait, no. Let me think about the structure. Biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at 2 and 2', and 6 and 6'. So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6 relative to the connecting bond. Oh wait, in biphenyl, the positions are such that 2 and 6 are adjacent. So, for each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, meaning they're on adjacent carbons. Wait, but the biphenyl structure isn't a chiral center. Do the substituents create any chiral centers? Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, let me think again. The structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So for each ring, there's a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, the substituents are on adjacent positions on each ring. Let me imagine: ring A has nitro at 6, ring B at 6. And each also has a carboxylate at 2. Wait, if the substituents on both rings are arranged symmetrically, maybe the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for some kind of stereoisomerism. Wait, but biphenyls in general don't have a chiral center unless there's some kind of substituents that create one. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let's consider: each substituent on each ring is at 2 and 6. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). So, for each ring, the substituents are para to each other? No, 2 and 6 are adjacent. Wait, in a benzene ring, numbering goes like this: positions 1, 2, 3, etc., around. So, 1 is where the biphenyl is connected. 2 is next to it, 3 is opposite, 4 is next but on the other side, 5 is opposite to 2, and 6 is next to 1. So, 2 and 6 are adjacent. So each ring has a nitro at 6 (adjacent to the connecting bond) and a carboxylate at 2 (next to the connecting bond). So, for each ring, substituents at 2 and 6 are adjacent. Wait, but for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. So, on ring A, the substituents are at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). Similarly for ring B. So, each ring has two substituents adjacent to the connecting bond. Hmm, but in such a case, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, like same on both, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and so no chiral centers. Wait, but the substituents are at 6,6' and 2,2'. So, the two substituents on each ring are adjacent, but the molecule overall might have a symmetry. So, if the substituents are on each ring in the same positions, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement around the central bond leads to a possibility of stereoisomerism, but I'm not sure. Another angle: do the substituents create any chiral centers? Let's see. The central atom (the one connecting the two benzene rings) is a carbon? No, wait, biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So the connecting bond is between two carbons, each part of their respective benzene rings. So, each carbon is part of a benzene ring, so it's sp2 hybridized. So, each of those carbons can't be a chiral center because they don't have four different substituents. So, perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the propanoate has a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, right? 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or wait, wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. Then the methyl ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2OH-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate part is three carbons. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate. Alternatively, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, for 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that carbon adjacent to the COO group is CH2OH. Let me see: the carbons are 1 (COOCH3), 2 (OH), 3 (CH3?) Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Let's perhaps draw it.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl group on the middle carbon. So, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, propanoate is:

CH2-CH2-COO-

But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon (the middle one). So the structure is CH2-CH(OH)-COO-.

Wait, but that's impossible because the middle carbon (second) would have four bonds: two from the CH2 groups, an OH, and a COO-. Wait, no: the second carbon is connected to the first (CH2-), the third (COO-), and has an OH and a hydrogen? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, but that can't be right because that's three carbons: CH2(OH)-CH2-COO-? No, that's four carbons, because CH2(OH) is one, CH2 is another, then COO-. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-:

Carbon 1: COO-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3CH2COOH. So the propanoate ester would be CH3CH2COOCH3, but that's the methyl ester. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is HOCH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. The formula is HOOC-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, because if it's 2-hydroxy, the OH is on the second carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure is HO-CH2-COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right.

Wait, the formula for propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon. So, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The second carbon (CH2OH) is attached to:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2-
- COOCH3
- a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Wait, the central carbon (the second carbon) in 2-hydroxypropanoate is connected to:

- OH group
- CH2COOCH3 group
- two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me see. The carbon chain is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon is the central one. It's connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2OH)
- The third carbon (CH2)
- COOCH3
- a hydrogen?

Wait, no. Let me think: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (second) is connected to:

- a CH2OH group (on one side)
- a CH2 group (leading to COOCH3)
- a hydrogen (maybe?), but wait, wait, perhaps not.

Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2. So, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: CH2OH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. No, wait, that's more like 3-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the middle carbon.

So structure would be CH2OHCH2COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the middle carbon (second) as CH2. So the second carbon is connected to:

- CH2OH (from carbon 1)
- CH2 (to carbon 3)
- a hydrogen?

Wait, that's not possible. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, with the second carbon being CH2. So, the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- two CH2 groups (from carbons 1 and 3) and two hydrogens. Wait, that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: in the compound methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- One OH group
- One CH2 group (connected to COOCH3)
- Two CH2 groups? Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. No, because that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as well. Wait, no, that would be 3-hydroxy. Wait, I'm getting myself more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the possibility of a chiral center regardless of the exact structure. Let's say the central carbon is attached to:

- An OH group
- A methyl group (from COOCH3)
- Two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon has four different groups attached. Let's see: if the central carbon is CH2, that's not possible. Wait, no, because that would mean it's CH2, which can't be a chiral center. Alternatively, wait a second: perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. In that case, the central carbon (the second) would be bonded to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- an OH group
- a hydrogen.

If that's the case, then the central carbon is connected to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, yes, that would be a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the second) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third)
- OH
- H.

Yes, all four substituents are different. So that's a chiral center. So compound 2 is capable of optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. So, the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a ketone oxygen, and another group. Wait, the central carbon is connected to:

- Two phenyl groups (same)
- One ketone group (O)
- One hydrogen (since it's a ketone).

Wait, no. Wait, benzophenone is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The carbon in the ketone is the central carbon. It's connected to two phenyl groups, one oxygen (double bond), and perhaps a hydrogen? No, wait, the structure is:

Ph

|
C=O

|
Ph

Wait, no, perhaps it's Ph-CO-Ph. So the central carbon is double-bonded to O, and connected to two phenyl groups. So, the substituents on the central carbon are:

- Two phenyl groups (same)
- One double bond to O (so, a double bond, which is a substituent)
- One single bond to nothing else, because it's a ketone.

Wait, no, in a ketone, the structure is R-CO-R'. So the central carbon is connected to two R groups and a double bond to O. So, for benzophenone, the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double-bonded O. So, substituents are two phenyls, and the double bond (which is a substituent). But wait, the central carbon has only three substituents (two phenyls and the double bond to O). So, it's sp2 hybridized, and thus can't be a chiral center, because chiral centers are sp3. So, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the acid form, but dimethyl fumarate would be the diester. Fumaric acid is a diacid, so dimethyl fumarate would have two ester groups. The structure of fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. As an ester, dimethyl fumarate would be (CH3O)2CCH=CHCOOCH3? No, wait, let me think. Fumaric acid is (Z)- or (E)-, but wait, no, fumaric acid is actually the (E) isomer of maleic acid. Wait, maleic acid is (Z), fumaric is (E). But that's about geometric isomerism. For optical isomerism, we need chiral centers.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, the fumarate is a substituted maleate or fumarate, which has a double bond. So, the structure is CH2CH2 with substituents on each end. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but that's not correct. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the structure has a double bond between the two middle carbons, and the two COOH groups are on either end, opposite each other. So, when esterified with methanol, dimethyl fumarate would have two ester groups: (COOCH3) groups on each end. So, structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)? No, more accurately, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. No, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that's not correct because that would imply two ester groups on the same carbon. Wait, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)? No, no. Wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)? No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH(COOCH3). No, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, no, that's not right. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. Wait, no, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the structure has a double bond between the two middle carbons.

So, when esterified, dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl ester groups on each end of the double bond. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, but that would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the double-bonded carbons has a COOCH3 group.

Wait, wait, the structure would be O=C-OCH3 on both ends of the double bond. So, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that's not possible because each double bond carbon can have two substituents. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3). No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a CH2 group, C2 has two COOCH3 groups. Wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)2C=CH2. No, that's incorrect.

Wait, regardless of the exact structure, the key point is whether there's a chiral center. Since fumarate has a double bond, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me consider the structure of dimethyl fumarate. If the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (two COOCH3 groups on each end), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule is symmetrical, and thus not chiral. But wait, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then optical isomerism is possible.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each of the carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, each double bond carbon is attached to two identical substituents (COOCH3), meaning they're not chiral centers. Wait, but in the case of fumarate, the double bond is between C1 and C2, with each of those carbons attached to two ester groups. So, each of those carbons has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. But wait, no, perhaps each of those carbons has two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups, but wait, that would be four substituents, but in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other atoms in the double bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the possibility of a chiral center. If a carbon has four different substituents, it's a chiral center. In dimethyl fumarate, are any of the carbons attached to four different groups?

Wait, the COOCH3 groups are on the same side? No, wait, in the fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite ends of the double bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3). No, wait, that can't be because each carbon in the double bond can only have three substituents. So, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each carbon in the double bond would have two COOCH3 groups attached, plus two CH2 or CH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)-, but that's a single bond. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possibility of a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, wait. Another approach: dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleate has the Z configuration, and fumarate has E. But in terms of optical isomerism, which refers to the presence of chiral centers, not geometric isomerism. So, if the compound has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, considering the structure, perhaps the central carbon (if any) is a chiral center. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, are there any sp3 hybridized carbons with four different substituents?

Alternatively, perhaps the ester groups are arranged in such a way that creates a chiral center. Wait, let's imagine the structure: the molecule has two ester groups on either end of a double bond. So, each ester group is on a carbon that's part of the double bond. Those carbons can't be chiral centers because they're sp2 hybridized. So, perhaps the other carbons are CH2 groups. So, if the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, then the CH2 groups on either end of the double bond would be sp3 hybridized. Are those CH2 groups attached to four different substituents?

Wait, the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would be attached to:

- The double bond (which is a substituent)
- Two methyl ester groups (from the COOCH3 groups)
- And another CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think: the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the two CH2 groups are on either side of the double bond. So, each of those CH2 carbons is connected to:

- A CH2 group (from the other end)
- A double bond (which is a substituent)
- Two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps each CH2 is connected to:

- The double bond (so, two substituents from the double bond)
- Two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about this differently. Dimethyl fumarate is a diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an E-dioic acid. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, that's succinic acid. No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the ester would be (CH3OOC)-CH=CH-(OOCCH3). So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, each of the double bond carbons is attached to:

- A COOCH3 group
- A double bond to the other carbon.

But in this case, each double bond carbon is attached to two identical groups (the COOCH3 groups). So, they can't be chiral centers because they have two identical substituents. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another possibility: perhaps the molecule has two ester groups on each end, making it symmetrical. So, it's not chiral because it's symmetrical.

Wait, but let me think again about the possibility of a chiral center elsewhere. Are there any other carbons in the molecule that are sp3 hybridized and attached to four different groups?

In the structure of dimethyl fumarate, the only sp3 carbons are the ones in the ester groups—specifically, the methyl groups attached to the oxygen. But those methyl groups are attached to an oxygen and are identical on both sides, so they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the two ester groups are on adjacent carbons, leading to the possibility of a chiral center. Let me imagine:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C(=CH2)-COOCH3.

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-C(=O)-OCH3.

No, that's not correct. Hmm, perhaps I should consider that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I might be wrong. Another way: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. For example, if the substituents are mirrored on either side of the double bond, then the molecule is symmetrical. So, in dimethyl fumarate, since both ends have the same substituents (COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical across the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but then why is option A including compound 4 as having optical isomerism? Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the molecule having a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think: if the ester groups are on adjacent carbons, perhaps the central carbon is a chiral center. Let's imagine a structure like CH2-CH(COOCH3)2, but that's a single bond. Wait, no, that's a single bond, so the central carbon would be attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups, but that would require four substituents. So, if it's CH2-CH(COOCH3)2, then the central carbon is attached to:

- Two CH2 groups (one from each adjacent CH2)
- Two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, that's four substituents, but two of them are identical (two COOCH3 groups), so it's not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so based on this, compound 4 doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. Another way: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that's not correct because then each end would have a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, each of the double bond carbons is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, each double bond carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH2 group
- Double bond (so, two substituents from that).

Wait, but each double bond carbon is attached to two identical substituents (the COOCH3 groups), making them not chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another angle: if the molecule has a center of symmetry, it's not chiral. Since the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's achiral.

So, to recap:

1. No chiral centers; no optical isomerism.
2. Yes, has a chiral center; exhibits optical isomerism.
3. No chiral centers; no optical isomerism.
4. No chiral centers; no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought compound 4 might have a chiral center. Did I get that wrong?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center. Let me think: if the two ester groups are on the same side, or opposite sides, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center, not just a double bond.

So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think: if the molecule has a chiral center, it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are each attached to a CH2 group and a COOCH3. So, the structure would be:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)CH2

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-C(=O)-OCH3.

No, that's not right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the possibility of a chiral center in the dimethyl fumarate molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is actually (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester, which is a trans configuration. But that's about geometric isomerism, not optical.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing fumarate with another compound. Another approach: dimethyl fumarate is used as a plasticizer and is known to have certain properties. But I'm not certain about its optical activity.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the ester structure. The ester groups are on either end of the double bond. So, each of the double bond carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each of those carbons is bonded to:

- COOCH3
- CH2 (on either side)
- The double bond.

So, each double bond carbon is bonded to two substituents (COOCH3 and CH2), and the double bond. So, each has two substituents, which are not four, so they can't be chiral centers.

Wait, so dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, looking back at the options, the compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which has a chiral center) and perhaps another.

Wait, let's check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

B) 3 and 4 → both are incorrect.

C) 2 and 3 → 2 is correct, 3 is not.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 is incorrect, 2 is correct.

Wait, but wait, I thought compound 2 has a chiral center and thus optical isomerism. So, which options include compound 2?

Looking at the options:

Option A includes 2.

Option D includes 2.

Option A: 1,2,4 → only 2 is correct.

But according to my analysis, 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism.

So, the only correct compound is 2. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, the correct answer would be the option that includes only compound 2. But none of the options have only 2. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, going back to compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Another thought: perhaps the structure is such that a chiral center exists elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

In this structure, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Carbon 1 is attached to CH2 and COOCH3. Carbon 2 is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So, carbon 1 is connected to:

- CH2
- COOCH3
- double bond to C2.

But that's only three substituents. Wait, no. Wait, each double bond carbon is bonded to two groups. So, carbon 1 is bonded to CH2 and COOCH3, and is double-bonded to C2. So, it's bonded to:

- CH2
- COOCH3
- C2 (double bond).

That's three substituents, so it can't be a chiral center.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each end of the double bond are different, then the molecule could have a chiral center. But in dimethyl fumarate, both substituents on each end are the same (COOCH3), making the molecule symmetrical. So, no chiral centers.

Hmm, so only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, none of the options include only 2. The options are:

A) 1, 2,4 → 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are not.

B)3 and4 → incorrect.

C)2 and3 → 2 correct, 3 incorrect.

D)1 and2 → only 2 correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, and perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, but is there a carbon attached to four different groups somewhere else?

Wait, perhaps the ester groups are on adjacent carbons, leading to a chiral center. Let's imagine the structure as CH2-CH(COOCH3)2. So, the central carbon is attached to:

- two COOCH3 groups (same)
- two CH2 groups (from either side).

Wait, so that's two identical substituents and two identical substituents. So, no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)2CHCH2. But that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the molecule having a chiral center elsewhere. For example, in the methyl ester groups, but those are CH3-O-CO-, which are not connected to four different groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach: which of the options list only compound 2 as correct. The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, but 1 and 4 are not correct.

D)1 and2 → only 2 is correct.

So, if the only correct compound is 2, then the correct option would be D, but option D says 1 and 2. But according to my analysis, 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let's re-examine compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond) with nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate groups (as methyl esters) at 2 and 2' positions.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent on each ring.

Now, looking for a chiral center. The central bond connecting the two benzene rings is a single bond. So, the carbons in the biphenyl are sp2 hybridized and can't be chiral centers.

But wait, could the entire biphenyl system have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral? Or is there a possibility of the molecule being chiral due to the arrangement of substituents.

Wait, in biphenyls, the substituents can lead to different isomerism. For example, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-symmetrical, it can be chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are adjacent. Now, the question is whether this arrangement creates a chiral center.

Wait, but the biphenyl's central carbon is sp2 hybridized and thus can't be a chiral center. So, the substituents on the rings are on sp2 carbons. So, unless the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it might be chiral. But with substituents symmetrical on both rings, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but the substituents are on 2 and 6 on each ring. Are these positions symmetrically arranged? Let me imagine: each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are adjacent. So, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry along the central bond. Thus, it's achiral, and no optical isomerism.

So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options, none have only 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, but 1 and 4 are not correct.

B)3 and4 → both incorrect.

C)2 and3 → 2 correct, 3 incorrect.

D)1 and2 → only 2 correct, but 1 is not.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Let me think: the structure is (COOCH3)2C=CH2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that's not possible because that would be a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but that's a single bond, making the central carbons CH2 groups. So, if it's CH2-CH2 with ester groups on both ends, then the central carbons are each CH2 groups, which are not chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)CH2-CH(CH2COOCH3)-something. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester, which has the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, which has two COOCH3 groups on the same carbon. Then, that carbon would be attached to:

- two COOCH3 groups
- a CH2 group
- a double bond.

So, that's four substituents. But since two are identical (the two COOCH3 groups), it's not a chiral center.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for another way to determine if any of the compounds have a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: for a compound to have optical isomerism, it must have at least one chiral center. So, let's check each compound again.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: No chiral centers. The central bond is sp2, so no.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes, central carbon is a chiral center.

3. benzophenone: No chiral centers.

4. dimethyl fumarate: No chiral centers.

Thus, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none have only 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, but others not correct.

B)3 and4 → incorrect.

C)2 and3 → 2 correct, 3 incorrect.

D)1 and2 → only 2 correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A if my analysis of compound 4 is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH → No, that's succinic acid.

Wait, no, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH.

So, its ester would be (COOCH3)2C=CH2?

Wait, no, that would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has a CH2 group, and C2 has two COOCH3 groups. So, each of these carbons is attached to:

C1: CH2 and double bond.

C2: two COOCH3 groups and double bond.

So, no, no chiral centers. Thus, compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine compound 1. Could it have a chiral center?

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. The substituents are on adjacent positions.

Is there any possibility that the molecule has a chiral center? The central carbon is sp2, so it can't be a chiral center. But what about the other carbons in the rings? Are any of them attached to four different groups?

Each substituent is on a benzene ring carbon, which is sp2 hybridized. So, they can't be chiral centers. Thus, compound 1 doesn't have any chiral centers and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the only correct compound is 2. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps the answer is option A, which includes 2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again: is there any possibility that dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center?

Wait, another angle: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. If not, it's chiral. For dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, so the molecule is symmetrical. Thus, it's not chiral.

So, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't include an option that only includes 2. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 among others, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. Its structure is (CH3OOC)CH=CH(COOCH3). So, each double bond carbon is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH group.

Wait, in this structure, each double bond carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3
- two H's (since it's CH)
- double bond.

So, each is attached to three groups, making them sp2 hybridized. Thus, no chiral centers.

So, I think I'm confident that only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps the answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound 4 is a diastereomer, but that's about stereoisomerism, not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center.

So, to conclude, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and I was wrong about compound 4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me think: perhaps the molecule is arranged such that a specific carbon has four different substituents.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that there's a carbon with four different groups. Let's imagine the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). No, that's a single bond, so the CH2 in the middle would be attached to:

- two CH2 groups (from either side)
- two COOCH3 groups.

No, that's not possible because that would require four substituents, but two are the same.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but the options don't include that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4, but I'm not sure about 4.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let me imagine the structure as CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). In this case, the central CH2 carbon is attached to:

- two CH2 groups (from either side)
- two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, that's four substituents, but two are identical. So, no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), which would have a CH2 group in the middle. But that's a single bond, so the central carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center.

Thus, I'm confident that only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Each of the double bond carbons is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So, each double bond carbon is bonded to:

- COOCH3
- CH2
- Double bond.

That's three substituents, so no chiral centers.

Thus, I'm confident that only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But since the options don't include an option with only 2, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, including compound 4. But I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Wait, another angle: if the ester groups are on different carbons, perhaps creating a chiral center. Let me imagine the structure as CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's a single bond, so the central CH2 is not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two ester groups are on adjacent carbons. For example, (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3). But that's a single bond, so no chiral centers.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted my options. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and I was wrong about compound 4. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. Thus, the correct answer would be option A if it includes 2, but I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A says 1,2,4. So, if I'm confident that only 2 is correct, but the options don't have an option that includes only 2, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis of compound 4. Let me think again: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. For example, if the molecule has a carbon attached to four different groups, like a CH with different substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)CH2CH2(COOCH3). No, that's a single bond, so no chiral centers.

I think I've reached the end of my reasoning. Based on the analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct option would be the one that includes only 2, but since none of the options do, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 also has optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think: perhaps the ester groups are on adjacent carbons, leading to a central carbon that's a chiral center.

For example, if the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH(COOCH3)-CH2, but that's a single bond, making the central carbon a CH, which is attached to:

- two COOCH3 groups
- two CH2 groups.

So, that's four substituents. But two are identical (the two COOCH3 groups), so no chiral center.

Thus, I'm confident that only compound 2 has optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer must be the option that includes only 2. But since none of the options do, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

But looking back, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate's structure is (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). No, that's not correct because each double bond carbon can only have three substituents.

At this point, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option A, including compounds 2, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Optical isomerism occurs when such a chiral center exists.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions. The carbons in the biphenyl rings are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.  
   **No optical isomerism.**

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: a hydroxyl group (OH), a methyl group (CH₃), an ester group (COOCH₃), and a hydrogen atom (H). This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.  
   **Optical isomerism occurs.**

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two phenyl groups. This carbon is sp² hybridized and cannot be a chiral center. The molecule is symmetrical and does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
   **No optical isomerism.**

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (COOCH₃)₂C=CH₂. The double-bonded carbons are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the identical substituents on either side of the double bond, making it achiral.  
   **No optical isomerism.**

### Conclusion:
Only compound 2, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**, exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the analysis, the closest option is **A (1, 2, and 4)**, but compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism. Despite this inconsistency, **A** is selected as the answer.

**Answer: A**
