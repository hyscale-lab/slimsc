Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given quantum state. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So, the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²). 

Wait, but since P_z is an operator, I need to compute the expectation values. Let me jot down the steps:

1. Compute <P_z>: this is the expectation value of P_z. To find this, I need to multiply the state vector by the P_z matrix and then take the inner product with the state vector. Alternatively, since the state is a column vector, maybe I can compute it by matrix multiplication and then take the inner product.

Wait, no, actually, the expectation value is given by ψ† P_z ψ, where ψ is the state vector. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the matrix is diagonal, which might simplify things. Wait, looking at the given matrix for P_z, it's diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ.

The state vector ψ is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
        [1/√2 ]
        [ -1/2 ]

Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, each component corresponds to the eigenvalue. So, the expectation value <P_z> is just the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the components of ψ in that basis are the amplitudes. So the expectation value is sum |a_i|^2 * λ_i, where a_i are the components of ψ and λ_i are the eigenvalues of P_z.

Let me compute the squares of the components first. 

The first component: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Second component: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Third component: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Now, the eigenvalues of P_z are, from the matrix:
First diagonal element: ħ
Second: 0
Third: -ħ.

So <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ + 0 = 0. Oh, interesting. So the expectation of P_z is zero.

Wait, but that's the expectation value. Now, what about <P_z²>? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with the squares of the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues squared are ħ², 0², and (-ħ)². So they become ħ², 0, ħ².

So <P_z²> is sum |a_i|^2 * (λ_i)^2.

So:

(1/4)* (ħ^2) + (1/2)*(0) + (1/4)*(ħ^2) = [ (1/4 + 1/4) ] ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Therefore, <P_z²> = (1/2) ħ².

Then, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ) ħ.

Wait, sqrt(1/2) is 1/sqrt(2), which is the same as sqrt(2)/2. So sqrt(1/2) is equal to 1/√2. So ΔP_z = (1/√2) ħ.

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So that's the answer.

Wait, but just to double-check, did I compute everything correctly? Let me go through the steps again.

The state is given as a three-component vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

Compute the norm: |a1|^2 + |a2|^2 + |a3|^2. 

(1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 +1/4) +1/2= (1/2 + 0.5) = 1. So the state is normalized, which is good.

Then, for <P_z>, since the basis is eigenbasis, each component's square is the probability. So for each term:

P1: 1/4 * ħ = (1/4)ħ

P2: 1/2 * 0 = 0

P3: 1/4 * (-ħ) = (-1/4) ħ

Adding them gives (1/4 -1/4) ħ + 0 = 0. Correct.

For <P_z²>:

P1: 1/4 * ħ^2

P2: 1/2 * 0 = 0

P3: 1/4 * (−ħ)^2 = 1/4 ħ^2

Total: (1/4 +1/4) ħ^2 = (1/2) ħ².

So uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2). So option B.

To find the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the given quantum state, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state vector is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ in the eigenbasis of $P_z$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |a_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|a_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squares of the components of $\psi$) and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The components of $\psi$ are:

\[
|a_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |a_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |a_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, which are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Using the same probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |a_i|^2 (\lambda_i)^2.
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
