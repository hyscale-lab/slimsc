Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. Alright, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (so, not a pure state).

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I think I've seen this before. Oh right, this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because when you have |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, each multiplied by 1/2, it means the qubit is in a completely mixed state, 50% in state 0 and 50% in state 1.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices correspond to points in space. Wait, I remember that for a qubit, the state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has a certain parametrization, right?

So, the general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space with |r| ≤ 1. The point r gives the coordinates on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state, |r|=1, and for a mixed state, |r| is less than 1.

Let me write down the given ρ again. It's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me expand each term. |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the top left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 in the bottom right. Adding them gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. So the density matrix is diag(1/2, 1/2).

Wait, the general form of ρ is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Let me compute each σ matrix. The Pauli X matrix σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when I plug them into the expression, I get:

(I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

I is the identity matrix, so I/2 is diag(1/2, 1/2). Then, the other terms are the off-diagonal and diagonal terms from the Pauli matrices.

So, let's compute each part.

I/2 = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

r_x σ_x /2 is (r_x/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0]].

Similarly, r_y σ_y /2 would be (r_y/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] = [[0, -i r_y/2], [i r_y/2, 0]].

r_z σ_z /2 is (r_z/2) * [[1,0], [0, -1]] = [[r_z/2, 0], [0, -r_z/2]].

Adding all these together:

rho = (I + ... )/2 = [ [1/2 + r_z/2, r_x/2 - i r_y/2],
                      [r_x/2 + i r_y/2, 1/2 - r_z/2] ].

But our given rho is diag(1/2, 1/2). So the off-diagonal terms must be zero. That means r_x/2 - i r_y/2 = 0. So r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because if r_x and r_y are non-zero, their combination would give a non-zero value in the off-diagonal.

Now, looking at the diagonal elements. The (1,1) element is (1 + r_z)/2. Wait no, because in the general form, after adding it all up, the (1,1) element is (1 + r_z)/2. Similarly, (2,2) is (1 - r_z)/2.

Wait, our given rho has (1,1) equal to 1/2. So (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2. Therefore, 1 + r_z =1 → r_z=0.

Wait, let me double-check. The (1,1) element is (1 + r_z)/2. So (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z=0. Similarly, the (2,2) element is (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → same result.

So putting it all together, r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. So the vector r is (0,0,0). That corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but let me think again. The Bloch sphere has a radius of 1, and the origin is the completely mixed state. So yeah, if r is (0,0,0), that's the center. So the density matrix is in the center of the Bloch sphere in the qubit space.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. A general single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector in 3D space with \( |\mathbf{r}| \leq 1 \). The vector \( \mathbf{r} \) determines the position of the state on the Bloch sphere, with pure states lying on the surface (\( |\mathbf{r}| = 1 \)) and mixed states inside (\( |\mathbf{r}| < 1 \)).

For the given \( \rho \), expanding it yields a diagonal matrix:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} (I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}) \), the off-diagonal terms must vanish, implying \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). The diagonal terms give \( (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 \), which simplifies to \( r_z = 0 \). Thus, the vector \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
