Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll give it a go.

So the question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, I don't think the masses directly affect the calculation here since the question is about elemental ratios. Maybe it's just extra info. 

The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW (equivalent width) method. Oh right, EW is a way to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere by looking at absorption lines. The notation [X/Y]_i means the logarithm of the ratio of the number density of X to Y in star i, relative to the Sun.

Let me jot down the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, but in the Sun, [X/H] would be 0 by definition since X is the element in question and H is the reference. Wait, but the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, and [Mg/H] is 0 as well. So the given Sun's data is probably their log(nX/nH) values.

Wait, the question says [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star 1 is higher than in the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3. Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, so Mg is more abundant relative to Si than in the Sun by 10^0.3.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about what these abundance ratios mean.

The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, relative to the Sun. So [X/Y]_star = log10( (nX/nY in star) / (nX/nY in Sun) )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

Wait, but the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, so for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning it's the same as the Sun's Fe abundance.

Same with Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun.

So, now I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need (nSi)_1 / (nSi)_2.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, so I'm assuming it's the number density ratio. Let me think about how to get each nSi.

Let me approach each star separately.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe)_1 / (nH)_1 = (nFe)_sun / (nH)_sun. So the Fe abundance is solar.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But we can express nSi in terms of nFe and nH.

Wait, let's write down the equations for each star.

For Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe)_1 / (nH)_1 = (nFe)_sun / (nH)_sun. Let's denote (nFe)_sun / (nH)_sun as A. Then (nFe)_1 = A * (nH)_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun is (nSi)_sun / (nFe)_sun.

So, (nSi)_1 = (nFe)_1 * (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.

Substituting (nFe)_1 = A * (nH)_1:

(nSi)_1 = A * (nH)_1 * (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.

But A is (nFe)_sun/(nH)_sun. So (nFe)_sun = A * (nH)_sun.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express nSi in terms of nH.

Because (nSi)_1 = (nFe)_1 * (nSi/nFe)_1.

Wait, no: (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun. So (nSi)_1 = (nFe)_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun is (nSi_sun)/(nFe_sun). Let's compute that.

Wait, from the Sun's data, we have:

log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → (nFe/nH)_sun = 10^(-4.5)

Similarly, (nMg/nH)_sun = 10^(-5).

Wait, but (nSi/nH)_sun isn't directly given. Hmm, so maybe I need to find (nSi/nH)_sun from the given data.

Wait, I'm given [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

So perhaps I need to find the solar ratio of Mg to Si, and then relate that to find the solar [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero because [Mg/H] and [Si/H] are zero? Wait, no. Wait, [X/H] is measured relative to H, but [X/Y] is relative to the Sun's X/Y.

Wait, in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is log10( (nMg/nSi)_sun / (nMg/nSi)_sun ) which is zero, but that's perhaps not the case. No, wait, [X/Y] is (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun. So if both are measured relative to H, perhaps I can find (nMg/nSi)_sun from the given Sun's data.

Alternatively, perhaps I can get (nSi)_sun in terms of (nH)_sun.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The Sun's (nFe/nH) is 10^(-4.5), so (nFe)_sun = 10^(-4.5) * (nH)_sun.

Similarly, (nMg)_sun = 10^(-5) * (nH)_sun.

But I don't have (nSi)_sun. Hmm. So maybe I need to find (nSi)_sun in terms of (nMg)_sun and [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, but [Mg/Si]_sun is zero by definition, so (nMg/nSi)_sun = (nMg/nSi)_sun, which is a fixed value.

Wait, but I don't have [Mg/Si]_sun given. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides enough information to find (nSi)_sun in terms of (nH)_sun.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun = 0, so (nMg/nSi)_sun = (nMg_sun)/(nSi_sun) = 10^0 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun)_sun? Wait, no. Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun is (log10 ( (nMg/nSi)_sun / (nMg/nSi)_sun )) which is zero. So that's not helpful.

Hmm, maybe I need to find (nSi)_sun in terms of (nFe)_sun.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But (nSi/nFe)_sun is (nSi_sun)/(nFe_sun). So if I can find that ratio, I can proceed.

But to find (nSi_sun)/(nFe_sun), I need more information. Wait, perhaps the Sun's photosphere has a solar abundance of Si, but it's not given directly. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given data from Star_2.

Let me think about Star_2.

For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

Also, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (nMg)_2 = (nMg)_sun * (nH)_2/(nH)_sun.

Wait, since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, that means (nMg)_2 / (nH)_2 = (nMg)_sun / (nH)_sun.

So, (nMg)_2 = (nMg)_sun * (nH)_2/(nH)_sun.

Similarly, (nSi)_2 can be expressed in terms of (nMg)_2.

Wait, from [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

So, (nMg)_2 = (nSi)_2 * (nMg/nSi)_2.

Substituting, (nMg)_2 = (nSi)_2 * 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

But we already have (nMg)_2 from the [Mg/H] ratio:

(nMg)_2 = (nMg)_sun * (nH)_2/(nH)_sun.

So equate the two expressions for (nMg)_2:

(nMg)_sun * (nH)_2/(nH)_sun = (nSi)_2 * 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

We can rearrange this to find (nSi)_2 in terms of (nH)_2 and known terms.

But (nMg/nSi)_sun is (nMg_sun)/(nSi_sun) = (10^(-5) (nH_sun)) / (nSi_sun).

Hmm, but I don't have (nSi_sun). This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to express everything in terms of the Sun's nH, which I can take as a reference.

Let me denote (nH)_sun = H_sun. So:

(nFe)_sun = 10^(-4.5) * H_sun.

(nMg)_sun = 10^(-5) * H_sun.

We need to find (nSi)_sun, but perhaps I can express (nSi)_sun in terms of (nMg)_sun and the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, but [Mg/Si]_sun is zero because [Mg/H]_sun is 0 and [Si/H]_sun is 0. So (nMg/nH)_sun = (nMg)_sun/(nH)_sun = 10^(-5).

Similarly, (nSi)_sun/(nH)_sun = something we don't know. Let me call this S, so S = (nSi)_sun/(nH)_sun.

Then, (nMg)_sun = 10^(-5) * H_sun → (nMg)_sun = 10^(-5) H_sun.

Similarly, (nSi)_sun = S * H_sun.

So, (nMg)_sun/(nSi)_sun) = (10^(-5) H_sun) / (S H_sun) ) = 10^(-5)/S.

But [Mg/Si]_sun is log10( (nMg/nSi)_sun / (nMg/nSi)_sun ) ) = 0. So that's consistent.

Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Let me think about Star_2 again.

From Star_2:

(nMg)_2 = (nMg)_sun * (nH)_2/(nH)_sun.

And from [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3:

(nMg)_2/(nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun)/(nSi_sun).

So substituting (nMg)_2:

(nMg_sun * (nH)_2/(nH)_sun) ) / (nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/(nSi_sun)).

Multiply both sides by (nSi)_2 and divide by (nMg_sun) gives:

(nH)_2/(nH)_sun) ) = (10^0.3) * (nSi_sun/(nMg_sun)) ) * (nSi)_2.

Wait, maybe not. Let's try to solve for (nSi)_2.

Rearranging, (nSi)_2 = (nMg_sun * (nH)_2/(nH)_sun) ) / [10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/(nSi_sun)) ) ].

Simplify denominator:

10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/(nSi_sun)) = 10^0.3 * (10^(-5) H_sun) / (S H_sun) ) [since nMg_sun=1e-5 H_sun, nSi_sun = S H_sun.]

So,

nMg_sun/(nSi_sun) ) = (1e-5 H_sun) / (S H_sun) ) = 1e-5 / S.

So denominator is 1e0.3 * (1e-5 / S )

So,

(nSi)_2 = [ (nMg_sun * nH2/nH_sun) ] / [10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/(nSi_sun)) ) ]

Simplify numerator: nMg_sun is 1e-5 H_sun.

So numerator is (1e-5 H_sun) * (nH_2 / nH_sun) ) = 1e-5 nH_2.

Denominator is 10^0.3 * (1e-5 / S) )

So,

(nSi)_2 = (1e-5 nH_2 ) / [ 10^0.3 * (1e-5/S) ) ].

Simplify denominator:

1e-5/S multiplied by 10^0.3.

So,

(nSi)_2 = (1e-5 nH_2 ) * S / (1e-5 * 10^0.3 )

The 1e-5 cancels out from numerator and denominator.

So,

(nSi)_2 = (nH_2 * S ) / 10^0.3.

Now, what is nH_2? Because H is the reference, but I don't have any data about the total hydrogen in Star_2. Wait, but perhaps the H abundance affects nH in the same way as other elements, but given that [Fe/H] is 0 for Star_1 and [Mg/H] is 0 for Star_2, maybe their H is the same as the Sun's? No, because [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies (nFe)_1/(nH)_1 = (nFe)_sun/(nH)_sun.

So for Star_1, (nFe)_1 = (nFe)_sun * (nH)_1/(nH)_sun.

But I'm trying to find (nSi)_1 and (nSi)_2, then take their ratio.

Hmm, maybe considering that H's abundance is the same in all stars? No, that's not necessarily true. But in this problem, since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, that means (nFe)_1/(nH)_1 = (nFe)_sun/(nH)_sun → so (nH)_1 = (nH)_sun * (nFe)_1/(nFe)_sun.

But without knowing (nFe)_1, perhaps I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of (nH)_1 and (nH)_2 can be determined based on their masses, but I don't see a direct connection.

Wait, another approach: since we're looking for the ratio (nSi)_1/(nSi)_2, perhaps the nH terms will cancel out.

Let me try to compute (nSi)_1 and (nSi)_2 in terms of (nH)_1 and (nH)_2, then take the ratio.

For Star_1:

(nFe)_1 = (nFe)_sun * (nH)_1/(nH)_sun → because [Fe/H]_1 = 0.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

So,

(nSi)_1 = (nFe)_1 * 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Substitute (nFe)_1:

= (nFe_sun * (nH)_1/(nH)_sun) ) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

The nFe_sun cancels out:

= (nH)_1/(nH)_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_sun.

But nSi_sun is S * nH_sun → because S = nSi_sun / nH_sun.

So,

(nSi)_1 = (nH_1 / nH_sun) * 10^0.3 * (S nH_sun) )

Simplify:

= (nH_1) * 10^0.3 * S.

Similarly, for Star_2, we have:

(nSi)_2 = (nH_2 * S ) / 10^0.3.

Wait, wait, earlier I had (nSi)_2 = (nH_2 * S ) / 10^0.3.

Wait, let me recheck that.

Earlier for Star_2, (nSi)_2 = [ (nMg_sun * (nH)_2/(nH)_sun) ] / [10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/(nSi_sun)) ) ]

Which simplified to (nH_2 * S ) / 10^0.3.

Yes.

So, (nSi)_1 = (nH_1) * 10^0.3 * S.

(nSi)_2 = (nH_2) * S / 10^0.3.

So the ratio (nSi)_1/(nSi)_2 is:

[ (nH_1) * 10^0.3 * S ] / [ (nH_2) * S / 10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify: S cancels.

= (nH1) * (10^0.3) / (nH2) * (10^0.3) )^{-1} × 10^0.3 / 10^{-0.3}?

Wait, let me compute step by step.

(numerator) = nH1 * 10^0.3 * S

denominator = nH2 * S / (10^0.3)

So ratio = [nH1 * 10^0.3 * S ] / [nH2 * S / 10^0.3 ]

= [nH1 * 10^0.3 ] / [nH2 ] * [ 10^0.3 ] / 1

Because S cancels.

So,

= [nH1 / nH2 ] * (10^0.3)^2.

Wait, (10^0.3) * (10^0.3) = 10^(0.6).

So,

= (nH1 / nH2 ) * 10^0.6.

Now, we need to find nH1 / nH2.

Wait, but how? I don't think the problem gives any information about H in the stars. Wait, wait, but perhaps the mass of the star affects the total number of hydrogen atoms in the photosphere. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun, but that doesn't make sense because [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero for each star, but H could vary. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe)_1/(nH)_1 = (nFe)_sun/(nH)_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (nMg)_2/(nH)_2 = (nMg)_sun/(nH)_sun.

But unless told otherwise, I don't think I can relate (nH)_1 and (nH)_2. So perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the hydrogen number density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. Or that the ratio of H in the two stars is 1, i.e., (nH)_1 = (nH)_2 = (nH)_sun. But that's not necessarily true. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H doesn't affect the final ratio because it cancels out.

Wait, looking back at the ratio I have:

(nSi)_1/(nSi)_2 = (nH1 / nH2) * 10^0.6.

But I don't have information about nH1 and nH2. So perhaps I'm missing a step here. Maybe I should find (nH1 / nH2) from the given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] data.

Wait, let's think. For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe)_1/(nH)_1 = (nFe)_sun/(nH)_sun → So, (nFe)_1 = (nFe)_sun * (nH)_1/(nH)_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (nMg)_2 = (nMg)_sun * (nH)_2/(nH)_sun.

But I'm not sure how to relate (nH)_1 and (nH)_2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the stars' overall metallicity is the same as the Sun, but that's not given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the hydrogen density is the same for both stars as in the Sun, so (nH)_1 = (nH)_2 = (nH)_sun. If that's the case, then (nH1/nH2) =1, and the ratio becomes 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4. So the ratio would be about 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close to 4. So is that the answer?

Wait, but let me think again. If the problem says to "assume LTE and using the EW method", but that's standard for abundance measurements. So perhaps the H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. If that's the case, then nH1 = nH2 = nH_sun. Then the ratio (nSi)_1/(nSi)_2 = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, so option A is correct.

But why would the H density be the same? Well, perhaps because in the EW method, the continuum is normalized, and the H abundance is normalized as well. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have H abundances similar to the Sun, making (nH)_1 = (nH)_2 = H_sun, so their ratio is 1.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the metallicity (Fe abundance) is the same as the Sun. But H could vary. But without more info, perhaps the problem expects us to proceed with the assumption that the H is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So then nH1 = nH2 = H_sun, making (nH1/nH2) = 1.

So then the ratio (nSi)_1/(nSi)_2 = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is about 4. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations.

10^0.3 is approximately 2 (because 10^0.3 ≈ 2), so 10^0.6 would be (10^0.3)^2 ≈ 4.

Yes, so the ratio is approximately 4.

So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is about 4. So the answer would be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and use the relationships between elemental abundances.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → \( \frac{n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}}}_{\odot} = 10^{0.3} \)
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → \( \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}} \)

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → \( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}}}_{\odot} = 10^{0.3} \)
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex → \( \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}} \)

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### **Star_1**:
From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe}} \) in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun relative to hydrogen:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{H}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}}.
\]
From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the silicon-to-iron ratio in Star_1 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Fe}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}}.
\]
Thus, the silicon abundance in Star_1 is:
\[
n_{\text{Si}} = n_{\text{Fe}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}}.
\]

#### **Star_2**:
From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg}} \) in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun relative to hydrogen:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{H}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}}.
\]
From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the magnesium-to-silicon ratio in Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{n_{\text{Si}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}.
\]
Rearranging, the silicon abundance in Star_2 is:
\[
n_{\text{Si}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}}.
\]

#### **Ratio of Silicon Abundances**:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\text{Star}_1}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\text{Star}_2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\odot}}}}.
\]
Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}^{\odot} \cdot n_{\text{H}}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}} \) and \( n_{\text{Mg}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}^{\odot} \cdot n_{\text{H}}}{n_{\text{H}}^{\odot}} \), the \( n_{\text{H}} \) terms cancel out, leaving:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}^{\text{Star}_1}}{n_{\text{Si}}^{\text{Star}_2}} = \frac{\left(10^{0.3}\right)^2}{10^{0.3}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio is approximately 4.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **4**.
