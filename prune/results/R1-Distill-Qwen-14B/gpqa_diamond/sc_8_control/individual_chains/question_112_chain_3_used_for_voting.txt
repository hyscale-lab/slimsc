Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first off, I remember that in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors, and |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So that's S_z, I think. But the question is about another operator whose matrix elements are given by A_ij.

The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so for a 2x2 system, which makes sense since we're dealing with up and down spins. Let me visualize this matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0,  hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So this operator is actually the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2, right? Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so multiplying that by hbar/2 would give exactly this matrix. So the operator is (hbar/2) * σ_x.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are used for spin operators. Oh right, so the spin matrices are S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z. So the operator in question here is S_x, the spin-x operator. Because S_x has the matrix [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ].

So the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of S_x, and the average value of S_x.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again. It says: "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix is A_ij". So the eigenstates of S_x are the eigenstates of A, because A is S_x. So we need to find the probability that a measurement of S_x yields each eigenvalue, and the average value of S_x.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the operator is not S_x. Because the way the problem is phrased, the matrix A is given as zero on the diagonal, and hbar/2 elsewhere. So the matrix is:

0   hbar/2
hbar/2  0

Which is exactly the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. So yes, the operator is S_x. So the eigenstates of S_x are the eigenstates that are superpositions of |up> and |down> in equal parts.

So, the process would be: first, normalize the state |alpha>. Because the problem says it's proportional to that, so we need to find the normalization constant.

The state is given as |alpha> = (1+i) |up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me write it as a vector. Let me denote |up> as (1,0) and |down> as (0,1), so |alpha> is (1+i, 2 - i). The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

So, |1+i|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. |2 -i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Now, the question is about measuring in the eigenbasis of S_x. Wait, but S_x has eigenstates that are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because the eigenstates of σ_x are those.

So, to find the probabilities, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of S_x. Let me denote the eigenstates as |+x> and |-x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So we can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

Then, the probabilities of measuring +x and -x are |a|^2 and |b|^2, respectively.

Let me compute a and b.

Expressing |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>

We can substitute |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

We have:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) [ (|+x> + |-x> ) / sqrt(2) ] + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) [ (|+x> - |-x> ) / sqrt(2) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from both terms:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) / sqrt(2) ] |+x> + [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) / sqrt(2) ] |-x>

Wait, let me compute the coefficients step by step. Let me calculate the coefficients for |+x> and |-x>:

Coefficient for |+x> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2))
= [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))
= [ (1+2) + (i -i) ] / (sqrt(14))
= (3) / sqrt(14)

Similarly, coefficient for |-x> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2))
= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(14))
= [ (1-2) + (i + i) ] / sqrt(14)
= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

So, |alpha> = [3 / sqrt(14)] |+x> + [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ] | -x >

Now, the probability of measuring +x is |a|^2 where a is 3/sqrt(14). |a|² = (3²)/(14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857. Which is approximately 0.64.

The probability of measuring -x is |b|^2, where b is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The modulus squared is [(-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of the operator. The operator is S_x, which has eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The expectation value <S_x> is given by <alpha| S_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is expressed as a combination of |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value is |a|^2*(+ħ/2) + |b|^2*(-ħ/2).

But wait, in our case, a is 3/sqrt(14), so |a|²=9/14, and |b|²=5/14.

So <S_x> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9/14 -5/14) ] (ħ/2) ) = (4/14)(ħ/2) ) = (2/7)(ħ/2) ) = ħ/(7).

Wait, because 4/14 simplifies to 2/7. So 2/7 times ħ/2 is (2 * ħ) / (7 * 2) )= ħ/7.

Wait, let me compute this again:

(9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2)
= ( (9 * ħ/2 ) - (5 * ħ/2 ) ) /14
= ( (4 ħ/2 ) ) /14
= (2 ħ) /14
= ħ/7.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. That matches. So the options are:

Option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average ħ/7.

Wait, but let me make sure that's the correct way to compute the average. Alternatively, maybe using the original state and computing the expectation value directly.

Another approach: since the operator is S_x = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], and the state |alpha> is (1+i, 2-i)/sqrt(7).

So the expectation value <S_x> is (1/sqrt(7))² times the conjugate transpose multiplied by S_x and then by the state.

Wait, the state |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, the expectation value is (1/7) [ (1-i) (2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] multiplied by ħ/2, because S_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, matrix S_x is:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

So the expectation is |alpha>^† S_x |alpha>.

Let me compute matrix multiplication:

|alpha>^† is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiplying by S_x:

First row: (1-i)/sqrt(7) * 0 + (2+i)/sqrt(7) * ħ/2 → (2+i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7))
Second row: (1-i)/sqrt(7) * ħ/2 + (2+i)/sqrt(7)*0 → (1-i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)).

Then, multiply on the right by |alpha>:

[ (2+i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ] * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + [ (1-i) ħ/(2 sqrt(7)) ] * (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Let me compute each term:

First term: [ (2+i)(1+i) ] * ħ/(2 *7 )

(2+i)(1+i) = 2(1) + 2i + i(1) + i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

Second term: [ (1 -i)(2 -i) ] * ħ/(2*7 )

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 2(1) -1(i) -i(2) + i^2(1) = 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) )=1-3i.

So putting it all together:

[ (1 +3i) + (1 -3i) ] * ħ/(14 )

The i terms cancel: 1 +3i +1 -3i = 2.

So 2 * ħ/(14 ) = ħ/7.

Which matches what I found earlier. So the average is ħ/7.

So the probabilities are about 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that's the correct choice.

Wait another thing: the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.36. So the options match.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves an electron described by the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( \hat{A} \) with matrix representation:

\[
\hat{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Additionally, the average value of \( \hat{A} \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared norm:

\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

The normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( \hat{A} \)
The operator \( \hat{A} \) corresponds to the spin-\( x \) operator \( \hat{S}_x \), which has eigenstates:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \):

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a |+x\rangle + b |-x\rangle,
\]

where the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) are computed as:

\[
a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad b = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
P(+x) = |a|^2 = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |b|^2 = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( \hat{A} \)
The operator \( \hat{A} \) has eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The average value is:

\[
\langle \hat{A} \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle \hat{A} \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively, and the average value of \( \hat{A} \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar/7 \).**
