Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm. I remember that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diamondoid structure. When it reacts with KOH, probably an elimination reaction occurs because KOH is a strong base. So, heating with KOH, which is a dehydrohalogenation, likely forms an alkene. Since it's 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would form either 1,3-cyclohexadiene or something similar, but wait, adamantane is a cage structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would probably lose two HBr molecules when treated with KOH. Because each Br is on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So eliminating two HBr would form an alkene. But the product has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1 which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's not just elimination; perhaps it's more of an epoxide or a ketone?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. KOH is a strong base, but it's heated. 1,3-dibromoadamantane when treated with KOH might undergo a double elimination, forming a double bond. Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but that would require an oxide ring. Hmm, maybe the reaction is forming an epoxide? Or maybe a ketone through some rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility is that KOH might cause an elimination, forming an alkene, and another reaction. But since the IR shows 1720, which is around where ketones or esters appear. So maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps when the two Brs are eliminated, a carbonyl group is formed. Wait, but elimination of HBr usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's for amides. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, another possibility is that the dihalide is undergoing a dehydrohalogenation twice, forming a diene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? That doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Because when two bromides are next to each other, perhaps they could form an epoxide. But the IR for epoxide would have C-O-C, but maybe not a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the product's NMR. The spectrum has 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is probably a CH2 group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Then the 2.41-2.23 ppm for 10H—those are probably all the adamantane CH groups. 1.94 ppm for 2H, maybe another CH2 group.

Wait, if the product is an epoxide, the NMR would have a triplet for the CH2O group. Or maybe a quartet if coupled with another group. But the IR at 1720 is more indicative of a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait another thought: maybe the KOH is causing a formation of a cyclohexene oxide, but that might not explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening of a dihalide to form a diol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is forming a diketone. How? Oh, wait, when two vicinal dihalides are treated with a strong base, perhaps they could undergo a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't give a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement. Oh! Wait, the pinacol rearrangement involves elimination of water from a diol to form a ketone.

But in this case, the starting material is a dihalide. Oh wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a diene. But that doesn't directly give a ketone.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the product's structure. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a small coupling, maybe around 4-5 Hz. Common for CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen, like in an epoxide or an ether. The IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, perhaps an ester or ketone.

Wait, could it be that the product is a ketone formed via some elimination? Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr to form a carbonyl group, that would require a loss of HBr from each Br and creation of a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, and the IR isn't showing the carbonyl because I'm mistaken. Wait, epoxides have C-O-C, which has an IR absorption around 1200-1300 cm^-1. The 1720 would be a carbonyl, which isn't an epoxide.

Wait, maybe the product is an enol ether. Enol ethers have C-O and adjacent double bonds, but their IR doesn't show a strong carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the 1720 cm^-1 is the C=O stretch. So how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone? Maybe via a ring-opening followed by oxidation. But the reaction is with KOH, a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of adjacent dihalide elimination leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't directly form a ketone. Maybe the diene is then oxidized. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. How? Maybe the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, and when they eliminate, they form a carbonyl group. Wait, that might require a mechanism where each Br is eliminated, but combining to form a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe that's possible via a conjugate elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is adamantanone, a ketone. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr molecules, would form a ketone within the adamantane ring. So, if the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, their elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps via a different mechanism, the ring might rearrange to form a ketone.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's proceed with the assumption that product 1 is a ketone, maybe 1,3-diketone, but the NMR doesn't show a peak where a carbonyl would be (since carbonyl protons are usually not present in ketones, as they don't have H attached).

Wait, wait. The NMR data for product 1 has 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is probably a CH2 group. Then 10H between 2.41 and 2.23, which are likely the adamantane CH groups, and 1.94 ppm for another 2H.

If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's an epoxide derivative or something else. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, another approach: when a dihalide is treated with KOH, it can undergo elimination to form an epoxide if it's a vicinal dihalide. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a 1,3-dihalide, not vicinal. So that might not form an epoxide. Vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) would form epoxides with KOH, but 1,3 is more separated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a diene. But then product 1 would have a double bond. But the IR shows 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide and a ketone? That doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a cyclohexene, but then another reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH isn't acting as a base but as a nucleophile. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 1,3-dibromoadamantane is undergoing a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules, and forming a conjugated diene. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, but how? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr, perhaps in a way that forms a ketone group.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of the benzilic acid rearrangement or similar. Wait, but that's for esters. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether, which would explain the CH2O group. But then the IR would show C-O-C, not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide. That's a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. If product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps it's undergoing some kind of alkylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, say, an adamantane-based ketone, then reacting it with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a strong Lewis acid, might facilitate some kind of acylation or alkylation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, it undergoes ring-opening. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane were to undergo hydrolysis with KOH, perhaps it would form a diol. But then, in that case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm-1 could also indicate an ester group. So maybe product 1 is an ester. But how would that form from a dihalide and KOH? That seems less likely.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and the 1720 is something else. But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is forming a diketone. Let's imagine that product 1 is a diketone within the adamantane structure. Then, when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it undergoes some kind of enolate formation or alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an acid chloride or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Wait, but then IR wouldn't have the 1720 cm^-1.

Wait, maybe the product 1 is an alkene formed via elimination, and the IR is showing a carbonyl from an adjacent group. But that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene, and the IR is showing something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the second step. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then product 2 is ozonolysed.

Wait, ozonolysis of a diene would break it into fragments. But in this case, when ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, which is a reductive workup, it would break any double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps product 2 has a diene, which upon ozonolysis forms product 3 with carbonyl groups.

So, going back, product 1 is a diene, product 2 is perhaps a more substituted diene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would be a dialdehyde or diketone or a combination.

Wait, but product 1's NMR shows a 4.79 ppm for 2H, which could be a CH2O group. If product 1 is a diene, then maybe the CH2O is from an epoxide or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on product 1. Let's try to think again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1.

IR of product 1: 1720 cm^-1 (C=O), so likely a carbonyl group. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm, which is about 4.8, so maybe a CH2 adjacent to O. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone with an adjacent CH2O group.

Wait, but how would that form from a dihalide. Maybe the dihalide is oxidized to a diketone. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a elimination to form a carbonyl. Like in the case of β-halo elimination.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes a double elimination, each Br leaving as Br- and forming a double bond. But wait, forming a double bond would require each C to have a H to eliminate. So, perhaps two adjacent Cs each lose HBr, forming a double bond between them. But that would require the two Brs to be on adjacent Cs, but 1,3-dibromo are not adjacent. So that's probably not possible.

Wait, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent Cs in the adamantane structure, but the numbering is 1 and 3. Hmm, adamantane has a structure where each C is connected in a diamond lattice. Maybe the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent in the structure. Let me visualize: Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions could be on adjacent carbons in one of the rings.

In that case, if they are adjacent, eliminating both HBr would form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene (if that's possible), but that would be a diene. Then, does that explain the IR? No, because diene doesn't have a carbonyl.

But product 1's IR shows a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps elimination forms a carbonyl. Wait, if the dihalide is treated with a strong base, perhaps via a mechanism that forms a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a case of two E2 eliminations, each losing HBr, but in such a way that a carbonyl group is formed. So, for example, in each elimination, a Br is removed along with a H, forming a double bond, but the two eliminations could lead to a conjugated system that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mechanism that converts a dihalide into a ketone. Oh! Maybe it's a case of the formation of a ketone via a double elimination and a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the formation of an enol ether, which upon treatment with acid could form a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Product 1's NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Let me think about what structure would give that. A CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an epoxide or an ether, or an ester. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester.

Wait, but how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form an ester with KOH? That doesn't seem likely. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the triplet is from a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. So, a structure like (CH2)2CO, where the CH2 next to the CO would be split into a quartet or something else.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. If the triplet is for 2H, each of those H's is coupling with two equivalent H's. So, for example, a CH2 group next to another CH2 group. Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to a CH group. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal coupling, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is from a CH2O group, like in an ether or epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on the first step. Maybe I should think about the overall reactions and see if that can help.

Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 1 must be something that, when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, forms a diene.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So, if product 1 is an acyl chloride, then product 2 would be an alkylated product.

Wait, but product 1's IR shows a 1720 cm^-1, which could be an ester or a ketone. If it's a ketone, then maybe product 1 is an enol ether, which upon reaction with Al(i-Pr)3, undergoes some kind of alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it undergoes ring-opening to form a diol, which could then form a diene upon dehydration. But that seems a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it forms an enol ether. But then product 1's IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkylated product. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of product 1 as a diol.

If product 1 is a diol, then product 2 might be a diether or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Then product 2 would be a diol after acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but since it's treated with Al(i-Pr)3, which is a Lewis acid, it might protonate the epoxide and open it. But then product 2 would be a diol, which upon ozonolysis would not do much, because diols don't have double bonds.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a carbonyl, and then product 2 is a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone with a double bond adjacent to it. Then, upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination to form a more substituted double bond, making product 2 a more stable diene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into carbonyl groups, forming product 3.

So, putting it all together:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (with KOH) → product 1 (maybe a ketone with a double bond) → (with Al(i-Pr)3) → product 2 (a more substituted diene) → ozonolysis → product 3 (with ketones or aldehydes).

But how does product 1 have a double bond? Because the initial step is elimination, which would form a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps product 1 has both a double bond and a carbonyl group.

Wait, if product 1 is a conjugated dienone, then upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps it undergoes some rearrangement to form a more substituted diene. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would break into carbonyls.

But I'm getting stuck on the initial step, so perhaps I should try to figure out what the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would look like.

Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of a diene typically forms two carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl. Such H's are usually deshielded because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl. So, for example, in an aldehyde, the H is around 9-10 ppm, but in a ketone, there are no H's attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but if the ozonolysis produces aldehyde groups, then those would have H's that are highly deshielded. So in product 3, perhaps there are aldehyde protons.

But in the question, it says to exclude H's that exchange with deuterated solvent. So, any acidic protons, like aldehyde H's, would exchange with D2O but if the solution is in D2O, those would be exchanged. But in the problem, the NMR is taken in a solution, perhaps in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6, but the question says to exclude those that exchange. So, any -OH or -NH protons would exchange, but aldehyde H's are not typically exchanged under normal conditions, but maybe under certain conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a carbonyl environment but not attached directly, like being adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, but in the ozonolysis product, carbonyl groups would be present. So, perhaps the H's next to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

In the NMR, the coupling pattern depends on the neighboring H's. So, if a H is next to a CH2 group, it would split into a triplet, etc.

Wait, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R', then the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would each have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet. But wait, for each CH2, the two H's would be split by the neighboring CH2 group. So, each H on the CH2 would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

But in product 3, after ozonolysis, perhaps it's a diketone, so the structure might have two ketones. So, maybe the adjacent H's are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Those H's would couple with each other and any adjacent H's.

Alternatively, if the structure is a chain with a ketone in the middle, then the H's on either end would be split.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is (CH2)nCO. Then, the (CH2) group next to the CO would have H's that are deshielded.

Let's imagine product 3 is a diketone, perhaps something like (CH2)2CO-R-CO(CH2)2. Then, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would each have two H's. So, each of these H's would be split by neighboring H's.

Wait, but in that case, each CH2 group would be next to another CH2, so each H would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH2-CO-..., then the CH2 group would have H's that are adjacent to each other. So, each H on the CH2 would have two neighboring H's (from the same CH2) and possibly one from an adjacent group. Wait, no, if it's CH2-CO, then each H on the CH2 is adjacent to another H on the same CH2, so each H would see one neighboring H on the same carbon (which is a geminal coupling, but that's usually negligible in 1H NMR) and perhaps coupling with H's on adjacent carbons.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the possible splitting patterns.

If a hydrogen is part of a CH2 group that is next to a carbonyl group and adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would see two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if the CH2 is next to the carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group, like in a structure like CH2-CO-CH2-R, then the CH2 next to the carbonyl (the first CH2) would be adjacent to the carbonyl and the next CH2. So the H's on the first CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH2. That would make each H's signal a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is more complex, like maybe a cyclic ketone, but I think the problem is more about a linear structure.

So, considering that, the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The coupling would be to two H's on an adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is triplet, which fits this scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another scenario. If the H is on a CH group next to a carbonyl, then it would couple with neighboring H's differently.

Wait, but the most deshielded H is likely to be on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, which would give a triplet coupling pattern.

Wait, but what if the structure is such that the H's are adjacent to more than one set of H's? For example, if the H is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 which is next to another CH2, then each H would couple with two H's from one adjacent CH2 and two from another. Wait, but that would be a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2 group. That could lead to a more complex coupling, like a triplet of triplets.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the structure is CH2-CH-CO-R. The H's on the CH2 would couple with the two H's on the adjacent CH, and those H's on the CH would couple with both the CH2 and perhaps another group.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the H is part of a CH group that is adjacent to two different sets of H's, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

But going back to the initial step, perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis product. Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

Wait, for example, if product 2 is a 1,3-diene, then ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups, possibly ketones or aldehydes, depending on substitution.

So, for a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-..., ozonolysis would form two aldehydes (if terminal) or ketones (if internal).

Assuming product 2 is a conjugated diene, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups in the middle. So, a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R'.

In that case, the H's on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would be deshielded. Each CH2 would have two H's, each coupling with the two H's from the adjacent CH2. So, each of these H's would be a triplet.

So, the most deshielded H's would be on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl, and their coupling would be a triplet.

But wait, perhaps each H on the CH2 is coupled with the two H's from the adjacent CH2 and the two H's from the same CH2 (but that's geminal coupling, which is usually not observed because the splitting is too small). So, each H would see two neighboring H's from the adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

Therefore, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking again at the options, option A is triplet.

So, I think the answer is A) triplet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   When 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, the IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), likely from a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom, and other signals consistent with adamantane carbons. This suggests that product 1 is a ketone, likely formed via a double elimination of HBr, resulting in a conjugated system that includes a carbonyl group.

2. **Reaction with aluminum isopropoxide**:  
   Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates further rearrangement or stabilization of the carbonyl-containing structure, forming product 2. Product 2 likely contains a conjugated diene system, as ozonolysis is performed in the next step.

3. **Ozonolysis of product 2**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide, cleaves the double bond in the diene, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones). Thus, product 3 is expected to contain carbonyl groups.

4. **NMR analysis of product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Such hydrogens are typically on CH₂ groups next to carbonyls. These hydrogens couple with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern. Other coupling patterns (e.g., doublet of triplets or pentet) are less consistent with the described structure.

Based on this analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

Answer: A
