Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out how much longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Let me think through this step by step. Hmm, both planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star wobble.

Wait, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have masses similar to Neptune. So the key here is the Doppler shift, right? The problem gives me the maximum shifts for each planet, 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. I'm guessing the shift relates to the velocity of the star. Oh right, because the star moves in response to the planet's orbit, and the RV method measures this velocity through the shift in spectral lines.

So, the formula that relates the Doppler shift to velocity is the Doppler formula. I think it's something like velocity equals the shift divided by the wavelength, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula. Oh wait, no, the RV method actually measures the star's velocity towards or away from us. The formula is v = (lambda - lambda_0)/lambda_0, where lambda is the observed wavelength and lambda_0 is the rest wavelength. Since the shift is small, we can approximate this as v ≈ delta_lambda / lambda_0. But wait, the question gives the shifts in milliangstroms, so if the wavelength is in the optical range, say around 500 nm (which is 5000 angstroms), then the shift of 5 milliangstroms would be 5e-3 angstroms. Let me compute that: delta_lambda is 5e-3 angstroms. So v would be (5e-3) / 5000 = 1e-6. But wait, that's in terms of units. Maybe I should think of it in terms of proportional velocities because the actual wavelength might not matter here since the stars are the same.

Wait, another approach: since the two stars have the same mass, and the planets have the same mass, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity (K) should be related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. Oh right! The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)) ) * (P)^(-1/3)

Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for circular orbits (e=0) and when the planet mass is much less than the star mass (which is the case here since Neptune is much less than the Sun), K can be simplified. Let me think again.

The formula I think is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too detailed. Let me think of it this way: the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / (P^(1/3))) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another approach is to consider that the maximum Doppler shift (v) is proportional to the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, but since both stars have the same mass (M*) and both planets have the same mass (M_p), and they're detected via RV, the semi-amplitude K (which is the maximum velocity of the star) is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )).

But since M_p << M_*, the denominator can be approximated as M_*^(1/3). So K ≈ (M_p) / (M_*^(1/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)).

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * [ 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) * P ) ) ]^(1/3)

But since e=0 (circular orbits) and M_p << M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( G * M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / P )^(1/3)

So K = ( (G M_p ) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3)

Since both stars have the same M_*, and both planets have the same M_p, the (G M_p / M_*) term is the same for both. So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, because K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), so if K1 is for planet 1 and K2 is for planet 2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant. So K1/K2 = P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

So: (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, no. Because K1 is the velocity shift for planet 1, K2 for planet 2. So if K1 is smaller than K2, that implies that planet 1's star's velocity is smaller, so the period is longer? Or wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if K is the semi-amplitude (maximum velocity), then a larger K would mean a higher velocity, which could be due to a more massive planet, a shorter period, or a lower mass star. But in this case, planet masses are same, stars are same; so K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So higher K would correspond to shorter P. Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1.

Wait, but the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is longer, the answer is greater than 1. If shorter, less than 1.

Wait, but according to the formula, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let's write it:

From K1 = (C) / P1^(1/3)
K2 = (C) / P2^(1/3)
Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)
So, (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)
Take both sides to the power of 3: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1
So, P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1, that would be less than P1. But the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. If P2 is less than P1, then it's not longer; it's shorter.

So let me recheck my equations. Because I think I might have messed up the ratio.

Wait, I think I should have (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Because K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3).

Let me think again: K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^(3).

So K1 = 5, K2 =7.

So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So (7/5) = (P1/P2)^(1/3) → because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, let's derive it correctly. Let me write the K equation again.

K1 = (C) / P1^(1/3)
K2 = (C) / P2^(1/3)

Dividing K2 by K1: K2/K1 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, (K2/K1) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (7/5) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, cube both sides: (7/5)^3 = P2/P1 → 343/125 ≈ 2.744

So P2 is approximately 2.744 times longer than P1.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A: ~0.36, B: ~1.40, C: ~1.96, D: ~0.85.

Wait, 2.744 is not among them. Did I make a mistake?

Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe I confused P1 and P2.

Wait, the problem statement says: the shift of planet #1 is 5, and planet #2 is 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is7.

So, if I have K2 > K1, then according to K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), a higher K implies a shorter period. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So P2 < P1 → P2/P1 < 1.

But the question is asking how many times longer P2 is than P1. Which would be P2/P1. But if P2 is shorter, that ratio is less than 1. So the answer would be less than 1, which would be option A or D.

Wait, but according to the calculation, (7/5) = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → so (7/5)^3 = P2/P1 → 343/125 ≈ 2.744. So P2 is longer than P1 by a factor of ~2.744. But that's not one of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio reversed. Let me check again.

From K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Cubing both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times as long as P1. That would mean that P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~2.75. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1 = 0.364. So approximately 0.36 times as long. So the orbital period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1, which is shorter. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 is shorter (0.36 times as long), so the correct answer is that it's approximately 0.36 times, so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So P2's period is shorter.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter by a factor of about 2.75. So it's not longer at all.

But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer would be that P2 is ~0.36 times as long as P1 → so it's about 0.36 times longer, which is shorter.

Wait, but the question is phrased: "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if the answer is 0.36, that means P2 is 0.36 times P1, so it's shorter. So P2's period is 0.36 times that of P1, meaning it's about 36% as long. So it's shorter, not longer.

So the correct answer would be A, 0.36 times as long. So P2 is ~0.36 times the period of P1.

Wait, but I'm confused because the options don't include a 2.7 factor. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me think again. Let me make sure I got the formula right.

The formula for K (radial velocity semi-amplitude) is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (1 day in seconds) ) * (P) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps I should consider that K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)).

Wait, another approach. I think the formula is:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

Since e=0, and M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and (1 - e²)^(1/2) = 1.

So K ≈ ( G * M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3))

Which can be written as K = ( (G M_p) / (M_*) )^(1/3) / ( P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)), since M_p and M_* are same for both planets.

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1 / K^3.

So, for planet #1, K1 =5, planet #2, K2=7.

So P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3.

Wait, because P is proportional to 1/K^3.

Wait, no: if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then P is proportional to 1/K^3.

So, P1 ∝ 1/K1^3, P2 ∝ 1/K2^3.

So, P1 / P2 = (1/K1^3) / (1/K2^3) ) = (K2^3)/(K1^3) = (K2/K1)^3.

So, (P1/P2) = (7/5)^3 = 343/125 ≈ 2.744.

So, P1 is about 2.744 times longer than P2. So P2 is 1/2.744 ≈ 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter.

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's 0.36 times, so it's shorter.

So the answer is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but the options are asked as how many times longer P2 is than P1. So, the factor is less than one, meaning P2 is shorter. So the answer is 0.36 times as long. Therefore, the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), meaning:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that the two stars have the same mass and the planets have the same mass, the proportionality constant is the same for both planets. Thus, the ratio of \( K \) values is inversely proportional to the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

The problem states that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This result shows that the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.364 \) times the orbital period of planet #1, meaning it is shorter. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is \( \sim 0.36 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
