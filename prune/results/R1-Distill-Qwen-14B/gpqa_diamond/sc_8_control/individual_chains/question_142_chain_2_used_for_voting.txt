Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem gives a density matrix ρ equal to (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). And the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are four different points in 3D space, each with coordinates (r_x, r_y, r_z). Hmm.

Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, while mixed states are statistical ensembles, which have more complicated density matrices.

So what's the structure of a qubit's density matrix? A single qubit's density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form is ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]], where a, b, c, d are complex numbers, and the trace is 1 (since Tr(ρ) = a + d = 1). Also, ρ must be positive semi-definite, which means all its eigenvalues are non-negative and sum to 1.

In this problem, ρ is given as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute that. Each term |n⟩⟨n| is a projector, so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix for 2x2. Then, multiplying by 1/2, I get ρ = 1/2 * I, where I is the identity matrix.

So ρ is a diagonal matrix with entries [1/2, 1/2]. Yes, that makes sense. Because the trace is 1 (1/2 + 1/2 = 1), and it's positive semi-definite since both eigenvalues (1/2 and 1/2) are positive.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, any single qubit state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. For a density matrix, the state is on the surface of the Bloch sphere if it's a pure state, and inside if it's a mixed state.

Wait, but this ρ is a mixed state, isn't it? Because it's a convex combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So the density matrix is in the interior of the Bloch sphere.

How do we find the Bloch vector for a given density matrix? Let me recall. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

So let's expand this. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Given that ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], let's write it using the formula.

So, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. That would be (1/2) * [ [1,0],[0,1] ] + (1/2) [r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Wait, no. Wait, the general formula is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2. So we can rearrange it as:

ρ = (1/2) * (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z )

Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct expansion should be:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ) / 2.

So ρ is equal to 1/2 times the sum of I and the Pauli matrices scaled by the components of r.

Given that, let's compute each term.

First, I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So (I) /2 is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

Next, the other terms:

r_x σ_x = r_x * [[0,1],[1,0]], so (r_x σ_x)/2 is [[0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0]].

Similarly, r_y σ_y is [[0, -i r_y], [i r_y, 0]], so when multiplied by 1/2, it's [[0, -i r_y/2], [i r_y/2, 0]].

r_z σ_z is [[r_z/2, 0], [0, -r_z/2]].

So adding all these together:

ρ = (1/2) I + (r_x σ_x)/2 + (r_y σ_y)/2 + (r_z σ_z)/2.

Which equals:

[[1/2 + r_z/2, (r_x/2 - i r_y/2)], 

 [r_x/2 + i r_y/2, 1/2 - r_z/2 ]]

Wait, let me actually compute each element:

First element (top-left) is (1/2) + r_z/2.

Top-right is (r_x/2 - i r_y/2).

Bottom-left is (r_x/2 + i r_y/2).

Bottom-right is (1/2) - r_z/2.

In the given ρ, it's:

[[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]

So comparing element-wise:

Top-left: 1/2 + r_z/2 = 1/2 → So r_z/2 must be 0 → r_z = 0.

Top-right: (r_x/2 - i r_y/2) = 0 → both real and imaginary parts must be zero.

So r_x/2 = 0 → r_x = 0.

Similarly, -i r_y/2 = 0 → r_y = 0.

So that leaves r as (0,0,0).

Wait, that makes sense. Because the given ρ is a completely mixed state, which is the maximally mixed state. So in the Bloch sphere representation, it's at the center, which is the origin.

So the coordinates would be (0,0,0), which is option C.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a maximally mixed state, meaning it represents equal probability for the qubit to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\), where the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

with \(I\) being the identity matrix and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) being the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the density matrix becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}\), we find:

1. From the top-left element: \(1 + r_z = 1 \implies r_z = 0\).
2. From the top-right element: \(r_x - i r_y = 0 \implies r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the maximally mixed state being at the center of the Bloch sphere.

The correct answer is:
