Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is about a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, so I'm thinking this has to do with the Saha equation, which relates the ionization states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere, taking into account temperature and electron density. Or wait, wait, maybe it's more about the Boltzmann equation since it's about the ratio of populations in two energy levels of the same ion (neutral Ti in this case). Because the Saha equation is for ionization, but Boltzmann is for different energy levels in the same ion.

Right, the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is proportional to the exponential of ( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff drops. Wait, but the spots are dark, so they are cooler regions. So when the star has spots, 40% of its surface is cooler. But how does that affect the overall observed temperature? Oh, wait, the Teff given is the overall effective temperature when 40% is covered. The problem says that the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered.

Wait, but wait, effective temperature is determined by the total luminosity. Luminosity is σ Teff^4 times the surface area. So, when spots cover part of the surface, the total luminosity changes. But the problem says that when the spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's overall emission is as if it's a blackbody at 5500 K.

But how does this relate to the photospheric temperature? Because the spots are cooler, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. Hmm, but the problem states that when the surface isn't covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the effective temperature is lower because the spots emit less.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Oh, wait, but how does the presence of spots affect the photospheric temperature where Ti is located? Does the presence of spots affect the local temperature of the photosphere?

Wait, the problem states that when examining the photosphere, the ratio changes. So perhaps the spots are causing a change in the photospheric temperature. Or maybe the overall star's photospheric temperature is now 5500 K when spots are present. Wait, that can't be right because the star's surface isn't all the same temperature. Wait, the problem says "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." Hmm, maybe that's the average.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the effective temperature is 5500 K, which is an average. But then, when considering the photosphere, the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels is lower when spots are present.

Wait, maybe the star's photosphere is not isothermal. So when 40% of the surface is spotted, that part is cooler (maybe around 5500 K?), and the rest is 6000 K? But the problem says that the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, maybe the average temperature is 5500 K, but the star's surface is a mix of 6000 K and cooler regions. But then, the photosphere as a whole is at an effective temperature of 5500 K.

Wait, but the star's photosphere is in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), so each region has its own local temperature. So maybe I need to model the average ratio of Ti atoms across the entire photosphere when spots are present versus when they're not.

But that sounds complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is approximating the effective temperature as the average, and the ratio is a function of the temperature. But wait, what's the ratio? It's the ratio of two populations in the same atom, so it's governed by the Boltzmann factor.

So the ratio R = N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Assuming that E2 > E1, so the exponent is negative, making the ratio decrease with higher temperature.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). So if the average T is lower, then the exponent term would be larger (since T is smaller, so (E2 - E1)/(k T) is larger, making the exponential smaller). So the ratio R would be smaller when T is lower.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, R is lower, which would be consistent because the effective T is lower. So when the star has no spots (Teff=6000), R is higher than when it has spots (Teff=5500 K).

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R_spotless / R_spotted. So that factor would be (R1) / (R2), where R1 is at 6000 K, R2 at 5500 K.

Wait, but wait, let's think about this. The ratio R is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

So R1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * T1) )

R2 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k * T2) )

Since T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K, and E2>E1, so (E2-E1) is positive.

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ] - [ -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

So the factor is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

But what's E2-E1? Oh, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. That's about 1448 Angstroms, which is in the near UV or maybe visible? Wait, visible light is around 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Å). So 1448 Å is in the near UV, so it's about 144.8 nm.

The energy difference between the two levels can be found using E = hc/λ.

Let me compute E = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters (since 1 Å is 1e-10 m).

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m).

Calculate that:

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but I need E in terms of eV, maybe? Or perhaps in terms of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So to find E in eV:

E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy jump. Hmm, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = ?

Let me compute 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7:

= (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-25+7 = (1.372) * 1e-18 J.

Which is 1.372e-18 J, which is 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV. So about 8.56 eV.

Hmm, that's a big energy difference between the two levels. That's more than typical for many transitions, but maybe it's correct.

Now, the next step is to find the ratio R1/R2, where R1 is at 6000 K and R2 at 5500 K.

So, the ratio R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, wait, no, in the expression earlier:

R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Because the factor was (1/5500 - 1/6000) multiplied by (E2-E1)/(k).

Wait, that's correct.

So T1 = 6000 K, T2 =5500 K.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500/(3.3e7) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1.515e-5).

Wait, but E is about 8.56 eV, which is 8.56 * 1.602e-19 J = approximately 1.37e-18 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So let's compute:

(E2-E1)/(k) = (1.37e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.93e4 K.

Now multiply by (1.515e-5):

9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.503.

So the exponent is approximately 1.503.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.503) ≈ e^1.503 ≈ 4.49.

So the ratio R1 is approximately 4.49 times R2.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So that's R1 (no spots) divided by R2 (has spots), which is 4.49.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, so that's the likely answer.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate E.

E = hc / λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by denominator 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

In eV: 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 = approx 8.56 eV. Correct.

Then (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.56 eV * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (1.38e-23 J/K) 

Wait, perhaps an alternative way to express E in terms of kT.

Because E is in eV, and k in eV/K is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So E = 8.56 eV.

(E2-E1)/(k) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) = approximately 99300 K.

Yes, same as before, ~1e5 K.

Then 1/T2 -1/T1 = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500 *6000) ) = 500/(33e6) )= 500/(3.3e7) = approx 1.515e-5.

Multiply: 99300 K * 1.515e-5 1/K = 99300 * 1.515e-5 ≈ let's compute 99300 * 1.515e-5.

99300 = approx 1e5, so 1e5 *1.515e-5 = 1.515.

So 99300 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 99300 * 0.00001515 ≈ let's compute:

99300 * 0.00001515 = (99300 * 1515e-8) 

Wait, 99300 is about 993e2, 1515e-8 is 0.0001515.

993e2 * 0.0001515 = 993 * 0.0001515 * 1e2.

Wait, maybe another approach: 99300 * 0.00001515 = (approx 100,000 * 0.00001515) = 1.515, but 99300 is 99.3% of 1e5, so 1.515 * 0.993 ≈ 1.503.

So exponent is approximately 1.503.

e^1.503 ≈ e^1.5 is about 4.48, and e^0.003 is ~1.003, so approximately 4.48 *1.003≈4.49.

So the factor is about 4.5, which matches option C.

So the answer should be C) ~4.5.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
R = \frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The problem asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\)) to having spots (effective temperature \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\)).

### Step 1: Energy Difference Between Levels
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), the energy difference is:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Ratio of Ratios
The ratio of the populations at two temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\), \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\), and \(E_2 - E_1 = 8.56 \, \text{eV}\), we calculate:

1. **Energy term**:  
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{(8.56 \, \text{eV})(1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV})}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} \approx 99300 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Temperature term**:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]

3. **Exponent**:  
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (99300)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.503.
   \]

4. **Factor**:  
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.503) \approx 4.49.
   \]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes (no spots vs. spots) is approximately \(4.5\), corresponding to option **C**.

Answer: C
