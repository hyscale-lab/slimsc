Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm not too familiar with Lagrangians, but I think this is describing how the boson X interacts with fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the possible decay channels at the lowest order.

Wait, so the Lagrangian is written in a way that probably couples the boson X to fermions. Let me parse this. The term seems to involve ψ_f, which probably represents a fermion field. The structure looks like it's a Yukawa interaction, similar to how the Higgs field interacts with fermions. In the Standard Model, the Yukawa coupling is something like λ ψ ψ H, where H is the Higgs field. So in this case, X is similar to the Higgs, perhaps — but maybe it's a scalar boson.

The mass of X is 6 GeV, which is an important factor because the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to this. So when the boson X decays, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

But wait, the problem is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So, probably, the decay must proceed via a tree-level diagram. That would mean the decay is direct, without any loops or higher-order processes. So we're looking for decays into fermion-antifermion pairs where each fermion has a mass less than half of 6 GeV (since each would have to have energy at least their rest mass, and the total can't exceed X's mass).

So, the possible decay products would be pairs of fermions where each fermion has a mass m such that 2m ≤ 6 GeV. Because each particle and its antiparticle must each have at least their rest mass. So the maximum mass for each fermion is 3 GeV.

Let me list the known fermion masses to see which ones qualify.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u), Down (d): very light, maybe ~0. few MeV (<<1 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
Wait wait, wait. Let me get the approximate masses right.

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV (511 keV)
Muon: ~0.105 GeV (105 MeV)
Tau: ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
u: about 2-5 MeV (so <<1 GeV)
d: ~3-7 MeV
s: ~95-110 MeV (so ~0.1 GeV)
c: ~1.25-1.5 GeV
b: ~4.1-4.7 GeV
t: ~173 GeV (way too heavy)

So for each fermion, let's see if 2m ≤ 6 GeV.

For leptons:
e: 2m ≈ 0.001 GeV, well under 6. So allowed.
μ: 0.21 GeV, still allowed.
τ: 3.56 GeV. Wait, 2m would be about 3.56 GeV. 3.56 < 6, so yes. So τ and their antiparticles can be decay products.

For quarks:
u and d: 2m is negligible, way under 6 GeV. So their pairs are possible.
s: 2m is 0.2 GeV, allowed.
c: 2m is 3 GeV (since m is ~1.5 GeV), so 3 <6. So c c-bar is allowed.
b: 2m is 8.2 GeV (if m is 4.1 GeV, then 8.2 >6). So b quark pair is not allowed. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

Top quarks are way too heavy, so no.

So the possible fermion pairs are:
electron and positron (e+ e-)
muon and anti-muon (mu+ mu-)
tau and anti-tau (tau+ tau-)
and all the quark-antiquark pairs where the quark mass is ≤3 GeV. So u, d, s, c.

Wait, but what about the quarks? Are all u, d, s, c allowed?

Yes. But wait, the problem says "fermions" — but in the decay, X can decay into any of these as long as the mass allows.

So the possible decay channels would be into any of these fermion pairs where each has mass m ≤3 GeV.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b is 4.5 GeV, so 2m is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b can't be in the decay products. So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but c is 1.5 GeV, so 2m is 3 GeV. That's allowed. So c is allowed. So option B includes c, which is allowed. So in the possible decays.

But wait, what about the quarks? The Lagrangian has ψ_f, which probably refers to all fermions, so any fermion can be a decay product as long as they meet the mass condition.

But wait, wait. Another factor: if the coupling is to all fermions, then any allowed by mass can decay. So in this case, the X boson can decay into any of the possible fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m ≤6 GeV.

So, in the options, which ones include only the allowed fermions.

Option B includes c c-bar, which is allowed (3 GeV), and tau (3.56 <6 GeV), mu (0.21), e (0.001), and s, u, d.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t. But t is way too heavy (173 GeV, 2m=346 GeV way over 6 GeV). So option C's decay to t t-bar is impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which we've determined is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Option B includes all the allowed ones except for the tau. Wait, tau's mass is about 1.78 GeV, so 2m is about 3.56 GeV which is less than 6 GeV, so tau is allowed.

So the possible decay channels are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. Let me check:

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed channels.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The decays must occur at the lowest order, meaning the decay products must satisfy the condition that their combined rest mass is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints for Decay Products**:  
   The boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs \( f\bar{f} \) only if the rest mass of each fermion \( m_f \) satisfies \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This ensures that the total energy of the decay products does not exceed the mass of \( X \).

2. **Known Fermion Masses**:  
   - **Leptons**:  
     - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
     - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
     - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
   - **Quarks**:  
     - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
     - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 3-7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
     - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95-110 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
     - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.25-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).  
     - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 8.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).  
     - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

3. **Allowed Decay Channels**:  
   Based on the mass constraints, the allowed decays of \( X \) are:  
   - \( X \to e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( s\bar{s} \), and \( c\bar{c} \).  
   Decays involving \( b\bar{b} \) or \( t\bar{t} \) are kinematically forbidden due to their masses exceeding the mass of \( X \).

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.  
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.  
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.  
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
