Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying a compound X, based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, so I need to figure out what the starting material is and then what reaction happens.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But the other peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. Hmm. The big one is 1720, which makes me think of a carbonyl group—like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. 1720 is a bit lower than a typical aldehyde (which is around 2800 for the C-H stretch, but the carbonyl is around 1700 maybe). Wait, no, the carbonyl peak is 1720. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very broad, which I think is present here. Oh wait, the IR shows 3400-2500—so maybe that's an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid. But wait, after that, the 1720 could be a carbonyl, like a ketone, or if it's an ester, or maybe an acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the 1720 would be the carbonyl. So maybe compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has peaks at:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a strong, broad singlet. In carboxylic acids, the O-H proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and is broad. So that fits. So that's probably the acid proton.

Then 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets each with 2H suggest that. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Next, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – this might be a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe a ketone or an ester. Or perhaps a CH in a branched alkyl chain.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – could be another set of CH2 groups, maybe adjacent to something else.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a triplet of CH3 groups? Wait, a doublet of 3H—could be a CH(CH3) group. Because in a doublet, the coupling is with one neighbor. So maybe a -CH(CH3)- group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – that's a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group maybe. So maybe a CH2CH3 somewhere.

Putting this together. So the aromatic ring has substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (since we have the O-H and the carbonyl in IR and the 10.5 ppm peak), and the other substituent might be a branched alkyl group.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the substituents on the benzene could be two groups, but in para positions. So perhaps one is the -COOH group and the other is an isobutyl group or something similar. Let's think.

Looking at the NMR shifts: At 2.9 ppm, that's a CH which is next to an electronegative group. Maybe a ketone? Or perhaps a CH connected to an ester or something else. But if the IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, let me think again. If the compound has a benzene ring with a -COOH group and another substituent, perhaps a branched chain.

So the substituent on the benzene would be something like -CH2CH(CH3)2 or something else. Or maybe an ethyl group with branching.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which suggests a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a CH(CH3) group, like in an isobutyl group. Let me think: an isobutyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something else? Wait, isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, isobutyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the isobutyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, no, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- no, maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Let me clarify. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) or is it -CH(CH2CH2) ?

No, wait, isobutyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, maybe I should think of it as the substituent on the benzene is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows at 2.9 ppm, a multiplet of 1H. That could be a CH group connected to two other CH2 groups. Maybe like in a propyl chain, but with branching.

Alternatively, considering the data:

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group, perhaps as part of a larger substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups next to each other. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the end of a chain, like an ethyl group.

Putting it together: perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH(CH3), something like CH2CH(CH3)CH2-?

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch. Let's think about the structure.

Alternatively, let's try to sketch a possible structure. The benzene has a COOH group at position 1 and another substituent at position 4 (para). The substituent is a group that has a CH(CH3) connected via a methylene group.

Wait, the 1H NMR has peaks at 2.9 (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). Hmm.

So, 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which suggests that it's attached to a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is something like -CH2CH2CH3, but with branching.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 group that's attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group. But wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. Wait, but the 0.9 triplet is a CH3 connected to a CH2, which is connected to another CH. Let me try to draw it.

Suppose the substituent is a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait no, because that's a pentyl group.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a CH2CH3 group. So the substituent would be something like CH2CH2... but where?

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH(CH3) group. Let me think: maybe the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that would be a neopentyl group, but the NMR doesn't show a septet or anything like that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think. The substituent would be -(CH2)2CH(CH3). Let's see: the structure would be CH2CH2CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene.

In that case, the NMR of the substituent would have:

- The terminal CH3 (the one furthest from the ring) as a triplet (since it's attached to a CH2 group), which would be at around 1.2 ppm, but in our data, it's at 0.9. Hmm, maybe that's a longer chain or different branching.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, so it's a CH2CH3 group. So maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's think about a sec-butyl group.

The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is actually -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? Or is it -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-? Hmm.

Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

But then, the NMR would have a triplet for the terminal CH3, which would be at 0.9 ppm, which matches. Then, the next group would be a CH2 connected to the CH(CH3), which would be a quartet or something else.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. Let's say the substituent is a propyl group that's branched. Maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent as being a pentyl group, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a isopropyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a CH(CH3) in the middle. Let me analyze the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a multiplet. That could be a CH group that's next to two CH2 groups. So like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- something.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. Let's say the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a benzene ring, but that doesn't explain the NMR peaks. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, like a sec-butyl.

Another approach: Let's try to figure out the structure of compound X based on the NMR and IR.

IR shows a broad peak around 10.5 ppm, which is likely an O-H from a carboxylic acid. So the structure has a -COOH group.

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, doublets each integrating for 2H. So that's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. One substituent is the -COOH group, and the other is some alkyl group.

The NMR shows:

- 10.5 (bs, 1H): O-H of the carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H): The aromatic protons. So the substituents are in para positions, and each substituent is de-shielding the adjacent protons, giving the doublets.

Then, the other peaks are:

2.9 (m, 1H): Probably a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group.

1.7 (m, 2H): CH2 groups, perhaps next to a CH.

1.4 (d, 3H): A CH3 group attached to a CH.

0.9 (t, 3H): A CH3 at the end of a chain.

So putting this together, the substituent on the benzene (other than the -COOH) is a group that has a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the substituent is attached to the benzene as R-.

So R is perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? Or maybe a -CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a pentyl group. But the NMR doesn't show a lot of peaks for that.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, but attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CO- something? Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group attached to the benzene. Then, the NMR would have the following:

The CH2 groups: the CH2 next to the benzene would be at 2.9 ppm, the next CH2 at 1.7, and the terminal CH3 at 0.9. But wait, that doesn't fit exactly.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group. Let's imagine:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at para position as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's a butyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) which is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps a -CH(CH3) group is present.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Let's break it down:

- The CH2 next to the benzene: perhaps split into a triplet or quartet. But in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could be a CH next to two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. Let me think about the NMR of that.

- The terminal CH3 (CH2CH2CH3) would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

- The CH2 next to it would be a quartet, maybe around 1.7 ppm.

- The CH(CH3) would be around 2.9 ppm as a multiplet.

And the CH2 next to the benzene would be a triplet around 1.4 ppm? But wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which doesn't fit a CH2.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the substituent is a secondary carbon. So maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene.

Wait, that would mean the substituent is like -CH(CH2CH2CH3) attached to the ring. So the structure would be benzene with a -COOH and a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group in para positions.

But then, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH2CH2CH3) would have a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) for the CH.

- The CH2 groups would appear as multiplets in the 1.7 ppm region.

- The terminal CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

But wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would then be a CH3 attached to a CH, which doesn't fit. Because in this scenario, the CH3 is at the end of the chain, as a triplet.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see the options given:

Options are:
A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so looking at the options, options C and D have benzoic acid groups. So if the IR shows a carboxylic acid (broad peak around 10 ppm and 1720 cm-1), then options C and A are possibilities.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the structure would be a phenyl group (substituted in the 4 position with ethyl) attached to a propanoic acid. Alternatively, wait, no: the formula is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the propanoic acid is attached to the benzene at position 2, and the benzene has an ethyl group at position 4? Or is it the other way around? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, nomenclature: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the phenyl group attached to the second carbon of the propanoic acid. So the propanoic acid is CH2-C(=O)OH, with the benzene attached to the middle CH2. But the benzene has an ethyl group in the para position.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is benzene with an ethyl group at position 4 and a propanoic acid group at position 2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the NMR for option C and D.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzoic acid has a substituent at position 4 which is a sec-butyl group.

What's a sec-butyl group? It's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is actually -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. So attached to the benzene is a CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, no. Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: the butyl group has four carbons. The sec- refers to the position of the branch. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? No, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, meaning the branching is on the second carbon. So the group would be -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. So the substituent is a four-carbon chain where the branch is on the second carbon.

So the substituent would be: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Wait, no. Let me think: the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, but that's only three carbons. So the substituent is a four-carbon group where the branch is on the second carbon.

Wait, maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. So the substituent is: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Hmm, maybe I should think of the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene, making it a four-carbon group. So the substituent is a butyl group where the branching is on the second carbon, i.e., a sec-butyl.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but that would give the substituent as a butyl group: the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to a CH2-CH3.

So in the NMR, the protons would be:

The terminal CH3 (CH2CH3) at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The adjacent CH2 (attached to the CH(CH3)) at around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

The CH(CH3) would be around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

The CH2 attached to the benzene would be around 1.4 ppm (d, 3H?), but wait, if it's a CH2 group, it would be a quartet or something else.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet with 3H. That suggests it's a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps that CH is the -CH(CH3) group.

Wait, in the substituent: benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So the CH2 adjacent to the benzene would have protons that are split by the neighboring CH(CH3) group. Let me think.

In that structure, the CH2 next to the benzene (let's call it CH2A) is attached to CH2B (CH(CH3)), which is attached to CH2C (CH2CH3).

So for CH2A, the protons would be split by the adjacent CH2B. So perhaps they appear as a triplet or a quartet.

But in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2B group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH(CH3). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is CH2C's CH3.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a doublet, which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which would be the CH(CH3) group. Oh wait, no, the CH(CH3) is connected to CH2A and CH2B. So the CH3 group on the CH(CH3) would be at 1.4 ppm as a doublet, because it's attached to a CH that is connected to two CH2 groups. Hmm, maybe.

Putting it all together, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. So compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, the reaction: compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, what's that reaction?

Red phosphorus and HI is a reagent used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but wait, that's not applicable here. Wait, another possibility—maybe it's for the deoxygenation of ketones to alkanes? No, wait, I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of esters or maybe the elimination of certain groups.

Wait, another thought: the reaction might be a substitution. For example, if there's a carbonyl group, perhaps it's being reduced or modified.

Wait, but in this case, the compound is a benzoic acid. So what reaction would benzoic acid undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used to convert carboxylic acids into alkanes. I remember that in the Clemmensen reduction, Zn(Hg)/HCl is used to reduce ketones to alkanes, but that's under acidic conditions. Alternatively, the reaction of carboxylic acids with red phosphorus and HI might lead to substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be the hydrolysis of an ester. But in this case, X is a benzoic acid, not an ester.

Wait, wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution of the -COOH group. Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe the -COOH group is being converted into a methyl group. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the reaction.

Oh! I think I remember that in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, carboxylic acids can be converted into alkanes via the formation of an imidazolium intermediate. Wait, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group.

Wait, the reaction converts the carboxylic acid group (COOH) into a CH3 group. So if X is benzoic acid, then the product would be toluene (methylbenzene). But in our case, X has a substituent on the benzene ring, so the product would be benzene with substituents.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI leads to the replacement of the -COOH group with a -CH2PHORANE intermediate, which then is replaced by HI, leading to the formation of a methyl group. So, for example, benzene carboxylic acid would become toluene.

So in our case, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the -COOH group would become a -CH3 group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a methyl group attached.

Wait, no, because the -COOH is at the para position relative to the substituent. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the -COOH is at position 1 and the substituent is at position 4. So after the reaction, the -COOH becomes a methyl group, so the substituent (sec-butyl) is at position 4 relative to the methyl group. So the product would have methyl at position 1 and sec-butyl at position 4. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene.

But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So that's a benzene ring with a methyl group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1. But wait, that would mean the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, which are para to each other.

Wait, but in the starting material (option C), the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). So after the reaction, the COOH becomes CH3 at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4. So the product would have a methyl at 1 and sec-butyl at 4, making 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene, which is the same as 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is that. So the product would be option D.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: when the -COOH is converted to -CH3, the substituent would be at the adjacent position. Let me make sure.

In option C, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The benzene has a COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4. So when the COOH is replaced by CH3, the product would have a CH3 at position 1 and a sec-butyl at position 4, making it 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene. Which is the same as 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

So the answer should be option D.

But wait, let me check the other options. If the starting material were option A, which is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, then the substituents would be a phenyl group at position 2 and a propanoic acid. But I don't think that would fit the NMR data, because the aromatic region would be more complex.

Alternatively, if compound X were option C, the product would be option D after the reaction.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction involving compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data:

**IR Data:**
- 3400–2500 cm⁻¹: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- 1720 cm⁻¹: Suggests a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹: Likely aromatic C=C stretching.

**NMR Data:**
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H):** Broad singlet, characteristic of the O-H proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H):** Doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted aromatic ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H):** Multiplet, likely a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H):** Multiplet, likely CH₂ groups in a chain.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H):** Doublet, consistent with a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H):** Triplet, indicative of a terminal CH₃ group in a chain.

### Analysis of Compound X:
The IR and NMR data suggest that compound X is a para-substituted benzoic acid. The aromatic protons confirm a para-substitution pattern, with one substituent being a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the other being a branched alkyl group. The NMR data indicates the presence of a sec-butyl group (-CH₂CH(CH₃)CH₂-) as the alkyl substituent. Thus, compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (option C).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI typically converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group (-CH₃). In this case, the -COOH group at position 1 is replaced by a methyl group, while the sec-butyl group at position 4 remains unchanged. The resulting product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, which corresponds to option D.

**Answer: D**
