Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think this through.

So, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in special relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Or wait, maybe it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)) ?

Wait, let me get that right. The formula for the relative velocity between two objects moving at speeds u and v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Oh wait no, wait. Because if object A is moving at u relative to the rest frame, and object B is moving at v relative to the rest frame, then the speed of B relative to A is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) if they are moving in the same direction. Wait, or is it (u - v) or (v - u)?

Wait, another way: If I'm in a frame where object A is moving at velocity u, and object B is moving at velocity v (same direction as u), then the velocity of B as seen from A is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in our case, since both are moving in the positive x-direction, we can plug in their speeds.

Wait, but the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So to find the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen by the first, we'd do (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(
