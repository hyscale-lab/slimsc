Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when measuring the position, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. They weren't found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So, the question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So, the probability of finding a particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 must be 1 (since it's a normalized wave function). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around... Or perhaps the wave function isn't normalized, so we need to find 'a' such that the integral from 1 to 3 is 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that as ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (i/2).

Wait, actually, since 'i' is the imaginary unit, the wave function is complex. To find the probability density, I need to compute the modulus squared, which is ψ*(x) ψ(x).

So, ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (i/2). The complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (i/2).

So, |ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x)) + i/2] * [a/(sqrt(1+x)) - i/2].

Multiplying these two, it's a product of the form (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B².

So, A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is i/2.

So, |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) - ( (i/2) )^2.

Wait, (i/2)^2 is (i^2)/(4) = (-1)/4. So, |ψ|² becomes (a²)/(1+x) - (-1/4) → (a²)/(1+x) + 1/4.

Wait, that's the probability density. Now, to find the normalization condition, the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1 because the probability of finding the particle in that region is 100%. So, ∫ from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 1/4] dx = 1.

Let me compute that integral.

First, split the integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx and integral of 1/4 dx, both from 1 to 3.

The integral of a²/(1+x) dx is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/4 dx is (1/4)(3 - 1) = (1/4)(2) = 0.5.

So putting it together:

a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] + 0.5 = 1.

Because ln(1+3) is ln(4), ln(1+1) is ln(2). So, ln(4) - ln(2) is ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So, the equation becomes:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Divide both sides by ln(2):

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Then, a is the square root of that. So, a = sqrt(0.5 / ln(2)).

Wait, let me compute that numerically.

First, compute ln(2). I remember ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is about 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then square root of 0.7213 is about 0.849, which is roughly 0.85. So, looking at the options, B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the integral computation.

Wait, the integral of a²/(1+x) from 1 to3 is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Adding the 1/4 integral which gives 0.5, the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1. So yes.

So, a² = (0.5) / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

So the correct option is B.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - \frac{i}{2}.
\]

The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function, \(|\psi(x)|^2\). Using the formula for the modulus squared of a complex number, we compute:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + \frac{i}{2}\right)\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - \frac{i}{2}\right).
\]

Expanding this product, we get:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2.
\]

Since \(i^2 = -1\), this simplifies to:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the region where the particle is found (between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\)) must equal 1. Thus, we compute:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = \int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + \frac{1}{4}\right) dx = 1.
\]

Splitting the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_1^3 \frac{1}{4} \, dx = 1.
\]

The first integral is:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

The second integral is:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{4} \, dx = \frac{1}{4}(3-1) = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Adding these results, we have:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + \frac{1}{2} = 1.
\]

Subtracting \(\frac{1}{2}\) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1}{2 \ln(2)}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2 \ln(2)}}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\), we compute:

\[
a^2 = \frac{1}{2 \cdot 0.6931} \approx 0.7213, \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option **B**.
