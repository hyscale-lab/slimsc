Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with light moving through a medium, the speed isn't just c/n, but I think that's the speed relative to the medium at rest. But in this case, the medium is moving, so maybe I need to consider some sort of relativistic effect or perhaps just velocity addition.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer. So, the glass's frame is moving relative to the lab frame. But light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, from what I recall, the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But that's in the rest frame of the medium. If the medium is moving, does that change the observed speed of light in the medium?

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Oh wait, no, because if the medium is moving, does that affect the light's speed in the lab frame? But wait, I'm getting confused because the speed of light in a medium is less than c
