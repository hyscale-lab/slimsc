Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Parallax, right? Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in terms of parallax is d = 1/plx, where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds. So, a higher parallax means the star is closer, and lower parallax means it's farther away.

The question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let's see. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their distances (or parallaxes) are spread out in a certain way. I'm trying to remember the relationship between the number of stars and the range of parallaxes.

Wait, I think this has to do with the volume of space. Because stars are three-dimensional objects, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on how that volume changes with distance. Oh right! The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, as the distance increases, the volume increases with the cube of the radius.

But how does that relate to parallax? Since d = 1/plx, then as plx decreases (because the star is farther), d increases. So the volume depends on d³, which is (1/plx)³. So volume is proportional to 1/plx³.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So if I have a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx, the volume of that shell is the surface area times the thickness. Oh wait, wait. The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πd²) multiplied by dr. Because surface area increases with d², and dr is the thickness (so the volume of the shell is 4πd² dr).

But we're looking at parallax, so let's express d in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to substitute.

The number of stars in a thin shell (dN) is proportional to the surface area times the thickness (dr). So,

dN = n * 4π d² dr
