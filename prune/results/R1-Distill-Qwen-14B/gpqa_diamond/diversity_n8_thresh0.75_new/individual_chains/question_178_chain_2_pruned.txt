Okay, so I have this Lagrangian given, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, the Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. 

Wait, I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. So σ is an antisymmetric tensor made from the gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think, like F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ.

But the main thing is to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I need to figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Since the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 (because the action S is dimensionless, and S is the integral of L over spacetime, so L has dimension 4). 

Wait, right, in 4 spacetime dimensions, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density is 4. So each term in L_int must have dimension 4 as well, because they're part of the full Lagrangian which is 4.

So let's look at each component of the Lagrangian L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, the ψ fields: ψ is a Dirac spinor. What's its mass dimension? I remember that in 4D, Dirac spinors have dimension (3/2) because the action has to be dimensionless. Because the kinetic term is ∫ ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ d^4 x. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, and ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2. So (3/2) + 1 + (3/2) = 4. So the whole term has dimension 4. So each ψ is dimension 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from γ matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices; their indices are Lorentz, which are dimensionless in terms of mass. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γ_mu, gamma_nu], which is dimensionless because each gamma is dim 0. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. What's its dimension? F is made from derivatives of the gauge field A, which is a vector potential. The gauge field A_mu has dimension 1 in 4D. Because the term in the Lagrangian like F^2 would have each F being dimension 2, because F is ∂A, and ∂ is dimension 1. So F^{μν} would have dimension 2. Because A has dimension 1, ∂A is dimension 2.

So putting it together: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is also 3/2. σ is 0. F is 2.

So the product would be:

κ * (3/2) * (0) * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, let me compute the dimensions step by step. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, F^{μν}.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ * ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then σ is dimensionless, so that part is still 3. F is dimension 2, so 3 * 2 = 6. So the term is κ multiplied by something of dimension 6.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each ψ is 3/2
