Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think this through.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky as seen from Earth during the year. I remember that the parallax (usually denoted by 'plx') is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. So, a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer. The formula I recall is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax.

The question says the stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their spatial density is constant in the universe. So, more stars would be found in regions where there's more volume. But how does that translate into the distribution of parallax?

Wait, parallax relates to distance, so if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. But how does that volume change with parallax?

Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax 'p' is in arcseconds, and distance 'd' is in parsecs, and p = 1/d. So, as d increases, p decreases. If I have a range of parallaxes from p to p + dp, that corresponds to a range of distances from d to d + dd. But how do these ranges relate?

Wait, since p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = - d² dp. Hmm, but when integrating over a range of p's, the corresponding change in d is important.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, suppose I want to find how the number of stars N depends on the parallax range.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n (stars per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a volume element dV is n*dV.

What's the volume corresponding to a small range of parallax? Let me model this. For stars at a distance d, with distance between d and d + dd, the volume is a spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd. The volume of a shell is 4πd² dd.

But wait, the question is about a unit range of parallax, which is dp. So I need to express the volume in terms of dp. Since
