Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV and mu is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of each product.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation laws are key. Since the pion is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But I'm not sure how to use that yet.

I also know that energy is conserved. The initial total energy is just the rest energy of the pion, because it's not moving. So E_initial = m_pi c^2. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Each of their energies is their rest mass plus their kinetic energy. Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have negligible mass, right? Or is their mass considered here? The problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

So, energy conservation equation:
m_pi c^2 = (gamma m_mu c^2) + (gamma_nu m_nu c^2) + KE_mu + KE_nu.

Wait, but m_nu is zero, so the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, right? Because E = pc for massless particles. So the neutrino's energy is pc, and since it's massless, its rest mass energy is zero.

Hold on, maybe I should write the equation in terms of energies. Let me denote the total energy of the muon as E_mu = gamma m_mu c^2, and the neutrino's energy as E_nu = p c (since m_nu is zero).

So the energy conservation equation is:
m_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu.

And for momentum conservation, since the total initial momentum is zero, the momenta must be equal and opposite. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since p is a vector, their magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Wait, but the muon has mass, so its momentum is gamma m_mu v. And for the neutrino, since it's massless, p_nu = E_nu / c.

So let's denote p_mu = p (magnitude) and p_nu = p as well, but opposite direction.

Now, for the muon, E_mu^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. So p = sqrt( (E_mu^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2) ) / c^2? Wait, no, I think more accurately:

p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu)^2 - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? No, wait, units. Let's think in terms of units where c=1, which is common in particle physics.

Wait, in units where c=1, energy E is in MeV, mass m is in MeV/cÂ², but since c=1, it's just MeV. Momentum p is in MeV/c. So E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4. So if c=1, E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

So, using that, and since p_mu = p_nu, we can write:

p_mu = p_nu.

But E_nu = p_nu c. Wait, but again, c=1, so E_nu = p_nu.

So, putting this together:

Energy conservation:
m_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Which is m_pi = E_mu + p_nu.

But E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2).

And since p_mu = p_nu, we can write:

m_pi = sqrt
