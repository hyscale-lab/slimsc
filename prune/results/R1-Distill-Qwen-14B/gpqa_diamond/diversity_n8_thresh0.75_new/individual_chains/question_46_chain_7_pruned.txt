Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is usually for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis, but I think in this case, since it's an alkene, it's about breaking and reforming the double bond.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers, right? But wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene has a double bond between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, no, let's count the carbons.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait, wait. Let me draw it out.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, maybe I should number it. Carbon 1 is the first carbon, 2 is the second, etc.

Wait, pent-1-ene: 5 carbons with double bond starting at 1. So it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on carbon 3. So, carbon 3 is the middle carbon in the chain. So the structure becomes CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me count again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: pentane has five carbons. The double bond is between carbons 1-2. Carbon 3 would have a methyl group. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH
