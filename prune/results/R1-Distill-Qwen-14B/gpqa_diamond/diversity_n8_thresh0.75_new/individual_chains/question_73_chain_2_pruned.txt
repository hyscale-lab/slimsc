Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving a relative speed and a total energy. I remember from my studies that when dealing with relativistic speeds, both velocity addition and energy calculations are different from classical mechanics.

First, I think I should handle the relative speed part. Oh wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. You can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. The formula for adding velocities is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), right? Because if you have two objects moving at u and v relative to a common frame, their relative speed isn't simply u minus v. So I need to apply that formula.

Wait, so astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. Wait, no, actually, the question says they're moving in the positive x-direction, but I'm not sure if they're moving relative to the same frame. Oh wait, no, the problem says they're both traveling in the positive x-direction, so maybe each is moving at their respective speeds in the same reference frame. Wait, no, wait, no, the question is about their relative speed as observed by one astronaut. Or is it? Hmm, the question says "relative speed", so maybe it's the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c relative to the Earth, and astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c relative to Earth. So, the relative speed of B as seen from A's frame would be (v - u) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Plugging into the formula: (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me calculate numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. But since speed is a magnitude, maybe I take the absolute value? Or does the formula account for direction? Wait, the formula gives the velocity of B as seen from A's frame, so it could be negative, but for relative speed, we take the magnitude.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates direction—so from A's perspective, B is moving in the opposite direction. The magnitude is about 0.142857c, which is roughly 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's an important clue.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut A (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c), let's compute gamma. v²/c² is (0.6)^2 = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = gamma * m c² * 2m? Wait, no, wait. Wait, mass is 2m, so E_A should be gamma * (2m) * c². Hmm, but wait, actually, the formula
