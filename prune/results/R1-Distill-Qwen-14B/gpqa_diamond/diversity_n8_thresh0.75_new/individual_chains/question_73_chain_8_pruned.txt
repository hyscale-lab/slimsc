Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Oh right, it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I've studied a bit about relativity, so maybe I can apply what I know.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for total energy, I think it's the sum of their individual relativistic energies, which includes their rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. So I'll need to tackle each part separately.

First, the relative speed. Since both are moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed is not as simple as 0.6c - 0.5c. Oh, right, because of the Lorentz factor, the calculation is more involved. The formula for relative velocity u' when one object is moving at u relative to another object moving at v is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

So let me plug in the numbers. Here, the first astronaut's speed is u = 0.6c, and the second's speed is v = 0.5c, but wait, since we're finding the relative speed of the second from the first's frame, or vice versa? Wait, the problem says "relative speed" without specifying direction, but since both are in the same direction, the relative speed would be how much faster the first astronaut is moving compared to the second.

Wait, actually, in the problem, we have two observers, each moving at their own speed. So the relative speed from one astronaut's perspective to the other would be calculated using the formula I mentioned. Let me write that down.

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. If the problem is from the perspective of the first astronaut (the one moving at 0.6c), then we want to find the speed of the second astronaut (0.5c) in that frame. Or is it the other
