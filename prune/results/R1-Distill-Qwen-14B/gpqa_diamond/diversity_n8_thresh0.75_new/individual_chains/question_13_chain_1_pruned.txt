Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a specific structure—like a bicyclic structure? No, wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but more specifically, it's a cyclic monoterpene that's a bicyclic monoterpene? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing it. Let me think. Oh right, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, right? So, it's a seven-membered ring with two rings, making it a norbornene structure.

So, the starting material is (R)-(+)-limonene. The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. Oh, that's hydrogenation. So, the double bond in limonene would be hydrogenated. But limonene has two double bonds, or just one? Wait, no, limonene has a single double bond. Let me think: the structure of limonene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So when hydrogenated, it would add two hydrogens across that double bond, turning it into a single bond. So that would give me the hydrogenated product, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. But wait, the question says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. Oh wait, hydrogenation of a double bond typically uses one equivalent of H2 per double bond. So that would convert limonene into limonane, I think.

So product 1 is limonane. But wait, the problem says "stirred with Pd/C under a Hydrogen atmosphere. After 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed." So yeah, the double bond is saturated, so product 1 is limonane. Now, the stereochemistry—does hydrogenation of limonene preserve the configuration? Wait, the starting material is (R)-(+)-limonene. When you hydrogenate a double bond that's part of a bicyclic structure, does the hydrogenation have any stereochemistry? Oh, wait, limonene has a specific configuration
