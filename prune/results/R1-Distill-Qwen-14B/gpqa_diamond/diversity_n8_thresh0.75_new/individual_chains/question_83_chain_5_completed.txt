Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, right, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic range because the salt formed (like acetate) will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions.

First, I think I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ water, so total volume is 40 cm³.

The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume in liters. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, after diluting to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, during titration with NaOH, which is 0.1 M. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid would react with NaOH.

But the question is about two points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

So first, let's think about 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So the first step is to find out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration.

Wait, but the amount of NaOH needed at equivalence point can be calculated first. Because, for equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid before titration: 0.025 M * 0.04 L? Wait wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, which is 0.001 mol. Then, when diluted to 40 cm³, the concentration is 0.025 M. So when titrating, the volume of solution is 40 cm³.

Wait, but when we add NaOH, the volume increases. Oh, but for the equivalence point, maybe we don't need to worry about that? Or perhaps we can proceed with moles.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But for 25% titration, 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So the volume would be 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but why do I need the volume of NaOH for the 25% point? Maybe I don't, maybe I just need to compute the concentrations of the species in the solution at that point.

Okay, let's approach each point.

First, let's handle the 25% titration. So 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. So 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol reacts, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate ion (CH3COO^-). The remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

But wait, the total volume at this point isn't just 40 cm³ anymore because we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let me calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = (7.5e-4) / 4.25e-2 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 5.8824e-3 M.

Wait, but wait, when using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, perhaps I don't need to compute the concentrations again. Because the equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

So pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. 1.85e-5 is about 1.85×10^-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is approximately 4.733.

Wait, more precisely: 1.85e-5. Log(1.85) is approx 0.2672. So pKa is 4.7328.

So at 25% titration, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) )= 1/3.

So pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.7328 + log(0.3333) ≈ 4.7328 - 0.4771 ≈ 4.2557.

So approximately 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration.

Looking at the options, option A gives 4.26 as the first value. Option D is 4.57, which is higher. So maybe A or another option.

Wait, but wait a minute. When we add NaOH, it reacts with acetic acid to produce acetate. But when you add a strong base, it's a common ion effect. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach should still hold because it's a buffer solution.

So the pH calculation seems correct for 25% point.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions must be calculated. The moles of acetate is 0.001 mol.

At equivalence, the total volume is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. As we calculated earlier, 10 cm³ of NaOH is needed, so total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

We can set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let x be [OH^-]. So,

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x)

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, we can approximate (0.02 - x) ≈ 0.02.

So,

x^2 ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ let's compute that.

log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) = 0.5167 -6 = -5.4833.

So pOH = 5.4833.

pH = 14 - 5.4833 ≈ 8.5167.

So approximately 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is about 8.52.

Looking back at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that's looking good.

But wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the equivalence point again.

Another approach: when you have a solution of a salt of a weak acid (like acetate), you can calculate the pH using the formula for a weak base. So the concentration is 0.02 M, and Kb is 5.405e-10.

Yes, that's what I did.

Wait, but let me compute the exact x without approximation. So:

x^2 = Kb * (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)

Expanding,

x^2 = (5.405e-10)(0.02) - (5.405e-10)x

Bring all terms to left:

x^2 + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0

Quadratic equation: ax² + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 + 4 * 1 * 1.081e-11.

Compute:

(5.405e-10)^2 = approx 2.921e-19.

4ac =4*1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. So D=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since 2.9e-19 is negligible).

x = [ -b ± sqrt(D) ] / (2a)

Since x is positive, we take the positive root.

sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So,

x ≈ ( -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ) / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So the approximation holds, because x is about 3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02. So the initial assumption was correct.

So pH is about 8.52. Which matches option A's second pH value.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. So that's the one.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Did I miscalculate the 25% point?

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the concentrations after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³, and when adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH, the total becomes 42.5 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 L = approx 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log ( [A-]/[HA] )

pKa is 4.733.

[A-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is -0.4771.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.4771 = 4.256, which is approx 4.26. So that's correct.

So the 25% point is 4.26 and equivalence is 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the initial moles?

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 20 cm³ *0.05 M = 0.001 mol. Diluting to 40 cm³, concentration is 0.025 M. So that's correct.

So the calculation seems right.

But wait, another thought: when you add NaOH, the volume changes. So when calculating the concentrations, I think I did that correctly.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. Wait, another approach: perhaps the 25% is based on the total volume after mixing, not the initial moles. Wait, no, 25% of the moles needed would be correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point. Because the Kb calculation assumes concentration is 0.02 M, but perhaps I should have considered the dilution with the added NaOH.

Wait, no. At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. The moles are 0.001, and the total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M acetate. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the equivalence point? No, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized; only the conjugate base remains, so it's a solution of the salt, not a buffer anymore.

So I think option A is correct. But let me check the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52.

But wait, I thought the equivalence point was 8.52. But in the options, option A's second value is 8.52, and the first is 4.26.

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the value at 25% titration and equivalence point. So which option has these two values? Option A.

Hmm, but let me think again about the equivalence point calculation. Maybe I missed a factor of 2 in the calculation.

Wait, the Kb is correct. Or perhaps the concentration after adding NaOH. Wait, no, I think I did that right.

Another thought: maybe the initial dilution of acetic acid is 20 cm³ to 40 cm³ (diluted with 20 cm³ water) so the concentration is 0.025 M, as done earlier.

Wait, another approach for the equivalence point: the solution is 0.02 M acetate.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So,

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is [OH^-], then:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

As before, x ≈ 3.288e-6, so pOH = 5.483, pH=8.517.

Which is approx 8.52.

Therefore, the equivalence point is approximately 8.52.

So the correct option should be A: 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the equivalence point for a weak acid is around pH 8-9, which matches 8.52. So that seems correct.

So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by calculating the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting to a total volume of \(40 \, \text{cm}^3\) (\(0.04 \, \text{L}\)), the concentration becomes:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of acetic acid reacted are:

\[
\text{Moles reacted} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles unreacted} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at this point is \(40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3\) (\(0.0425 \, \text{L}\)). The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming \(0.001 \, \text{mol}\) of acetate ion. The total volume is:

\[
40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 \, (0.05 \, \text{L}).
\]

The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( \text{K}_b \) for acetate is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( \text{K}_b \):

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}][\text{OH}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Then:

\[
5.405 \times 10^{-10} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483,
\]

and the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \( 8.52 \). These values match **Option A**.

Answer: A
