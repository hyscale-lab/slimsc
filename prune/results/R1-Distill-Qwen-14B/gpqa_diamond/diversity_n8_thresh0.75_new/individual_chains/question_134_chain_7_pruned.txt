Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we're mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The goal is to find the enthalpy change when they're mixed. Oh right, neutralization reactions usually involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt.

Wait, neutralization enthalpy is typically the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But I remember that for strong acids and bases, the enthalpy change is pretty consistent per mole of H+ or OH- ions. Oh, and I think the enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is around -57 kJ/mol or something like that. But wait, the options here are in different units, so I'll have to make sure about that.

First, I need to figure out how much H+ and OH- ions are in each solution. Because when you mix them, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

Let's break down each solution.

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it fully dissociates. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
   Molarity is 0.2 M, volume 500 mL. So moles = M * V(L) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

2. H2SO4: Oh wait, sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each mole gives 2 H+ ions. But wait, does it dissociate completely in two steps? For the purpose of neutralization, I think the first dissociation is complete, and the second might not be, but since it's a strong acid, both H+ ions are released. Or wait, actually, concentrated sulfuric acid might not fully dissociate both H+ ions in solution, but I think in this problem, since it's a neutralization question, we can assume complete dissociation for simplicity. So, 0.3 M, 300 mL. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: This is a strong base. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions. Wait, let me think. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So for each mole, two moles of OH-.

Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 * 0.1 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 would give 0.2 moles OH- because each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So yes, 0.2 moles OH-.

Now, let's sum up the H+ and OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

So when they mix, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio to form water.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

But wait, in this case, the H+ is more than the OH-. So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So all OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

So the neutralization would involve 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate how much acid and base are present to see which is in excess.

Wait, the H+ from H
