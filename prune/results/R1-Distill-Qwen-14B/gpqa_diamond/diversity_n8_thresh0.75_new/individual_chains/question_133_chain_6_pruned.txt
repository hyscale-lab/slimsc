Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. We've got a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, and it contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, which is probably room temperature, so I don't think I need to adjust any constants for that. The question also gives me the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The different KAs tell me about the strengths of each deprotonation step. Since the problem is about orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-, I need to figure out how much of that is present in the solution.

Wait, wait, actually, H3PO4 is triprotic. So the forms are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So I need the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution contains two different phosphate salts. One is KH2PO4, which I think is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). So when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. The other salt is Na2HPO4·2H2O. Sodium phosphate dihydrate, I think. So when it dissolves, it gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions.

So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Oh, right! This reminds me of buffer solutions. Because when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and then determine the concentration of different species.

Wait, but in this case, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4
