Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different pH values.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid initially.

But wait, before that, the solution is diluted. So first, I need to figure out the concentration after dilution.

The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the diluted concentration would be (volume1 * concentration1) / total volume. Let's calculate that.

Volume 1 (V1) is 20 cm³, concentration (C1) is 0.05 M. Dilution adds another 20 cm³, so total volume V_total is 40 cm³.

So diluted concentration C2 = (20 cm³ * 0.05 M) / 40 cm³ = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, 20*0.05 is 1, over 40 is 0.025 M. Right, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point depends on the moles of acetic acid and NaOH.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. So, for each of these, I need to calculate pH.

Let's start with the 25% titration point.

First, let's find out the total volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid initially: volume * concentration = 0.025 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So diluted volume is 0.04 L. So concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M * (20/40) = 0.025 M. So moles of acetic acid is 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Because the reaction is 1:1.

Concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume (V) = moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So, equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

25% titration would mean 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence is added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So, in the 25% case, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, let's see what's the situation in the solution at 25% titration.

Initially, we have 0.001 mol of acetic acid. When we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles of NaOH added is 0.0025 L *
