Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The question involves several reactions starting with compound A, which undergoes several transformations, and we need to identify the final compound D from the given options.

Let's start by analyzing compound A. The proton NMR data for A is given: two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us how many hydrogens are present. So, 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet.

What structures give such NMR signals? A triplet suggests that each proton is adjacent to two equivalent protons. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH3 would be a triplet because each hydrogen is next to the CH2 group. Similarly, a quartet (which has four peaks) would come from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, like in an ethyl group. Wait, but in an ethyl group, the CH3 is a triplet and the CH2 is a quartet. So if that's the case, maybe compound A is an ethyl group attached to something else.

But wait, the integrations are 6H and 4H. So 6H as a triplet suggests three sets of 2H each? Or maybe a CH2CH3 group? Let me think. If it's an ethyl group, then the CH3 would be a triplet (split by the adjacent CH2). The CH2 next to it would be a quartet split by the CH3. So the triplet at 0.9 ppm (which is usually where CH3 groups in ethyls appear) with 6H would imply two ethyl groups. Because each ethyl has 3 CH3 hydrogens, but wait, no, in an ethyl group, each CH3 is 3H. So two ethyl groups would give 6H as a triplet. Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm would be from the adjacent CH2 groups. Each ethyl has a CH2, so two ethyl groups would give 4H (each CH2 has 2H). So that makes sense. So compound A has two ethyl groups attached to something. What would that structure be?

Wait, another possibility: maybe compound A is neopentane? No, that's 2,2-dimethylpropane, which would have a singlet for all the CH3's. Alternatively, perhaps it's two ethyl groups attached to a single carbon. Like diethyl something. But diethyl ether, for example, would have the ethyl groups attached to the oxygen. The NMR would show two triplets for the ethyl CH3 groups and two quartets for the CH2. Wait, but in diethyl ether, each ethyl group is attached to an oxygen. However, the splitting might differ. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps compound A is a diethyl ether, but that wouldn't have two separate signals. Wait, no, diethyl ether would have two equivalent ethyl groups, so the NMR would show a quartet for the CH2 groups and a triplet for the CH3 groups, but perhaps only one signal each because of symmetry. Wait, but in the given problem, the triplet is at 0.9 and quartet at 1.3. So that fits with diethyl ether's NMR. But diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. So the two ethyl groups each contribute their CH3 as triplet and CH2 as quartet. So diethyl ether's NMR would only have two signals: a triplet for the CH3 (each 3H, but two groups so 6H) and a quartet for the CH2 (each 2H, two groups so 4H). That matches the data given for compound A. So compound A is diethyl ether.

Wait, no. Diethyl ether is indeed (CH2CH3)2O. Its NMR would show the CH3 as a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (maybe a bit lower than 0.9?), and the CH2 as a quartet around 3.5 ppm (since they're attached to
