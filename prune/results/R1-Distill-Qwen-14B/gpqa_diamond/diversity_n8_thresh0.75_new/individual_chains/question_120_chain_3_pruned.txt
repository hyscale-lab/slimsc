Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx itself. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

The options are about how the number of stars changes with plx. The options involve variations like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc. So I need to figure out what mathematical relationship exists between the number of stars and the parallax.

Wait, let me think about the distribution. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars is constant in space. So more stars would be in larger volumes. But since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, higher plx means closer stars, lower plx means farther away.

So, the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. But when we look at a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, we're essentially looking at a thin shell in space.

The volume of that shell would depend on the radius. Because the parallax plx is 1/d, the radius r is 1/plx. So the volume of the shell from r to r + dr would be 4πr² dr. Wait, because the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. 

So the number of stars in that shell would be the volume times the number density. Let's say the number density is n (stars per cubic parsec). So number of stars N = n * 4πr² dr. 

But r is 1/plx, so substituting that in: N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. 

Wait, but the question is about number per unit range of plx. So dr is a small change in plx. But r is 1/plx, so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx, since plx =1/r, so dplx = - (1/r²) dr. So dr = - (plx^2) dplx. But since plx increases as you get closer (distance decreases), but for the purposes of counting, we can take the absolute value, so dr = plx² dplx.

Wait, perhaps I should just express N in terms of plx. So N = n * 4π (
