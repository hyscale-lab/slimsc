Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question starts with compound A which has an NMR spectrum with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, so maybe something like two CH2 groups adjacent. Wait, the 6H triplet—could that be from two equivalent CH3 groups attached to a CH2? Because each CH3 would be next to a CH2 with two protons, leading to a triplet. 

Wait, the 6H triplet at 0.9 ppm is likely two methyl groups (each 3H) adjacent to a CH2. So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH2(C)(C), but let me think. Oh, wait, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else. Or perhaps it's a diethyl group. Wait, no, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is next to three others. So, maybe it's a CH2 connected to a CH2CH3. Because a quartet would come from two neighboring CH2 groups. Let me try to draw this out.

So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) suggests two CH3 groups. The quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H) suggests a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH2 where each CH2 is connected to a CH3. Wait, that might make it like (CH2CH3)2CH2? Or perhaps more accurately, (CH2CH2)(CH3)2. Wait, maybe it's more like a diethyl group, but that has 2*(2+2) = 8 H, but I have 4 H in the quartet. So, maybe it's a CH2 connected to two CH2CH3 groups. No, wait, another approach.

Wait, maybe compound A is 2,2-dimethylbutane? No, let me think again. Let's think about the splitting. The triplet would be for the CH3 groups. So, if you have two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, that CH2 would be a quartet. Because each CH3 has 3 H, and the CH2 would split into a quartet (n+1, where n=3), but wait, that's the other way around.

Wait, no—the splitting is about neighboring protons. So the triplet (each peak split into three) comes from each CH3 being adjacent to a CH2 with two H. So the CH3 is next to a CH2, which has two H. So each CH3 would split into a triplet. So the triplet is from the CH3 groups, each adjacent to a CH2.

Then the quartet (split into four) is from the CH2 group. Because the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 (since the quartet has 4 peaks, which is n=3, so the neighboring group has 3 H). Wait, how does that work? If a CH2 is next to a CH2CH3, the neighboring group has 3 H. So, the CH2 would be split into a quartet. Because each proton on the CH2 is adjacent to three H from a CH2CH3.

So putting this together, maybe the structure is CH2CH2(CH3)2? Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense. Let me think of it as a chain. Suppose you have a central CH2 connected to two CH3 groups on one side and another CH2CH3 on the other. Wait, no, maybe it's more like a diethyl group attached to something else.

Another approach: The overall structure must have two different groups of protons. Let's say the 6H triplet comes from two equivalent CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2. The quartet of 4H comes from the CH2 adjacent to another CH2, which has two H. Hmm, perhaps the structure is 2,2-dimethylpropane? No, that's neopent
