Okay, so I've got this question about a transgenic mouse model and some cloning issues. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question is about why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed as expected. They tried to create a construct where the coding sequence includes a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, but the protein isn't showing up. They looked at the plus strand sequence and noticed something wrong.

Looking at the options, let's think about each possibility.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm. The construct was modified to add the HA tag at the N-terminus, which is the start. If there's a mutation in the HA sequence, maybe the tag is messed up. But the main issue is that the protein isn't overexpressed. Would a missense in the HA affect expression? Maybe the HA is for purification, but a mutation there might affect binding but not necessarily prevent expression. Unless the mutation is in the start codon or something. Wait, looking at the provided sequence, the start is ATG... let me check. The first part is 5' ATG TAC CCC ATA ... So the start codon is ATG, which is correct. Any issues after that? If the HA sequence is messed up, but the start is okay, then the rest of the gene might still be expressed. So maybe this is not the main issue here.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would mean a premature stop codon. So the mRNA has a stop codon before the actual end. How can we tell from the sequence? Let's look for in-frame stop codons. The sequence starts with ATG, which is good. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so maybe any stop codon before the end would cause this. I'll need to scan through the sequence for TAA, TAG, or TGA codons.

Wait, the sequence is given as the plus strand. So the coding sequence is in frame. Let me see. Let's break it down into triplets:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTA CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GCG CAG CGT CAG GGC TGC TCA CTC GCG TGT CGA GTC AGC CAA AGT CTT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGC TGC TGC TGC GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CGA GAA CGA CAT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGG CGA TGT GCA GCG GCT GGC GCG CGG CGA GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAA GAG GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC GCT TGG AGA AGCT CAG CCT TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCG AGC GTT AAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA.

Wait, that's a lot. Let me look for any in-frame stops. TGA is a stop codon. Looking through the triplets:

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA. Let's see:
