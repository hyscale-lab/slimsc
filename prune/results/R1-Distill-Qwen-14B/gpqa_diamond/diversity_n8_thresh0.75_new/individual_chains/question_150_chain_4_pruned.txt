Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For this formula: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring plus some double bonds or something like that.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at it again.

1H-NMR (ppm):
9.72 (t, 1H),
6.98 (d, 2H),
6.51 (d, 2H),
6.27 (bs, 2H),
3.66 (d, 2H).

So, looking at the NMR, the 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet (t), integrating to 1H. High chemical shift like thatâ€”maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the triplet could be because it's next to two protons, maybe on a CH2 group. Or perhaps it's an aromatic proton? But aromatic protons usually don't show up that high unless they're part of something like a conjugated system or an aromatic ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Wait, but 9.72 is more like an aldehyde. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the compound. Let me think.

Looking at the other peaks:

6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H.
6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H.
These could be two sets of aromatic protons. Maybe from two para-substituted phenyl groups. Because in para substitution, the protons are usually as doublets if coupling with adjacent substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene system, but the doublet pattern suggests something else.

The 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton, but it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe some vinyl protons in a
