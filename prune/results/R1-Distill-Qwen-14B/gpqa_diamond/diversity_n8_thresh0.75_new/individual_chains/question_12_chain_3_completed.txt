Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with particle physics, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, right? So this is a pion decay into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, which probably simplifies things because the total momentum should be zero before and after the decay.

They gave me the rest masses: Pi(+) has 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, but wait, the neutrino's mass is usually negligible, right? I think in particle physics, neutrinos are considered massless for these kinds of calculations because their mass is so tiny. So maybe I can treat it as zero. That should make the equations easier.

So, the problem is to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the neutrino's kinetic energy is part of the solution, but looking at the options, each has two numbers. So for each option, the first number is the KE of the muon, and the second is the KE of the neutrino. Or maybe the other way around; I'll have to check.

Wait, the problem says "KE of product particles"—so both particles. So each option gives two KEs, I think, for the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the neutrino is a lepton, and in beta decay, yes. But in pion decay, the pion is a meson, and it decays into a lepton and antineutrino (or something like that). Wait, the reaction is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Wait, no, actually, muons are leptons, and pions decay into muons and neutrinos. So I think the neutrino here is a neutrino, but in beta decay, the neutrino is emitted when a neutron turns into a proton, etc. But I might be getting confused here.

Wait, no, in this case, the pion is a Pi+, so when it decays, it should produce a mu+ (muon) and a neutrino. Wait, but wait, I thought the pion decay produces a positive muon and a muon neutrino. Or is it an anti-neutrino? Oh, I'm a bit rusty on that. But maybe it doesn't matter for the calculation since the mass is negligible.

So the key here is energy and momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me think about the energies. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_final = E_mu + E_nu.

But the neutrino's rest mass is zero (approximation), so its energy is just its kinetic energy (since E = p c for massless particles). Wait, no. Wait, the neutrino has energy E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ), but since m is zero, E_nu = p c. So the neutrino's energy is p c, where p is its momentum.

The muon has both kinetic and rest energy. Its total energy is E_mu = gamma m_mu c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Alternatively, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + m_mu c²? Wait, no, wait. Actually, E_mu is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic. So E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c².

Similarly, the neutrino's energy is just K_nu, because its rest mass is zero. Wait, no, because E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ), but m=0, so E_nu = p c. So the neutrino's kinetic energy is the same as its total energy, because there's no rest energy. So K_nu = p c.

So for the muon: E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c^2. And for the neutrino: E_nu = K_nu.

Conservation of energy: E_mu + E_nu = E_pi.

E_pi is 139.6 MeV, so:

K_mu + m_mu c² + K_nu = 139.6 MeV.

That's one equation.

Now, conservation of momentum: the momentum vectors must sum to zero. So the muon's momentum p_mu and the neutrino's momentum p_nu must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So p_mu = p_nu in magnitude.

But considering direction, p_mu + p_nu =0 → p_mu = -p_nu.

So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p, say.

Now, let's express the energies in terms of p.

For the muon: E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) → E_mu = sqrt( p² c² + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c²? Wait, no, E is in MeV, so let's think in terms of units.

Wait, let's write the equations without the c's for simplicity since they'll cancel out.

E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu^2 ), where p is in units of MeV/c, and m_mu is in MeV/c². So E_mu (MeV) = sqrt( (p (MeV/c) )^2 + (m_mu (MeV/c²) )^2 ) * c²? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused with the units here. Maybe it's better to use natural units where c=1. So then energy and mass have the same units (MeV), and momentum is in MeV/c, but with c=1, it's just MeV.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's let p be the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then the neutrino's momentum is p as well, but in the opposite direction.

So:

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )

E_nu = p (since E=pc for massless particles)

So, substituting into the energy conservation equation:

sqrt( p² + m_mu^2 ) + p = m_pi

Because the pion is at rest, E_pi = m_pi c², and since we're in units where c=1, E_pi = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So, the equation is:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

We can solve this equation for p.

Let me write it as:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p

Now, squaring both sides:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p²

So:

p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p + p²

Subtract p² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p

Rearranging:

2*139.6 p = 139.6² - 105.7²

Compute 139.6² and 105.7².

Let me calculate 139.6 squared:

139.6 * 139.6: Let me compute 140² = 19600, but subtract 0.4 * (2*140 -0.4) → no, perhaps better to compute exactly.

Wait, 139.6 is 1396/10. So 139.6^2 = (139.6)^2 = let's compute:

139.6 * 139.6:

= (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, 105.7^2: 105.7 * 105.7.

= (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So:

2 * 139.6 * p = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So:

2*139.6 * p = 8315.67

Compute 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So:

279.2 * p = 8315.67 → p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute this.

Dividing 8315 by 279.2:

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (because 279.2 *30=8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67.

Wait, 279.2 *29.7 → 29 *279.2=8096.8, 0.7 *279.2=195.44 → 8096.8 +195.44=8292.24.

So 29.7 gives 8292.24, and our numerator is 8315.67.

Difference: 8315.67 -8292.24=23.43.

So 23.43 /279.2 ≈ 0.084.

So p ≈29.7 + 0.084 ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute 8315.67 divided by 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.784.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 8315.67 / 279.2 = approximately 8315.67 / 280 ≈ 29.7 → let me just go with about 29.78 MeV/c for p.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Now, the neutrino's energy is p c, but since we're in units where c=1, E_nu = p ≈29.78 MeV.

But wait, no. Wait, earlier we set units where c=1, so E_nu = p (in MeV). So K_nu = E_nu = p ≈29.78 MeV.

Wait, but the neutrino's kinetic energy is the same as its total energy because its rest mass is zero. So that's correct.

Now, for the muon's energy:

E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² )

= sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Calculate each term:

29.78^2 ≈ 886.8 MeV².

105.7^2=11172.49 MeV².

So sum is 886.8 + 11172.49 ≈12059.29 MeV².

So sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.82 MeV.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(12059.29). Hmm, 109^2=11881, 110^2=12100. So 109.8^2 = (109 + 0.8)^2 = 109² + 2*109*0.8 +0.8² = 11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 12056.04. Hmm, 12056.04 is a bit less than 12059.29. So 109.8^2 is 12056.04. 12059.29 is 3.25 higher.

So 109.8^2=12056.04 → 109.8 + delta → let me compute (109.8 + x)^2 = 12059.29.

Expanding: 109.8² + 2*109.8*x + x² = 12059.29.

We know 109.8²=12056.04, so 12056.04 + 219.6 x + x^2 = 12059.29.

Subtract 12056.04 → 219.6 x + x^2 = 3.25.

Assume x is small, so x^2 is negligible. So 219.6 x ≈3.25 → x≈3.25/219.6 ≈0.01476.

So sqrt ≈109.8 +0.01476≈109.8148 MeV, approximately 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu≈109.81 MeV.

But E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c² → K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c^2.

Wait, m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV.

So K_mu = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV approximately.

So the muon's KE is about 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is about 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, in the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi

I subtracted p from both sides, squared, and so on. Let me double-check that.

Ah, wait, another approach. Let me denote the muon's energy as E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). The neutrino's energy is p. So the sum is E_mu + p = m_pi.

So, sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p.

Squaring both sides:

p² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

The p² terms cancel, so:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranged:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

Which is what I had earlier.

Compute 2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2.

Which gives p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi)

Wait, wait a minute, maybe I should compute it this way to avoid calculation mistakes.

So:

p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi )

m_pi =139.6, m_mu=105.7.

Compute m_pi^2 =139.6^2=19488.16.

m_mu^2=105.7^2=11172.49.

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 =19488.16-11172.49=8315.67.

Divided by (2 *139.6)=279.2.

So p=8315.67/279.2≈29.78 MeV/c.

Same as before.

Then, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 )= sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29)≈109.81 MeV.

So K_mu=E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

K_nu = p =29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches closely. So the answer should be option D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

**Given Data:**  
- Rest mass of \(\pi^+\): \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\)  
- Rest mass of \(\mu^+\): \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\)  
- Neutrino mass: \(m_{\nu} \approx 0 \, \text{MeV}\) (negligible)  

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   where \(E_{\pi} = m_{\pi}\) (since the pion is stationary), \(E_{\mu} = K_{\mu} + m_{\mu}\), and \(E_{\nu} = K_{\nu}\) (since the neutrino is massless).

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   \[
   \vec{p}_{\mu} + \vec{p}_{\nu} = 0 \implies |\vec{p}_{\mu}| = |\vec{p}_{\nu}| = p
   \]

3. **Energy-Momentum Relation for the Muon:**  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}
   \]

4. **Substituting into Energy Conservation:**  
   \[
   \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}
   \]

### Solving for \(p\):
Rearranging and squaring the equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p
\]
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2
\]
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2m_{\pi}p + p^2
\]
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2m_{\pi}p
\]
\[
2m_{\pi}p = m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2m_{\pi}}
\]

Substituting values:
\[
m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2
\]
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

### Calculating Kinetic Energies:
1. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy:**  
   Since \(E_{\nu} = p\) for a massless particle:
   \[
   K_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Muon Kinetic Energy:**  
   The total energy of the muon is:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}
   \]
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   The kinetic energy is:
   \[
   K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\)**

Answer: D
