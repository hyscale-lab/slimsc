Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question is about finding the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ in the given Lagrangian and determining whether the theory is renormalizable. The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν].

I remember that for a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive mass dimensions. Because if their dimensions are negative, that suggests we need an infinite number of counterterms, making the theory non-renormalizable. Or wait, no, wait. Because the mass dimension of the coupling constant determines the superficial degree of divergence, right? If the dimension is positive, the theory might be renormalizable. If it's negative, it's non-renormalizable.

Wait, no. Let me get that straight. For a term in the Lagrangian, the mass dimension of the coupling times the fields involved must equal 4, since the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 (because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is d^4x which has dimension -4, so Lagrangian density must be 4). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So to find the dimension of κ, I need to calculate the dimensions of all other terms in the Lagrangian term.

Let's break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, I know that ψ is a spinor field. The Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2 because in four spacetime dimensions, the action for the Dirac field is ∫ ψ̄ i γ^μ D_mu ψ d^4x, so each ψ must have dimension 3/2 to make the term in the Lagrangian have dimension 4. Wait, wait. Let's think again. The kinetic term for the Dirac field is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. Each ∂_mu has dimension 1 (since it's the derivative with respect to x^mu, which has dimension 1). So ψ̄ has dimension a, ψ has dimension b. So for the term ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ, the dimension is a + 1 + b. And this must equal 4. Since ψ and ψ̄ have the same dimension, a = b. So 2a +1 =4 → a=3/2. So ψ has dimension 3/2, ψ̄ same.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of two gammas and involves a commutator, but each gamma matrix is dimensionless, I think. Because gamma matrices are just matrices, not operators with dimensions. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Then, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Wait, but in the problem, it's not specified, but the form resembles a Yang-Mills field strength, but perhaps it's the Maxwell tensor. The Maxwell field tensor F^{
