Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about reaction mechanisms, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B. Then, I have to select the correct option from the given choices.

First, let's look at Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK.

Hmm, okay. So, the starting material is a ketone, specifically 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. That's a cyclohexane ring with substituents. Let me imagine the structure: the ketone is at position 1, and there are substituents at positions 2, 6. Wait, wait. Wait, numbering in cyclohexane would have the ketone at position 1. So, the substituents are at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl?), wait, no. Wait, the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ketone is at position 1. Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group, because 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean two methyl groups on carbon 2 and 6.

Wait, no. Wait, it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. So, position 2 has an ethyl group and two methyl groups? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Let me try to draw it.

Cyclohexanone has the ketone at position 1. So, position 2 is adjacent to the ketone. So, the substituents at position 2 are ethyl and methyl groups. So, that carbon (position 2) has two methyl groups and an ethyl group attached. So, it's a very substituted carbon. And position 6 has a methyl group.

So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone (O) at position 1. Position 2 has two methyl groups and an ethyl, and position 6 has a methyl group. So, it's a pretty bulky molecule.

The reaction is with ethyl acrylate and t-BuOK. Wait, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So, this sounds like a Claisen or ald
