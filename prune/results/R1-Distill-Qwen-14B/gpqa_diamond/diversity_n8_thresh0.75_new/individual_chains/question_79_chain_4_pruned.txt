Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on its reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and the resulting NMR spectra of the product. Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a catalyst used in the Sharpless epoxidation reaction, which forms epoxides from epoxide precursors like alkenes.

So, Compound X is probably an alkene that underwent epoxidation. The product would be an epoxide, and we have to look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of Compound X.

Let me look at the NMR data given for the product. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first two are singlets at δ 2.28 and 2.31, each integrating to 3H. Those are likely two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split the signals – maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom or in a symmetric environment. The next signals are at δ6.75, 7.08, 7.68, and 7.71. These are all in the aromatic region. 

Breaking down the 1H NMR:
- δ2.28 (3H, s): Could be a methyl attached to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. Or maybe a CH3 connected to a carbonyl or something else.
- δ2.31 (3H, s): Another methyl, perhaps in a similar environment but maybe a different substituent.
- δ6.75 (1H, d): A doublet, which might be part of a trans coupling in an epoxide. Epoxides usually have two protons that are adjacent and split each other into doublets.
- δ7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Maybe a para-substituted aromatic group.
- δ7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet. Possibly part of a styryl group or another substituent.
- δ7.71 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Could be the other side of an aromatic ring, perhaps attached to the epoxide.

Wait, or maybe some of these are from vinyl protons. Epoxide protons are usually around δ3-4, but these are higher upfield. Wait, no, the epoxide's protons in Sharpless epoxidation would be in a specific environment. Wait, but looking at the product, maybe there are substituents attached to the epoxide.

The 13C NMR has signals up to around 197 ppm, which is a carbonyl. Wait, but epoxides don't have carbonyls. Oh, perhaps the epoxide is in a more substituted environment, or maybe there's another functional group. Wait, 197 ppm is usually a carbonyl like ketone or ester, but maybe in this case, it's something else. Or perhaps an epoxide carbon attached to an electronegative group. Hmm.

Wait, 13C NMR data:
- 21.3 and 28.4 (each 1C, s): These are likely the two methyl groups. One is at 21.3, which is lower, maybe attached to an oxygen. The other at 28.4 might be a more substituted methyl.
- 126.9 (2C, s): Maybe carbons from an aromatic ring, perhaps in a symmetrical position.
- 127.1 (1C, s): Another aromatic carbon.
- 129.1 (2C, s): Another set of aromatic carbons.
- 130.3 (1C, s): Maybe a quaternary carbon in the aromatic ring.
- 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C, s): These are probably the carbons attached to the epoxide oxygen. In epoxides, the carbons are usually around 60-80 ppm, but if they are substituted, like with an oxygen, perhaps these are higher.
Wait, no, wait. Wait, 141 and 144 are more like carbons attached to electronegative atoms or part of an aromatic ring. Maybe they are part of a styryl group or attached to an oxygen.

Wait, the product is an epoxide. So, the original compound must have a double bond where the epoxide formed. Let me think about the options.

The options are:
A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, but I think option D is perhaps the same as option A, but the structures might differ. Let me try to draw them mentally.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So, the oxirane (epoxide) is attached to a styryl group at position 2. The styryl group is a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2? No, wait, styryl is a vinyl group attached to benzene. So, 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2 group? No, wait, styryl is a benzene ring with a double bond. So, 4-methylstyryl would be a benzene ring with a double bond (like CH2=CH-) attached at the para position with a methyl group. Wait, no: 4-methylstyryl is benzene with a propenyl group (CH2=CH-CH2-) attached at the para position with a methyl on the double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me
