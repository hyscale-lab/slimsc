Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again and jot down my thoughts.

The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D. They've provided the IR and NMR data for Compound X, so I need to determine what Compound X is first, right?

Let me look at the IR data first. IR peaks can tell a lot about the functional groups present.

The IR shows strong peaks around 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad region usually suggests either O-H or N-H stretches. Since the problem is about reacting with HI and phosphorus, which are typically involved in elimination or substitution reactions, maybe it's an O-H like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but another peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR spectrum has several signals.

The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, broad singlet (bs), integrating to 1H. A peak that high is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but a broad peak could also be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, but they are usually singlets because there's only one -OH proton. Alternatively, an -OH group in an alcohol might show up here, but that's usually broader and might be split depending on exchange. Wait, but if it's an aldehyde, it's a sharp peak, but this is a broad. Hmm, maybe it's a carboxylic acid -OH.

But looking further, there's a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest that each proton is adjacent to one other. So for example, in a para-disubstituted benzene, you have two sets of doublets. So, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but if it's a benzene ring with substituents, what are they? Let's see, the other signals are at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H).

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) looks like a methyl group attached to something that's a CH, perhaps. Like a methyl in an isopropyl or branching. The 0.9 triplet (3H) is likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl chain. The 1.7 (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a branching point. The 2.9 (m, 1
