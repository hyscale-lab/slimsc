Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a cage-like molecule with multiple rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 of this structure.

Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with bases, they usually undergo elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's an E2 elimination. So each Br could leave, but considering the structure, the elimination might form a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the bromines on adjacent carbons in some way? Or maybe on opposite positions. I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, adamantane's structure is such that 1 and 3 positions are on the same face or opposite faces? Hmm, maybe the elimination would form a bridge structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, but another possibility is that each Br leaves, but in a double elimination to form a larger ring or a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the KOH abstracts a proton and forms a double bond between the two carbons where the Brs were.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data can help. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of an ester or maybe a ketone. Wait, 1720 is in the range of an ester (C=O stretch) or maybe a ketone. But ketones are usually around 1700-1750, but let me think. Ester carbonyls are often a bit higher, maybe around 1740. Wait, but wait the product is 1, so maybe it's an elimination product. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. Hmm.

Wait, if it's a substitution, but with two Br atoms, it's more likely to form a diol. But wait, let's look at the NMR. The 1H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group, maybe near an oxygen. The 10H in the middle might be all equivalent, like in an adamantane structure but maybe with some branching. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, if the reaction is elimination, maybe it's forming a diene or a conjugated system. But the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. So perhaps the product isn't an alkene but something else. Wait, maybe the base caused not an elimination but a substitution. But with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double substitution.

Wait, when dibromides react with KOH, they can form epoxides, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution to form a glycol. But glycol would have OH groups, but the IR here doesn't show broad peaks around 3300, which would be for OH. So maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: maybe KOH is causing a ring-opening of adamantane. But adamantane is quite a stable structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then where is the carbonyl?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the IR. 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product after KOH is an ester or a ketone. But how does that happen?

Wait, another reaction possibility: when dibromides are treated with a base, sometimes they can form a carbonyl via elimination. Oh, wait! Maybe it's forming a ketone via a double elimination. For example, in a 1,2-dibromide, KOH can cause the formation of an alkene. But if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. But if they're on the same carbon, that would be a vicinal dihalide.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the Brs on carbons that are adjacent in the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, perhaps each Br is eliminated, but in a way that forms a ring contraction or expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a carbonyl. Wait, how? Maybe each Br is on a CH2 group, and elimination leads to forming a carbonyl group. Like, two Brs on adjacent CH2 groups are eliminated, each with a base, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, for example, if you have Br2C-R-CBr2-R', and upon elimination, you lose two HBr molecules and form a carbonyl. Wait, but I'm not sure how that would exactly proceed. Maybe if it's a vicinal dihalide, elimination forms an alkene. But if the base is strong and conditions are right, maybe it could form a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the Brs are on bridgehead carbons, and elimination forms a bridgehead double bond, but that's not very likely because bridgehead alkenes are usually not stable.

Wait, another thought: maybe the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, but with two equivalents of KOH. So two Brs are replaced by hydroxide. So 1,3-diol. Then, perhaps the diol is dehydrated to form a ketone or ester? No, the IR shows 1720, which is a carbonyl, but NMR doesn't show OH groups.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 4.79 (2H). That could be an -OCH2- group. So perhaps the product is a diol ester or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether, but the IR doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide, but then the NMR would show different signals.

Wait, considering the structure, maybe the product is a diketone. But then the IR would show a strong peak, and NMR would show carbonyl carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a gem-diol, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the product is an alcohol. But without OH groups in the NMR, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an alkyne. But 1720 cm-1 isn't the region for alkynes.

Wait, another angle: the product after KOH is 1. The IR at 1720 is a carbonyl, so it's probably an ester or ketone. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 (2H), which could be an OCH2 group. So if it's an ester, perhaps it's an ethyl ester or similar. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, maybe the 4.79 is a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, in a ketone, the CH2 adjacent to carbonyl would be around δ 2.1-2.6, perhaps. So 4.79 is higher, suggesting maybe an oxygen nearby, like an ether or ester.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction produces an epoxide, but that's not matching the IR.

Wait, let me think about the product 1. The NMR has a triplet at 4.79 (2H). That could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. Also, the 10H in the middle suggests that the molecule has a symmetric structure, perhaps like adamantane, with multiple equivalent CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe the product is a diepoxide? No, that doesn't explain the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but again, the absence of broad peaks for OH in the NMR is confusing.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product is a ketone. The IR would fit, and the NMR would show adjacent CH2 groups. If it's a ketone, maybe the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be around 2.3 or so. The 4.79 (2H) is too upfield for that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, but again, I don't see broad peaks so that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be an elimination forming a carbonyl via a double dehydrohalogenation. So, for example, if each Br is on a CH2 group attached to a CH2, eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond, but that might not directly give a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a cyclopropane or some other strained ring. Or maybe it's a ring-opening of adamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tertiary alcohol. But again, the NMR doesn't show broad peaks.

Wait, maybe the product is a geminal diol. But that would have OH groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, perhaps the IR is not from a carbonyl but from an ester. Wait, wait. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is strong, which is typical for an ester. So maybe the product is an ester. How would that form from a dibromide with KOH?

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a substitution to form a glycol, but then another reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution where the hydroxide attacks one Br, but then perhaps a neighboring group effect leads to another substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product has a carbonyl group, so perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. For instance, if each Br is on a CH2 group, elimination of two HBr could form a carbonyl group. So for example, CH2BrCH2Br would eliminate two HBr to form CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene, which isn't a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that elimination forms a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond, but that wouldn't directly give a carbonyl. Unless there's some kind of ring formation.

Wait, maybe the heating leads to more than just elimination. Perhaps the adamantane structure is rearranged. For example, the base could cause a ring contraction or expansion, forming a carbonyl in the process.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ketone or something similar.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the subsequent steps to understand product 1 better.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So if product 1 is an ester or ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylated or alkylated aromatic compound. But wait, product 1 doesn't seem to be aromatic. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(isopropoxide)3, it undergoes some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation. But without an aromatic ring, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol ester, and heating with Al isopropoxide could lead to some kind of cyclization or elimination.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide or some cyclic ether, but I'm not sure.

Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. But product 3's NMR is what we're interested in, especially the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, but before I get to that, perhaps I should focus on identifying product 1.

Another approach: looking at the NMR data. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests a symmetrical structure, perhaps like adamantane, which has multiple CH2 groups. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, maybe it's a vicinal diol. The 4.79 (2H) could be the two -OH groups, but that doesn't fit because diol protons are usually broader. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol ester, where the two OHs have been esterified.

Wait, another possibility is that product 1 is a ketone. Let's say the structure is such that a carbonyl group is formed. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, R-CO-CH2-CH2-R. In such a case, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be around 2.2-2.4 ppm, but 4.79 is higher, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 (2H) is an ether linkage, like OCH2CH2O. But then the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 next to oxygen, which is what's observed. So perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether or an acetal.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, it can form an epoxide if the dihalide is a vicinal dihalide. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon treatment with KOH, might form an epoxide. But would that explain the IR peak at 1720?

Wait, epoxides don't have a carbonyl group, so their IR wouldn't show a peak at 1720. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution leading to two hydroxyl groups, but that doesn't explain the IR either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent on the same face. So the structure would have Br atoms on two adjacent bridgehead carbons.

When KOH is added, perhaps elimination occurs, removing two Br atoms and forming a double bond. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So elimination can't happen to form a bridgehead double bond. Therefore, perhaps the elimination forms a ring contraction, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group attached to the adamantane structure. Elimination of HBr from each would form a double bond, but if that's not possible, maybe it leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps each elimination forms a carbonyl group. So two eliminations would form two carbonyl groups. But that would require each Br to eliminate with a neighboring group, which might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a single elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the IR data, if it's a carbonyl, then product 1 is either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. The NMR doesn't show any aldehyde protons (around 9-10 ppm), so it's not an aldehyde. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is more in line with an ester.

So if product 1 is an ester, how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, esters are usually formed via nucleophilic substitution or via esterification. But KOH is a base, not an acid. So perhaps the reaction is a substitution where one Br is replaced by an O- group, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a gem-diol, which then loses water to form a carbonyl. But again, I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the NMR data again. Product 1 has a triplet at 4.79 (2H). That would be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, perhaps as in OCH2CH2O, but that's a guess. The 10H in the middle (2.41-2.23) could be equivalent CH2 groups in an adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) might be another CH2 group attached to something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. But I'm not sure how that would fit with the IR data.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diethyl ester, but that doesn't fit the structure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl group. For example, if each Br is on a CH2 group, eliminating two HBr would form a carbonyl. So, BrCH2CH2Br → (elimination) → CO. But that's not possible because you can't form a carbonyl from two CH2Br groups.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group. So, perhaps the structure is BrCH2CHBr... and elimination would form CH2=CH... but that wouldn't form a carbonyl. Unless further oxidation occurs, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution to form an alkoxide, which then loses a proton to form a carbonyl. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on this part. Let me try to think about the other steps to see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Al isopropoxide is commonly used in Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation, but product 1 would need to have an acyl group or an alkyl group with a leaving group.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps Al isopropoxide would help in some kind of enolate formation or in a nucleophilic attack. Alternatively, if product 1 is an ester, maybe it undergoes some kind of acylation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is an ether, and product 2 is an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an acetylenic compound, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is causing a ring-opening of an epoxide, but that doesn't fit either.

Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, if product 2 has a double bond, that implies that product 1 must have undergone a reaction to form a double bond when treated with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or some conjugated system. Then ozonolysis would break the double bond.

But let's try to piece this together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → treated with KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm⁻¹).

Assuming product 1 is an ester, perhaps it's a diester. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, a Friedel-Crafts acylation could occur if there's an aromatic ring. But I don't think product 1 has an aromatic ring.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed via some kind of cyclization or elimination.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an alkene formed via ring-opening and elimination. Then, product 2 would have a double bond which would be cleaved by ozonolysis.

But product 1's IR doesn't show an epoxide's C-O stretch around 1250 cm⁻¹, but maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an ester or ether.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution to form a diol, which is then heated with Al isopropoxide to form an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck on product 1. Maybe I should focus on the ozonolysis step.

Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3. Ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyls. So product 2 must have a double bond. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be near a carbonyl group, perhaps as an aldehyde or ketone proton.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each fragment forms a carbonyl group. The hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear downfield.

The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring protons. For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 group, it might be a triplet. Or if it's next to a CH group with two protons, it could be a doublet.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, each carbonyl group is formed at the site of the former double bond. So if the original double bond was between carbons 1 and 2, then each fragment (1 and 2) would have carbonyl groups.

The hydrogens adjacent to these carbonyls would be deshielded. Suppose the structure after ozonolysis has a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Then the protons on the CH2 would couple with each other and possibly with any adjacent groups.

Wait, but the question says the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent), so perhaps it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, for example, if the ozonolysis produces a ketone and an aldehyde. The aldehyde protons are usually more deshielded. But in the NMR of product 3, we're looking for the coupling of the most deshielded H, which would probably be on a CH group next to a carbonyl.

Let me consider the possible structures. Suppose product 2 has a double bond in a symmetric position. Ozonolysis would break it into two identical fragments, each with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, if the double bond is in a less symmetric position, the fragments would be different.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, the initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH gives product 1, which has a carbonyl group (IR 1720). Then product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2, which has a double bond (since ozonolysis is used on it).

So, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enone (a conjugated enone), formed via some kind of elimination.

Wait, when a ketone is treated with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide, maybe it forms an enol, which could undergo elimination to form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination.

Another approach: When a dihalide is treated with KOH, elimination can form a double bond. But if the dihalide is on a bridgehead, elimination would not be possible due to Bredt's rule, so perhaps the reaction forms a carbonyl instead.

Wait, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, and elimination of HBr from each forms a carbonyl bridge. So, perhaps the product is a diketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the reaction forms a single ketone group through elimination of both Brs.

Wait, but how would that happen? If each Br is on a CH2 group attached to a bridgehead, perhaps elimination of HBr from each CH2Br group forms a carbonyl.

For example, if you have two CH2Br groups adjacent, elimination of two HBr would form a carbonyl group in between.

So, structure before reaction: BrCH2–CH2Br attached to the adamantane.

Elimination of two HBr would form O=C=O? No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a single carbonyl group, like CH2BrCH2Br → (elimination) → CH2=CH2, but that's ethylene, not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a ketone. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on the same carbon, but that would be a geminal dihalide, which upon elimination would form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the Brs on different carbons. If the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, perhaps elimination would form a double bond. But if the double bond can't form, then maybe the reaction forms a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe the two Brs are on the same carbon, but that's 1,1-dibromo. But the question states 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so they're on different carbons.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible structures again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane: imagine adamantane as four fused cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent. So, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon.

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, but since they are on bridgehead positions, elimination is not possible. Hence, perhaps a substitution occurs.

Wait, but substitution would lead to a diol (two OH groups). But the NMR doesn't show broad OH peaks, so maybe the diol is further dehydrated to form a ketone or some other structure.

Wait, perhaps dehydration of a diol forms a carbonyl. For example, two OH groups on adjacent carbons could lose water to form a ketone. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the diol is a vicinal diol, which upon heating with Al isopropoxide becomes an epoxide. Then, ozonolysis would act on the epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the diol is further oxidized to form a ketone, but oxidation usually requires specific conditions.

Wait, another approach: The NMR of product 1 has a triplet at 4.79 (2H). That could be a methylene group next to an oxygen, perhaps as in an ester's OR group. For example, if product 1 is an ester with an ethyl group attached to oxygen, the ethyl's CH2 would be around 4.79 ppm as a triplet, integrating for 2H.

If product 1 is an ester like R-O-CO-R', then the ethyl group (if present) would show up as a triplet. But how does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ester, a lactone. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, considering the IR, if it's an ester, then product 1 is an ester. So, perhaps the reaction is forming an ester via a substitution mechanism. But I'm not sure how two Brs would lead to an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the base is causing a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an oxygen nucleophile, leading to something like a diether. But that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to think about the overall process.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Heated with KOH → product 1 (ester?).

Product 1 heated with Al isopropoxide → product 2 (with a double bond?).

Product 2 is ozonolyzed → product 3.

In product 3's NMR, the most deshielded H has a certain coupling pattern.

Assuming that product 3 has a carbonyl group, perhaps from ozonolysis, and adjacent Hs have specific coupling.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the initial product 1 is a ketone. So, for example, product 1 is adamantanone. Then, product 2 would be formed via some reaction with Al isopropoxide. Maybe product 2 is an enolate or an enone.

Wait, if product 1 is adamantanone, then product 2 might be an enone formed by elimination. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent Hs.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diester, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination.

Wait, if product 1 is an ester, treatment with Al isopropoxide could lead to formation of an enol ether, which would have a double bond.

Then, ozonolysis would break that double bond into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not sure.

I think I'm going around in circles without a clear path. Perhaps I should focus on the ozonolysis step and the possible coupling patterns.

When ozonolysis is performed on a double bond, each carbon of the double bond becomes a carbonyl group. The neighboring Hs would then be adjacent to carbonyls.

For example, if the double bond is CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules. But that's a simple case.

If the structure is CH2=CHR, ozonolysis would give a formaldehyde and a ketone or aldehyde, depending on R.

The Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded. Their coupling would depend on neighboring Hs.

If the H is next to a CH2 group, it would couple with both Hs, leading to a triplet. If it's next to a CH group with two Hs, it might be a triplet as well, but if it's next to a CH with only one H, it would be a doublet.

Wait, but in product 3, the most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say the structure after ozonolysis is a ketone. The H adjacent to the carbonyl would be a CH2 group, maybe.

Wait, if the ozonolysis produces a structure like R-CO-CH2-..., then the CH2 group's Hs would be next to the carbonyl. Each H in CH2 would couple with the other H in the same CH2 (giving a triplet if coupled with another group). But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis produces a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, each H in CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs.

Wait, perhaps the Hs are in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H is coupled with two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not certain. Looking at the options, the possible coupling patterns are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the H is adjacent to a CH2 group, which is split into a triplet, and the H itself is coupled with another group, perhaps leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the H is coupled with two different sets of Hs, it could be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another scenario: the H is adjacent to a CH group that is itself adjacent to a CH2. So the H would couple with the two Hs in the CH2, leading to a triplet. Additionally, if the CH group has another H that's adjacent, that could cause further splitting.

Hmm, perhaps the H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H in CH2 is coupled with the two Hs in the adjacent CH2 group. That would give a triplet for each H, but if there's another coupling, like with a neighboring CH group, it could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2, leading to coupling with the two Hs in the CH2, making a triplet, and possibly another coupling elsewhere.

Wait, I'm not making much progress here. Let me think of the possible options.

The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group, each H would be split by the two Hs in the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there's another coupling, like with a CH group, it could become a triplet of triplets (option B).

Alternatively, if the H is coupled with two different groups, it might form a doublet of triplets (option C).

Wait, in a triplet of triplets, that would imply coupling with two different sets of Hs, each with two equivalent Hs. So for example, coupling with two sets of two Hs each.

Alternatively, if a H is next to a CH2 group (which would split it into a triplet) and also next to another CH group with two Hs, that could cause further splitting.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to a CH2 group. So the H would be split by the two Hs in the CH2, giving a triplet. Additionally, if it's also coupled with another H, like from a neighboring group, it could become a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 group and also to another CH group, leading to multiple couplings.

Hmm. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Based on the options, the most likely coupling pattern for the most deshielded H would be a triplet or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another angle: in ozonolysis, the products are carbonyl compounds. Suppose product 3 has a structure like O=C-R, where R is a CH2 group. The Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl and would couple with each other. If R is CH2-..., then each H would be next to two Hs (the other in the CH2) and perhaps another group, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if R is a CH group, then the H on CH would be next to the carbonyl and next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not sure.

Given the options, I'm leaning towards option B) triplet of triplets, but I'm not entirely certain.


The problem involves analyzing the reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product (product 3) after ozonolysis. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, forming a light yellow solid (product 1).  
   - The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or ketone.  
   - The NMR data for product 1 includes:  
     - 4.79 ppm (2H), likely a CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom (e.g., in an ester or ether).  
     - 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), suggesting a symmetrical structure, possibly related to the adamantane framework.  
     - 1.94 ppm (2H), likely another CH₂ group.  
   - Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is likely an ester or ketone derived from the elimination or substitution of the bromine atoms.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in reactions like Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation.  
   - This step likely introduces a double bond into the structure, as ozonolysis is performed on product 2 in the next step.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   - Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyl groups deshield nearby hydrogens.

4. **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - Its coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens.  
   - If the hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and also coupled with hydrogens from an adjacent CH₂ group, it would exhibit a triplet of triplets due to coupling with two sets of equivalent hydrogens.

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is **triplet of triplets**.
