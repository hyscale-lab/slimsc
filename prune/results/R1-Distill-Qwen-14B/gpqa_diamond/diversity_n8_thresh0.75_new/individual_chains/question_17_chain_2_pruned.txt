Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is related to the complex ion formation. So when Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine, they form the Ca-EDTA complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant K is given by Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Wait, but wait, in solution, EDTA is usually in various protonated forms because it's a polydentate ligand and depends on the pH. Oh, but wait, the question says the pH is ideal. So maybe we can assume that all the EDTA is in the form that can react with Ca²+. But I'm not entirely sure. But the problem states that the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex stoichiometrically, so maybe we can ignore the other forms of EDTA for this calculation.

Wait, the question says it's a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

The K value is given, so Kf = 5x10^10.

I think I can set up an expression for Kf using the concentrations. Let me write down what I know:

The reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-.

So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ).

But the problem is that in solution, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are what we're trying to find, but wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, then the total concentration of all EDTA species plus Ca species should be considered. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, wait. Another
