Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass slab that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember that when objects move, especially in physics problems, you have to consider reference frames and maybe even special relativity. Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v, so maybe it's in the realm of classical mechanics? Or does it involve relativistic effects? I'm a bit confused.

The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are formulas involving n and v. I know that the index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (which is given as c=1 here) to the speed of light in the medium. So normally, the speed of light in the glass would be c/n, which in this case would be 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so how does that affect the observed speed?

In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass itself is moving. So in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, how does that work? I think this is a case where we need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity because when velocities are involved, especially when they add up to speeds close to c, relativistic effects come into play.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving at constant velocity, so maybe it's using Galilean transformations. Oh, but light's speed isn't additive like that. Wait, in Galilean transformations, velocities just add up, but that's only at non-relativistic speeds, and light doesn't follow that. So
