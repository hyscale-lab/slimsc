Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have such a tiny mass, right? Like, for all practical purposes, their rest mass is zero. So, when the pion decays, the muon and neutrino share the energy.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after the decay, the total momentum must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Hmm, okay.

So, let's think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The rest energy of the pion is 139.6 MeV. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so its rest energy is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest energy is almost zero.

So, the total energy after decay is the energy of the muon plus the energy of the neutrino. The muon's energy is its rest energy plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy, since its rest mass is negligible.

So, energy conservation gives:

m_pi * c² = E_muon + E_neutrino

But since neutrino's rest mass is negligible, E_neutrino is just K_nu. And E_muon is m_mu c² + K_mu.

So, putting it together:

139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu

Which simplifies to:

K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

That's one equation. Now, the other comes from momentum conservation. The total momentum before is zero, so after decay, the momentum vectors of muon and neutrino must cancel each other. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum, then the neutrino's momentum is also p but in the opposite direction.

Momentum is a vector, so p_mu = - p_nu.

Now, using the energy-momentum relation for each particle. For relativistic particles, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

For the muon:

E_muon² = (p c)² + (m_mu c²)^2

So, p = sqrt(E_muon² - (m_mu c²)^2) / c

And for the neutrino:

E_nu² = (p c)^2 + (m_nu c²)^2 ≈ (p c)^2, since m_nu is zero.

So, E_nu = p c.

Wait, because if m_nu is zero, then E_nu = pc. So the neutrino's energy is equal to the magnitude of its momentum times c.

So, combining both, we have:

E_muon = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 )
E_nu = p c

And from energy conservation, E_muon + E_nu = 139.6.

So substituting E_nu into the equation:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + (p c) = 139.6

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can square both sides to solve for p.

Let me let x = p c for simplicity, so:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

x² + 11170.49 ≈ (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

Wait, 105.7 squared is 11170.49? Let me compute 105.7^2: 105 * 105 = 11025, 0.7^2=0.49, and cross terms 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49. Oh, I think I miscalculated earlier. So 105.7² ≈ 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let's compute 140^2 = 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less, so (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So, back to the equation:

x^2 + 11172.49 = (19488.16) - 279.2 x + x^2

Wait, 2 * 139.6 = 279.2, right? So the expansion is (a -x)^2 = a² - 2 a x + x².

So when we subtract x² from both sides, we get:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Now, let's move all terms to one side:

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49
Compute that: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division. 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So, 29.7 approximately?

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8. Hmm. 8096.8 is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783. So x≈29.783 ?

Wait, 29 * 279.2 = 8096.8, plus 0.783 * 279.2 ≈ 218.49. So 29.783, so x≈29.783.

So x ≈29.783 MeV/c. But wait, x is p c, so p = x / c.

But since we're dealing in MeV units, and c is 1 in these units (when using MeV and appropriate units), so p would be approximately 29.783 MeV/c.

Now, the energy of the neutrino is E_nu = x = 29.783 MeV.

The energy of the muon is E_muon = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + 11172.49 )

Calculating (29.783)^2: Approximately 887. So 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.

The sqrt of 12059.49 is around 109.81 MeV.

So E_muon is about 109.81 MeV. Its rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy K_mu = E_muon - m_mu c^2 = 109.81 -105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Similarly, E_nu is 29.783 MeV, and since its rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is approximately 29.783 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That looks close.

Option B is 7.2 and 32.8, which doesn't match.

Wait, but wait, are the kinetic energies of both particles additive to 33.9 MeV? Let's see.

4.12 +29.8 = 33.92, which is about 33.9, which matches our earlier sum.
