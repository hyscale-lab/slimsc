Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the structure of compound X. Let's see what information I have.

The compound X reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to match it to one of the four options.

First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in the opening of epoxides. So, it's likely that compound X is an epoxide that, upon reaction, forms an ether or something similar. But wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. Epoxides can undergo various reactions, but what's common with this base?

Oh, wait! I think that when epoxides are treated with amines, they can open up via a ring-opening reaction, especially under basic conditions. The base would deprotonate something, and then the nucleophile (the amine) would attack the less substituted or more electrophilic carbon of the epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

But wait, the product's NMR is given. So perhaps the product isn't the ring-opened compound, but rather something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination or some kind of rearrangement. Hmm.

Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh! That's a bulky base, often used in the Claisen rearrangement. Oh, right! The Claisen rearrangement involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. So, if compound X is an allyl vinyl ether, the reaction would undergo a Claisen rearrangement.

So, what's the structure of the product after the Claisen rearrangement? The product would have a carbonyl group, possibly an ester or ketone, and an aromatic ring, considering the starting material.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
δ 2.28 (3H, s) – a singlet, so probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, maybe an aromatic ring or a carbonyl.

2.31 (3H, s) – another singlet methyl group. Hmm, two methyl groups as singlets. Both might be attached to similar environments.

Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). So, this looks like a pattern of a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's break it down. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, you have two sets of doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substituted ring with two doublets, but the integration here is 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. Wait, that sums up to 6H, which would make sense for a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, let me think. The aromatic protons are split into four signals: a doublet of 1H, then two doublets of 2H each. Wait, no, actually, the integrations are 1,2,1,2. So sum 6H. So perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring, each causing their own set of doublets. Wait, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene (para), but that might give two doublets for the aromatic protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted styrene group or something else.

Wait, looking at the 13C NMR data:

The carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4 (two singlets, each 1C), probably two methyl groups. Then, several signals in the aromatic region (126-144), and a carbonyl at 197.7. Wait, 197 is a high chemical shift, likely a ketone or an ester or an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually around 95-100 for protons, but in 13C, they're like 190-205. So this could be a ketone.

Wait, but 197.7 is a bit high for a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, but esters have carbonyls around 165-175. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Or perhaps an aromatic ketone.

So, putting this together, the product after the Claisen rearrangement would be a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, perhaps a carbonyl group conjugated with a double bond.

Let me try to imagine the structure. Suppose the Claisen rearrangement product is a carbonyl with an adjacent double bond. So, perhaps a structure like:

Ar-C=O-CH2-CH2-Ar?

No, wait. The Claisen rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether gives a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl. So the structure would be:

The starting material is an allyl vinyl ether, which upon rearrangement would form a carbonyl group with a conjugated double bond.

Looking at the product NMR:

The two singlet methyl groups (2.28 and 2.31) could be methyl groups attached to a carbonyl group or perhaps adjacent to it.

Wait, in the 13C NMR, the carbonyl is at 197.7. That's a strong indication of a ketone (since esters are lower, maybe around 170). So, perhaps the product is a ketone.

So, perhaps the structure is something like:

Ph-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-Ph

No, wait, that might not explain the NMR.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR:

The aromatic protons are at 6.75, 7.08,7.68,7.71. Wait, the doublets may indicate coupling between adjacent protons. Let me see:

If it's a para-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. But the given data shows four signals: one 1H doublet, two 2H doublets, and another 1H doublet. So maybe it's not a simple para substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a di-substituted benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 4, but that would give specific coupling patterns.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic region is part of a styryl group (vinyl benzene). Let me think. The 13C NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7, which could be a ketone. So, maybe the structure is something like:

Ar-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-Ar

Or perhaps Ar-C(=O)-CH=CH-Ar?

Wait, let me consider the 13C data:

- 21.3 and 28.4 (two methyl groups)
- 126.9 (2C, s) — maybe two equivalent carbons in a conjugated system
- 127.1 (1C, s) — maybe the carbonyl adjacent?
- 129.1 (2C, s) — another set
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C, s) — these might be quaternary carbons, perhaps part of the aromatic ring or the carbonyl.
- 197.7 (1C, s) — the ketone.

So, the 13C NMR suggests a conjugated system with carbonyl. So maybe the structure has a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to a double bond, which is connected to an aromatic ring.

Wait, another thought: the product after Claisen would have a carbonyl group and an adjacent double bond. So, perhaps the structure is:

Ar-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-Ar

No, wait, Claisen rearr
