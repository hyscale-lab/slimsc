Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending up with compound D, and we have to identify which structure D is from the options provided.

First, let me read the problem again to understand all the steps.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell us a lot about the structure. So, a triplet usually means each proton is coupling with two others, like maybe two neighboring sets of protons. The integration of 6H and 4H suggests that there are groups with those numbers of protons. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably from a methyl group, since they are usually around 0.9-1.0 ppm. And a quartet at 1.3 ppm might be from something like a methylene group (-CH2-) next to another CH2 group. 

Wait, the triplet for 6H could be two sets of three, but 6 is a big number. Alternatively, maybe it's a single group with six equivalent protons. Like, perhaps two methyl groups each with three protons. Or maybe three equivalent methyl groups, each giving two protons? No, that doesn't add up. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-substituted group. Wait, if it's a triplet, each proton is split into three, so each is coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe each of those 6H is part of a CH2CH3 group? Let me think. A triplet for 6H could be two equivalent CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH2CH3 has six protons as a triplet, but wait, no. Each CH2CH3 would have a triplet for the CH2, but the CH3 would be a triplet as well, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a diastereotopic methyl group.

Wait, another approach: the integration is 6H and 4H. So 6+4=10H. So the molecule must have 10 hydrogens, or maybe more if there are other groups. Let's think about common structures that fit this NMR. A possible structure is 2,2-dimethylbutane? No, wait, 2,2-d
