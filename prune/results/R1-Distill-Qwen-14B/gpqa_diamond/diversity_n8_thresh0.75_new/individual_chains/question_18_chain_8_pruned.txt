Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I've got some data about their elemental abundances and their masses compared to the Sun. Alright, let's unpack this.

First, I remember that the notation like [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Oh wait, no, more accurately, it's the logarithm of (X/Y in star divided by X/Y in Sun), right? So [X/Y] = log10( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun ). Got it.

The problem gives me [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1. And [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Hmm. And the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Wait, so for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^( (7.5 -12) ), which would be 10^(-4.5). Similarly, n
