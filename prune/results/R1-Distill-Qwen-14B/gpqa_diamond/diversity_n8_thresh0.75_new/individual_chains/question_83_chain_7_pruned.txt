Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, right. Acetic acid is CH3COOH, and it's a weak acid. NaOH is a strong base, so it'll react completely with the acetic acid in a neutralization reaction. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, I need to find out the initial concentration after dilution. Then, determine the amount of NaOH added at 25% titration and calculate the pH. Also, calculate the pH at the equivalence point.

Starting with the initial dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution can be found using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So (0.05 * 20)/40 = (1)/(40) = 0.025 M. Wait, 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait. Because when you dilute a solution, the number of moles stays the same, but the volume increases. So, moles of acetic acid before dilution: Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) → 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ water, volume is 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So that part is correct.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So, the mole ratio is 1:1.

So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. Let me find the moles of acetic acid initially (after dilution): 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume, which is 10 cm³ × 0.25 = 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

So, let's first calculate the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1, this will neutralize 0.00025 moles of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

So the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution were 0.001 moles. After adding NaOH, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume at this point is initial solution (40 cm³) plus NaOH added (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no. pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256 → approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Option B is 3.17 and 6.73.

Wait, so the first pH is around 4.26, which matches option A or D. But in the options, A's first value is 4.26, D's is 4.57. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check the concentrations.

After adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH, total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075, so concentration is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. Correct.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025, so 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. Correct.

So ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333 → log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26. So looking at the options, option A and D have the first pH as either 4.26 or 4.57.

Wait, but let me think about the equivalence point pH.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point can be found by
