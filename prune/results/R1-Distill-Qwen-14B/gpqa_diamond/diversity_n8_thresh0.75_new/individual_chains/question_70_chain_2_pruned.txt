Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are various symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm. I remember that symmetry groups are part of molecular symmetry and relate to the different ways molecules can be shaped and symmetrical.

Let's start by outlining the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, the reaction could be written as A + 8B → C. I'm thinking about what this might be. Bright red product makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, 8 equivalents... Maybe B is an element that combines with A in an 8:1 ratio. For example, sulfur (S) has some compounds, but 8 equivalents might be something else.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. E is dangerous, so maybe something like a gas like chlorine or a toxic compound.

Third reaction: When C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. Acids... Strong and weak. Strong acid examples are HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak acids are like CH3COOH or HNO2. So, F is a strong acid, G is a weak one.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H. H is a solvent, so possible candidates are things like H2O (but D and B are gases?), maybe something like ethanol or another organic solvent. Wait, but D is a gas. So D is a gas, B is a gas. Their reaction gives H, which is a solvent. Wait, maybe D is HCl and B is NaOH? But that would form NaCl and water. Alternatively, maybe B is something else.

Wait, let's think about each reaction in steps.

First, reaction A + 8B → C. Let's think of a red product. One possibility is that A is a metal and B is a halogen, perhaps? Wait, but 8 equivalents is a lot. For example, if A is Fe (iron) and B is S (sulfur), but that's not 8 equivalents. Alternatively, maybe A is Cu and B is S? But CuS is black, not red. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like O2, but 8O2 would make a lot of product. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a compound with a lot of B atoms. For example, if B is O2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of O2. But what solid A reacts with O2 in 8 equivalents? Maybe A is copper? But CuO is black. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. Let's look at the third reaction. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak. Common acids from such reactions: perhaps sulfuric acid (strong) and carbonic acid (weak)? Or maybe nit
