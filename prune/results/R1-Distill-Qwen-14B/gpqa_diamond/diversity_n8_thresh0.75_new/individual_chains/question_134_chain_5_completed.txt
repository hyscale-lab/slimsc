Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acid and base solutions are mixed. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem states that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Wait, why are there three solutions? Oh, right, because when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions. And Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, providing OH- ions.

So the first thing I need to figure out is how much acid and base are present. Because the neutralization reaction depends on the moles of H+ and OH- available. The limiting reagent will determine how much reaction occurs.

Let's calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.

HCl is a monoprotic acid. So moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters). The volume is 0.5 L. So 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Each gives one H+, so 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 is diprotic. So each molecule gives 2 H+. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Multiply by 2 for H+: 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- per formula unit. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ reacts with OH- in a 1:1 ratio. So let's see the amounts.

Total H+ available: 0.28 moles. OH- available: 0.2 moles. Wait, so the OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 is less than 0.28.

So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain unreacted. But wait, wait, that's the case, but the problem is about enthalpy of neutralization. Oh, wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. So the amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, with a ΔH of about -57 kJ/mol (I think that's the value for strong acid and strong base). But wait, the actual value might vary based on concentration, but the problem probably assumes the standard value.

So the total enthalpy change would be moles of H+ reacting multiplied by the enthalpy per mole. But wait, wait, let me check. Or is it moles of OH- reacting? Because each mole of H+ neutralizes a mole of OH-.

So since OH- is 0.2 moles, the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (−57 kJ/mol) = −11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait! The problem gives all the options in kcal except option D, which is in kJ. Hmm, so I need to make sure what units I'm using.

Wait, wait a second. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given in kJ/mol. For example, strong acid + strong base is about −57 kJ/mol. But sometimes it's in calories, and 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal.

Wait, so if the calculation is 0.2 moles × (−57,000 J/mol) = −11,400 J → −11.4 kJ. Or if using kcal, 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal, so 0.2 * 13.6 is 2.72 kcal. Hmm, but that's positive, but the enthalpy is exothermic, so negative. So that calculation would be −2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is about −57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So each mole of H+ reacting releases 57 kJ.

So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is negative, so −11.4 kJ. But that's in kJ, and option B is in kcal. Let me convert 11.4 kJ to kcal.

1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is −2.72 kcal. That matches option A.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So the total reaction.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, all three solutions are mixed. So the HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is the base. So the total H+ from the acids is 0.28, and OH- from the base is 0.2. Thus, only 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate, releasing 2 H+ per molecule. So that part is correct.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (−57 kJ) = −11.4 kJ. But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I got the wrong enthalpy value.

Wait, wait, wait. Maybe I'm confusing the ΔH per mole of acid or per mole of H+.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ (or OH-). So each mole of H+ gives about −57 kJ. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But looking back at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → which is about −11.4 kJ (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ, so 2.72 kcal = ~11.4 kJ).

Wait, 2.72 kcal * 4.184 ≈ 11.4 kJ. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is equivalent to -11.4 kJ.

But the options include both kJ and kcal. So the correct answer would be either A or B but looking at the numbers.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal → which is about −11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → that's much larger, about -47.8 kJ.

Hmm, so if the calculation is −11.4 kJ, which is −2.72 kcal. So the correct option would be A. But wait, the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization when all three are mixed. Wait, but in my calculation, I considered only the H+ reacting with OH-.

But wait, wait another thing: Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- per formula unit. So for 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2, we get 0.2 moles of OH-.

The HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, giving 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

So OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the neutralization equation is: H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting is OH- (0.2 moles).

So the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 moles × (−57 kJ/mol) = −11.4 kJ.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value. For example, some sources might use −56.1 kJ/mol, but that's still around the same ballpark.

Wait, maybe I should calculate using the exact number of moles and the exact enthalpy value.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction isn't just H+ and OH- reacting. Because when you mix H2SO4 (a diprotic acid) with Ba(OH)2, the reaction could produce BaSO4 as a precipitate.

Wait, that's a thought. Because when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, it could form BaSO4, which is a precipitate. So perhaps the neutralization isn't just H+ and OH-; instead, the reaction could be a precipitation reaction as well.

Let me think about the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

The balanced equation would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of H2O.

So let's calculate the moles of each.

H2SO4 is 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles.

So the mole ratio is 0.09 : 0.1 → which is 9:10. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here.

So the reaction would consume 0.09 moles of H2SO4 and 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles H2O.

Wait, but wait, because the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1. So 0.09 moles H2SO4 would require 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2.

So after this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-, so 0.02 moles OH-.

Additionally, the HCl will contribute H+. HCl is 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles, providing 0.1 moles H+.

So after the reaction of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, we have some leftover H+ and OH-.

Wait, but the HCl is a separate solution. So HCl adds 0.1 moles H+.

Wait, but after H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, the solution now has:

From HCl: 0.1 H+

From any unreacted H2SO4: Wait, in the reaction, all the H2SO4 is consumed because it's the limiting reagent.

So the total H+ comes from the HCl and any H+ from the reaction of H2SO4.

Wait, but the reaction produces water and BaSO4. The H2SO4 is a strong acid, so when it reacts with Ba(OH)2, the H+ would have been neutralized by OH-.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider all the H+ and OH- in the system after mixing.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach.

The total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4.

HCl: 0.5 L × 0.2 M = 0.1 moles → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L × 0.3 M = 0.09 moles → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

The total OH- comes from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L × 0.5 M = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So when the solutions are mixed, the H+ and OH- will react.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The moles are 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So the limiting reagent is OH-, which is 0.2 moles. So all OH- will react, consuming 0.2 H+, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted.

So the neutralization reaction is 0.2 moles, releasing 0.2 × (−57 kJ) = −11.4 kJ.

But the options have this in kcal. So converting 11.4 kJ to kcal: 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is −2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some of the H2SO4 might precipitate as BaSO4, which would be a solid and affect the solution's ions.

Wait, no, because the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O.

So when you mix H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, they react to form BaSO4 as a precipitate. So the amount of H+ and OH- available for neutralization might be affected.

Let me calculate this again, considering the precipitation.

First, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

H2SO4 (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O (l)

Molar ratio is 1:1.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol.

The limiting reagent is H2SO4 (0.09 mol), so it'll all react, consuming 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, leaving 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2.

This reaction produces 0.09 mol BaSO4 as precipitate and 0.18 mol H2O.

So in the solution after this reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol → which dissociates into 0.01 × 2 = 0.02 mol OH-.

Now, the HCl contributes 0.1 mol H+.

Wait, but the H2SO4 that reacted would have provided H+ which was neutralized by OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but in this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 OH-.

So the reaction consumes 2 H+ and 2 OH- per mole of reaction.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to calculate the net H+ and OH- after all reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of Ba(OH)2 reacting with H2SO4 will affect the available H+ and OH- for neutralization.

Wait, maybe I should consider all the possible reactions:

1. H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O.

2. Any remaining H+ (from HCl and unreacted H2SO4) reacting with any remaining OH- (from unreacted Ba(OH)2) → H2O.

Wait, but in the reaction 1, the H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it will donate both H+ ions. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it donates 2 OH- per formula unit.

So for each mole of H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2, 2 moles of H+ are neutralized by 2 moles of OH-.

So in reaction 1, 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+; each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

So the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 mol, and Ba(OH)2 OH- is 0.18 mol. So all of this H+ and OH- is consumed in forming water.

Wait, but then the H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol, and the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol, which gives 0.02 mol OH-.

So the remaining OH- is 0.02 mol, which reacts with H+.

H+ available: 0.1 mol.

OH- available: 0.02 mol.

So H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles reacting: 0.02 mol. So enthalpy change is 0.02 × (−57 kJ/mol) = −1.14 kJ.

Ah, wait, that's different from before. So maybe I didn't account for the precipitation reaction correctly earlier.

So let me re-calculate the steps.

First, reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 (aq) + Ba(OH)2 (aq) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is limiting, so 0.09 mol reacts.

Each H2SO4 provides 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Each Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- → 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

But since only 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 reacts, the OH- used is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 mol.

So in reaction 1, 0.18 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH- are consumed, producing 0.18 mol H2O.

Now, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol → which gives 0.02 mol OH-.

The HCl contributes 0.1 mol H+.

So total H+ after reaction 1:

From HCl → 0.1 mol.

From any unreacted H2SO4: Since all H2SO4 was consumed, no additional H+.

So total H+ = 0.1 mol.

OH- after reaction 1:

From unreacted Ba(OH)2: 0.01 mol × 2 = 0.02 mol.

So, in the solution now, H+ is 0.1, OH- is 0.02.

Now, these will react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles reacting: 0.02 mol.

So enthalpy change is 0.02 × (−57 kJ/mol) = −1.14 kJ.

Wait, but that's only a small part. But wait, what about the H+ from the H2SO4 reaction? No, because the H+ from H2SO4 was consumed in reaction 1.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I considered all the H+ and OH- separately, including those from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, leading to a total neutralization of 0.2 moles, leading to a larger enthalpy change. But when considering the precipitation, it's a different scenario.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing two approaches. The correct approach is to first consider the precipitation reaction, which consumes some H+ and OH-, and then the remaining H+ and OH- react.

So in this case:

- Reaction 1: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

This consumes 0.09 mol H2SO4 and 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.18 mol H2O and 0.09 mol BaSO4 precipitate.

This uses 0.18 mol H+ (from H2SO4) and 0.18 mol OH- (from Ba(OH)2).

Leftover Ba(OH)2: 0.01 mol → 0.02 mol OH-.

HCl provides 0.1 mol H+.

So now, the H+ is 0.1, OH- is 0.02. So they react, producing 0.02 mol H2O.

Enthalpy change: 0.02 × (−57) = −1.14 kJ.

Wait, so total enthalpy change is just from this 0.02 moles.

Hmm, but this would give an answer of about −1.14 kJ, which is about −0.27 kcal (since 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal).

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the H+ and OH- consumed in reaction 1. Let me think again.

In reaction 1, 0.09 mol H2SO4 and 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 react.

Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- → 0.18 mol OH-.

These 0.18 H+ and 0.18 OH- react to form 0.18 H2O. So the enthalpy change for this reaction is 0.18 × (−57 kJ) = −10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining H+ comes from HCl (0.1 mol) and any unreacted H2SO4. But since all H2SO4 was consumed, no more H+ from there.

The remaining OH- comes from the unreacted Ba(OH)2: 0.01 mol → 0.02 mol OH-.

So these 0.02 OH- will react with 0.02 H+ from HCl.

Enthalpy change: 0.02 × (−57) = −1.14 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: −10.26 −1.14 = −11.4 kJ.

Which is about −2.72 kcal (since 11.4 kJ ≈ 2.72 kcal).

So that brings us back to the initial calculation. So the total enthalpy is −11.4 kJ, which is −2.72 kcal. So the correct option would be A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A is -2.72 kcal.

Option D is -16.0 kJ.

So the two are not directly equivalent. So I need to decide which unit the answer is in.

The question is to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when all three are mixed, so the total is -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, let me make sure about the enthalpy per mole. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, it's 0.2 × (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

Yes, that's correct.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine the moles of H⁺ from the acids:**
   - HCl is monoprotic:  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - H₂SO₄ is diprotic:  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine the moles of OH⁻ from the base:**
   - Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit:  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), which proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   - Total H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it is present in fewer moles.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - Moles of OH⁻ reacting = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - Converting to kcal:  
     \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Verify the options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
   - Option B: \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect, as it does not match the conversion from kJ to kcal.  
   - Option C: \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect.  
   - Option D: \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is incorrect, as it does not match the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A) -2.72 kcal**.

Answer: A
