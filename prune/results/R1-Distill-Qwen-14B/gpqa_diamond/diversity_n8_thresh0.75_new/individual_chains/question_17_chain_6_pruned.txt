Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the pH is ideal. The temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, what's a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent which forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. So in this case, one Ca²+ ion is bound by one EDTA^4- ion, forming a complex.

The formation constant, K, is given. I remember that the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or maybe another charge, but the exact formula might not matter here). 

The formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ). So if we have a solution where CaEDTA^2- is at a certain concentration, we can find the concentrations of the free ions.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. 

Now, assuming that the complex doesn't dissociate much, but wait, the K is 5e10, which is a large number, so it's a strong complex. That means the complex doesn't dissociate much, so the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA should be really low.

So the problem is to find [Ca²+]. Let me set up the equation.

Let’s denote the concentration of the complex as [C] = 0.02 M. The dissociation reaction is: 

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is given by K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-]

But wait, the formation constant is for the formation of the complex. So the reverse reaction would have K = 1/(formation constant) for the dissociation.

Wait no, maybe I should think of it the other way. The formation constant K is
