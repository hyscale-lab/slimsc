Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my studies. 

Alright, the question gives me two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun, respectively. But wait, I don't think the masses directly affect the elemental ratios, so maybe I can ignore that for now.

The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars, Star_1 to Star_2, I guess.

Wait, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms, n(Si) in Star_1 divided by n(Si) in Star_2, right? Or maybe it's Star_2 over Star_1? Wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So I think it's [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2], but wait, no, because the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms of Star_1 and Star_2." So maybe it's [n(Si)_1 / n(Si)_2].

Wait, but the options suggest a numerical answer, so perhaps I need to calculate the actual abundance ratio.

Let me think about how these abundance ratios work. The notation [X/Y]_star is log base 10 of (n_X / n_Y)_star divided by (n_X / n_Y)_Sun. So [X/Y]_star = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_Sun.

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_Sun. If [Fe/H] is 0, then log(n_Fe/n_H) = log(n_Fe/n_H)_Sun. So n_Fe/n_H in Star_1 is same as Sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so n_Mg/n_H in Star_2 is same as Sun.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So log(n_Si/n_Fe) in Star_1 is 0.3 higher than in the Sun. Because [Si/Fe] is log(n_Si/n_Fe)_Star - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_Sun.

So let me write down for each star their ratios.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

So n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^{0.3} × (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

But since n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun, I can write n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) × n_H1.

Wait, but maybe it's better to express everything in terms of solar values.

The Sun's composition: 12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H) =7.5 → log(n_Fe/n_H)_Sun =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → n_Fe/n_H = 10^(-4.5). 

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(n_Mg/n_H) =7 → log(n_Mg/n_H) =7-12= -5 → n_Mg/n_H =10^(-5).

Wait, that's the Sun's photosphere
