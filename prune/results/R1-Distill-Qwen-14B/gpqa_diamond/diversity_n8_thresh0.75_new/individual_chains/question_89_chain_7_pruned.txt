Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First, the initial compound is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I recognize as a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests that a ketone or ester might be formed. The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 has the following peaks: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Hmm.

Wait, so the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's quite a rigid molecule. When dibrominated at 1 and 3 positions, reaction with KOH would likely cause an elimination reaction, perhaps forming an epoxide or a ketone.

Oh wait, but wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoing a dehydrohalogenation with KOH... Wait, no, KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. But in an elimination reaction, two adjacent bromines would eliminate to form an alkene. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't adjacent. Wait, the structure of adamantane is a bit tricky. Let me visualize it. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to two others in a diamond lattice. The 1 and 3 positions are actually on opposite faces; I'm not sure if they're axial or equatorial, but the point is, they're not adjacent. So elimination between them isn't possible because they're not on adjacent carbons. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. Wait, I think in adamantane, each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three others. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br atoms on two bridgehead carbons.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps when treated with KOH, it undergoes a cleavage of the C-Br bonds. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's an SN2 reaction. But wait, with two leaving groups, perhaps elimination isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or a pinacol
