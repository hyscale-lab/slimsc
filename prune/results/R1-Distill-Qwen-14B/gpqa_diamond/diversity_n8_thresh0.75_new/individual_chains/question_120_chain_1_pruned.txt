Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right! Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer. Because parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution... I think that means the density of stars is uniform in space. So, same number of stars per volume, everywhere. But how does that translate to their distribution when we look at them in terms of parallax?

Let me visualize this. Imagine a sphere surrounding the Earth. The stars would be spread out uniformly in all directions. But when we consider parallax, which depends on their distance, the number of stars we observe in a certain range of parallax depends on how many are at those distances.

Wait, if the stars are uniformly distributed, then the number in a thin shell at a distance d would be proportional to the surface area of that shell, right? Because the volume is uniform, but when you're looking at a thin shell (infinitesimal thickness), the number of stars in it would be proportional to the volume of the shell. But wait, for a thin shell, the volume is 4πd² dd, where dd is the thickness. So the number of stars in that shell would be number = (constant) * 4πd² dd.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that in. So number of stars in a shell would be proportional to d², which is (1/plx)^2. But wait, the shell is in terms of d, but we're considering a range of plx. So the change in plx would be related to the change in d.

Let me think about the differential elements. So when plx changes by d_plx, that corresponds to a change in d. Since plx = 1/d, then d_plx = - (1/d²) dd. So, solving for dd, dd = -d² d_plx. But d is 1/plx, so d² is (1/plx)^2, so dd = - (1/plx^2) d_plx.

So the number of
