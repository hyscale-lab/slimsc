Okay, so I have this Grubbs catalyst question in front of me. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means breaking and reforming double bonds. Right, Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium based, and it's used for alkene metathesis.

The question says racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I'm supposed to find how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A to D, with C being 6. I need to think about what happens in this reaction.

First, the structure of the starting material. 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, let's draw it. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Oh wait, no, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Because pent-1-ene is five carbons with the double bond at the first position. So substituting a methyl group on carbon 3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me count. Pentane has five carbons. pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, 3-methyl would mean a methyl group is attached to the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH
