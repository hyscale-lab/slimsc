Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from Compound A. Let me break down each part.

First, the NMR of Compound A shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in proton NMR, the integration gives the number of equivalent protons. So, 6H and 4H.

The triplet and quartet suggest some splitting due to neighboring protons. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably from a CH2 group next to another CH2. Wait, 6H as a triplet—maybe two equivalent CH2 groups each with 3H? Or maybe three equivalent CH2 groups? No, wait, 6H would be like two CH2 groups with three H each? Wait, no, CH2 has two H. Oh wait, no. Wait, 6H would be three CH2 groups? Because each CH2 has 2 H. So 3 CH2 groups would give 6 H. But wait, the triplet could also be from a (CH2CH3) group maybe? Like, maybe a diethyl group.

Wait, let me think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is a common splitting for a CH2CH3 group. Because when a CH2CH3 is next to another CH2, the protons on the adjacent CH2 would split into a quartet or triplet, depending on the neighboring groups.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H—maybe it's two equivalent CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH2CH3 has 3H (the triplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring Hs). So two ethyl groups would give 6H as a triplet. But wait, each ethyl group's triplet would add up to 6H. But wait, ethyl groups (CH2CH3) have a triplet at around 0.9 ppm. So if two ethyl groups are present, their protons would all be equivalent and give a triplet. Or maybe one ethyl group with more splitting? Hmm.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet suggests three neighboring Hs. So maybe this is a CH2 group next to another CH2CH2 group or something. Wait, 4H as a quartet. So
