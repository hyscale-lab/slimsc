Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm supposed to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, first, I need to figure out what the starting material is. 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, benzene rings have substituents in certain positions. 1-bromo would be the position where the bromine is attached. The "2-d" partâ€”I think that refers to a deuterium somewhere. Wait, no, maybe it's a typo or a misunderstanding. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So on the benzene ring, there's a bromine in position 1 and a deuterium (D) in position 2.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the structure would be Br in position 1 and D in position 2. So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium next to the bromine.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, especially with halobenzenes, this might be a case of elimination or perhaps a substitution.

Wait, another possibility is that the bromide is undergoing elimination to form a benzene
