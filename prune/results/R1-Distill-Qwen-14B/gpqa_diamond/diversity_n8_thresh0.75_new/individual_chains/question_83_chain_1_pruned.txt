Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we're titrating the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll probably have to calculate both values and see which option matches.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when titrated with NaOH, a strong base, it forms acetate ions and water. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

Let me think about the initial steps. When you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're adding 20 mL of water, so the total volume becomes 40 mL (0.04 L). So the new concentration of acetic acid before titration can be found using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL, V2 is 40 mL. So M2 = M1*(V1/V2) = 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. That makes sense because diluting it by half would halve the concentration.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate how much NaOH is needed at equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid initially: volume (L) * concentration. So 0.02 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.0005 mol. Wait, no, wait: 20 mL is 0.02 L, but after dilution, volume is 40 mL (0.04 L), concentration 0.025 M, so moles are 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 mol. Oh wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, initial solution is 20 mL 0.05 M, so moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then after adding 20 mL water, the moles stay the same because dilution doesn't change the number of moles. So yes, moles are 0.001 mol of acetic acid.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume needed is (mol)/(M) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So
