Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying the molecular formula of an unknown di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data.

First, let me read the question carefully. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, meaning it has two substituents attached. The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) which shows up around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's break down what each part means. 

The first two signals are for aromatic-H. A di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns, like para, meta, or ortho. The splitting of the aromatic protons depends on the substitution. For example, in para-disubstituted rings, the protons are usually a singlet because of symmetry, but sometimes you can have two doublets if they're in certain positions. Wait, but the NMR here shows two signals for aromatic-H. So maybe the substituents are in a para position, but perhaps each substituent has different environments. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that split the aromatic signals into two sets, like one substituent is electron-withdrawing and the other is something else.

Next, there are two signals from vinyl-H. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, like in an enol ester or an aromatic ring with substituents that have double bonds, such as an ester group attached via a double bond.

Wait, wait. Since the FTIR shows an ester group, perhaps the substituents on the benzene are an ester group and another group. Oh, wait, it's di-substituted, so two groups attached. One of them is an ester. So what could the other substituent be?

But wait, the NMR has two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons usually come from double bonds adjacent to the benzene ring, like in a substituent like a vinyl group or part of the ester group. For example, if one substituent is an ester, maybe the other is something with a double bond, or perhaps the ester itself has a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a
