Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's start by going through the problem step by step.

The researcher is using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to transfect a plasmid. They introduced a coding sequence for GADD45G with an added hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. The plasmid was transfected using Lipofectamine, and they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, I need to figure out why the protein isn't being made correctly. The options given are A to D, and I need to eliminate them one by one.

First, I'll examine the DNA sequence to see if there are any obvious issues. The plus strand starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then it proceeds through several codons. I should check if there are any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the sequence before the end.

Wait, let me scan through the sequence. The sequence is long, but I can look for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let me go through some sections:

Looking at the beginning: ... ATG TAC CCATACGATG TT... Hmm, the first few codons are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCATAC... Wait, maybe I should look for the stop codons.

Looking further: ...
