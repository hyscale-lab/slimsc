Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step. So, let's read the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions and then determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) Dâˆžh, D) C2v.

First, I'll try to figure out what each compound is based on the reactions described. Let's break down the information given.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.

Hmm, I'm trying to think of a reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio. Wait, maybe A is something like sodium or another metal? But wait, 8 equivalents might mean it's a stoichiometric ratio. Let me think, maybe A is a metal and B is chlorine gas? Because sometimes metals react with Cl2 in specific ratios. But sodium chloride comes to mind, but that's a 1:1 ratio. Wait, maybe A is something else. Alternatively, maybe A is a sulfide or something else? Or perhaps it's a reaction involving sulfur. Wait, what if A is copper? No, copper and what gas? Wait, another thought: maybe A is iron, and B is sulfur, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product C is bright red. Bright red makes me think of something like sulfur trioxide? No, sulfur trioxide is a colorless liquid. Oh wait, maybe it's a metal oxide. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure if that's bright red. Alternatively, maybe C is a compound like mercury(I) oxide is red, but that's more of a red precipitate. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate... Wait, maybe C is a product like CuO (copper(II) oxide), which is black, not red. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, maybe C is a product like PbO2, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: when a solid reacts with a gas to form a bright red product. Oh! Maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur. Wait, sulfur itself is bright yellow, but when burned, forms sulfur dioxide which is a gas, not solid. Alternatively, maybe the product is a sulfide. Wait, no, perhaps it's a reaction where solid A is something like sodium sulfide reacting with sulfur? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is the formation of Na2O2? No, sodium peroxide is pale yellow. Hmm... Alternatively, maybe solid A is something like barium oxide reacting with sulfur dioxide? But that would form barium sulfate, which is white. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, Fe reacts with Cl2 in certain ratios. Iron(II) chloride is green, but Iron(III) chloride is yellowish. Wait, but the product C is bright red. Maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the product C is a nitro compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving transition metals forming colored compounds. Another thought: maybe the product is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another oxide.

Wait, I'm stuck on the first reaction. Let's think about the other reactions and see if that gives any clues.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form product E, which is extremely hazardous.

E is extremely hazardous, so maybe it's something like sarin gas, or perhaps a highly toxic compound. Alternatively, perhaps E is a nerve agent or a cyanide compound. But wait, let's think about the possible reactions.

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

Okay, so when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A (the original solid), and two acids. One strong (like HCl, H2SO4), the other weak (like CH3COOH or HNO2).

So, what compounds when reacted with water produce two acids? Maybe a sulfite or a nitride? Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids.

Wait, if C is a sulfide, like Na2S, reacting with water wouldn't produce two different acids. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, like NH2NH2 (but that's not likely). Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate? Wait, when nitrates react with water, they don't typically produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, like CaSO4, which reacts with water to form... wait, no, that's not an acid. Hmm. Maybe C is a sulfite. For example, if C is Na2SO3, but when it reacts with water, it would just stay as is, unless maybe in acidic conditions. Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. But carbonates react with water to form bicarbonate and CO2, but that's only if it's unstable. Wait, but the reaction says when C reacts with water, it re-forms A, and produces F and G, which are two different acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester? Or maybe an azide? Hmm.

Wait, maybe
