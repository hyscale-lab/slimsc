Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think about it. The question says stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx.

Wait, parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax in arcseconds is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. So a larger parallax means a closer star, right?

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax interval. So like, how many stars are there when you look at a range of, say, 0.1 to 0.2 parsecs in parallax? But wait, the problem states it's per unit range of plx, so maybe it's the number density as plx changes.

Wait, let's model this. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density (stars per cubic parsec) is constant. Let's say n is the number density.

The volume of a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr would be 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dr.

But parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me change variables from d to plx. Let's let plx = p, so d = 1/p. Then, dr = derivative of (1/p) w.r. to p. So dr = (-1/p²) dp. Hmm, because dr is positive when p decreases (since for a given p, increasing d means p decreases). Wait, maybe I should express dr in terms of dp. Let me think again: if I have p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = - d² dp. But since d = 1/p, dd = -(1/p²) dp.

But when integrating over a range of d, the limits would change. Alternatively, for a given p, the thickness in p is dp. How does this relate to the volume? Let's see.

The volume element in terms of parallax p would be? Let's think in terms of a thin shell at parallax p with thickness dp. The distance d is 1/p, so a change in p by dp corresponds to a change in d by dd = -d² dp (from the relation above). Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the volume in terms of p.

The volume of a thin shell at distance d is 4πd² dr, where dr is the thickness in distance. But since dr = (dd) for the shell, we need to relate dr to dp.

From p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. Differentiating both sides, dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² dp. But since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. So dr = |dd|, which is (1/p²) dp.

Wait, but the volume element is 4π d² dr. Substituting dr = (1/p²) dp, and d = 1/p.

So, volume element becomes 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp → 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the number of stars in that volume would be n * volume. So number of stars per unit p is n * 4π (1/p^4) → N ∝ 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait: the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx (p), so it's the number per unit p. So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/(plx)^4, which would be the case.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recount. The number of stars per unit volume is n. The volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit p is n * 4π (1/p^4). So yes, the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. So the correct answer is A.

Another way to think about it: the number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp is proportional to p^−4. So the number density in p is 1/p^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant, denoted as \( n \).

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \). The number of stars in this shell is then \( n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dr \). To express this in terms of \( p \), we use \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \) (from \( p = \frac{1}{d} \)). Substituting these into the volume element, the number of stars per unit \( p \) becomes proportional to:

\[
n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \)**.
