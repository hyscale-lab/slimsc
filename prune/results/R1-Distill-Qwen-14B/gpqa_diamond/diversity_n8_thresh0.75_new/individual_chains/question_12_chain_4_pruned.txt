Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Find the KE of product particles in the reaction Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D with different pairs of KE values.

Hmm, right, so this is a particle decay problem. I remember that in decay processes, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think in the Standard Model, neutrinos are considered massless, but in reality, they do have some mass. But for the sake of this problem, I guess we can treat the neutrino as massless because the problem doesn't provide its rest mass. So, the neutrino's energy would be equal to its momentum (since E = pc for massless particles).

Let me start by writing down the conservation laws. 

First, conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion because it's at rest. So, the initial energy is E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Each of their energies is their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. But wait, for the neutrino, since m_nu is approximately zero, E_nu = p_nu c (which is its kinetic energy because its rest energy is zero). So, the neutrino's kinetic energy is equal to its momentum times c.

But for the muon, it has rest mass, so its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). Alternatively, E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c².

So the energy conservation equation is:

m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu

And momentum conservation says that p_mu = p_nu, but in opposite directions, so the magnitudes are equal. Let me denote p as the magnitude of each momentum. So p_mu = p, and p_nu = p.

So plugging into the energy
