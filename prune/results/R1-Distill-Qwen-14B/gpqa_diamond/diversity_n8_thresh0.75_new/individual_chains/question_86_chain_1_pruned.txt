Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about reactions involving reducing agents and the stereochemistry of the products. Hmm, let's see. The problem states that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R) and (S) forms of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when ketones are reduced, the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol depends on the reducing agent and the reaction conditions. Wait, no, actually, ketones are typically reduced to secondary alcohols. Oh wait, but in this question, the products are 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, like a cyclic ether. So the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, maybe the starting material is an epoxide or an ester or something that can form a ring upon reduction?

Wait, the products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The only difference is the configuration: one is R and the other S. So that suggests that the starting material must have some kind of stereogenic center that is affected by the reducing agent's approach.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are diethyl esters or something that can form cyclic ketones upon opening. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that are being opened by the reducing agents. No, wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. Wait, another thought: maybe the starting materials are epoxides or cyclic ketals that upon reduction form the pyranone.

Wait, another angle: maybe the starting materials are carbonyl-containing compounds, like ketones or esters, and upon reduction, they form the cyclic products. But LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but if the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, then when it's reduced... Hmm, no, LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce esters, unless under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone that's part of a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone in an acetal form. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The product is a pyran-2-one. So it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone at position 2. The substituents are ethyl at position 4. So maybe the starting materials are some kind of diols or esters that form the ring upon reduction.

Wait, another approach: since the product is a cyclic ketone, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ester of a dihydroxy acid, which upon treatment with a reducing agent forms the ring. Oh, wait! I remember that when a diester is treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, it can form a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a 5-oxo-pentanoic acid derivative.

Wait, looking at the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group on carbon 3, an isobutoxy group on carbon 5, and a ketone (oxo) group also on carbon 5.

Hmm, so
