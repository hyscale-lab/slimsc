Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube—so it's one-dimensional, the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions usually need to satisfy some conditions. Oh right, they must be normalized so that the total probability of finding the particle is 1.

The problem also states that when measuring the positions, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because the square root of a negative number would be imaginary, but I think the wave function can have an imaginary part. Or maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait a second, perhaps I should consider that the wave function is given in a region where it's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So outside this region, the wave function is zero. But wait, the function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me think about the square root part. sqrt(1+x) is real when 1+x is positive, which it is for x >= -1. But the particles are found only between x=1 and x=3, so x ranges from 1 to 3 here.

Wait, but the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but that seems to have a fixed imaginary part, which might not make sense. Because in reality, the wave function is a function that can have both real and imaginary parts, but the probability density is the square of the absolute value, so the modulus squared. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is being represented as a function that's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the given wave function is valid only in that interval, and zero elsewhere. But the function as written is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that would imply that the wave function is a constant imaginary number minus a real term. That doesn't quite fit. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by some function that's zero outside x=1 to x=3. Oh, but the problem says that each particle can exist in a part of space where the wave function is as given. Hmm, maybe the wave function is zero outside that region. So, perhaps it's a piecewise function, but the given part is for the region where x is between 1 and 3.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, so the region outside is zero. So the actual wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise. But that doesn't make sense because when x is exactly 1, 1+x=2, so the denominator is sqrt(2), and so on. But the imaginary part is 0.5i, which is a fixed term. That seems a bit odd because if the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared would involve both terms, which might complicate the normalization.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed with normalization. The wave function must satisfy the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Wait, let me compute |ψ(x)|^2. ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2, because when you square the absolute value, you get (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

Wait, because ψ = A + Bi, then |ψ|^2 = A^2 + B^2. So in this case, A is (a/sqrt(1+x)), B is (-0.5), so |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

Let me calculate this integral. The integral is ∫ [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3.

Breaking it into two parts: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3, plus 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3.

The first integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total integral is a²*ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a²*ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there a mistake here? Because the wave function given has an imaginary component, which is a constant. So, when I compute |ψ|^2, I'm adding the square of the real part and the square of the imaginary part. But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|^2 is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (−0.5)² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. So my calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is actually (a/sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{-i something}, but the problem states it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is an explicit expression. So I think my approach is correct.

So a is approximately 0.85. So option B is the answer.


To determine the numerical value of "a" in the wave function, we use the normalization condition for quantum mechanical wave functions. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle in the region \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) is 1. The probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization integral is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = \int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx\)
2. \(\int_1^3 0.25 \, dx\)

For the first part, \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx\), the integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Evaluating this from \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\):

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second part, \(\int_1^3 0.25 \, dx\), the integral of the constant \(0.25\) over the interval \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) is:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combining both parts, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of "a" is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option B.

Answer: B
