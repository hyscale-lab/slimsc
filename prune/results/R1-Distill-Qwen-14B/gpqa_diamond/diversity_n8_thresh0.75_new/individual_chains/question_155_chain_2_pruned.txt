Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, the uncertainty principle says that ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation value of (P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z). So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Since the state is |ψ⟩, we'll calculate these expectation values.

The matrix for P_z is given as:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I multiply the state vector by P_z and then take the inner product with the state.

Wait, actually, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Let me write out the state as a column vector:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ]

So, P_z |ψ⟩ is the matrix multiplied by the vector.

Calculating P_z |ψ⟩:
