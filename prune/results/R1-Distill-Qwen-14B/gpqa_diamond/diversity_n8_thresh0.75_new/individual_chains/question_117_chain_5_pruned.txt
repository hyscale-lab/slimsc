Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So, the molecule must have an asymmetric carbon or some other form of chirality like in allenes or certain rings.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them can exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.** 
   Wait, biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality. Oh right, if the substituents on the two benzene rings are arranged in a way that they can't be superimposed on their mirror image. But this compound has nitro groups on the 6 positions and carboxylate groups on the 2 positions. Since the substituents on each benzene are symmetrical, might they lead to a plane of symmetry? Or maybe if the substituents are in a way that causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality.

   Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl has some hindrance, leading to restricted rotation. I remember that biphenyls with bulky groups can have axial chirality. So if the substituents on the two rings are in positions that create a chiral axis, the molecule could have enantiomers. But wait, the substituents here are at 6 and 2 positions. Let me visualize: each ring has two substituents, one at 2 and 6? Or each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate?

   Alternatively, if the connecting bond between the two benzene rings allows for rotation, then perhaps the molecule can have a plane of symmetry, but if the substituents are arranged such that they can't, then it's chiral.

   Wait, but dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate... each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each substituent is on the same ring. Wait, each ring is substituted with a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each benzene has two substituents. Are these substituents on positions that cause the overall molecule to lack
