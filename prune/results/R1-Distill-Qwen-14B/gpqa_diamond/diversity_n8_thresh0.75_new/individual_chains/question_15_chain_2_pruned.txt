Okay, so I have this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the orientation of the orbit. Oh right, the inclination of the orbit matters a lot. If the orbit is edge-on, the planet is more likely to transit.

The question says both planets have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, and P2 is 3*P1. Wait, no, the question says Planet_1 has a shorter period, so P1 is shorter. So let me think: if P is the orbital period, then P1 = P, and P2 = 3P. But wait, the question says the period of Planet_1 is three times shorter, so it's 1/3 the period of Planet_2. Oh, okay, so Planet_1's period is shorter, so it's closer to its star. Because for a star, the orbital period decreases with distance. Because of Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to a³/(M+Mstar), but since the planet's mass is negligible, it's a³/(Mstar). So, a is proportional to cube root of (P²*Mstar).

Wait, but in this case, the star for Planet_1 is more massive. Let's see, the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So, M1 = 2*M2. Both stars have the same radius, though.

So, for the transit probability, I think the formula is roughly (R_planet / R_star)², but not exactly. Wait, transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's size to the planet's orbital distance, and the planet's size relative to the star, and the alignment. The actual probability is proportional to (R_star / a)², because the area of the star is π R_star², and the planet's area is π R_p². But for the probability, it's the chance that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight. So, the probability is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Oh
