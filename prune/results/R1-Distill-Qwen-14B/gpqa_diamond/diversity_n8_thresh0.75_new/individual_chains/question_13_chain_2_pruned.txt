Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through each step carefully. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slowly.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclic compound with a specific stereochemistry. So, the starting material is (R)-Limonene, which is a chiral molecule.

The first step says the solution is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That sounds like hydrogenation. Pd/C is a catalyst used for hydrogenation reactions. Since it's stirred with H2, I think it's a catalytic hydrogenation, which usually adds hydrogen across double bonds. Limonene has a double bond in its structure, so this is probably hydrogenating that.

Wait, but how many equivalents of H2 are consumed? The problem says 1 equivalent. So, maybe the double bond is partially hydrogenated. Hmm, wait, but in typical hydrogenation, each double bond requires one equivalent of H2. Let me recall. Limonene has a structure that's a bicyclic monoterpene, specifically a limonene molecule. Its structure is a bicyclic system, perhaps with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 in the ring system. So, when hydrogenated, that double bond would become single, adding two hydrogens.

So product 1 would be the hydrogenated version of limonene. I think limonene's structure is something like a cyclohexene ring fused with another ring. Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexene derivative. Let me visualize. Limonene is actually a cyclic monoterpene with a bicyclic structure, I think it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or something similar. Wait, no, let me get that right. Limonene's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, more precisely, it's a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific arrangement. When hydrogenated, the double bond in the bicyclic system would be saturated, so the molecule would become bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.

Wait, but limonene is a cyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclic system where the double bond is in a six-membered ring. So hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the double bond, turning it into
