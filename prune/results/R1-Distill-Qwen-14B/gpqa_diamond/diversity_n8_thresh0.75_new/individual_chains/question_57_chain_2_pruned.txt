Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, the question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is often represented in terms of partial waves, each characterized by a phase shift. The amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using a sum over these phase shifts. Oh right, the formula involves a sum of terms with each phase shift δ_l multiplied by some spherical harmonics or associated Legendre polynomials, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me get this straight. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momenta l of (something involving the phase shifts δ_l). The general expression I think is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) / (2ik) * (2l + 1) P_l(cosθ) ] where k is the wave number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, does that apply here? Because the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, along the beam direction, that would be θ = 0 degrees, so cosθ = 1.

Wait, but when θ is 0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because P_l(1) is always 1. So each term in the sum becomes (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) * (2l+1) * 1. And the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum where δ_l is given.

Looking at the problem, the phase shifts given are δ_0=90 degrees, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, and δ_4=13. So l goes up to 4 here. The rest are ignored, so the sum stops at l=4.

The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam, which is the imaginary part of f(0). So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

Let me write out the expression for f(0). It would be the sum from l=0 to 4 of [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1 )/(2ik) * (2l + 1) ].

But wait,
