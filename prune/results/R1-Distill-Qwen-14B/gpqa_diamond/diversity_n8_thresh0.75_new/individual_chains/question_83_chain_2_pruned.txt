Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I think if I break it down, I can manage.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with NaOH, a strong base, it reacts to form acetate ions and water. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO⁻ Na+ + H2O.

So, the first thing I should do is find out the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We're adding 20 cm³ of water, which makes the total volume 40 cm³. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, when you dilute, the moles of acetic acid stay the same, right? So, moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So, initial moles of acetic acid = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration part. Since we're titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, let's figure out how much NaOH is needed at 25% and at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's the equivalence point? The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The original moles of acetic acid are 0.001 (from the 20 cm³ × 0.05 M). So moles NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So, at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, but how does that affect the solution? At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate.

Let me think about the 25% point. So, 25% of the acetic acid
