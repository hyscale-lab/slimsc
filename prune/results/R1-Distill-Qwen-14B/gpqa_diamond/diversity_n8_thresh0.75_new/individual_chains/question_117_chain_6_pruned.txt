Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So the presence of such centers is key. Also, sometimes meso compounds can be tricky because they might have chiral centers but are achiral overall.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected at position 1. The substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. The nitro groups are at 6,6' and carboxylate groups at 2,2'. Wait, but the rings are connected at 1,1', so any symmetry? If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it might not be chiral. Alternatively, maybe the substituents cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry. I'm not too sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the two rings are identical with substituents symmetrically placed, the molecule could be meso and not chiral. But in this case, the substituents are nitro and carboxylate on each ring. Wait, nitro is a strong group. If the groups are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetric, then there could be a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has no chiral centers but could have geometric isomerism. Wait, no, because biphenyls can have E and Z isomerism if there are substituents on both rings. But that's about stereoisomerism, not optical. Wait, but optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism. So if the molecule has a chiral center, then it can have optical isomers. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't. So maybe in this case, the molecule is symmetric. Let me think: The two rings are connected at 1,1'. Each has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each ring has substituents in the same positions relative to the connecting point. So the molecule would be symmetrical across the center connecting the two rings. So no chiral centers. Hence, no optical is
