Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answers. Let's take it step by step.

The problem has two parts: Reaction A and Reaction B. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacts with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it's probably involved in some kind of elimination or perhaps a conjugate addition. Wait, but wait—what's the structure of the starting material here?

2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group, and a methyl group at position 6. Wait, no, 2 and 6 are both substituents? Wait, no, 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Wait, no, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. Oh wait, no, wait: the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group? Or wait, maybe it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl. Wait, the IUPAC name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone has substituents: at position 2, there's an ethyl and a methyl (since 2,6-dimethyl) — wait, no. Let me think again. The base name is cyclohexanone, with a ketone at position 1. Then, substituents at position 2: an ethyl group and a methyl group. And at position 6, another methyl group? Or wait, maybe the substituents are: position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl, and position 6 has another methyl. No, wait, the numbering would be such that position 1 is the ketone. So positions 2 and 6 both have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with the ketone at 1, a methyl at 2, another methyl at 6, and an ethyl at 2. Wait, I might be getting
