Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

Firstly, the question gives me the masses of the stars—Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, Star_2 is 1.2. But I'm not sure if their masses directly affect the elemental abundances here. It says LTE is assumed, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which probably means we can use standard abundance analysis techniques, like the EW method. 

The elemental abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Wait, I think [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, more accurately, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun, so it's the logarithmic difference between the star and the Sun.

Given that, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I think I'm being asked to find (n_Si, Star1) / (n_Si, Star2). 

But wait, the options are A to D, so I need to compute this ratio.

Let me jot down the given data.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

And the Sun's composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =10^-5.

Wait, I should double-check that. The notation is 12 + log X = Y. So for Fe, 12 + log (nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = approx 3.16e-5 (since 10^(-4)=0.0001, 10^(-5)=1e-5, so 3.16e-5 is about 3e-5).

Same for Mg: log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Okay.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_
