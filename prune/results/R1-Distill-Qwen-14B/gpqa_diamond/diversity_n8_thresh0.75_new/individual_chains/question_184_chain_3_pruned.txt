Okay, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. There are four options, and I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. So, the molecule has a benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are as follows: the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at position 3. Wait, actually, in benzene numbering, we start numbering such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Let me double-check that. Oh, right, the numbering should be such that the substituents are attached to the lowest possible numbers. So position 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. That makes sense.

Now, thinking about the synthesis steps. Benzene is the starting material. Each reaction step will add a substituent or modify an existing one. The goal is to add these groups in the correct positions with the correct order to maximize yield.

Let me list out the substituents and their activating or deactivating nature. 

- tert-butyl group: This is a bulky, strong activating group (alkyl group), so it's an ortho/para director.
- Ethoxy group: Also an activating, ortho/para director, but it's an ether. Wait, no, wait. Ethoxy is actually a strong activating group because of the lone pairs on oxygen. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the ethoxy group is an activating group because it's an electron-donating group (through the lone pairs on oxygen). So it is activating and ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but wait: nitro groups are deactivating and meta-directing. So if I have a nitro group in the molecule, it will influence where the next substituents go.

But the target molecule has a nitro group at position 3. So I need to plan the order of adding substituents to ensure that each group is added in the correct position relative to others.

I remember that in electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS), groups that are strongly activating (like -OCH2CH3) are typically added before deactivating groups (like nitro), because once deactivating groups are present, they make the ring less reactive, which could complicate the addition of other groups. Wait, but sometimes the order can vary based on directing effects.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: since the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group, it would be better to add it after the activating groups so that the activating groups can better direct the incoming nitro group. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group should be the first substituent, but that might not be efficient. Hmm, perhaps it's better to add the nitro group after the activating groups.

Wait, another point: when you have multiple substituents, the positions
