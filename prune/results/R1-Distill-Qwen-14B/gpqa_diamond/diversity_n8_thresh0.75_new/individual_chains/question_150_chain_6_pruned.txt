Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then there's a series of reactions. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, I think I should analyze the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So it's (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I did that wrong. Oh wait, X is halogens, which aren't present here. So formula becomes (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 because N counts as 1. So (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's probably a ring plus double bonds and maybe some rings or triple bonds.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests it's coupled with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and are split based on adjacent groups. If it's a triplet, maybe it's adjacent to two protons on a neighboring carbon. Like in a conjugated system, maybe an enal?

- 6.98 ppm: doublet of 2H. That's in the aromatic region. Could be para-substituted aromatic protons. Maybe two protons in a para position relative to something.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet of 2H. Also aromatic, perhaps adjacent to the previous set. So maybe it's a di-substituted benzene ring with two substituents, like two substituents in the para positions, but perhaps in a more complex structure.

- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet of 2H. Hmm, broad and singlet. Broad suggests maybe exchange, like an -OH proton, but it's a singlet, so perhaps not. Or maybe it's a conjugated diene? Or maybe it's a pair of protons that are not split because they're equivalent and not near any others.

Wait, another thought: when a proton is next to an oxygen, like in a phenolic OH, but OH protons can vary. But this is a singlet, so maybe it's two aromatic protons that are equivalent and not next to any others. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system, like allylic protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton that's part of a conjugated system, but that usually gives a triplet or a multiplet.

- 3.66 ppm: a doublet integrating to 2H. That
