Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Then, I need to figure out the product.

First, let me look at the spectral data provided. The IR and NMR data. I think I should start by analyzing the IR to get an idea of the functional groups present in compound X.

Looking at the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region probably indicates an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H. Wait, but if it's a carbonyl group, maybe an acidic proton? Like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be around 2500-3300, which is in that broad region. But wait, another strong peak is at 1610 and 1450 cm^-1. Those might be aromatic C=C stretches, indicating that the compound has an aromatic ring.

So, putting the IR together: It could be a carboxylic acid since we have the O-H (broad around 3400–2500) and a carbonyl (1720). But wait, another possibility is an ester, but then the 1720 would be more typical. But the broad region could be from an alcohol. Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an alcohol? Not sure yet.

Now, let's look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR peaks:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a pretty downfield shift. Could be an aldehyde proton (but those are usually around 9-10), but more likely a carboxylic acid proton. Because aldehydes are usually singlets, but that's broad here. So a carboxylic acid OH? Or maybe an aromatic proton in a strong deshielded environment, like an aromatic ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups. Wait, but 10.5 is very high, so maybe it's a phenol? No, phenols are around 5-7 ppm. So it's more likely the -COOH proton. So that suggests a carboxylic acid group.

The next peak: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical for aromatic protons. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. Two protons as a doublet—so each one has one neighboring proton in the aromatic ring. So maybe a para-substituted ring, like 4-substituted. So the two protons on either side are equivalent and each have one neighboring proton.

Then 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons. Wait, if the ring is para-substituted, then the protons would be in a doublet. For example, if it's para to a substituent, the two protons next to it would each have one neighboring proton. So that fits with 8.0 and 7.2 as the two sets, perhaps in a para-substituted benzene.

Wait, but 8.0 and 7.2... Maybe it's a substituent that is electron-withdrawing, causing the adjacent protons to be deshielded and appear downfield. For example, a carbonyl group like a ketone or a carboxylic acid. So if the ring has a -COOH group in position 4 and another substituent elsewhere, maybe?

Wait, but wait, I thought the 10.5 ppm was the -COOH proton. So maybe the ring has a -COOH group in the para position. So the other substituent is perhaps an alkyl group.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be a CH group adjacent to an oxygen or maybe a carbonyl. Or perhaps a methylene group next to something else. Like maybe a CH in a
