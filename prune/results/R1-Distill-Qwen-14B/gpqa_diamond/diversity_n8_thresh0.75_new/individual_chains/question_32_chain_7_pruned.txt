Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm. The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is lithium with 3 neutrons, so Li-6 or something like that. Wait, lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6, so Li-6.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, you use the relativistic energy equations. The energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

The formula for gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So if the speed v is 0.96c, then v²/c² is (0.96)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28. Let's compute that. 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is m*c². So I need to find the rest mass of the lithium nucleus.

Wait, lithium-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron. So each proton contributes about 938 MeV, and same for neutron. So total rest mass would be (3+3)*938 MeV = 6 * 938 = let me calculate that. 6 * 900 is 5400, 6 * 38 is 228, so total 5628 MeV. That's 5.628 GeV.

So the rest mass energy is 5.628 GeV. So the total energy E is gamma times that. Gamma is 3.5714, so 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me calculate that. Hmm, 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857, 3.5714 * 0.628 is approximately 3.5714 * 0.6 is 2.1428, 3.5714 * 0.028 is about 0.100. So total 2.1428 + 0.100 = 2.2428. So 17.857 + 2.2428 is approximately 20.0998 GeV. So around 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but let me be precise.
