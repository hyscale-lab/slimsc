Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, with different concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant tells us about the stability of the complex. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So in this case, Ca-EDTA is a pretty stable complex since K is 5e10, which is a big number.

Wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So I think the formula for the complex would be CaEDTA^2- or something like that. So when it's dissolved in solution, it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, the problem says it's the stochiometric complex. Stochiometric probably means that the ratio is 1:1, so each Ca-EDTA complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as [Ca²+], and the concentration of EDTA^4- as [EDTA^4-]. But wait, when the complex dissociates, each mole of the complex releases one mole of each ion. So if the complex concentration is 0.02 M, then [Ca²+] should be 0.02 M and [EDTA^4-] should also be 0.02 M if it completely dissociates. But wait, that's probably not the case because K is large, which suggests that the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. Wait, no, wait a second. No, wait. Wait, the formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, the formation constant K is given as K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So when K is large, the complex is more formed, meaning the concentration of the complex is high compared to the product of the concentrations of the individual ions. But in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So let's think about the dissociation.

Let me model this. Let me denote the complex as C for CaEDTA^2-.

The reaction is C ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation of C would have K_form = [C]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Wait, but sometimes people define the formation constant as the opposite reaction. Wait, no. Because K is given for the formation reaction. So K is for C being formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Alternatively, when the complex dissociates, the reverse reaction would have K_rev = 1/K_form. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the dissociation is C ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-, then the equilibrium concentrations would involve some x.

Wait, maybe it's better to set up an equilibrium expression.

Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex. So when the complex dissociates, each mole of C produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So the initial concentration of C is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, [C] = 0.02 - x. But wait, if the solution is in equilibrium, then the amount of C that dissociates is very small because K is large, which would mean that the dissociation is not favored, so x would be very small compared to 0.02. Therefore, [C] ≈ 0.02 M.

Wait, no. Wait, K is given for the formation of the complex. So K = 5e10 is the formation constant, which is [C]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

So, the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, and the K is very large, so the complex is highly favored. Wait, but in this problem, we start with the complex. So when the complex is in solution, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But since K is very large, the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have a very small K_rev = 1/(5e10). So the dissociation is not favored, meaning that very little C dissociates. So the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be very small.

Wait, but the initial assumption is that the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So when it dissociates, each C gives 1 Ca²+ and 1 EDTA^4-. So let me model this properly.

At equilibrium:

[C] = 0.02 - x

[Ca²+] = x

[EDTA^4-] = x

But wait, no. Because the initial concentration of C is 0.02 M, and each C that dissociates produces 1 Ca²+ and 1 EDTA^4-. So if x is the amount dissociated, then [C] would be 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] would be x, and [EDTA^4-] would be x.

But since K is 5e10, which is very large, the formation of C is favored, so x would be very small. So [C] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] ≈ x, which is small.

So plugging into the formation equation:

K = [C]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) ) = 5e10.

So substituting [C] ≈ 0.02, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, so:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) )

So 5e10 = 0.02/(x²)

Let me solve for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) )= (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/(5)) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5? Wait, no. 4e-13 is 4*1e-13. sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, because (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 1e-6 * 1e-0.5. 1e-0.5 is about 0.316. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7.

So x = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Wait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with dissociation, people might model it differently. Let me think again.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The dissociation reaction is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is given as 5e10, which is for the formation reaction: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, K = 5e10.

So the reverse reaction (dissociation) would have K_rev = 1/(5e10), which is 2e-11.

But wait, in equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are x each.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the initial solution is 0.02 M of the complex. So when it dissociates, the amount dissociated is x, so [Ca²+] is x and [EDTA^4-] is x. The [C] is 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 for small x.

So the formation constant K = [C]/([Ca][EDTA}) ) = 5e10.

So substituting:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x^2)

Solving for x^2:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, let's compute sqrt(4e-13) properly.

4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13.

The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.162e-7.

So 2 * 3.162e-7 = 6.324e-7.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M, which is about 6.3e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

Wait, but another thought: EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but in the problem, we're assuming it's a 1:1 complex, so each Ca gives one EDTA. So the stoichiometry is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) ions at equilibrium. Since the solution starts with 0.02 M of the complex, the equilibrium concentration of the complex is approximately \( 0.02 - x \). Given that \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) is very large, \( x \) will be very small, so \( 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \).

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
