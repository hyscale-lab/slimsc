Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues come from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, typically around 1740 cm⁻¹. So, the compound must have an ester functional group. That means the formula will have an oxygen count that includes the ester. Esters are usually R-O-C-O-R', so two oxygen atoms from the ester group. So the formula will have at least two oxygens. Looking at the options, they all have O2, so that doesn't help narrow it down directly.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals in total. Let's break down each part.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents will affect the aromatic protons. If the substituents are in certain positions, the aromatic H's would be split into different signals. For example, para substitution would lead to two sets of equivalent H's, but in di-substituted rings, the substitution pattern could be para, meta, or ortho. Wait, but the problem states it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, maybe the substituents are in a way that leads to two sets of aromatic Hs. So two signals here.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl groups are CH₂=CH- or similar. The NMR shows one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Let me think. A vinyl group's protons can show up as a doublet if they're adjacent to another vinyl proton, but wait, in an ester group, maybe it's part of a substituent. Oh, wait, the ester could be part of a substituent on the benzene ring.

Wait, the ester group is likely connected to the ring. So maybe the substituent on the benzene is an ester, such as an aryl ester. Alternatively, the substituent could be an alkoxy group connected to another carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is something like an ethyl ester, like OCO
