Okay, so I have this question about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian is given, and I need to find the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Wait, I think σ_{μν} is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would be a part of the interaction term.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I remember that each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ = c =1). So each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension [mass]^4, because when integrated over four dimensions, it gives a dimensionless quantity.

So the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} must have mass dimension 4. Let's break down each field's mass dimension.

The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2 because a Dirac spinor in four dimensions has dimension (mass)^3/2. So ψ̄ is also 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? Since it's built from the gamma matrices, which have dimension 1 each (because gamma matrices are dimensionless, but their products contribute to the dimension). Wait, actually, the gamma matrices are dimensionless. So [γ_μ, γ_ν] would be a commutator of two dimensionless objects, so σ_{μν} is dimensionless because it's i/2 times a commutator of γ matrices. So each σ_{μν} adds no dimension.

So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimensions of (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because each ψ is 3/2, and σ is 0, so 3/2 + 0 +3/2 =3.

Now F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of electromagnetism, right? Or wait, in this case, is it for a non-Abelian field? Wait, the problem doesn't specify. But typically, F^{μν} is antisymmetric and for a gauge field A, F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ + something else for non-Abelian, but in the Abelian case, it's just the first two terms. The field A has mass dimension 1 because it's a gauge field, so each derivative ∂ has mass dimension 1. So F^{μν} would have dimension 2 because each derivative brings a mass dimension 1, and it's two derivatives. So [F^{μν}] = 2.

So putting it all together: the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions [κ] + [ψ̄σψ] + [F].

Wait, no, wait. The term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) multiplied by F. So each part's dimension is:

[κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3 + 2. Because [ψ̄ σ ψ] is 3 and [F] is 2.

But the entire Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, since each term in the Lagrangian density has dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Wait, but wait, the Lagrangian is L = ... so each term in L must be dimension 4. So the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F^{μν} must have dimension 4. So:

[κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = 4.

Wait, no, wait. Because ψ̄ σ ψ and F are factors in the product. So the dimension of the term is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F^{μν}].

Wait, [ψ̄ σ ψ] = [ψ̄][σ][ψ] = (3/2) * (0) * (3/2) ) = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Because σ is dimensionless. So [ψ̄ σ ψ] is 3.

[F^{μν}] is 2, as I thought earlier.

So the product (ψ̄ σψ) (F^{μν}) would have dimension 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, because when you multiply two terms, their dimensions add. So [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 3 + 2 =5.

So the entire term κ (ψ̄ σ ψ F) must have dimension 4, because the Lagrangian has to have [L] =4. So:

[κ] +5 =4 → [κ] =4-5= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? To determine that, I need to look at the maximum number of fields in each term. For a theory to be renormalizable, all terms in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension ≤4.

In this case, the interaction term is L_int = κ ψ̄σψ F. The dimension is 4, as we saw. So terms can't have dimension more than 4 for renormalizability.

Wait, but wait, when considering the renormalizability, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4. Wait, more precisely, the mass dimension of each term must be ≤4. Since in this case, the term has mass dimension 4 (because [κ] is -1, and [ψ̄σψ F] is 5, but [κ * ...] is 4). So each term is dimension 4.

But wait, the power counting for renormalizability is about each term in the Lagrangian. So if all terms have dimension ≤4, the theory is renormalizable. If any term has dimension >4, the theory is not renormalizable because you can't write down a finite number of counterterms.

So in this case, the term is dimension 4, so the theory is renormalizable. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: the theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension ≤4 minus the sum of the fields' dimensions in the term. Because the coupling is what's involved in the interaction vertices. Alternatively, a term with n fields has a coupling with dimension [coupling] =4 - sum of [field dimensions].

Wait, no. The standard approach is that each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension ≤4. So each term's dimension must be ≤4.

In our case, the term is dimension 4, so it's okay. So the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, but let me think about the number of fields. The interaction has three fields: two ψ and one F. Or wait, no: the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F, so it's two ψs (since ψ̄ is a Dirac spinor, same dimension as ψ) and one F. Wait, wait, each ψ (or ψ̄) is a Dirac spinor, so dimension 3/2. So for the ψ̄ σψ F term, the fields are ψ̄, ψ, and F.

Wait, but the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the number of fields is 2 (ψ̄ and ψ) plus 1 (F). Oh wait, no: ψ̄ is a separate field, and ψ is another, F is another. So three fields? Or is ψ̄ part of the same as ψ? Hmm, ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, so it's a separate field. So the term has two ψ fields (ψ̄ and ψ) and one F field. So three fields in total.

Wait, but for renormalizability, the term can have up to four fields, each with dimension 1, because 4 fields *1 dimension each=4. Or, in this case, the fields have higher dimensions. So the term's dimension is 4, so it's allowed in a renormalizable theory.

So given all that, the options are:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable.

C) [κ]=-1, not renormalizable.

D) [κ]=1, not renormalizable.

So from earlier, [κ]=-1, and the theory is renormalizable. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, is the term involving F^{μν} a derivative term? Because F involves derivatives of A. So perhaps the term is higher order in terms of derivatives, but that's okay for renormalizability as long as the dimension of the term is ≤4.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the superficial degree of divergence. But that's more for determining renormalizability via power counting.

Wait, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D =4 - (n_B * [B] + n_F * [F] + ...), where n_B is number of boson fields, n_F number of fermion fields, etc. Each term in the Lagrangian must satisfy D ≤0. Hmm, but I think that's for Feynman diagrams.

Alternatively, the renormalizability is determined by whether the interaction terms can have all their dimensions ≤4. So since this term has dimension 4, the theory is renormalizable.

So the correct answer is A: [κ]=-1, theory is renormalizable.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The mass dimension of the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$ must be 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless. Each term in the Lagrangian must therefore have mass dimension 4.

- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$, and its adjoint $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$ because it involves derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has mass dimension 1.
- The operator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless because it is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$.

The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi] = [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} = 3.
\]

The full interaction term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + 3 + 2.
\]

Since the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4:
\[
[\kappa] + 3 + 2 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$.

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension $\leq 4$. The interaction term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 4, which satisfies the condition for renormalizability. Therefore, the theory is renormalizable.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **A)** $[\kappa]_M = -1$. The theory is renormalizable. **Correct**.
- **B)** $[\kappa]_M = 1$. The theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect** (mass dimension of $\kappa$ is not 1).
- **C)** $[\kappa]_M = -1$. The theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect** (the theory is renormalizable).
- **D)** $[\kappa]_M = 1$. The theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect** (mass dimension of $\kappa$ is not 1, and the theory is renormalizable).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
