Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, I think. Or wait, no. Wait, H3PO4 is the triply protonated form. When it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (Ka1). Then HPO4^2- (Ka2), then PO4^3- (Ka3). So orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Or maybe I'm mixing terms. Some sources call HPO4^2- the dihydrogen phosphate ion, and PO4^3- the orthophosphate. Hmm, I'm a bit confused there. But for this problem, I think the question is about HPO4^2- concentration.

The Ka values are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, Ka3=1.8e-12.

So the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think these are going to react with each other in solution because they are related salts.

Wait, KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-, plus water of course.

So in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These can undergo hydrolysis reactions as well.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2- or maybe PO4^3-. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer solution where H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, and their concentrations are determined by the amounts of the two salts added.

But wait, when you mix these two, wouldn't they form a buffer solution? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and vice versa. So the solution would buffer around the pH where these two are in solution.

So, the first step is to calculate the moles of each salt.

Let me start by calculating the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.007337 mol. Let me compute that more accurately.

1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007337 mol. Let's say 0.007337 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = approximately 0.005618 mol. Let me compute 1 / 177.99: 178 is about 0.005618. So 0.005618 mol.

So, in solution, the moles are:

KH2PO4: 0.007337 mol → gives H2PO4^- (each mole gives one mole)
Na2HPO4: 0.005618 mol → gives HPO
