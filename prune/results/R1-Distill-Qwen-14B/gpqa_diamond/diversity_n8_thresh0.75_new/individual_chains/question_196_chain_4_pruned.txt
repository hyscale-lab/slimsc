Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So the question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. 

Wait, right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, for a spring with force constant k and amplitude A, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². Then, the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (where speed is max) is that same amount, so (1/2)mv_max² equals (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so things are different because of the speed of light.

Oh right, in relativity, as an object approaches the speed of light, its mass increases due to relativistic effects. So the classical approach might not apply directly. I need to consider relativistic equations of motion or energy.

The total energy in relativity is given by E = gamma m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for a harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies are functions of position and velocity. In the non-relativistic case, they are equal at the equilibrium point, but relativistically, I'm not sure how that works.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic, so K = (gamma - 1) m c². Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy is (gamma m v²)/2, but wait, no, that's not quite right. No, the correct relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², where gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy in the system would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. At maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. At maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic. So when the mass is at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So at that point, the total energy E is (1/2)kA² +
