Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters, right? And in this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 grams of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, I think. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄^3-) in this solution. The options are given, and we're provided with the Ka values for H₃PO₄: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, so I remember that when you have a mixture of different phosphate salts, it can form a buffer solution. Because phosphate exists in multiple forms depending on the pH—H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The given salts are KH₂PO₄ (which is H2PO4^-) and Na₂HPO4·2H2O (which is HPO4^2-). So, these two should form a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or wait, no—orthophosphate is usually H3PO4, but in solution, it's deprotonated. Oh wait, no, orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think.

Phosphate exists in different forms:
- H3PO4 (triprotic)
- H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate)
- HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate)
- PO4^3- (phosphate)

Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-, I think. But wait, the question says "orthophosphate ions". Oh wait, no, orthophosphate is HPO4^3-? Or is that another term? Maybe I should double-check. Oh no, wait, I think orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's deprotonated once, it becomes H2PO4^-; deprotonated twice, HPO4^2-; thrice, PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, perhaps the term "orthophosphate" refers to the HPO4^3- ion. Or maybe it's H2PO4^-—I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says, "the concentration of orthophosphate ions." So, which ion is that? Let me look up. Oh, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. So the orthophosphate ion would be the conjugate base, which is HPO4^3-? Or is that the pyrophosphate? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the phosphate species present.

Wait, but the problem gives two salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, when dissolved in water, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (so that's H2PO4^-). Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, gives Na+ and HPO4^2- (since Na2HPO4 is Na+ and HPO4^2-; the 2H2O is just the water of crystallization, so it doesn't affect the ions).

So, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. And these two can act as a buffer in the second dissociation step of H3PO4, which is where Ka2 is involved. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2- (with Ka2), or gain a proton to become H3PO4 (with Ka1), but since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- present, this is a buffer solution.

So, the problem is about finding the concentration of HPO4^2- (I think that's what is meant by orthophosphate here, but I'm not entirely sure). Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to HPO4^3-? No, because in this solution, we have HPO4^2- from the sodium salt.

Wait, but wait, I thought that orthophosphate is PO4^3-? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, perhaps the orthophosphate ion is the HPO4^3-? Hmm, maybe I should focus on the problem regardless of the term and figure out the correct approach.

So, the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So, the concentration of each can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So, the pH would be pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the problem isn't asking for pH; it's asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. But I think in this scenario, the orthophosphate (if it's HPO4^2-) is present in a certain concentration based on the buffer.

Wait, but to find the concentration of HPO4^2-, we need to know how much of each salt is present, because each contributes to their respective ions.

Let me calculate the moles of each.

First, calculate moles of KH2PO4. The mass is 1.00 g, and molecular weight is 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007338 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005604 mol.

Wait, because Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and 2 H2O. So, per mole of the salt, we get one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007338 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005604 mol.

The total volume is 0.200 liters.

So, concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007338 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03669 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005604 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02802 M.

Wait, but these are the concentrations in the solution. Now, how do the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations relate to each other and to the pH?

Since the solution is a buffer, pH = pKa2 + log ( [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] )

But wait, we don't know the pH yet. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the pH and then calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the Ka expression.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in this solution, but given that it's a buffer, the ratio of the concentrations is determined by the ratio of the moles of each salt.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, then the concentration is 0.02802 M. But that's one of the options? Let me check the options.

Wait the options are all around 1e-7 M. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the concentrations I calculated are about 0.036 and 0.028 M, which are much higher than the options. So, I must have misunderstood the problem.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a buffer but about the dissociation of the phosphate ions in solution. So, when both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, they can both act as acids or bases, so perhaps I need to calculate the dominant species and then find the concentration of HPO4^3- (if that's the orthophosphate here) considering the dissociation.

Wait, but wait, the problem says "orthophosphate ions"—if orthophosphate is PO4^3-, then perhaps I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.

Wait, but that complicates things. Because now, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which can further dissociate or associate. Let me think.

Each of the phosphate species can undergo further deprotonation or protonation.

H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2- (with Ka2 = 6.2e-8), or gain a proton to become H3PO4 (with Ka1 = 7.5e-3).

Similarly, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12) or gain a proton to become H2PO4^- (with Ka2 = 6.2e-8).

So, the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will establish an equilibrium. But because we're adding both of their salts, they form a buffer solution, primarily involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, then that's PO4^3-.

Wait, but in that case, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because the solution is buffered around the second pKa (pKa2 is about 7.2), and the third dissociation is much weaker (pKa3 is about 11.7), so unless the solution is very basic, PO4^3- concentration would be negligible.

But wait, the problem is about orthophosphate, which might be HPO4^2- or HPO4^3-? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should look up what orthophosphate refers to. From what I remember, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and orthophosphate is PO4^3-. So the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

Ah, okay, so orthophosphate is PO4^3-. That makes more sense because it's the most deprotonated form.

So, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the salts. Now, these can undergo further dissociation. The HPO4^2- can deprotonate to form PO4^3- (Ka3) and H2PO4^- can deprotonate to form HPO4^2- (Ka2), but in this solution, the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- would affect the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but if the solution is buffered primarily around H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because the solution is not basic enough. So, perhaps the PO4^3- concentration can be found using the third dissociation constant.

Let me think about this. So, the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the dissociation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So, the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

But what's the [H+] in the solution?

Wait, the solution is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation at pKa2.

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

We have [HPO4^2-] = 0.02802 M, [H2PO4^-] = 0.03669 M.

So, the ratio is 0.02802 / 0.03669 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) ≈ -0.114.

So, pH = 7.207 - 0.114 ≈ 7.093.

So, [H+] = 10^(-pH) ≈ 10^(-7.093) ≈ 8.18e-8 M.

Now, using Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

We can solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] = 0.02802 M, [H+] = 8.18e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / (8.18e-8)

Let me calculate the numerator first: 1.8e-12 * 0.02802 ≈ 5.0436e-14.

Denominator: 8.18e-8.

So, 5.0436e-14 / 8.18e-8 ≈ 6.163e-7 M.

Wait, that would be approximately 6.16e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, option D is 3.97e-7 M.

Hmm, 6.16e-7 is close to option A.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, the [HPO4^2-] is 0.02802 M and [H+] is 8.18e-8.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / 8.18e-8

Compute numerator: 1.8 * 0.02802 = 0.050436. Then 0.050436e-12 = 5.0436e-14.

Divide by 8.18e-8: 5.0436e-14 / 8.18e-8 = (5.0436 / 8.18) * 1e-6.

5.0436 / 8.18 ≈ 0.616.

So, 0.616e-6 = 6.16e-7 M.

Which is about 6.16e-7 M.

Looking back at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So perhaps I should choose option A.

But wait, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or other factors, but I think for the purposes of this problem, we can ignore that.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the buffer calculation. Let me double-check the buffer.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation was pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) = log(6.2)+log(1e-8) = ~0.79 + (-8) = 7.21.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, pKa2 is -log(Ka2). Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is about 7.207.

So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02802 / 0.03669 = 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately -0.114.

So, pH = 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093.

So, [H+] is 10^(-7.093) = 8.18e-8. That part seems correct.

So, the calculation for [PO4^3-] seems correct.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. If orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, then this is correct. But earlier I thought orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps I was mistaken, and orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe I should re-examine the terminology. Orthophosphate typically refers to the phosphate ion, PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait, orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. Orthophosphoric acid dissociates into H+ and H2PO4^-, then H+ and HPO4^2-, then H+ and PO4^3-.

So, the orthophosphate ion would be PO4^3-.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- is what we're calculating, and that's approximately 6.16e-7 M, which is closest to option A (6.24e-7 M).

But wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking about the concentration of HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

In that case, the concentration would be 0.02802 M, which is about 0.028 M, but the options are all around 1e-7, so that's not possible. So, that can't be.

So, I think I was correct in calculating for PO4^3-.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles.

Let me recheck the moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.1.

1.00 / 136.1 ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005604 mol.

So, that's correct.

So, concentrations are 0.00734 / 0.2 = 0.0367 M for H2PO4^-, and 0.005604 / 0.2 = 0.02802 M for HPO4^2-.

Now, the buffer pH is 7.093, as calculated.

So, [H+] is 8.18e-8.

Then, for the dissociation of HPO4^2-:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/ [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02802) / 8.18e-8.

Calculating:

1.8e-12 * 0.02802 = 5.0436e-14.

Divide by 8.18e-8: 5.0436e-14 / 8.18e-8 ≈ 6.163e-7.

So, around 6.16e-7 M, which is approximately 6.16e-7.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is very close.

So, I think the answer is option A.

But wait, why are the options so much lower than my calculation? Wait, no—my calculation gives about 6.16e-7, which is 6.16 × 10^-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7 M). So, I think that's the right choice.

Wait, but wait, another point: when you have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, the pH is determined by their ratio. But what about the fact that HPO4^2- can dissociate further into PO4^3- and H+? Does that affect the pH? Well, yes, but the contribution from PO4^3- is negligible because Ka3 is so small. So, the pH is dominated by the buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the calculation is correct.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the equilibrium constants provided.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Mass = 1.00 g, Molecular Weight (MW) = 136.09 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007338 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Dissociates into \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Mass = 1.00 g, MW = 177.99 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005604 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Dissociates into \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \).

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in the solution
The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.  
- \([ \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- ] = \frac{0.007338}{0.200} \approx 0.03669 \, \text{M}\)  
- \([ \text{HPO}_4^{2-} ] = \frac{0.005604}{0.200} \approx 0.02802 \, \text{M}\)

### Step 3: Determine the pH of the buffer
The solution is a buffer involving \( \text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- \) (acid) and \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \) (base). The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right)
\]  
Here, \( K_{a2} = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), so:  
\[
\text{p}K_{a2} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log \left( \frac{0.02802}{0.03669} \right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.764) \approx 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \([ \text{PO}_4^{3-} ]\)
The concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \) is determined by the dissociation of \( \text{HPO}_4^{2-} \):  
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-}
\]  
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_{a3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). Using the expression for \( K_{a3} \):  
\[
K_{a3} = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([ \text{PO}_4^{3-} ]\):  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_{a3} \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]  
From the pH calculated earlier, \([\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.18 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting the values:  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02802)}{8.18 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{5.0436 \times 10^{-14}}{8.18 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.16 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of \( \text{PO}_4^{3-} \) is approximately \( 6.16 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A** (\( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)).

Answer: A
