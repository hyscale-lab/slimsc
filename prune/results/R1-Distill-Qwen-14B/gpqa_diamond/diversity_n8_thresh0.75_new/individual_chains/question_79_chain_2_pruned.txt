Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying Compound X, which after a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day gives a product whose NMR spectra are provided. The options are A to D, each a different compound. 

First, I need to understand what the reaction is. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane sounds familiar. Oh, wait! That's a commonly used base, right? It's often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. So the reaction here is probably an epoxide opening. But wait, what's the structure of Compound X? Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane: So oxirane is an epoxide. The substituents are at position 2, with a 4-methylstyryl group. Styryl is a vinyl benzene, so it's like a benzene ring with a CH2CH2 group attached.

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane: The substituent here is a propenyl group with a phenyl attached to the first carbon. So the structure would be something like a cyclopropane ring attached to an epoxide, but wait, no. Wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, so like CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? Or maybe it's actually a substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the phenyl is on C1.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. The substituent is 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl. So propene is CH2=CHCH2-. But if it's prop-1-en-2-yl, the structure is CH2-C(Ph)=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2- with the substituent on the second carbon. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(Ph)-CH2-? No, wait. Wait, prop-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2. The
