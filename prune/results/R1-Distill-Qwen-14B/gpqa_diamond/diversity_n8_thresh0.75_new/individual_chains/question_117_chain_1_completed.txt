Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has such centers, it can exist as enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates non-superimposable mirror images. So, the biphenyl here has two nitro groups on the 6 positions and two carboxylate ester groups on the 2 positions. Wait, but the biphenyl ring has two substituents on each ring. Are they in positions that allow for cis or trans arrangements? Let me think. If the substituents are on opposite sides, is there a plane of symmetry? Or maybe the arrangement leads to different stereoisomers. Alternatively, I'm thinking about whether there's a plane of symmetry in the molecule. If the substituents are symmetrical, maybe not. Wait, the two nitro groups are on the same carbon on each ring, and same for the ester groups. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two rings. That would mean that it's not chiral, because any stereoisomer would have a mirror image. Wait, no, because if the substituents on each phenyl are in the same relative positions, but the entire molecule could be asymmetric. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should move on and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)(OOCCOCH3)-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the formula is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is HOCH2COOCH3. So the structure is: the central carbon (carbon 2) has an OH group, a COOCH3 group, and two CH3 groups? Wait no, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So for 2-hydroxypropanoate: the carboxylic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, let me get this right. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would have the OH on the second carbon, so it's CH3CHOHCOOH. Then the ester would be CH3CHOHCOOCH3. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to what? Let me see: the groups are CH3 (from the adjacent CH2), the OH, the COOCH3, and another CH3 (from the adjacent CH2). Wait, so the central carbon has four groups: two CH3 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. So that's two CH3 groups. Oh wait, that would mean the central carbon is attached to two identical groups (the two CH3), so it can't be a chiral center. Because a chiral center needs four different groups. So if it's CH3-C-OH-CH2-COOCH3, or perhaps I got the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out. The structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one bearing the OH) is connected to two CH2 groups. So the groups would be: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? No, wait wait. Let me think again. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate means three carbons. The formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH2OH
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to carbon 1 and 3
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, the structure is:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait that's 3-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, no, no. Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure would be:

CH2(COOCH3)CH2OH.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me imagine the structure correctly. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the 2nd carbon is the middle one. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CHOHCOOH. When you esterify it with methanol, you replace the -OH of the carboxylic acid with OCH3. So the structure becomes CH3CHOHCOOCH3.

So the central carbon (the OH-bearing carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent CH2 group)
- OH
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- and another CH3 (the other adjacent CH2 group? Or wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first CH3)
- OH
- COOCH3
- and the other group is a CH2? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure as:

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1)
- OH (carbon 2)
- COOCH3 (carbon 3)
- And perhaps another CH3 from carbon 3? No, wait, carbon 3 is the COOCH3 group, which is connected to carbon 2. So carbon 2 is connected to carbon 1 (CH3), carbon 3 (COOCH3), another CH3 group, and the OH? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, in the structure CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

1. CH3 (from the left)
2. OH
3. COOCH3 (from the right)
4. Another CH3? No, because the structure is CH3-C-OH-C-O-OCH3?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is more accurately depicted as:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- two CH2 groups (left and right)
- an OH
- a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would give the central carbon two identical CH2 groups, meaning it can't be a chiral center. So, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. The central carbon (carbon 2) in this structure has groups: 

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (which is a CH2 connected to the ester)
- CH3 (from the left CH3 group)
- and another CH2 group (the one on the left side? No, wait, maybe not.)

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think again: if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon (carbon 2) has:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (i.e., a -CH2-COOCH3 group)
- CH3 (from carbon 1)
- and another CH2 group (from carbon 1?)

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, so the central carbon is CH2OH, but no, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHOHCOOCH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which can also be written as HOCH2COOCH2CH3. No, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2OH, which is attached to another CH2 connected to the COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with the OH) has:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- two CH2 groups (left and right). Wait, no, the structure would be CH2OH-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2OH, and the adjacent carbons are CH2 and COOCH3. So the groups attached to the central carbon are:

- OH
- CH2- (leading to the next CH2)
- CH2- (from the previous one)
Wait, perhaps the central carbon is attached to:

- OH
- CH2CH2COOCH3? No, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about the actual structure: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, and the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH) – CH2 – COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is CH2OH, which is connected to another CH2 group and the COOCH3 group. So the groups attached to this carbon are:

- OH
- two CH2 groups (from either side)
- and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but that would mean the central carbon has two CH2 groups, so it's attached to two identical groups. So it can't be a chiral center. Because the four groups would be: OH, CH2CH2COOCH3, CH3 (from the CH2 connected to COOCH3), and another CH2?

No, wait, perhaps I'm looking at it wrong. Let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, so Carbon 2 is the central atom. The groups attached to Carbon 2 are:

- Two CH2 groups (from Carbon 1 and Carbon 3)
- and a COOCH3 group and an OH group? No, wait, Carbon 1 is CH2(OH), so the groups on Carbon 2 would be:

Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH2(OH))
- Carbon 3 (CH2COOCH3)
- and two H's?

Wait, no, because Carbon 2 is CH2 in the middle. So maybe Carbon 2 has two CH2 groups attached to it, each on either side. So the groups on Carbon 2 would be:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right)
- OH (from Carbon 1)
- and a COOCH3 (from Carbon 3)?

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more accurately:

The molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central CH2 group is between the OH and the COOCH3. So the central CH2 has:

- HOCH2-
- CH2COOCH3
- and two H's.

Wait, that can't be right because each CH2 has two H's. So the central carbon isn't a chiral center because it's attached to two identical CH2 groups.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing, but perhaps the conclusion is that this compound, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, doesn't have a chiral center. Because the central carbon is attached to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups). So it can't be a chiral center, meaning this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, wait. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. No, that's not possible because propanoate is three carbons. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one in the middle) is attached to:

- two CH2 groups (from each side)
- an OH group
- and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but that would mean the central carbon is attached to two CH2 groups, which are identical, so it can't be a chiral center. So this molecule doesn't have a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism. Hmm, but this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe I should look at the actual structure again. Maybe the molecule is (R)- or (S)-configured if the groups are different.

Wait, wait, maybe the central carbon (carbon 2) has the following groups:

- OH
- COOCH3
- CH2CH3 (from the adjacent carbon)
- and another CH2 group?

No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's move on to the next compound and come back.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Phenyl)(phenyl)ketone, structure is (Ph)C(O)(Ph). So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl group (C=O), and a lone pair (since it's a ketone). Wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond, so the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, an oxygen (double bond), and another carbon (the ketone group is C=O). But wait, the structure of benzophenone is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon (the one in the ketone) is connected to two phenyl groups, an oxygen (as part of the carbonyl), and another carbon (which is part of the carbonyl group). Wait, no, the carbonyl is O=C-.

Wait, benzophenone's structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the central carbon (the one in the carbonyl) is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's sp2 hybridized. So that carbon can't be a chiral center because it's not a tetrahedral carbon. So no chiral centers here, meaning no optical isomerism. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but wait, no, wait. Wait, fumaric acid is trans-2,3-dicarboxylic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, no. Fumarate is the trans diastereomer. Its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate: CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3). Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

The fumarate ion is the trans-diepoxide form, so in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. No, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Fumarate is a substituted maleate, so the structure is (E)-1,2-dicarboxyethene. So the structure is:

O
||
O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3?

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the structure is actually (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3). No, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3, but in the trans configuration. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but the molecule has a double bond, and the substituents (the ester groups) are on opposite sides. So for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center. Wait, but wait, dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond with two ester groups on either side. So the molecule is symmetric?

No, wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides, does that create a chiral center? Wait, in the molecule, each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two ester groups and two CH2 groups. Let me think again: the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but in a trans configuration across the double bond. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides.

Wait, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is actually (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So each of the double-bonded carbons has two ester groups. So, for example, on the left, the CH2 group is connected to two COOCH3 groups, and on the right, similarly.

Wait, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So it's symmetrical. So any substituents would have mirror images. So, does that mean that the molecule itself is not chiral? Because in order to have optical isomerism, the molecule should not have a plane of symmetry. Oh, but wait, if the molecule has a double bond with substituents on opposite sides, but the entire molecule is symmetrical. So maybe it doesn't have any chiral centers.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Another approach: optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center. Alternatively, it can occur in cases like allenes or certain other structures, but in this case, I'm focusing on whether chiral centers are present.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the double bond carbons is connected to two ester groups and two methyl groups (from the CH2). Wait, no, perhaps each is connected to two ester groups and two H's. Wait, no. Let me see: fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in trans configuration. So each of the double bond carbons is connected to two ester groups on opposite sides.

Wait, but that would mean each double bond carbon is connected to two ester groups and two CH2 groups. Wait, no. Let me think: the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3? No, wait, no. The correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but arranged in the trans configuration. So each of the double bond carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups, but arranged opposite to each other. So each C is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So that would make each C connected to two identical groups (the two COOCH3), and perhaps two H's. So, each C is connected to two COOCH3 groups, two H's. So each C is CH2(COOCH3)2? No, that can't be right because that would be a single bond.

Wait, no, the structure of fumarate is O=C-(CH2)2-C=O, but that's for maleic acid. Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let me get this straight: maleic acid is cis, and fumarate is the trans form. The structure is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the correct structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for maleic acid, but that's not right. Wait, no, maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side (cis), and fumarate is the trans form, so the COOH groups are on opposite sides.

But when esterified with methanol, the -OH groups become ester groups. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but that's not right. Wait, no, the structure is (E)-CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's better drawn as:

O
||
O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

In that structure, each of the double bond carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each of these carbons would have two identical substituents, which would make it impossible for them to be chiral centers. Because a chiral center requires four different substituents.

So, if each of the double bond carbons in dimethyl fumarate is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and two H's, then each C has two identical groups (the two COOCH3), and two H's. So each would have groups: two H, two COOCH3. So that's not four different groups, so no chiral center. Hence, no optical isomerism. But wait, wait. There's another possibility: the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So, even if a molecule doesn't have a chiral center, if it has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So if the molecule is symmetrical, then it wouldn't have any optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about another possibility: maybe the molecule has some other chiral centers.

Wait, another approach: the question is which of these compounds show optical isomerism. So let's go through each one again.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Biphenyl structures can exhibit stereoisomerism if the substituents on each phenyl ring are arranged in a way that allows for cis or trans isomerism. So, in this case, the biphenyl has nitro groups on the 6 positions and carboxylate ester groups on the 2 positions. So each phenyl ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester group at position 2.

Wait, the biphenyl has a single bond between the two benzene rings, allowing for rotation unless the substituents are bulky enough to prevent free rotation. However, in such cases, the substituents can create different diastereomers if they are arranged in a way that their positions relative to each other can't rotate into a mirror image.

Wait, in this case, each ring has a nitro group in the 6 position and a ester group in the 2 position. So how are these arranged on each ring? Let me imagine the structure: each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Since the rings are connected at position 1 and 1' (the [1,1'-biphenyl] part), the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring.

Wait, the positions on each ring would be such that the 2 and 6 positions are para to each other. So each ring has substituents in the para positions relative to the biphenyl junction. So when looking at the biphenyl structure, each ring has substituents in the 2 and 6 positions. Because of the biphenyl's single bond, these substituents can be arranged in a way that's either on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans) relative to the central bond.

Wait, but wait, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions. So, for each ring, the nitro is at 6 and the ester at 2. But that means that on each ring, the substituents are para to each other. So when considering the biphenyl, if the substituents on both rings are arranged in a way that their positions relative to each other are either cis or trans, that would create stereoisomerism.

So, in this case, is the molecule capable of having stereoisomers? Because the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, but their arrangement across the biphenyl can lead to different diastereomers.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism. So if the molecule has stereoisomers, then it can exhibit optical isomerism if it's chiral.

But wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry and must have a chiral center or some other feature like a helix. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, and the biphenyl ring is symmetric. So, for example, if both nitro groups are on the same side of the central bond, and the ester groups are on the same side, would that create a chiral molecule?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Because each substituent on the two rings is mirrored on the other side.

Hmm, I'm a bit unsure about this one. It's possible that this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism because it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Moving on to compound 4 again: dimethyl fumarate. Earlier, I thought that each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups, making them not chiral centers. But wait, perhaps there's another consideration. Maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole is chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are on opposite sides (trans), but the molecule is symmetrical, then it wouldn't be chiral. For example, think about (E)-but-2-ene, which is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Similarly, trans-dimethyl fumarate might have a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral. So it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about another approach. Let's move to the options.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4
B) 3 and 4
C) 2 and 3
D) 1 and 2

We have to determine which of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

From earlier analysis, compound 3 (benzophenone) doesn't have optical isomerism because it lacks a chiral center and is planar.

Compound 4: I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-diepoxy, so the substituents are opposite. So each ester group is on opposite sides. So the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical activity. So no optical isomerism.

So which compounds have optical isomerism?

Compound 1: I'm unsure, but perhaps it does. Because the substituents on each ring could be arranged in a way that creates a chiral molecule.

Compound 2: Earlier analysis suggests it doesn't have a chiral center because the central carbon is attached to two identical groups, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine compound 2. The structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the adjacent CH2)
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH2 group (from the adjacent CH2). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me imagine the structure correctly.

Wait, the correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)-CH2-COOCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is CH(OH), attached to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- two H's?

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would mean the central carbon is attached to CH3, COOCH3, two H's, and an OH. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHOHCOOCH3. No, that's not possible because the formula would be longer.

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure as HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the middle CH2. So the groups attached to the central carbon (CH2) are:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right)
- COOCH3
- and OH.

Wait, no. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another CH group (from the adjacent CH2). No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central CH is attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH (on the CH)
- and another CH2 group (wait, no, because that would be three substituents).

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH2OH) is connected to:

- CH2COOCH3
- and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, because CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 would have the structure where the central carbon is CH2OH, connected to another CH2 group (which is connected to COOCH3), and two H's. So the central carbon (CH2OH) has:

- two H's
- CH2COOCH3
- and another CH2 group (from the left).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the actual groups attached to the central carbon. If it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon has:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH (on the central carbon)
- and another CH group (from the adjacent CH2), but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHOHCOOCH3, but I don't think so. 

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that the central carbon (the one with OH) has four different groups.

Wait, let me think: in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (the second CH) has:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (on itself)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and another CH group (from the right side? No, because the right side is COOCH3.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Another approach: if the central carbon in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has four different groups, then it's a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

What are the groups attached to the central carbon?

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the groups are:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (on central)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and another CH2 group?

No, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and another CH2 group (from the right?), which is the same as the COOCH3's CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the four substituents on the central carbon as:

1. CH3
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. CH2 (from the adjacent CH2 group)

But that doesn't make sense because CH2 is not a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

1. CH3
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. another CH2 group (but that's the same as the first substituent?), which would mean it's identical. So that can't be a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central CH2 (the middle CH2) is attached to:

- two CH2 groups (left and right)
- COOCH3
- and OH.

Wait, no, in that case, the middle CH2 is attached to:

- two H's
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and OH (from the left).

No, that's not possible. I think I'm stuck on this; perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe I should make a decision based on the options.

So, based on the previous analysis:

- Compound 1: I'm unsure, but perhaps it's chiral. Let's say yes for now.

- Compound 2: Earlier, I thought it doesn't have a chiral center because the central carbon is attached to two identical groups. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, no, wait a minute. If the central carbon is attached to four different groups, it would be chiral. Let me think again: in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (right)
- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct substituents are:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (central)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and another CH2 group (same as the left?), which would make two substituents identical. So no chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon has:

- CH3
- OH
- COOCH3
- and another CH2 group, but that's the same as the CH3's group, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (R)- or (S)-configured, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that compound 2 does have a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism. Because if the central carbon has four different groups, then it's chiral.

Wait, if the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, then the groups on the central carbon (CHOH) are:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and another CH3 (from the right COOCH3 group?) No, that can't be.

Wait, no. The COOCH3 group is O=C-O-CH3. So the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (on itself)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and another CH2 group (from the right side, which is connected to the COOCH3).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central CH2 is attached to:

- two CH2 groups (left and right)
- COOCH3
- and OH.

Wait, but that would mean the central carbon has two identical substituents (the two CH2 groups), so no chiral center.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

So, which compounds have optical isomerism?

From the options, the only compound that possibly has optical isomerism is compound 4, but earlier I thought it doesn't. Hmm.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond with substituents on opposite sides. So the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism except maybe compound 1.

Wait, but I'm not sure about compound 1. Let me think: the biphenyl has two nitro groups and two ester groups. Could that arrangement lead to a chiral molecule?

If the substituents on each ring are arranged so that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. For example, if the nitro and ester groups are in positions that create a non-superimposable mirror image.

In the structure dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, each ring has a nitro at 6 and ester at 2. Are these positions such that the substituents are in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical?

Wait, the substituents on each ring are in the 2 and 6 positions, which are para to each other. So for each ring, nitro is at 6, ester at 2. So when you look at the biphenyl, each substituent is across from the other. So when looking at the entire molecule, the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to a chiral molecule.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical along the central bond, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then none of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But that can't be right because the options don't include that possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is not symmetrical. Wait, no, because each substituent is the same on both sides. So, for example, each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group on either end. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond, making it achiral.

So, if I'm correct, then among the four compounds, only compound 4 has a structure that could lead to optical isomerism. But earlier I thought it doesn't.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me consider that dimethyl fumarate is a trans diester, which might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me recap which compounds could have optical isomerism:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm unsure. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center, then yes.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: I'm unsure. If the central carbon has four different groups, then yes.

3. Benzophenone: No.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No.

From the options, option A is 1,2,4. But I'm not sure about 1 and 2.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds have a chiral center?

Compound 2: If the central carbon is a chiral center, then yes.

So let me imagine the structure correctly. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. Wait, the central carbon (CHOH) is attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (on itself)
- COOCH3 (right)
- and another CH group (from the right side?)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure as:

The molecule is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the middle CH2. So the groups attached to it are:

- two CH2 groups (left and right)
- COOCH3
- and OH.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another CH group (from the adjacent carbon? No, that's the same as CH3.)

Wait, perhaps the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3
- COOCH3
- OH
- and another CH2 group.

Wait, that would make four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and CH2. So that would be a chiral center. So compound 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then compound 2 has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, which compounds have optical isomerism:

Compound 2: yes.

Compound 1: I'm still unsure. Let me think again.

In compound 1, the structure is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Each phenyl ring has nitro at 6 and ester at 2. Are the substituents arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral?

The biphenyl system can have two possible configurations: the substituents can be on the same face (cis) or opposite faces (trans). But if the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, the molecule might be symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, perhaps the two nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl, and the two ester groups are also on the same side. But if the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that their positions lead to no symmetry, hence making the molecule chiral.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Let's make a decision based on what I've analyzed so far.

Compound 2: yes, optical isomerism.

Compound 4: no.

So, looking at the options:

Option A includes 1,2,4. But I'm not sure about 1.

Option D is 1 and 2.

If compound 1 also has optical isomerism, then option D would include both.

But I'm not certain about compound 1.

Wait, another angle: if compound 1's substituents are arranged in a way that their positions don't allow for a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

For example, if the nitro groups are on opposite sides relative to the ester groups, the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry, hence being chiral.

So, if the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in such a way that they cannot be mirrored, then the molecule would be chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

Therefore, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, compounds 1 and 2 have optical isomerism, and 4 does not.

So, among the options, option D is 1 and 2.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option D.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center or other features that lead to chirality.

### 1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with nitro groups at the 6 positions and ester groups at the 2 positions on each phenyl ring. The arrangement of the substituents can lead to stereoisomerism. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism. Based on the analysis, this compound is likely to exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### 2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
The structure of this compound is CH₃-CHOH-COOCH₃. The central carbon (bearing the OH group) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and another CH₃ group (from the adjacent carbon). This makes the central carbon a chiral center, allowing the compound to exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### 3. **Benzophenone**  
The structure of benzophenone is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group and is sp² hybridized, meaning it cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and unable to exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### 4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH₂=C(COOCH₃)-CH₂(COOCH₃), where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is symmetrical due to the trans configuration, and thus it lacks chirality. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### Conclusion  
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism due to the presence of chiral centers or asymmetry in their structures. Compound 3 is achiral due to its plane of symmetry, and compound 4 is achiral due to its symmetry. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
