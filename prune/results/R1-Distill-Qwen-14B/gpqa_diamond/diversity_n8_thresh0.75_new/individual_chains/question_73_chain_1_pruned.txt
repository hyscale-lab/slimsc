Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, the question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let's break this down.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the system's total energy.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just subtract them normally because of relativity. So their relative speed isn't simply 0.6c minus 0.5c. Oh right, I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at u and v relative to each other is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)). Let me plug in their speeds. So u is the speed of the first astronaut from the perspective of the second, or vice versa? Let me think. Oh, from the second astronaut's frame, the first is moving at u = 0.6c - 0.5c, but wait no, that's not right because of the relativity of simultaneity and all that. So I must use the formula correctly.

Wait, I think the formula is (u - v) divided by (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So here, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So u - v is 0.1c. Then the denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is about 0.1428, so approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed should be about 0.14c.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so the total energy is the sum of their individual energies.

The energy of a relativistic object is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut: mass is 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait wait, 1.25 times 2 is 2.5? Wait 2 * 1.25 is 2.5, yes.

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So
