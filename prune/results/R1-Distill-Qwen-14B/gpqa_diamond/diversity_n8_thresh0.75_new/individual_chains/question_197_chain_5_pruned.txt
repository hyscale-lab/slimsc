Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. So, the problem involves identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different structures, so I need to figure out which one is correct. 

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks mentioned are in the ranges 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But wait, the main peak here is at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid, but wait, carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300 cm-1, which they do here. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, looking at the other peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has aromatic rings, probably with substituents that affect the carbonyl.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's list them out:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, wait! Wait, no, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -COOH proton would be a broad peak, but carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but 10.5 is a bit high for that. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because the IR has a peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl, but also, the broad peak at 10.5 could be the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. But wait, wait: the question says the IR includes 3400–2500, which is the O-H region. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But let me check the other signals.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents in para positions. Because it's two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, this suggests a para-substituted benzene, like p-xylene or similar. Wait, but the substituents would be something else. Looking at the substituents, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two groups, one at each para position. 

Other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These are likely from a chain structure attached to the benzene. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H
