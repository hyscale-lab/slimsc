Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of two reactions. The question gives two separate reactions, and I have to choose the correct products from the options provided. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so maybe it's involved in some kind of elimination or maybe a nucleophilic attack. 

Let me tackle the first reaction first. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize the structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1, which is adjacent to substituents. So position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. Wait, wait—no, wait. Wait, the numbering is 2-ethyl, 2,6-dimethyl. So, 2-ethyl would be a substituent on carbon 2, and 2 and 6 are both methyl groups? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no—the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexanone is at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group. Oh, wait, no—because 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups at positions 2 and 6. So the structure is: position 1 is the ketone (cyclohexanone), position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group.

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me sketch it out mentally. The cyclohexane ring: position 1 is the ketone. Position 2 is adjacent to position 1, so it has substituents. So position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? So, on carbon 2, there's an ethyl and a methyl group. And carbon 6 (which is opposite to carbon 2 on the ring) has a methyl group. So the structure is a substituted cyclohex
