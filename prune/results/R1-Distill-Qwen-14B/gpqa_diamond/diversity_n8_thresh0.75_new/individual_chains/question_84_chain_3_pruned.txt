Okay, so I've got this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically when using matrix exponential functions approximated by a fractional approximation.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think. I remember that when solving PDEs like the heat equation, finite difference methods are often used. Higher-dimensional equations can be tricky because they involve multiple spatial variables, so the matrices involved in the numerical methods can get pretty large. 

The question mentions parallel splitting. I think that refers to domain decomposition methods, where the problem is split into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel. For example, in time or space, you divide the domain into parts and solve each part separately, then combine the solutions.

Now, the matrix exponential function approximation. I recall that the solution to the heat equation can often be expressed using matrix exponentials. For example, using methods like the exponential time differencing method, the solution at each time step involves computing e^(-At), where A is a matrix derived from the finite difference discretization.

Fractional approximation... wait, fractional in what sense? Maybe it's about using a fractional step method or a method that approximates the exponential function in a way that can be split. Oh, right, sometimes you approximate e^(-At) using a sum of terms that can be computed more efficiently, perhaps in parallel.

The question is about the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. So which option is that?

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up, but it's more about whether the method works correctly, not about making it parallel.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate things, but I'm not sure how they directly relate to parallelism. Maybe in terms of how boundaries are handled when splitting the domain, but I'm not certain.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Hmm. If the approximation involves complex analysis, maybe it's about how the matrix is diagonalized or decomposed. But I'm not directly seeing the connection to parallelism.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fraction decomposition is a method used to break down complex functions into simpler parts. If the fractional approximation allows for the matrix exponential to be expressed as a sum of simpler exponentials, each of which can be computed independently, that could enable parallel computation. Because each term in the sum could be handled by a different processor, reducing the overall computation time.

Wait, so matrix exponentials can sometimes be decomposed into sums of exponentials, each with a diagonal matrix. Or perhaps in cases where the matrix can be split into commuting parts, each part's exponential can be computed separately. So if the fractional approximation leads to a partial fraction decomposition, that could allow for parallel computation of each term.

For example, if you have e^(-AΔt) = e^(-A1Δt) * e^(-A2Δt), and A1 and A2 commute, then you can compute their exponentials separately and multiply them. But if A is split into parts that don't commute, you might need a different approach, like using a decomposition that allows for parallel evaluation.

Alternatively, think about the method of lines, where after discretizing in space, you have an ODE in time. Solving this with exponential methods. If the ODE can be split into independent parts, each part can be advanced in time independently, allowing for parallel computation.

So the key factor here would be whether the approximation allows the matrix exponential to be broken down into terms that can be computed in parallel. That would point to the linear partial fraction decomposition because it splits the function into a sum of terms that can be handled separately.

Wait, but
