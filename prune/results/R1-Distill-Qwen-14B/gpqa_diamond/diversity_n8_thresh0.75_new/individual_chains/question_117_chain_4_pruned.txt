Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, right, that's when compounds can rotate plane-polarized light because they have non-superimposable mirror images, which means they're chiral. So I need to check each of the given moieties and see which ones have chiral centers or some sort of stereogenic elements.

The question gives four compounds: 1, 2, 3, and 4. And the options are A to D, each listing different combinations.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the positions are 6 and 6' for the nitro groups and 2 and 2' for the carboxylate esters. So, the structure is symmetrical? Let me think. The molecule has a central single bond between the two benzene rings. If the substituents are all in positions that make the molecule symmetrical, then it might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. But wait, if the substituents are arranged in a way that causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Wait, in this case, each ring has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So on each benzene ring, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6. Oh, wait, in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are para to each other? No, wait, positions 1 and 4 are para. So 2 and 6 are actually adjacent to each other, right? No, wait. Let me number a benzene ring. If the connecting point is position 1 on each ring, then position 2 is next to it, and position 6 is across, maybe? Wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally. The two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So, for the first ring, positions are 1 (connection), then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So position 2 is adjacent to 1. Position 6 would be across from position 2. Or wait, the numbering might be such that positions 2 and 6 are meta to each
