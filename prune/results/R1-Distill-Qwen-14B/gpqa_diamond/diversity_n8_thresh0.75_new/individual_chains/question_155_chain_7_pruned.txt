Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given a specific state. Hmm, let's see. I've studied a bit about operators and uncertainties, but I'm a little rusty, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩. The matrix for P_z is provided:

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

Wait, so P_z is a diagonal matrix. That should make things easier because the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the corresponding probabilities.

Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal in the given basis (which are its eigenvectors), each basis vector corresponds to an eigenvalue. The state |ψ⟩ is expressed in this basis, so the coefficients are the amplitudes for each eigenstate.

Let me write the state vector ψ as:

|ψ⟩ = ψ₁|e1⟩ + ψ₂|e2⟩ + ψ₃|e3⟩

Where |e1⟩, |e2⟩, |e3⟩ are the eigenvectors of P_z. The eigenvalues for P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively, because the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So ψ₁ is -1/2, ψ₂ is 1/√2, and ψ₃ is -1/2. The probabilities are the squares of the magnitudes of these coefficients.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is:

⟨P_z⟩ = |ψ₁|² * (ħ) + |ψ₂|² * (0) + |ψ₃|² * (-ħ)

Let me compute each term:

|ψ₁|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4
|ψ₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
|ψ₃|² = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0.

Wait, that's zero? Interesting. So the average of P_z is zero.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of the diagonal elements. So the matrix for P_z squared would have entries:

Row 1: (ħ)^2 = ħ²
Row 2: 0^2 = 0
Row 3: (-ħ)^2 = ħ².

So the matrix P_z² is diagonal with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

So the
