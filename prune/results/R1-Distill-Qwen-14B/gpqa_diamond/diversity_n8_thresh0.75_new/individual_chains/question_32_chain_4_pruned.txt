Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about this step by step.

Wait, Li is lithium. So the isotope would be Li-6, since it has 3 neutrons. Because lithium typically has 3 protons, so Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number is 6. So the mass of the nucleus is the mass of a Li-6 atom, right?

But wait, when dealing with heavy ions in colliders, they usually talk about the mass in terms of the rest mass energy. So the energy required to accelerate the ions would be related to their kinetic energy, but in particle physics, especially for high energies, we often use the concept of total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

The problem asks for the energy of the collider, so I think that's the total energy each nucleus has. Since RHIC is a collider, it accelerates ions to a certain energy and then collides them. Each ion would have a certain kinetic energy, but in particle physics contexts, the energy given is often the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). Or sometimes, it's given as the kinetic energy separately. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

The speed here is 0.96c, which is pretty high. So relativistic effects are definitely in play. So I should use the relativistic equations for energy.

The total energy E of a
