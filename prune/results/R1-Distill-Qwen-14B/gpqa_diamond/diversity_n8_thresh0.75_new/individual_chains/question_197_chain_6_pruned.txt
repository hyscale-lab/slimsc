Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the final product. The options are A to D. They also provided IR and NMR data for Compound X. Hmm, right, so I should start by determining what Compound X is using the spectroscopic data. Once I know that, I can think about the reaction.

Let's look at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests an -OH group because that's where O-H stretches appear, especially if it's a broad peak. Alternatively, it could be an amine, but more likely an alcohol or a carboxylic acid because of the other peaks.

The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong indicator. That's usually a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm⁻¹, but maybe a bit higher if it's an ester or ketone. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would also have a broad -OH peak, which I see here. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. But wait, wait, the 1720 might also be an ester or maybe a ketone. Let me hold that thought.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR has several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong, broad singlet. Very deshielded. For a carboxylic acid proton, that makes sense because the -COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and is broad. So that fits. So probably a carboxylic acid.

Other signals:
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons, probably para-substituted. So like two protons as a doublet, maybe on a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): another set of aromatic protons, maybe ortho to substituents. Wait, or maybe it's a substituent causing coupling. Let's think— if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, like a methyl and a carbonyl group, then the ring would have two sets of protons. The 8.0 ppm would be the protons ortho to the substituent, and 7.2 ppm would be the meta, but wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two groups, actually, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, if the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4 (para), the protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. If the substituents are strong de-shielders, like a carbonyl group (COOH or ester), then the o and p protons would
