Okay, so I have this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from the given options. Hmm. Let's think through this step by step.

So, the question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They are Earth-like, which I guess means they have similar masses to Earth. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The key here is that both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations because eccentricity might complicate things. The host stars' masses are different: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same size. Interesting.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit relative to the star's size. The formula for the probability (geometric probability) of a transit is something like (R_p / a) * (something else?), but wait, let me think. Wait, the transit probability formula is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, it's approximately R_star / a? Or wait, no, the actual formula is R*/a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly the case. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula (R*/a) * ( (1 + R_p/R*) )^2. But since R_p is much smaller than R*, it's approximately (R*/a). So the probability is proportional to R* divided by the semi-major axis a. But wait, no. Wait, another thought: the probability is actually (R*/a) multiplied by (something else). Wait, the exact formula I think is (R* / a) multiplied by a factor that accounts for the alignment of the orbit. Oh, right, but the main factor is (R*/a) because the planet needs
