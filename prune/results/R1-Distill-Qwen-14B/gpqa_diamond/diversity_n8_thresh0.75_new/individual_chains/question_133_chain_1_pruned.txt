Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Oh wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right?

The solution has two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are 1.00 grams each in 200 cm³ of solution. I remember that KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate. But wait, the second one is the dihydrate, so it has two water molecules attached.

First, I need to find out how many moles of each compound are there. Because concentration is moles per liter, I think. Oh wait, the solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

Let me calculate the moles for each. For KH2PO4, the molar mass is given as 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g divided by 136.09 gives me moles. Let me compute that: 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007345 moles. So about 0.00735 mol.

Next, the Na2HPO4·2H2O. Its molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005614 mol. Approximately 0.00561 mol.

Now, each of these compounds dissociates in water. Let's think about their dissociation.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, I think it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water. Or wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, so the actual formula is Na2(HPO4)(H2O)2? Hmm, but when it dissolves, the water of crystallization probably stays with the structure, but the ions dissociate. So Na2HPO4 is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions
