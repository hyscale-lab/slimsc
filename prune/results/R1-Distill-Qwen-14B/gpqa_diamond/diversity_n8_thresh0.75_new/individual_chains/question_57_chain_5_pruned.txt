Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is important, and phase shifts come into play. The question gives me phase shifts δ₀ to δ₄, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the incident beam direction—that's the direction where the angle θ is zero, right? So I think the formula for the scattering amplitude f has something to do with the phase shifts and the angle. Oh right, the general form is f(θ, k') = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * Pl(cosθ) ) ] summed over l, where Pl is the Legendre polynomial and k is the wave number.

But wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. Oh, wait no, they give δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. So I guess we're considering l=0 to l=4. But since the problem is along the incident beam direction, θ is 0°, so cosθ=1. That simplifies things because Pl(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because Pl(1) = 1 for any l. So each term just becomes (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) multiplied by (2l +1), all divided by 2ik.

But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. Let me think about what that is. The amplitude f is a complex quantity. The imaginary part of f would be the imaginary part of that sum. So for each term, I can write e^{2iδ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l), so e^{2iδ_l} -1 is [cos(2δ_l) -1] + i sin(2δ_l).

So each term is [ (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) + i sin(2δ_l) ] multiplied by (2l+1), then all divided by 2ik. The imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) / (2k). So the overall imaginary part of f would be the sum over l of [ (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) ] divided by (2k), and then that's multiplied by 1/(2ik), wait no—wait, wait, the 2ik is in the denominator. Let me re-express the amplitude.

The amplitude f is (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(1) ]

Since P_l(1)=1, it's sum[ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) ] / (2ik).

The imaginary part of f is the imaginary part of that sum divided by (2ik). Let's compute Im(f). Let me write each term as (e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (cos(2δ_l) - 1) + i sin(2δ_l). So each term in the sum is ( (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) + i sin(2δ_l) ) * (2l+1).

So the imaginary part of the entire sum is the sum over l of (2l+1)* sin(2δ_l). Then, when you divide by (2ik), the denominator has i and k. So the imaginary part of f is [ sum( (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) ) ] / (2k) multiplied by i, but wait, because 1/(2ik) is equal to (-i)/(2k). Let me see:

f = [ sum_{l} (e^{2iδ_l} -1)(2l+1) ] / (2ik )

The imaginary part of f is Im( [sum ... ] ) / (2ik ). Wait, no,
