Okay, so I have this multiple-choice chemistry question about identifying a product formed from a reaction. Let's see what I can do. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question says Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember red phosphorus and HI are involved in a reaction that typically does a hydrolysis, especially for esters or maybe acid chlorides. Wait, red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids, right? Or maybe it's more about converting esters to alcohols? Hmm, no, wait. I think when you have an ester and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's a method to cleave the ester into the corresponding acid and the alcohol. Or is it called something else? Oh, right, it's the hydrolysis of esters to acids and alcohols. So the ester group (-CO-O-) would break down.

But first, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectroscopic data given: IR and 1H NMR.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are between 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. That usually indicates O-H stretching. Wait, that's a broad peak around 3000-3400, right? But the range given is 3400–2500, which is a big range. Hmm. Maybe that's an aliphatic or aromatic O-H? Or maybe it's an alcohol or acid. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is typical for an ester or maybe a ketone, but more likely an ester because the reaction is with HI and P. Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretches. So that suggests an aromatic ring, possibly with substitution.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet but broad. High ppm, around 10, that's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, no. Or maybe an acidic -OH proton, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's an ester, then maybe the
