Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says we have a solution with 200 cm³ volume, which is 0.2 liters when converted. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Wait, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The species in solution would be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But since we have these two salts, let's see what each contributes.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When this dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Each mole of this salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, I have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. I think these two can interconvert in water. The presence of both suggests that we're dealing with a buffer solution, right? Because a buffer is made by a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid.

In this case, H2PO4^- is the acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The relevant Ka here would be Ka2, because H2PO4^- is the acid (HA) where A- is HPO4^2-. Ka2 is given as 6.2e-8.

So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution, which would help determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The question specifically asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So we need to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution.

But wait, how about the Ksp or any precipitation? No, I don't think that's needed here. It's more about the concentrations in the buffer solution.

So first, I need to calculate the moles of each salt.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ let's see, 1 divided by about 136 is about
