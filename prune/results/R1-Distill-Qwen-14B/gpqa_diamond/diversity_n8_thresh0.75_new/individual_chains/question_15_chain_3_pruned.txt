Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using transits, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Specifically, the formula for the transit probability (P) is something like (R_s / a)^2, where R_s is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (which for a circular orbit is just the orbital radius). Wait, no, wait, I think the formula is more about the alignment. Oh right, the probability is roughly (R_* / a)^2, where R_* is the star's radius and a is the orbital radius of the planet. Wait, actually, I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me recall. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability of that alignment is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. So the probability P is approximately (R_*/a) multiplied by something else? Or maybe just (R_*/a), because the more the planet is distant from the star relative to the star's size, the less likely it is for the planet to pass in front from our viewpoint.

Wait, no, the exact probability is actually given by (R_* / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (m_p^2/m_*^2)) )) ), but wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, I think the formula simplifies when the planet mass is much smaller than the star's mass, which is usually the case. Hmm, but wait, the question states that both planets have the same mass. So maybe the formula for transit probability is P = (R_* / a) * (something else), or perhaps it's (R_* / a)^2. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. But since the orbit is much larger, the probability is low. The formula for the transit probability is (R_* / a) * (1 / sin i), but wait, no, because sin i is the inclination, and for random inclination, the average sin i is 1/2. So the probability should be (R_* / a)
