Okay, so I have this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair, and I'm trying to figure out why a particular result is observed. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The setup is that a new ligand-receptor pair, expressed in neural crest cells, is being studied to understand their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with a specific structureâ€”eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that form a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices. 

The experiment uses a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two ORFs in one vector, so two genes are being expressed. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus.

Wait, so the vector probably has the ligand under a certain promoter, then the receptor under another promoter? Or perhaps they're arranged in a way that affects their expression. Oh, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is upstream of an IRES element. IRES is involved in internal ribosome entry sites, which can allow for the translation of a second ORF from the same mRNA. So the setup might be that the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and then the IRES drives the receptor expression.

But the vector has some stop cassettes. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, so these are probably for conditional expression using Cre recombinase. Because Cre can excise the loxP sites. So, without Cre, the stop cassette blocks expression of the downstream gene.

So, for the ligand, the construct is ligand ORF followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. So when Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP sites, deleting the stop, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor is before the IRES, and then has a stop in a lox2272 cassette before eGFP. So if there's Cre, it would delete that stop, allowing receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But the way the vector is set up is a bit confusing. Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so it's one mRNA that's translated into two proteins. So the mRNA would have the ligand ORF, then perhaps an IRES, then the receptor ORF? Or maybe the IRES is after the receptor?

Wait, the description says the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. That's a bit unclear. Maybe the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed from the same mRNA but via an internal ribosome entry. So the mRNA would have ligand, then IRES, then receptor. But then, in the vector, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor has eGFP at the C-terminus.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic. So the same mRNA would produce both proteins. But each has a stop cassette which can be removed by Cre. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry (since the stop after ligand would prevent the rest from being translated?), but the presence of Cre would remove the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed as a separate thing. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the initial setup is that the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. So ligand is first, then mCherry. But the stop in a loxP cassette is between ligand and mCherry. So normally, without Cre,
