Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. Oh right, the formula is plx (parallax) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in what sense? Oh, I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space, like a constant number per cubic parsec. So the number of stars in a given volume doesn't change with distance. But how does that translate to the number of stars per unit parallax?

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So as parallax increases (smaller distances), there are more stars in a given plx range? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let's think in terms of volume. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a spherical shell between radius r and r+dr would be proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in a small shell is N(r) = 4π r² dr * n, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But since parallax (plx) is 1/d, if d is the distance, then plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So the radius r is d, which is 1/plx. So substituting, r = 1/plx. So dr would be the change in distance. Let me see, dr = (change in plx) * derivative of d with respect to plx. Since d=1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Oh wait, but when plx increases, d decreases. So perhaps I should relate dr in terms of plx.

Alternatively, since r = 1/plx, then r² = 1/plx². So the number of stars in a shell at distance r is proportional to r² dr. But I need to express this in terms of plx, not r.

So let's let plx = p. So r = 1/p. Then dr is the change in r, which would be dr = - (1/p²)
