Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, I need to think through the steps carefully.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me write down the details. It says 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. Then 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when these are mixed.

First, I should figure out how much of each reactant we have. Wait, but since it's a neutralization reaction, I need to find out the moles of H+ and OH- ions available.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each HCl molecule gives one H+ ion. So moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume in liters. So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. That's 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Then, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and it's diprotic. So each molecule gives two H+ ions. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since it's diprotic, that's 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.2 moles.

Now, I need to find out how much H+ and OH- are present. H+ total is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, in neutralization, H+ reacts with OH- to form water. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent here is OH- because 0.
