Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then there are products 1, 2, and 3 formed through various reactions. The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom.

First, I need to figure out what each product is.

Starting with product 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH. KOH is a strong base, and dibromides usually undergo elimination reactions when treated with bases. Since it's dibrominated, maybe it's a di-elimination. Wait, but adamantane is a highly strained structure with a diamondoid framework. So, when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, probably it undergoes dehydrohalogenation. Since the two bromines are on adjacent carbons (assuming 1 and 3 are adjacent in the adamantane structure), but wait, adamantane is a diamondoid, so maybe the positions are such that elimination is possible.

Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane - the structure of adamantane is like a diamond fragment. Each carbon in adamantane is bonded to three others. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two non-adjacent carbons? Or maybe adjacent? I'm a bit confused about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps when KOH is used, it's a double elimination, leading to the formation of an alkene. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but KOH is more likely to cause elimination.

The product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Light yellow solids are often alkenes or ketones. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is around 1700-1800 for ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc. So product 1 is likely a ketone.

Hmm. So heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH gives a ketone. How does that happen? Maybe elimination followed by some ring-opening? Or perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, but that doesn't explain the
