Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the speed of light in the glass as observed in the laboratory frame. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer.

Wait, the light is propagating through the glass, and the glass itself is moving. So the glass has a refractive index n. I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes. The usual formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? Because the glass is moving, we have to consider how this affects the speed observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but velocity addition in relativity... Oh, wait, wait a second. This is a tricky part. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add up linearly, especially when dealing with light. But wait, this is a problem that might involve either Galilean relativity or special relativity. But since the problem says it's moving at a constant velocity, maybe it's non-relativistic? Or does that not matter?

Wait, but the options given don't look like the classical velocity addition formula, which is u' = u + v. Oh, because in that case, if the light's speed in the glass (in its rest frame) is c/n, then adding the glass's velocity v would give (c/n) + v. But wait, none of the options look like that. Option B is just 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum. But in the glass, the speed is c/n, which is less than c.

Wait, but hold on. The glass is moving towards the observer. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is v_light = c/n. What would the observer in the lab frame measure?

In the case of light, the speed isn't simply additive. According to Einstein's postulate of special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, that's in a vacuum. Here, the light is in a medium with refractive index n, so it's moving at c/n in the glass's frame. But how does that translate when the glass is moving relative to the lab?

Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Because the glass is a medium, not a vacuum. So the usual relativistic velocity addition formula might not apply directly. Let me think. In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, I need to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, in this case, u is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. So u = c/n. And v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab. But wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. So when we apply the velocity addition, the direction matters.

Wait, let me rephrase. The glass is moving towards the observer, so in the lab, the glass is moving in the direction opposite to the light beam's propagation? Or same direction? The question says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read the question again.

The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is toward the observer. So in the lab, the glass is moving in the direction of the beam. So the beam, in the glass's frame, is moving at speed c/n towards the observer. But the glass itself is moving towards the observer at speed v. So in the lab, the beam's speed would be higher.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the beam is moving through the glass, which is moving towards the observer. So, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. The glass is moving towards the observer at v. So the beam's speed in the lab frame would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass's frame? Or is it more complicated.

Wait, but wait. I think the velocity addition formula in relativity says that if an object is moving at u in frame S, and S is moving at v relative to S', then the object's speed in S' is given by (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²). But wait, the problem here is that the light's speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n. So the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So we want to find the speed of the light in the lab frame. So we can treat the glass as the S frame, moving at velocity v relative to the lab (S').

Wait, no. Let me get the frames straight. Let's define S as the lab frame. S' is the glass's rest frame, moving at velocity v relative to S. In S', the light is moving at u = c/n towards the observer (since the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer in the lab frame).

So in S', the light's velocity is u' = c/n. We need to find u, the velocity observed in S (lab frame). Using the velocity addition formula:

u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' v)/c²]

Substituting u' = c/n,

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify denominator:

Denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c)

So u = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator correctly. Wait, the denominator is 1 + (u' v)/c². u' is c/n, so (u' v)/c² = (c v)/(n c^2) ) = v/(n c).

So denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So the entire expression becomes:

u = [ (c/n + v) ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is equivalent to [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancels: so it becomes [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, let's compute that:

(c + n v) * c = c² + n v c

Denominator: n c + v = v + n c.

So u = (c² + n v c) / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v)

Denominator: (n c + v) )

So u = [ c (c + n v) ] / [ (n c + v) ]

Wait, but can I factor or simplify this further? Let me see.

Wait, n c + v = c (n) + v. Hmm, but that's the same as c n + v, which is the same as c n + v.

Wait, so the expression is [ c (c + n v) ] / ( c n + v )

Wait, but that can be written as [c (c + n v) ] / ( (c n) + v )

Does that simplify further? Let's factor c from the denominator.

Wait, denominator: c n + v = c (n) + v. Hmm, not much to factor. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me recheck the velocity addition step.

The formula is u = (u' + v) / [1 + (u' v)/c² ]

Given u' = c/n, v is the speed of S' relative to S. Wait, wait — are we considering the correct sign for v in the formula? Because in the velocity addition formula, the S' frame is moving at velocity v relative to S. So if in S, the S' frame is moving at velocity v (towards the observer, perhaps), then the formula applies as is.

But in our case, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, so in the lab frame S, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So the light in the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, but in the glass's frame (S'), the light is moving at u' = c/n towards the observer. So when we apply the velocity addition, the S' frame is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. Hmm, maybe I got the direction signs wrong.

Wait, let's clarify the frame setup. Let me define S as the lab frame, and S' as the glass's rest frame, moving at velocity v relative to S (towards the observer). In S', the light is moving at u' = c/n towards the observer. So the direction is such that in S, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

Wait, then the velocity addition formula would be:

u = [ u' + v ] / [ 1 + (u' * v ) / c² ]

But wait, wait. No — in the standard formula, if S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then from S, the velocity in S' is u', and the velocity in S is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² )

But in this case, the light's velocity in S' is u' = c/n, and the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So using the formula, u = (c/n + v) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v/(n c)).

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ].

Wait, same as before.

So u = [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify:

The n in numerator and denominator cancels, so u = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but c is 1. So substituting c=1,

u = (1 + n v) * 1 / (n * 1 + v )

So u = (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Wait, looking at the options, that's option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but earlier I thought the speed of light in a medium is always c. But that's only in the medium's rest frame. Because in the lab frame, when the medium is moving, the speed changes according to the velocity addition formula. So in the lab frame, the speed might be higher than c/n if the medium is moving towards the light.

Wait, but according to our calculation, u is (1 + n v)/(n + v ). If v is non-zero, this could be greater than 1, which would be faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. That can't be right because nothing can go faster than c. But wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, but here we have a medium. So does the speed of light in a medium plus the medium's motion exceed c? Or is that not possible?

Wait, let's plug in some numbers. Let's say n=1 (vacuum), and v=0. Then u = (1+0)/(1+0) = 1, which is correct. Now, if n=2, v=0.5 (assuming units where c=1). Then u= (1 +2 *0.5)/(2 +0.5) )= (2)/(2.5) )= 0.8. So 0.8c, which is less than c. Wait, but if the glass is moving towards the observer, wouldn't that make the light's speed as observed higher than c/n?

Hmm, maybe I messed up the direction of v in the velocity addition formula. Let me re-express the frame setup.

If the glass is moving towards the observer (in the lab frame), then in the lab frame, the glass is approaching with velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving towards the observer at c/n. So when the glass itself is moving towards the observer, the light's speed in the lab frame should be higher than c/n.

Wait, let's take an example where v is positive (towards the observer). So if in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n, and the glass is moving towards the observer at v, then the lab frame would see the light moving at c/n + v? But that can't be right because that would exceed c, but with the velocity addition formula, it's not a simple addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the medium's motion. When a medium is moving, the light's speed in the medium is still c/n, but the overall speed according to the lab frame depends on the medium's velocity.

Wait, but according to the velocity addition formula we applied, u comes out to be (1 + n v)/(n + v ). Since n is greater than or equal to 1, and v is positive, the denominator is larger than the numerator, so u is less than 1. So the speed measured is less than c. That makes sense because even if the medium is moving towards the light, the speed can't exceed c.

Wait, let's take another example. Suppose n=1, v=0.5 (so in the medium, light speed is 1, same as vacuum). In the lab frame, the medium is moving towards the light, so the light's speed is (1 + 1*0.5)/(1 +0.5 )= 1.5 /1.5 =1. Which is correct because in the lab frame, the light's speed is still c.

Wait, another example. Let's say n=3, v=0.5. Then u = (1 +3*0.5)/(3+0.5) )= (2.5)/(3.5) ≈ 0.714. So less than 1, which is okay.

Wait, so according to this, the correct formula is option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v)


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass has a refractive index \( n \), and in its rest frame, the speed of light is \( c/n \). The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Refractive Index and Light Speed in Glass**: In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u' = c/n \), where \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( u' = c/n \), the formula becomes:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**:
   - The denominator simplifies to:
     \[
     1 + \frac{v}{n c} = \frac{n c + v}{n c}
     \]
   - The numerator simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{c}{n} + v = \frac{c + n v}{n}
     \]
   - Combining these, the expression for \( u \) becomes:
     \[
     u = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{\frac{n c + v}{n c}} = \frac{(c + n v) \cdot c}{n c + v}
     \]
   - Since \( c = 1 \), this simplifies further to:
     \[
     u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
     \]

4. **Physical Interpretation**: The derived formula ensures that the observed speed of light in the lab frame is always less than or equal to \( c \), consistent with the principles of special relativity. The glass's motion affects the observed speed, but it does not exceed the speed of light in a vacuum.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived formula and is correct.
- **Option B**: \( 1 \) is incorrect because it implies the speed of light is always \( c \), regardless of the medium or its motion.
- **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) is incorrect because the denominator has the wrong sign.
- **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) is incorrect because the numerator has the wrong sign.

### Final Answer:
The speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

Answer: A
