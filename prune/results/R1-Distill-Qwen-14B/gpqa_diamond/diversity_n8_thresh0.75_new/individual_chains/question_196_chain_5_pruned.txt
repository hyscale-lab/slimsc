Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I've studied some classical mechanics before, but relativistic stuff is a bit trickier. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c. There are four options given, A to D.

Wait, so in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a classical oscillator, the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Here, it's relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

Relativistic dynamics usually involve the use of the Lorentz factor or the total energy considerations. In relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where p is momentum. But in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and kinetic energy is (γ-1)(1/2)mv², but wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, in the relativistic scenario, the equations of motion change. The force is still F = -kx, but the force relates to acceleration, which in relativity isn't as straightforward as F=ma. Oh right, the relativistic equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator is more complicated. I think the equation becomes something like d/dt (γ m v) = -k x. But since x and v are related through the oscillator's motion, maybe I can find an expression for v_max.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider energy conservation in the relativistic context. In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy when x=A. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic, which gives the maximum speed. But in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy.

Hmm, the total energy in relativity is E = γ mc² + (1/2)kA²? Wait, not quite. Wait, the oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kx². But in relativity, kinetic energy is (γ - 1) mc², not (1/2)mv². So maybe the total energy E is (γ mc²) + (1/2)kx². But at maximum displacement x = A, the oscillator is at rest (v=0), so the kinetic energy is just mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the point of maximum velocity (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic. So at that point, E = γ mc². Therefore, γ mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA². So I can write this as γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2m c²).

Wait, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So solving for v_max.

So, let's write that equation:

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)
