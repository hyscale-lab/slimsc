Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

The question says that a chemist did two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I need to determine the starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, so the products are enantiomers of each other. One is R and the other is S. The reactions used different reducing agents: LiBH4 with H+ for A, and BH3 with H+ for B. 

Wait, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is another reducing agent but maybe used under different conditions. Oh right, BH3 is typically used for the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which involves anti-Markovnikov addition, and it's stereospecific. LiBH4 is used for reductions, like reducing ketones to secondary alcohols, but wait, wait—no, LiBH4 usually doesn't do that. Wait, maybe I got this mixed up. Oh, wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But I think when you have something like a ketone, LiBH4 would reduce it to an alcohol. Wait, but the product here is a pyranone. Oh wait, no, the product is a tetrahydro pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or something like that. Wait, no, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So, maybe the starting material was an ester or something that upon reduction forms a cyclic ether.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an acyloin or an ester that undergoes a ring-forming reaction upon reduction. Alternatively, considering the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, that's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, right? Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So, the structure is O in the ring, and a ketone at position 2. The substituents are at position 4, which is an ethyl group.

Wait, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal? Or maybe it's a result of a Claisen or Aldol condensation. Or perhaps it's a reduction of a carbonyl group leading to ring formation.

Wait, the reaction conditions are important. Let's think about what each reagent does. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but in acidic conditions. Oh wait, no, LiBH4 is usually used in basic or neutral conditions. Wait, but the problem says H+ is present, so maybe it's an acidic workup.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone that undergoes some kind of ring-forming reaction upon reduction.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones. Hmm, but no, the product is a six-membered ring, so perhaps it comes from a five or six carbon chain.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen (like a tetrahydropyran), and a ketone at position 2. So, the structure is O in the ring (like an ether), and a carbonyl at position 2.

Wait, how do you form that? Perhaps from a hemiacetal or acetal. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Upon reduction, that might open and form something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible reaction types. Let me think about both reactions.

Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, so what's the role of these reagents? LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are stereospecific. So maybe the starting materials are alkenes, and the reagents are adding boron in a certain way.

Wait, but the product is a ketone in a ring. Hmm. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are ketones themselves, and the reagents are reducing them. Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. But the product is a cyclic ketone, so if the starting material is a ketone, LiBH4 would reduce it, not form a new ketone. So that might not make sense.

Hmm, perhaps the starting materials are esters. LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, but LiBH4 doesn't usually reduce esters. NaBH4 and LiAlH4 do. Oh wait, wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reagent than NaBH4, but I think
