Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to identify compound X from the options A to D.

Hmm, wait, but wait a second. The question is about identifying compound X, but the NMR data is for the product. Oh, right, because the reaction is probably leading to a transformation of compound X. So I need to figure out what reaction happened here and then determine what the product's structure tells me about X.

Looking at the reagent: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh, wait! That's a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides, right? Or is it something else? Wait, no, wait. Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a base, it's used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Oh, no, wait, that's not right. Wait. Oh, no, wait—epoxidation is usually done with peracids. Oh wait, maybe not. Alternatively, in some cases, the Prilezhaev oxidation uses a peracid, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no—diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base used in the epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh wait, perhaps in this case, the reaction is an epoxide opening. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is an epoxide formation. Wait, but the reagent is a base. Oh, wait, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. Or perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of an epoxide from an alkene, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, when an alkene reacts with a peracid, we get an epoxide. But the reagent here is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a strongly basic, bulky amine. Oh, wait, perhaps it's involved in the acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening. No, because the solvent is nonpolar, and the temperature is 403 K, which is pretty high—like 130°C. That's a high temperature. So maybe it's a reaction that involves ring-opening of an epoxide under basic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide via a nucleophilic attack, but without an acid catalyst. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition or something else.

Wait, but let me think about the product's NMR data. The product's 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's parse them:

1H NMR:
- δ2.28 (3H, s): A singlet with 3H—could be a methyl group attached to something deshielded, like maybe an electronegative atom or in an aromatic environment. Or perhaps a methyl adjacent to an epoxide oxygen.
- δ2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, 3H. So two methyl groups here. Maybe they're in similar environments, like both attached to a benzene ring or something.
- δ6.75 (1H, d): A doublet, around 6.75. That's in the aromatic region, maybe a proton adjacent to substituents.
- δ7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Maybe part of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- δ7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet, perhaps adjacent to something else.
- δ7.71 (2H, d): Another doublet, similar to the 7.08 signal but upfield.

Wait, the aromatic region suggests some sort of substituted
