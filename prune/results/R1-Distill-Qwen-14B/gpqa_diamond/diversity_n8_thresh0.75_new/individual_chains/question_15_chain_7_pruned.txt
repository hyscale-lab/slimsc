Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star since the period is shorter. Also, their orbits are circular, which is good because eccentricity can complicate things, but in this case, it might not matter as much.

The host stars are interesting. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same size. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So same radius but different masses. For stars, higher mass usually means larger radius, but maybe Planet_2's star is a subgiant or something that has expanded a bit but not as much as the main sequence star for Planet_1? Not sure if that affects transit probability, but probably the radius being the same is key here.

The main point is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative sizes of the planet's orbit and the star. The formula, I think, is something like R_star divided by the orbital distance (a). So the probability increases as the star's radius is larger relative to the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, the formula is P_transit = (R_star / a) * (something else?), maybe multiplied by the impact parameter, but in the case of circular orbits, the average probability could just be (R_star / a), assuming that inclination is random.

Wait, no, I think the formula is more accurately the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. So P = R*/(a) * something, perhaps multiplied by an inclination factor. Oh wait, the correct formula is that the probability is (R*/a) * (some function based on the planet's size and the star's size), but for the purpose of this problem, I think the main factor is R*/a, because the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance are the key variables here.

So, higher R*/a ratio means higher transit probability. Because if the star is bigger relative to the
