Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one when approximating the matrix exponential function with a fractional approximation.

Hmm, let's break down the question. So, the process involves higher order finite differences and parallel splitting. Wait, what's parallel splitting? I think it's a method used to solve PDEs by splitting the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel. This might involve something like domain decomposition or splitting the operators.

The main point is about the matrix exponential function. Oh right, when solving systems that can be written in the form u' = Au, where A is a matrix, the solution is the matrix exponential exp(A*t). But computing this directly can be expensive, especially for large matrices. So people use approximations, like fractional approximations, which I'm guessing are methods such as Padé approximants or other rational function approximations.

The question is about the key factor for converting the sequential algorithm into a parallel one. The options are A to D. Let me think about each option:

A) Stability analysis. Well, stability is important in numerical methods to ensure that errors don't grow without bound. But how does that tie into making the algorithm parallel? Maybe it's not the direct factor for conversion but more about whether the method works correctly.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions might complicate the problem, but I'm not sure how that would directly help in parallelization. Nonlocal might refer to boundary conditions that depend on values inside the domain, but I don't see the immediate link to parallel processing.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximations are rational functions, and their roots (poles and zeros) can affect the stability and accuracy. If the approximation has complex roots, perhaps this affects how the method can be split into parallel tasks. Maybe if the roots are complex, they require certain decompositions or affect the way the matrix is split for parallel computation.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Linear partial fractions are a way to decompose a rational function into simpler fractions, which might allow for easier computation in parallel. If the approximation can be broken down into partial fractions, each part could be handled by a different processor, making the algorithm parallel. So this seems plausible.

Wait, let me think again. In parallel splitting, you'd want to decompose the problem into parts that can be computed independently. If the fractional approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that are easier to compute separately, that would enable parallel processing.

Linear partial fraction decomposition would break the approximation into a sum of simpler fractions. Each of these could then be applied separately in a parallel fashion. For example, if the approximation is a sum of terms like 1/(A - λ_i), each term could be handled by a different processor, then combined at the end.

Alternatively, if the approximation has complex roots, maybe that affects how the matrix is exponentiated. But I'm not as sure about that. I think the partial fraction decomposition is more directly related to enabling parallel computation because it splits the problem into smaller, independent parts.

So the key factor would be the ability to decompose the approximation into linear partial fractions, which allows each fraction to be computed in parallel. That would make option D the correct answer.
