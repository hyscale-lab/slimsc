Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says. Hmm, it's about identifying compound D based on a series of reactions starting from compound A.

Alright, let's start by analyzing the given data. Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is adjacent to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three. Also, the integrals (6H and 4H) might indicate the number of equivalent protons in each set.

Wait, 6H as a triplet. That sounds like maybe two sets of three equivalent protons each, but wait, 6H suggests perhaps two groups of three. Alternatively, maybe it's a triplet in a group of six. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet integrating to six, which could be two triplets each integrating to three? Not sure yet. Let me think about common structures.

The 0.9 ppm region is typical for methyl groups, especially in alkanes. So maybe those six protons are two methyl groups (-CH2CH3 maybe?), but wait, a triplet for a methyl group would be if it's next to a CH2 group. Because the CH2 would split each into a triplet. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH3 is a triplet when next to a CH2. And the CH2 would be a quartet, each proton next to two others.

Wait, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm for 4H. 4H could be two sets of two protons each, perhaps as two CH2 groups. For example, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, which would split into a quartet. Because each proton in the CH2 is next to two others on the adjacent CH2. So if we have a structure like R-OCH2CH2OR or something else, but perhaps in an ethyl group.

Wait, putting it together: the NMR for compound A. Two signals. A triplet at 0.9 for 6H, quartet at 1.3 for 4H. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe it's a diethyl ether? Because in diethyl ether, the structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The protons on the CH2 groups next to oxygen would be split differently.

Wait, let's see. In diethyl ether, each CH2CH3 group would have the CH3 as triplet and the CH2 as quartet. Wait, but looking at diethyl ether's NMR: the CH3 groups are at around 1.2 ppm (as a triplet), and the CH2-O would be a quartet around 3.5 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit because the quartet here is at 1.3 ppm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a di-substituted cyclohexane. Wait, cyclohexane derivatives? Let me think. Another possibility is that compound A is neopentyl something, but wait, neopentyl is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which would have a singlet for 9H, I think. That's not
