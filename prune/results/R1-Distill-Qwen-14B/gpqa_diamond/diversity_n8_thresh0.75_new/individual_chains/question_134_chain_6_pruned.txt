Okay, so I have this question about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So, the question says we have 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. They're all being mixed together, and I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I'll have to be careful with units.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But I remember that the neutralization reaction is exothermic, so the enthalpy should be negative, which matches the options given.

But wait, in neutralization reactions, it's typically acid + base → salt + water. However, in this case, I have two acids and a base. That's a bit confusing. Or wait, no, maybe HCl and H2SO4 are the acids, and Ba(OH)2 is the base.

So, first, I should determine the moles of each acid and the base. Then, figure out which reacts with which, and how much reacts. Because when you mix acids and a base, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

Wait, but the problem is mixing all three solutions. So, the HCl and H2SO4 will donate H+ ions, and the Ba(OH)2 will donate OH- ions. So, the total H+ should react with the total OH-.

Let me calculate moles of each.

Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters)

HCl:
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume 500 mL → 0.5 L. So, moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, I think. Wait, actually, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be? Or for the purpose of neutralization, maybe we consider all H+ available. Hmm, but in neutralization with a base, each H2SO4 can provide two H+ ions. Let me think.

So, for H2SO4, each molecule can give 2 H
