Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to figure this out step by step. The molecular formula is C8H9NO, and the reagents are NaNO2, HCl, H2O, and then KOH with heat. Hmm. I've heard that NaNO2 and HCl are usually involved in diazotization, right? So maybe the compound has an aromatic amine or something that can form a diazonium salt.

Looking at the NMR data first. The peaks are:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton since aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it could be something else, but aldehyde is common.

6.98 ppm (d, 2H) – aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Because two protons as a doublet. So perhaps a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, or maybe two different substituents but each giving a doublet. Wait, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a coupling with another ring.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – another aromatic doublet. Hmm, this could be another pair of protons, maybe on a different benzene ring, or maybe part of a coupling with the first ring.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, maybe two protons. Not sure what that is. Maybe it's an aromatic protons that's part of a conjugated system, or perhaps some kind of enol or something else.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – this looks like a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom. Maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in a benzyl group or something. A doublet suggests coupling to one other group, perhaps another CH2 group or something else.

Putting this together, maybe the molecule has two benzene rings connected somehow. Let's think about the structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation. For C8H9NO: degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is the halogens, which we don't have here. So N is considered as 1, since in amines it's similar to CH
