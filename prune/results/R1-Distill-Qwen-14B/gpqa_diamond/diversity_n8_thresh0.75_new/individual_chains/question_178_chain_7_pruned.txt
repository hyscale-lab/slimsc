Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_{μν} is (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν], which I think is part of the definition for the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F is the field strength tensor, right? Like for electromagnetism, it's F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. But wait, here the F is in the Lagrangian as F^{μν}, so it's the same as the tensor but with indices up.

So the first thing I need to find is the mass dimension of κ. Then determine if the theory is renormalizable based on that.

I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian has to have a mass dimension of 4 because the integral over spacetime (which has dimension 4) should be dimensionless when considering units. So the whole Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Each term in the Lagrangian is a product of fields and coupling constants. So let's break down L_int term by term.

L_int is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

Wait, what's the dimension of each field here?

I think the psi (ψ) is a spinor field, so each ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because for Dirac fields, like in the Dirac Lagrangian L = iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ, each ψ is 3/2. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1, so the kinetic term has dimension 4 (3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 4). The mass term has m which is dimension 1, and ψ̄ ψ would be 3, so m ψ̄ ψ has dimension 4.

So ψ̄ has dimension 3/2 as well, same as ψ.

What about σ_{μν}? Well, σ_{μν} is made from [γ_μ, γ_ν], so it's a product of two gamma matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would be (3/2) + (0) + (3/2) = 3.

Wait, but wait: σ_{mu nu} is actually a product of two gammas, but it's antisymmetric. But dimensionally, it's just products of dimensionless matrices, so no mass dimension change. So yeah, that term is dimension 3.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. Each derivative is dimension 1, and each A is a gauge field, which has dimension 1, because the kinetic term is (F)^2, and F has dimension 2 (
