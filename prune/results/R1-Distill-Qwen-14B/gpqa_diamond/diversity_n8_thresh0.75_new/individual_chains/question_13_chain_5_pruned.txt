Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Alright, the starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene in a methanol solution. It's stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. Then, after one equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated as the major product.

Hmm, I remember that hydrogenation reactions with Pd/C typically add hydrogen across double bonds. Limonene has a double bond in its structure. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, right? It's a cyclic ether, isn't it? Wait, no, limonene is actually a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a structure like a bicyclic system. But wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. Oh wait, right, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that includes a double bond. So when hydrogen is added, it's hydrogenated.

Wait, limonene's structure is (R)-(+)-Limonene, which has a specific configuration. The structure is a bicyclic monoterpene with an exo double bond. So when hydrogen is added, it becomes hydrogenated, probably adding to the double bond. So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene. Since it's hydrogenated, the double bond becomes a single bond, and two hydrogens are added. So the product would be a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic compound, but perhaps upon hydrogenation, it remains as a bicyclic system but with a single bond. Alternatively, maybe it's hydrogenated in a way that opens a ring? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that includes a cyclic ether and a double bond. Wait, no, limonene isn't an ether. Wait, actually, limonene is a terpene. The structure of limonene is a bicyclic structure with a specific configuration. The (R) configuration indicates the specific stereochemistry.

So, limonene's structure is a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration. The hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, turning it into a single bond. So the product after hydrogenation (product 1) would be a saturated compound.

Wait, I think that
