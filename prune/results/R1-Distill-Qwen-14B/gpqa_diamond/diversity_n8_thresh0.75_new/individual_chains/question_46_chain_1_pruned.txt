Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis, right? So metathesis means breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds, basically swapping parts of the alkenes.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene has a double bond between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on C3. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait wait. No, wait, pent is 5 carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw it out.

Carbon 1: CH2=CH-
Carbon 2: connected to Carbon 3, which has a methyl group. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's number from the double bond. So pent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a methyl group on C3. So
