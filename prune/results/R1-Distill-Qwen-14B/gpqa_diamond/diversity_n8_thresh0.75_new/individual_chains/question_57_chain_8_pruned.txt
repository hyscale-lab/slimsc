Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question involves elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The given data are phase shifts for different angular momentum states: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D with various values in fm.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed using partial waves. The formula involves a sum over all angular momentum states l, each contributing a term with a spherical harmonic and a phase shift. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact expression. Let me try to recall.

Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is given by the sum from l=0 to infinity of (2l+1) [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) / (i kl) ] P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ}, where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Wait, but wait—this is in three dimensions. But the question specifically asks about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, wait, the incident beam direction would imply θ=0 (since the angle is measured from the direction of the incident beam).

So when θ=0, P_l(cosθ) becomes P_l(1), which is 1 for all l. Also, e^{i l φ} would be e^{i l * 0} = 1 when φ=0, which is along the beam. So along the incident direction, only the l=0 term might survive? Wait, no. Because for θ=0, P_l(1) is 1 for any l. So each term in the sum would contribute when θ=0.

Wait, but wait—no, when θ is 0, the angle between the incident and scattered directions is zero, which is the same direction. So perhaps the sum is just over all l, each term contributes, but evaluated at θ=0.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction would be the imaginary part of f(0,0). Because the question says "along the incident beam direction," which is θ=0, φ=0.

So the formula for f(θ, φ) is:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^{infinity} (2l+1) [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) / (i k l) ) ] P_l (cosθ) e^{i l φ }

But when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1. And φ=0, so e^{i l φ}=1. So each term becomes:

(2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} - 1)/(i k l) )

So f(0,0) is the sum over l of (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} - 1) / (i k l) )

And the imaginary part of f is the imaginary part of this sum.

So Im[f(0,0)] = sum_{l=0}^n [ (2l+1)/(k l) ) * Im( (e^{i δ_l} - 1)/i ) ]

Wait, let's simplify the expression inside the sum. Let's compute (e^{iδ} -1 ) / i.

Because (e^{iδ} -1 ) = cos δ + i sin δ - 1. So that's (cos δ -1 ) + i sin δ.

Dividing by i gives [ (cos δ -1 ) + i sin δ ] / i.

Which can be written as [ (cos δ - 1 ) / i ] + [ i sin δ / i ].

Simplify each term: (cos δ -1 ) / i = -(i)(cos δ -1 ) because 1/i = -i. So that's
