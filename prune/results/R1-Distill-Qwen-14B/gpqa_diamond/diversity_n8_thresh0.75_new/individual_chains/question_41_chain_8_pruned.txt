Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and relative speeds. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I know.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one. Let me break it down.

First, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So normally, in the glass, light would move at v_glass = c/n. But wait, the glass itself is moving. So the observer in the lab would see both the light moving through the glass and the glass moving. How do these velocities combine?

I think this is a relativistic problem because velocities are involved, and when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, the simple addition doesn't work. Oh wait, but in this problem, the glass is moving at velocity v. The question says "constant velocity v," so maybe we're assuming non-relativistic speeds here. Or maybe even if it's not, I should think about the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but that's the speed in the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, the speed observed in the lab frame would change. So I might need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²)

But wait, in this case, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So what's the u here? Let me think.

In the rest frame of the glass (let's call it S'), the light's speed is c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame (say S frame). So we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, no, that's only for light in a vacuum. Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium isn't necessarily c in other frames. Or is it?

Oh, this is a bit confusing. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n, but when the glass is moving, what
