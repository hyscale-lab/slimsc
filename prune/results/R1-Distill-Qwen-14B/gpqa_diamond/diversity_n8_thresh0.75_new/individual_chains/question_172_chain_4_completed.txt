Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the usual blackbody radiation and Boltzmann distribution apply.

Hmm, so I remember that in LTE, the number of particles in an excited state relative to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So if star_1 has twice the excitation (n_upper) compared to star_2, then n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = 2 * (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2).

Let me write the equations for both stars.

For star_1: (n_upper_1 / n_lower_1) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
For star_2: (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

But according to the problem, (n_upper_1 / n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2). So substituting the expressions from Boltzmann:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this. Let's see:

ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, because ln(a*b) = ln a + ln b, so ln(2) + ln(exp(...)).

So:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Let me rearrange this equation. Bring the ΔE terms to one side:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2)

Hmm, so [1/T2 - 1/T1] equals [ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

Wait, but I'm solving for the temperatures T1 and T2. Let me see if I can rearrange this.

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln 2) * (k / ΔE)

Wait, but I don't think I need the exact value because the options don't have constants. The question is about which equation is correct. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1 → That would imply a ratio of Ts, but I don't think that's correct because our equation involves 1/T terms.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2) → Hmm, that seems complicated. Wait, let me think about algebra here. Let's see:

We have [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2) * (k/ΔE), but wait, actually, the equation is [1/T2 - 1/T1] = (ln 2) * (k / ΔE). But since the problem only gives the energy difference and not k, perhaps the options are in terms of the variables.

Wait, but in the given options, none have k or ΔE. So perhaps the options are just the structure of the equation after rearranging, assuming that the constants are accounted for.

Wait, perhaps I should express it in terms of T1 and T2 without the constants.

Wait, let me think again about the equation:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (ln 2) * (k / ΔE)

But the question says that the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, but Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's the same value! So k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So k/ΔE = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) = 1 K^{-1}.

So this simplifies our equation to:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * 1

Which is:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Let me rearrange this:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2)

Factor the left-hand side:

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

So:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2), which matches this equation.

Wait, but the setup said that in star_1, the excitation is higher, meaning T1 is hotter than T2, because higher temperatures increase the excitation.

So (T1 - T2) is positive, and ln(2) is positive, so that's consistent.

So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars, we start by analyzing the given information. The excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Assuming LTE, the Boltzmann distribution applies:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant (\( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)) and \( T \) is the temperature of the star. For star_1 and star_2, we have:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Since the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, we write:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E / k \):

\[
\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting this:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options do not align with the derived equation. For example:

- Option A implies a direct ratio of \( T_2 / T_1 \), which does not match the \( 1/T \) dependence.
- Options B and C involve more complex expressions that do not simplify to the correct form.

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
