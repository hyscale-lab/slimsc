Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Let's break it down.

The question says both planets have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, and their orbits are circular, which probably simplifies things.

Wait, the host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up same size. I think star mass and radius will affect the transit probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula (R_planet + R_star) / a, where a is the orbital semi-major axis. Or wait, maybe it's more about the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Let me think. Oh right, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight, which is a geometric probability. The formula is roughly R_star / a (but I might be mixing terms here).

Wait, no, the formula for the probability P is (R_* / a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, actually, I think the correct formula is (R_* / a), but sometimes it's (R_* + R_p) / a, but R_p is usually much smaller than R_*, so maybe we can ignore it. Either way, R_* over a is a big part of it.

But wait, the orbital period is given. I need to find the semi-major axis a. Using Kepler's third law, which relates the period P to a and the star's mass M. The formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). But since we're dealing with ratios, maybe I can handle this with relative values.

Given that both stars have the same radius, but different masses. So R_* for Planet_1 is same as R_* for Planet_2. Let's call that R.

Now, Planet_1 has an orbital period P1, Planet_2 has P2=3*P1.

The masses: M1 =
