Okay, let me try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about identifying the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I need to figure out what these substances are. Let's start breaking it down.

Looking at reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. The product C is bright red. A is a solid, B is a gas. 8 equivalents suggest that maybe B is something that adds 8 times to A. Hmm, maybe A is a metal, and B could be a halogen? Wait, 8 equivalents... Wait, another thought: I remember that sulfur is bright red. Oh, wait, maybe C is sulfur? Or wait, perhaps A is sodium, and B is chlorine? Let me think.

Wait, if A is sodium (Na), and B is chlorine (Cl2), then 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na. Because sodium has a +1 charge, so each Na bonds with one Cl. But wait, if A is Na, then 8 equivalents of Cl2 would give 8 Cl atoms. But sodium is monovalent, so each Na would take one Cl. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal oxide. Let's think about the reaction where a metal oxide reacts with a halogen. Oh, perhaps A is sodium oxide (Na2O) reacting with Cl2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is Na metal and B is Cl2. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would be 8 moles per mole of Na? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because 2 moles of Na would react with 1 mole of Cl2. So if A is Na, then 8 moles of Cl2 would require 16 moles of Na. Hmm, but the question says 8 equivalents. Maybe I'm getting the stoichiometry wrong.

Wait, perhaps A is a different element. Another approach: when a solid reacts with a gas to form a bright red product. What's a bright red product? Sulfur? No, sulfur is yellow. Oh wait, maybe the product is a transition metal compound. Hmm. Or perhaps C is a compound with a red color.

Wait, when I think of bright red products, maybe it's something like mercury(II) oxide is red, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction forming a sulfur compound, but I'm not certain. Hmm, perhaps I should think about reaction 3, where C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So C is probably a compound that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid, along with reforming A.

Wait, what gives two different acids when reacted with water? That sounds like a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is a nitride or something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide, which when hydrolyzed gives H2S (a weak acid) and another acid. Hmm. Wait, but if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with water might not produce a strong acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitride, like Na3N. When Na3N reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base, but the question says acids F and G). Wait, no, because that would produce a base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal chloride. Let's say A is a metal, B is Cl2. Then C is a metal chloride. When C reacts with water, it forms the metal hydroxide (if it's a strong base) and HCl (a strong acid). Wait, but the problem says two different acids. So that doesn't fit. Unless the metal is a transition metal that forms more than one acid. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfate? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. Let me think differently.

Looking at reaction 4: D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D and B combine in 1:1. B is a gas; D is a gas as well? H is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, etc. But H is formed from D and B. So B and D are gases, and when they react, they form a solvent. What gases combine to form a solvent? Let's think: if B is Cl2 and D is something else. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, they form H2O, a solvent. That makes sense. So B is O2, D is H2, and H is H2O. But wait, reaction 4 is D + B → H. So H would be H2O in that case.

But then, in reaction 3, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So if H is water (from reaction 4), then in reaction 3, C is reacting with water. Let me see.

Wait, let's re-examine. Reaction 4: D (gas) + B (gas) → H (solvent). So H is a solvent, perhaps H2O, ethanol, etc. If B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O. Or if B is Cl2 and D is NH3, but NH3 is a gas but not sure. Alternatively, B is CO2 and D is something else. Hmm.

Let me think again. Let's suppose that in reaction 4, B is Cl2 and D is something else. For example, D could be H2, but then H would be HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Wait, but H could be HCl gas, but that's not a solvent. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: What if B is O2 and D is NH3? Then H would be NO or something, which isn't a solvent. Alternatively, what if B is O2 and D is H2? Then H is H2O. That could work. So H is water. So in reaction 4, B (O2) and D (H2) react to form H2O. That makes sense.

So, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O. Now, going back to reaction 1: A (solid) reacts with O2 (8 equivalents) to form C (bright red). So A is a metal that, when oxidized with O2, forms a red oxide. Which metals form red oxides? Maybe manganese (Mn) forms MnO2, which is black. Or perhaps vanadium? Wait, vanadium(V) oxide is orange. Wait, what about sodium oxide? Na2O is white. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur. Wait, sulfur is a solid, but reacting with O2 would form SO2 or SO3. But SO2 is a gas, not a solid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A is copper. When copper reacts with O2, it forms CuO, which is black. Not red.

Wait, another angle: Reaction 3 says C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid. G is a weak acid. So if C is a metal oxide, like CuO, then reacting with water would produce Cu(OH)2, but that's a base, not an acid. Hmm. Alternatively, if C is a non-metal oxide, like SO3, which is a gas. SO3 when hydrolyzed gives H2SO4 (a strong acid) and... wait, no, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4. But that's only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a carbonate. No, carbonates usually produce bicarbonate and CO2 when reacted with water. Wait, but the problem states that C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. So maybe C is a mixed carbonate? Or perhaps a sulfite? Let's think: for example, if C is Na2SO3, then when it reacts with water, it might not do much. Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track.

Another thought: maybe C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (a weak base, not acid) and Ca(OH)2. Hmm, that's not fitting either.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate? If A is a metal, like Ba. So Ba reacts with O2 to form BaO. But BaO is a solid, and when BaO reacts with water, it forms Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide. Wait, but metal sulfides usually react with water to produce H2S (a weak acid) and the metal hydroxide. But again, that's a base and an acid. So F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a sulfide of a metal that produces a strong acid. Wait, but I can't think of any.

Wait, maybe C is something else. Let me think about the first reaction again. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). If B is Cl2, then 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So, for example, if A is Na, then 8 Cl2 would mean 16 Cl atoms. But sodium is +1, so each gives one Cl. So 8 Cl2 (16 Cl atoms) would require 16 Na atoms. So the formula would be Na16Cl8? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the formula is NaCl2? No, sodium chloride is NaCl.

Hmm, maybe it's a different structure. Wait, perhaps A is a diatomic molecule, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe A is a compound that can accept multiple Cl atoms. Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a complex. Or maybe A is a metal oxide. Let me think: for example, Na2O reacting with Cl2 to form NaCl. But the stoichiometry would be different.

Wait, another approach. The product E is extremely hazardous. What dangerous substances are formed by reacting C with D? C is the product of A and B. So, E is C + D → E.

If D is H2, and C is something like SO3, then E could be H2SO4, but that's not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, if C is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), reacting with H2 could produce HClO4, which is highly dangerous. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), but that's a gas. I'm not connecting the dots.

Let me think about reaction 3 again. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, maybe C is a salt that contains both a strong acid and weak acid anions. Hmm, like a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), then when it reacts with water, maybe it doesn't do much. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, but that's a base.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloride of a metal that when hydrolyzed produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm. For example, suppose C is sodium chloride (NaCl), but that would produce HCl (strong acid) when reacted with water, but not another acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: maybe C is a carbonate. Let's say Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid). But the problem states that C reacts with water to form two acids. So, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed carbonate and something else. I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about reaction 4 again. D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If D is H2 and B is O2, then H is H2O. So, H is water. So in reaction 3, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is strong acid, G is weak acid.

Hmm, maybe C is a sulfite. Let's say C is CaSO3. When it reacts with water, it would produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, sulfurous acid) and Ca(OH)2 (a strong base). But that would not produce two acids. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is FeS, then reacting with water would produce H2S (weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (a base). Not two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say C is NH4N3. No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a phosphate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. Let's say C is Na2O2. When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorate. For example, NaClO3. When reacted with water, it might not decompose. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck, maybe I should think about the products again. Another approach: The reaction of C with water gives two acids. So, C is likely a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acid components. That suggests that C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. Wait, but such salts are usually like sodium acetate (from a weak acid, acetic acid, and strong base, NaOH), which would hydrolyze to give a weak acid and a strong base. But in our case, it's producing two acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a diacid. For example, if C is magnesium dihydrogen phosphate, MgH2PO4. When it reacts with water, it could give H3PO4 (a weak acid) and Mg(OH)2 (a base). But that's again not two acids.

Another thought: Maybe C is a sulfonate ester, but that's probably too complicated.

Wait, what if C is a nitro compound? Nitro groups when hydrolyzed can form nitric acid, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate of a weak acid. Hmm, but that usually leads to bases.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Let me try to think about the possible substances.

In reaction 4, D and B form H, a solvent. So maybe B is Cl2 and D is NH3. Then H would be NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is F2 and D is something else. Not sure.

Wait, another idea: B is O2 and D is C (carbon). Then H would be CO or CO2, which are gases, not solvents. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2. Then H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O. Then H would be H2CO3, which is a weak acid, not a solvent. Hmm. Not quite.

Wait, perhaps B is NH3 and D is something else. No, because B is a gas, D is a gas, H is a solvent.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider the most dangerous products. For example, phosgene (COCl2) is highly toxic. But how would that form? If C is OCl2 (ozone?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), which is a very dangerous gas. How would that form?

Wait, reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So, if C is a chloride and D is F2, then E could be ClF3 or similar. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly reactive compound like ozone (O3), but I think O3 is formed from O2 and UV light, not a reaction with another gas.

Wait, another approach: Let's go back to reaction 1. If 8 equivalents of gas B are used, perhaps B is a diatomic molecule, so 8 B would mean 8/2 =4 moles of molecules. Wait, maybe B is O2, so 8 moles of O2 would be 4 diatomic molecules. So the reaction would be A + 4 O2 → C.

If A is Na (solid), then 4 O2 would produce NaO2? Wait, sodium oxide is Na2O, which is formed when Na reacts with O2. So the reaction would be 2 Na + O2 → Na2O. But the question states 8 equivalents of O2. So 4 O2 per Na? That would lead to NaO2? But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, sodium peroxide? Na2O2 is formed when Na reacts with O2 in excess. The reaction is 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. So, perhaps A is Na, B is O2, and C is Na2O2.

So, solid Na reacts with O2 gas to form Na2O2 (which is bright yellow, not red. Hmm, doesn't fit. Wait, maybe C is another compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is another oxide.

Wait, perhaps A is aluminum. Aluminum reacts with O2 to form Al2O3. That's a white solid. Not red.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur (solid) reacts with O2 to form SO2 or SO3. SO2 is a gas, doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different oxide. Wait, maybe it's a transition metal. For example, manganese forms MnO2, which is black. Not red.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. Let's say A is a metal that forms a sulfide. So, A + B (which is S) → C (a sulfide). But that doesn't fit with the first reaction having 8 equivalents.

Wait, maybe A is a metal that forms a sulfide with S8 gas. For example, Fe + S → FeS. But FeS is black. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the other reactions. Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. If C is Na2O2, then reacting with D would form what? If D is Cl2, then perhaps E is NaClO4? Not sure. Alternatively, if D is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is SO3, and D is H2. Then E would be H2SO4, which is a strong acid but not extremely hazardous in that form. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is chlorine gas, but that's not formed from C and D.

Another thought: What if C is a chlorate, like KClO3. Reacting with D (maybe H2) could produce KCl and H2O. But that's not extremely hazardous. Hmm.

Let me think about the symmetry of E. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. So E has a certain molecular structure. Usually, these symmetry groups correspond to molecules with specific shapes.

For example:
- D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with multiple atoms, like O2, CO2, etc.
- D4h is the symmetry of a molecule like SO2 or O3.
- C2 is a molecule with a two-fold rotation axis, like H2O (but actually, water has C2v symmetry).
Wait, no, water has a C2v point group. Ozone (O3) is D3h. CO2 is D∞h.

Wait, the options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a linear molecule like CO2 or O2, it would have D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, if E is a bent molecule like O3, it would be D3h (but that's not one of the options). Hmm.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent, its symmetry is D4h? Wait, SO2 is V-shaped, similar to water, but with a different symmetry. Wait, SO2 has a D∞h symmetry? No, I think SO2 has a D3h symmetry because it's a trigonal planar molecule. Wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule with a central S atom double-bonded to two O atoms. Its structure is similar to O3. So its symmetry is D3h.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like H2O, which has a C2v symmetry. But in the options, C2v is option D.

Wait, but I'm not getting much further with this approach. Maybe I should think about the possible E.

Another angle: the reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. If D is H2, then 2 H2 reacts with C to form E. So perhaps E is CH4 or something? But I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of all reactions together.

- Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red)
- Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
- Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent)

From reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). So H is a solvent formed from D and B. The likely candidates for H are H2O, ethanol, etc. So if H is H2O, then D and B must combine to form water. Which would mean D is H2 and B is O2. So reaction 4 would be H2 + O2 → H2O (with a catalyst perhaps).

If that's the case, then B is O2, D is H2.

Now, reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 O2 → C (bright red). So A is a metal that oxidizes with O2 to form a red oxide. Which metal forms a red oxide? Hmm, maybe chromium? Chromium(III) oxide is green, though. Manganese(IV) oxide is black. Wait, maybe it's vanadium(V) oxide, which is orange. Not red. Alternatively, cobalt(II,III) oxide is blue.

Wait, could it be lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of compound, like a sulfide.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a manganese compound. Manganese(II) oxide is black, but permanganate is purple. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about reaction 3. C reacts with H2O to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). If C is a metal oxide, but then it would produce a base. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. Let me think: if C is Fe2(SO4)3, then when it reacts with water, it would produce Fe^3+ ions and SO4^2-. But that doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's think reaction 3. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So, C could be a salt that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, if C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. Wait, but that usually produces a strong base and a weak acid. Not two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a diacid. For example, if C is H2SO4, then reacting with water would not change much. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed salt. Wait, maybe C is something like sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which when reacted with water doesn't produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: If C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, it doesn't change much. But if it's reacted with an acid, it could produce SO2. Hmm, but the reaction is with water.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, NH4N3. When it reacts with water, it could produce HN3 (uncommon) or other products. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a perchlorate. Let's say C is KClO4. When it reacts with water, it would just dissolve, not produce acids. Hmm.

I'm stuck, perhaps I should think about the possible E. What extremely hazardous substance is formed by reacting C (unknown) with D (H2).

If E is a highly toxic gas, perhaps it's phosgene (COCl2) or hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Let me think about how E could form.

If C is CO2 and D is Cl2, perhaps E is COCl2. But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions.

Alternatively, if C is SO3 and D is H2, perhaps E is H2SO4, which is a strong acid but not extremely hazardous in that form.

Wait, another thought: if C is SO2 and D is H2O, but that's not reaction 2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Cl2O7 (dichlorodioxygen), and D is H2. Then E could be HClO4, a strong acid and oxidizer. HClO4 is a very strong acid and highly dangerous.

So, if E is HClO4, what's its molecular symmetry?

HClO4 is a linear molecule? No, it's a tetrahedral structure with Cl central. Wait, no, HClO4 is a monoprotic acid where the structure is similar to HClO3 but with an additional oxygen. Wait, the structure of HClO4 is Cl central with four O atoms. Each O is bonded to Cl, and one H. Wait, no, HClO4 has the formula HClO4, so the structure is Cl-O-O-O-OH. Wait, no, that's not right. HClO4 has a central Cl atom with four oxygen atoms: one double-bonded, three single-bonded, and one H attached to the double-bonded O. So the structure is similar to HClO3 but with another oxygen.

Wait, no, HClO4 is a monovalent acid where the structure is Cl central with four oxygen atoms: three in a plane (double bond, single, single) and a hydrogen on the double-bonded O. So the molecule is tetrahedral around the Cl atom.

Wait, the symmetry of HClO4 would be C2v. Because the molecule has a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the plane of the double bond, and a mirror plane. So the point group would be C2v.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. HClO4 is a monoprotic acid where the Cl is in the center with four oxygens: one is double-bonded (with H), and the others are single-bonded. So the molecule has a trigonal pyramidal geometry, similar to NH3. The symmetry would be C3v. But that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, but the options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. So if E is HClO4, its symmetry is C2v. Which would make option D the answer.

But let me check another possibility. What if E is phosgene (O=CCl2). Phosgene has a structure similar to O=CX2, where X is Cl. The molecule is linear, so its point group is D∞h. So if E were phosgene, its symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But how would phosgene form? From reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. If D is H2 and C is CO, then CO + 2 H2 → CH2O (formaldehyde?), but that's not phosgene. Alternatively, perhaps C is Cl2O and D is CO. Then Cl2O + 2 CO → 2 CCl2O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCl (a strong acid, but not extremely hazardous in that form. Unless it's in high concentrations).

Wait, another possibility: E is ClF3, which is a highly dangerous gas. ClF3 has a trigonal pyramidal structure, similar to NH3. Its point group is C3v. But that's not one of the options here.

Alternatively, perhaps E is H2O2, which is a weak oxidizer but not extremely hazardous. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck because I don't know what E is. Let me try to think of another angle.

In reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. That suggests that C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed carbonate, like sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3). When it reacts with water, it doesn't produce two acids; it's a weak acid itself.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate ester. For example, if C is CH3SO3Na, which could hydrolyze into H2SO3 (weak acid) and CH3COOH (weak acid). That would fit F as strong acid, but both are weak. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitrate ester. For example, if C is something like CH3NO3, which upon hydrolysis gives HNO3 (strong acid) and CH4 (a neutral molecule, not an acid). So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a phosphate. Let's say C is NaH2PO4. When it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into H3PO4 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But again, that's not two acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide of a transition metal that when hydrolyzed produces two different acids. For example, if C is CuS, but that doesn't hydrolyze in water to produce acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. If C is Na2O2, when it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. Again, not two acids.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think about what E could be, given that it's formed from C and D, which we've tentatively identified as H2. So reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → E.

If E is HCl, then C would be Cl2O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is CH4, but that's not extremely hazardous.

Wait, another angle: Let's suppose that C is CO2. Then reaction 2: CO2 + 2 H2 → CH4 + H2O. But that's not a dangerous product. Alternatively, C could be Cl2O, and D is H2, then E would be HClO. But HClO is a strong oxidizing agent but not extremely hazardous in small amounts.

Wait, perhaps E is HClO4, which is a strong acid and a good oxidizer. So if E is HClO4, then how is it formed?

In reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → HClO4. So C would have to be something like ClO2, perhaps. ClO2 is a reddish gas. So if C is ClO2, and D is H2, then 2 H2 + ClO2 → HClO4 + H2O? Not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe C is ClO3, and D is H2. Then  ClO3 + H2 → HClO4 + H2O? Again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO and D is H2O, but that's not a reaction with H2.

I'm not getting anywhere. Let's think about the possible symmetry groups.

Option C is D∞h, which is for linear molecules like O2, CO2, etc. Option B is D4h, for molecules like SO2, which is bent. Option A is C2, which is a two-fold rotation, like some linear molecules with two atoms. Option D is C2v, which is for molecules like H2O (though H2O is C2v).

Wait, if E is HClO4, then its symmetry is C2v. So the answer would be option D.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene (O=C=Cl2), which is a linear molecule, its symmetry is D∞h. So the answer would be option C.

But how to decide which is more likely.

Wait, given the reactions, perhaps E is phosgene. Let me think how that could form.

Phosgene is formed by the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with excess chlorine under certain conditions. Or perhaps from COCl2 and Cl2. But I'm not sure how that would fit here.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3, but that's not fitting with D being H2.

Another angle: If E is HClO4, then what is C? C would have to be a chlorate. So reaction 2 would be C (chlorate) + H2 → HClO4. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps reaction 2 is C (ClO2) + 2 H2 → HClO4 + H2O. That would make sense in terms of H2 providing the hydrogen.

So, if E is HClO4, symmetry C2v (option D), but if E is phosgene, symmetry D∞h (option C).

I think I'm stuck, but based on the information, if E is HClO4, its symmetry is C2v, which is option D. Alternatively, if E is phosgene, option C.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G.

If C is ClO2, then reaction with water would produce HClO (a strong acid) and HOCl (weak acid?), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps C is ClO3^-.

Wait, maybe C is sodium chlorate (NaClO3). When it reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze. Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO2, which would react with water to produce HClO and HOCl. Then F would be HClO (a strong acid) and G would be HOCl (a weak acid). That fits the description.

So in that case, E would be formed from ClO2 and H2. So ClO2 + 2 H2 → E. What could E be? Maybe HClO4?

Wait, that reaction doesn't look right. Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, but that's not extremely hazardous as a gas, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HClO. But HClO is a strong oxidizer but not extremely hazardous in small amounts.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to tie everything together.

From reaction 4, H is a solvent formed from B and D. If H is H2O, then B is O2 and D is H2.

In reaction 1, A + 8 O2 → C. If A is Na, then 8 O2 would form NaO2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon. If A is carbon, 8 O2 would produce CO2, which is a gas, not a solid.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide that's red. Wait, I think vanadium(V) oxide is orange, but not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Could C be a sulfide? If A is a metal that forms a sulfide with S8 gas (B is S8), then 8 equivalents would mean 8 S atoms. So the formula would be M S4? For example, FeS is a sulfide, but it's black. Hmm.

But I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should conclude based on symmetry.

If E is phosgene (O=C=Cl2), it's a linear molecule, so D∞h symmetry. Thus, option C.

Alternatively, if E is HClO4, symmetry C2v, option D.

But without knowing E, it's hard. However, given that the options include D∞h and C2v, and considering common symmetry groups for such molecules, I think the answer is either C or D.

Wait, another thought: perhaps E is ozone (O3), which has a D3h symmetry, but that's not an option. Alternatively, O2 has D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like H2O (C2v), but that's not extremely hazardous.

Wait, considering all, I think E is phosgene, which is O=C=Cl2, has a linear structure, thus D∞h symmetry. So the answer is option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometry suggests that B is likely a diatomic gas, and 8 equivalents correspond to 4 diatomic molecules. If B is O₂, A could be a metal that forms a red oxide. However, common red oxides like MnO₂ (manganese dioxide) are black, and other metals like vanadium or cobalt do not form red oxides. This step remains unclear, but B is tentatively identified as O₂.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. If D is H₂, E could be a highly reactive compound like HClO₄ (a strong acid and oxidizer) or phosgene (COCl₂), both of which are dangerous. These possibilities align with the reaction conditions.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A, producing two acids: F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests that C is likely a salt or compound that hydrolyzes into acids. For example, if C is a chlorate or sulfite, it could produce strong and weak acids upon hydrolysis.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O₂ and D is H₂, H would be H₂O, a common solvent. This supports the identification of B as O₂ and D as H₂.

### Symmetry Analysis of E:
- If E is HClO₄, it has a tetrahedral geometry with a central Cl atom bonded to four oxygen atoms. Its molecular symmetry group is **C₂v**.
- If E is phosgene (COCl₂), it is a linear molecule with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Its molecular symmetry group is **D∞h**.

Given the options and the analysis, phosgene (COCl₂) is a more likely candidate for E due to its extreme hazard and linear structure, which corresponds to **D∞h** symmetry.

**Answer: C**
