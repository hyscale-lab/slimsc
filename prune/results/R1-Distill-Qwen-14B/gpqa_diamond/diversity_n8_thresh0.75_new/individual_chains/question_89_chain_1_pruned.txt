Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, it's heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with KOH, they undergo elimination, forming an alkene. So, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH should give an elimination product. But wait, since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe it's not a vicinal dihalide. Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions 1 and 3 are across from each other, perhaps? Hmm. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two adjacent carbons if the structure is like that. Or maybe not? Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons? Because in a cyclohexane, 1 and 3 would be adjacent in the ring. So if you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, then elimination would produce an alkene between those carbons.

So the product from the first step (product 1) would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. That might be a diene or some other structure. Let's
