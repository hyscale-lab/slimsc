Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Since the periods are shorter, that means Planet_1 is closer to its star because orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law.

The host stars have the same radius, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, how does the star's mass affect the probability of transit? Oh, wait, the star's radius is the same for both. So, that's the same for the transit probability calculation. Because transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star and planet.

Wait, what's the formula for transit probability? I think it's (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (a (1-e^2)^0.5 )) or something like that, but wait, for a circular orbit (e=0), the probability simplifies. The transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / (R_s (1/(1 - (R_p/(a))^2 )) ) ) ), wait no, maybe I'm complicating. Wait, maybe it's P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_p/a)^2 )^(1/2)), but wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach. The probability that we see a transit is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital plane being aligned edge-on. More accurately, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / (R_s * sin i)) ), but I think I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by the solid angle where the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight. Oh, right, the formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a / (R_s * sin i)) ), but wait, for a random inclination, the probability is (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a / (R_s * sin i)) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( 1 / ( (a / R_s) - (R_p / R_s) ) )^{-1} or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 )) ), but I'm not quite getting this.

Wait, I think I should look at the formula for the transit probability. Let me recall: the probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block (the area of the planet's disk) over the area of the star, multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits. The geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2, right? But wait, that's not considering the orbital distance. Oh, wait, no. The transit probability actually also depends on the orbital distance. Because the planet has to be at the right distance for the alignment. The formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a / R_s) / ( (a / R_s)^2 - 1 )^0.5 ) )? Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 ) ?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the distance. Let me think about the Hill sphere or the orbital distance. The probability of transit is higher when the planet is closer to the star because the alignment is more likely? Or is it when the star is larger? Wait, no, because if the planet is closer (a is smaller), the orbital plane's required alignment is more critical for the transit. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability can be approximated as (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (sqrt( (a/R_s)^2 - 1 )) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s) * sqrt( (a/R_s)^2 - 1 ) )).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the condition for a transit to occur. The planet must pass directly in front of the star, so the line of sight must be within the planet's orbital plane. The probability of this is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s - R_p / R_s)) ). Or, wait, perhaps the probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s) )^(-1) )? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I should look for a more straightforward approach. Let me think about the Kepler's third law. The period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the mass of the star M. So for each planet, using P^2 = (4π²/GM) * a^3. Since both planets have the same mass, but different host stars, their a's can be calculated.

Wait, but the problem states that both planets have been detected via the RV method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. So the orbital periods are known. For Planet_1, P1 = P2 / 3.

The host stars have same radius, R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

Star 1 has mass M1 = 2 M2 (since M1 is twice M2).

So, using Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 π² a^3) / (G M). So a^3 = (G M P²)/(4 π²).

So, for each planet, a1 and a2 can be calculated.

Wait, but both planets have their own a's. Let's see.

Wait, no, each planet is around its own star.

So for Planet_1: P1^2 = (4 π² a1^3)/(G M1)

Similarly, for Planet_2: P2^2 = (4 π² a2^3)/(G M2)

We can write a1 in terms of a2.

Given that P1 = P2 / 3, and M1 = 2 M2.

So, substituting M1 = 2 M2 into a1's equation:

a1^3 = (G * (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )

a2^3 = (G * M2 * P2^2 ) / (4 π² )

So, a1^3 = (2 M2) (P2² /9 ) * G / (4 π² )

a2^3 = ( M2 P2² ) G / (4 π² )

Comparing a1^3 and a2^3:

a1^3 = (2/9) * (M2 P2² G/(4 π²)) ) = (2/9) * a2^3.

So, a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Calculating that cube root: 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6 (since 0.6^3 is 0.216). So a1 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So, Planet_1 is orbiting closer to its star than Planet_2 is.

Now, the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet to the star and the geometry of the orbit. The formula I've heard is that the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I think I might be mixing up some terms here.

Wait, another thought: The transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio (a/(R_s * sqrt(a² - R_s²))) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / sqrt( (a/R_s)^2 - 1 )) )

Wait, let me think again. The planet must lie within the cone of our line of sight. The probability is the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star, multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits. Wait, but the latter part depends on the distance. Hmm.

Alternatively, the geometric transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_p / a)^2 )) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should find the exact formula.

Wait, from what I recall, the geometric transit probability (assuming random inclination) is approximately:

P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * [1 / (a / R_s) * sqrt( (a/R_s)^2 - 1 ) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate as:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (sqrt( (a/R_s)^2 - 1 )) )

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, another source says that the transit probability is the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it passes in front. The alignment probability is 1/(a/R_s), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the formula for the transit probability. But since I can't, I'll proceed as best as I can.

Assuming that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), but that seems off. Alternatively, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a) * something else.

Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a/R_s)) ), but that would mean that as a increases, the probability decreases. Wait, that makes sense because if the planet is farther away, the chance of it passing in front is smaller. So for the same R_p and R_s, a larger a would lead to lower probability.

Wait, but in our case, R_p is the same for both planets? Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass, but mass doesn't directly tell us about the radius. Wait, the question says "Earth-like" planets. So, perhaps their radii are similar to Earth's. But unless specified, I think we can assume that their radii are similar, so R_p1 ≈ R_p2.

But the question doesn't specify the planet radii, but it's probably assuming they're the same, since it's about Earth-like planets. So R_p1 = R_p2.

Wait, the problem says "Both of these planets have the same masses." So, same mass, so same radius? Well, Earth-like, same mass implies similar radius, so R_p1 = R_p2.

So, R_p is same. R_s is same (since both stars have same radius).

So, the only variable in the transit probability is a. So, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a.

Wait, but no, because the transit probability formula also involves a in the denominator squared perhaps. Let me think.

If the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/R_s)), then since R_p, R_s are same for both planets, the probability is proportional to 1/a.

So, Planet_1 has a semi-major axis a1 = 0.6 a2.

So, the transit probability for Planet_1 would be (1/a1) = 1/(0.6 a2) ≈ 1.666/a2.

Planet_2's transit probability is 1/a2.

So, Planet_1's probability is ~1.666 times higher. Thus, the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the exact ratio.

Given a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) = a2 * (2^(1/3))/(9^(1/3)).

9^(1/3) is about 2.08, 2^(1/3) is about 1.26. So (1.26)/(2.08) ≈ 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So, transit probability (assuming 1/a) for Planet_1 is (1/0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 times Planet_2's 1/a2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher by about 1.65 times. So the researchers should choose Planet_1, so option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The transit probability formula might not be exactly 1/a. Let me think again.

The actual formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(a / R_s)) ) * (1/(sqrt(1 - (R_p / a)^2 )) )

Wait, if R_p is much smaller than a, which it is for planets around stars, then sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2 ) is approximately 1. So P ≈ (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s /a) ) = (R_p^2 R_s ) / ( a R_s^2 ) ) = ( R_p^2 ) / ( a R_s )

Wait, but since R_p is same for both, and R_s is same, then P is proportional to 1/a. So, same conclusion: P1 = (1/a1) = 1/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65/a2.

So, the probability is higher for Planet_1, and the ratio is about 1.65.

Looking at the options, option C says "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."

So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The geometric transit probability is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{R_s}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{a}
\]

where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius, \(R_s\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Since both planets are Earth-like, their radii (\(R_p\)) are assumed equal. The host stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), so the transit probability depends inversely on the orbital distance (\(a\)).

### Step 1: Orbital distance calculation
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis (\(a\)) is related to the orbital period (\(P\)) and the host star's mass (\(M\)):

\[
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G M}
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) (Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period).
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).

Substituting these into the formula for \(a^3\):

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{G M_1 P_1^2}{4\pi^2}, \quad a_2^3 = \frac{G M_2 P_2^2}{4\pi^2}
\]

\[
a_1^3 = \frac{G (2M_2) \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{2}{9} a_2^3
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
a_1 = a_2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx a_2 \cdot 0.606
\]

Thus, Planet_1 orbits closer to its star, with \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\).

### Step 2: Transit probability comparison
Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a\), we calculate the ratio of the probabilities:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{1/a_1}{1/a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1 because it has a higher transit probability. Among the options, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
