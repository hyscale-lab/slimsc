Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-, right? So I think I need to figure out the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution.

Wait, how are these salts contributing to PO4 species? Let me think. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. 

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, I think. Its formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion.

So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions, which are phosphate species. But wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form. So maybe these H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will react in solution to form PO4^3- through some dissociation.

I remember that in solution, phosphate species can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The phosphate ion (PO4^3-) is the fully deprotonated form, and the various HPO4 and H2PO4 are partially protonated forms.

So the next thought is about the buffer system here. Since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they can act as a buffer. So the pH of the solution will determine the predominant form of phosphate present, but since we have both, maybe I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the relevant Ka.

Wait, but the problem specifically asks for the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the fully deprotonated form. So I need to consider how much HPO4^2- will deprotonate to form PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will lead to some conversion through their respective Ka values.

Let me think about the possible reactions. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, or accept a proton to become H3PO4. Similarly, HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept to become H2PO
