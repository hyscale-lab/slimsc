Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see. The question involves two reactions where unknown compounds A and B are treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, respectively. The products in both cases are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I need to find out what the starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm. I remember that when you reduce a ketone with a borohydride like LiBH4 or BH3, you usually get an alcohol. But wait, this product is a tetrahydro pyranone, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Wait, no, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ether with a ketone, right? So it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone group.

Wait a second, maybe the starting material is an ester or a carbonyl compound. Oh right! I think when you have a cyclic ketone like pyranone, it's possible that the starting material was an ester or a nitrile? Or perhaps an aldehyde or ketone that undergoes some kind of cyclization upon reduction.

Wait, no, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol ether or a ketal. Wait, but looking at the product, it's 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the pyran ring has a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So how do you form that? Maybe through a reduction of an epoxide? Or perhaps via a ring-opening and then a cyclization. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a cyclic ether.

Wait, I think that when you have a gamma-keto ester (like a cyclic ester?), reducing it can lead to a cyclic alcohol. But wait, the product here is a cyclic ketone, which suggests maybe the starting material was a cyclic ester that upon reduction forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Let me think. Gamma-keto esters can undergo various reductions. For example, when a gamma-keto ester is treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, it can
