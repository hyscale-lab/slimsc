Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So the problem is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. 

Wait, the operator P has components P_x, P_y, P_z. The matrices for each are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh wait, that's important because the state vector is given in that basis.

The system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then plug them into this formula.

But wait, how do I find ⟨P_z⟩? Oh right, because the state is given as a column vector in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, let me think again. The basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. So each component in the state vector corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. So for a three-component system, each basis state |n> has P_z |n> = p_n |n>, where p_n is the eigenvalue.

Looking at the matrix of P_z given:

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So the eigenvalues for P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ, corresponding to the diagonal elements. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors, each basis state is an eigenstate of P_z.

So the state vector is [a, b, c], which is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So each component a, b, c corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate.

Wait, but the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So the state |ψ⟩ can be written as a linear combination of |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, which are the eigenstates of P_z with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

So |ψ⟩ = a |1⟩ + b |2⟩ + c |3⟩, where a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

But wait, the state has to be normalized. Let me check: |a|² + |b|² + |c|² should equal 1.

Calculating:

|a|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
|b|² = (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2
|c|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
Total = 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 +
