Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, right, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I know are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 particles. So, first, maybe I should normalize this state because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, what's the procedure? Oh, right. To normalize, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself and then divide each component by the square root of that inner product.

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's compute the inner product <alpha|alpha>.

First, write the components. The first term is (1+i) for |up>, the second is (2-i) for |down>. The inner product is (1+i)²* |up><up| + (2-i)² |down><down| + cross terms, but since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, the cross terms vanish. So it's just (1+i)^2 + (2-i)^2.

Let me calculate each part. (1+i)^2 is (1 + 2i + i²) → 1 + 2i -1 = 2i. And (2-i)^2 is (4 -4i +i²) → 4 -4i -1 = 3 -4i. Wait, but wait, no, when calculating the inner product, it's the sum of the squares, not the modulus squared? Wait no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the inner product of |alpha> with itself is (1+i)^* (1+i) + (2-i)^* (2-i). Because when you compute <alpha|alpha>, each term is the product of the conjugate of the coefficient times itself.

So (1+i) conjugate is (1-i), so (1-i)(1+i) = 1^2 + (i)(1) + (-i)(1) + i^2(1) → 1 + i -i -1 = 0? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, (1-i)(1+i) is 1*(1) +1*(i) -i*(1) -i*(i) → 1 + i - i -i². Since i² is -1, so 1 +0i +1 = 2. So that's 2.

Similarly, (2 - i) conjugate is (2 + i). So (2 + i)(2 - i) is 4 - (i)^2 → 4 - (-1) = 5.

Wait, wait, no: (2+i)(2-i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5. So the inner product is 2 +5=7. So |alpha> is given as proportional, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next part: we have an operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So what is this operator? It's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin up and down, which are two states.

Let me write the matrix. For a 2x2 case, the diagonal elements are zero (since i=j gives A_ij=0). The off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0,    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Wait, that's correct, because when i != j, it's ħ/2. So yes, that's the matrix.

Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator, and
