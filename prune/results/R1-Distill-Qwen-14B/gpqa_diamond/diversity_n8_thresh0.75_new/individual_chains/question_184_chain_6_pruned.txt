Okay, so I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, I should visualize the target molecule. The substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me number the positions. So, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 on the benzene ring.

Wait, I think I might have that wrong. Let me draw it out. Benzene ring with ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro (NO2) at position 3. So all three substituents are adjacent, like 1, 2, 3 positions. So it's a meta arrangement for the nitro and the ethoxy? Or wait, no. Let me think: benzene is a hexagon, so numbering can be a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's para to each other, but I think in this case, the substituents are adjacent. 

But wait, benzene is symmetrical, so the exact numbering could vary depending on the direction. Anyway, the key is that the substituents are in 1, 2, and 3 positions. So, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl,
