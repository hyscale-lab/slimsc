Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration problems can be a bit tricky. Let me see if I can break it down step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid being diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll work through each part carefully.

First, let me get the initial concentrations and volumes straight. The acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M. So the moles of acetic acid initially are Molarity × Volume. Let's calculate that: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration after dilution would be moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait a second. The initial moles are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we dilute with 20 mL of water, the total volume is 40 mL, so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

But wait, let me make sure. Oh, wait, no. The problem says we dilute with 20 cm³ water. So initial is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So the moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then adding 20 cm³ of water brings the total to 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yup, that's correct.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is 0.1 M. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let's find the equivalence point volume. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed are 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

But the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. Wait, the
