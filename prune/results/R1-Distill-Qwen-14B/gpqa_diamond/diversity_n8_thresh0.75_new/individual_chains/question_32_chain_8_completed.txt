Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to accelerate a nucleus to a certain speed. Hmm, okay, let's start breaking this down.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. So, what's the mass of that nucleus? Let me think. Lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that means it's Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, but wait. The nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus. So the mass would be the mass of a Li-6 atom, but since it's a nucleus, we probably just take the mass as that of the atom minus the electrons. But wait, in high-energy physics, when they talk about the rest mass of a nucleus, they usually use the atomic mass, right? Because the electrons contribute a negligible amount compared to the nucleus, especially for heavier elements. So for simplicity, I'll use the atomic mass.

Li-6 has a molar mass of 6 grams per mole. To find the mass of one nucleus, I'll use Avogadro's number. The atomic mass M would be (6 g/mol) / (1 mole / Avogadro's number) ) divided by the conversion factor to get to kilograms.

Wait, wait. Let me write that down. The molar mass is about 6 g/mol for Li-6. So the mass of one nucleus is (6 g/mol) / (6.022e23 nuclei/mol) ) = 6 / (6.022e23) grams per nucleus. Converting grams to kilograms, divide by 1000. So M = (6 /6.022e23) / 1000 kg.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 6 u (atomic mass units) where 1 u is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So, M = 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 9.963e-27 kg.

Wait, that's a better approach. Because I remember that 1 u is about 1.66e-27 kg. So for Li-6, the mass is 6 u, which is 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approximately 9.963e-27 kg.

Okay, so mass m = 9.963e-27 kg.

Now, the speed is given as 0.96c, where c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s. So the velocity v is 0.96 * 3e8 = 2.88e8 m/s.

Wait, but in relativity, things get a bit more complicated because we have to use the relativistic formulas for energy. So, the total energy E is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute gamma first. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Plugging in v=0.96c:

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So, 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Take the square root: sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate 1 - (0.96)^2:

0.96^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784: Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857… approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy (m c²) is m * c^2.

m is 9.963e-27 kg, c is 3e8 m/s.

So mc² = 9.963e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Calculating (3e8)^2: 9e16 m²/s².

So 9.963e-27 * 9e16 = let's compute that.

Multiply 9.963e-27 * 9e16.

9.963 *9 = approximately 89.667.

Exponents: 1e-27 + 1e16 = 1e-11.

So 89.667e-11 J. Wait, 1e-11 is 10^-11.

So 89.667e-11 is 8.9667e-10 J.

Wait, to be precise, 9.963e-27 * 9e16 = (9.963 *9) * 1e(-27 +16) )= 89.667 *1e-11 = 8.9667e-10 J.

So the rest energy is about 8.9667e-10 J. But we need to find the total energy, which is gamma times that.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 8.9667e-10 J.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 *8.9667e-10 ≈ (approx 3.57 * 8.9667) * 1e-10.

3.57 *8.9667:

Let's compute 3.5 *8.9667: 3.5 *8 is 28, 3.5 *0.9667 is about 3.4, so total around 31.4.

But more accurately:

3.5714 *8.9667:

Hmm, let's compute 3 *8.9667=26.9001.

0.5714 *8.9667: Let's compute 0.5*8.9667=4.48335, 0.0714*8.9667≈0.639. So total approx 4.48335 +0.639=5.12235.

So total is 26.9001 +5.12235=31.02245.

So 3.5714 *8.9667e-10 ≈ 31.02245e-10 J = 3.102245e-9 J.

Wait, but that's in Joules. We need to convert that into GeV because the options are in GeV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 1.602e-10 J.

So to convert Joules to GeV, divide by 1.602e-10.

So E (GeV) = (3.102245e-9 J) / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) )

Let me compute that.

3.102245e-9 / 1.602e-10 = (3.102245 / 1.602) * 10^( -9 +10 )= (approx 1.936) *10^1 = 19.36 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 3.102245e-9 divided by 1.602e-10.

3.102245 /1.602 ≈ 1.936 (because 1.602 * 1.936 ≈ 3.102). So 1.936 * 10^(-9 +10) = 1.936 *10^1 = 19.36 GeV.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest would be option C: 20.132 GeV, but wait, none of the options are exactly 19.36. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculations. Let me go through again.

Wait, the rest mass energy calculation. Oh wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 isn't 6u. Let me think again. Wait, no, Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, so total mass 6u. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma.

v = 0.96c. So beta = 0.96. So beta squared is 0.9216.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta squared) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that part is correct.

Then rest mass energy: m c^2 is 6u * c^2. Oh wait, perhaps I should compute it as 6u * c^2, where u is 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, 6u = 6 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 9.963e-27 kg.

m c^2 is (9.963e-27 kg) * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Which is 9.963e-27 *9e16 = 89.667e-11 J, which is 8.9667e-10 J.

Then E = gamma * m c^2 = 3.5714 * 8.9667e-10 ≈ 31.022e-10 J.

31.022e-10 J is 3.1022e-9 J.

Now, converting to GeV: 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J, so E (GeV) = 3.1022e-9 J / 1.602e-10 J/GeV = (3.1022 / 0.1602) ) GeV.

Wait, wait, wait: 3.1022e-9 / 1.602e-10 = (3.1022 / 1.602) ) * (1e-9 / 1e-10) ) = (approx 1.936) * 10 = 19.36 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have 19.36. The options are:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute 1 - 0.96^2.

0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Wait, but perhaps when I compute gamma, I should use more precise calculations. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus in kg.

Wait, Li-6 has a molar mass of 6.01512279 g/mol, I think. Because exact molar masses can be looked up, but maybe I should use more precise numbers.

Wait, the standard molar mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512279 grams per mole. So the mass per nucleus is (6.01512279 g/mol) / (6.02214076e23 nuclei/mol) ) = 6.01512279 /6.02214076e23 grams per nucleus.

Convert grams to kg: 6.01512279 /6.02214076e23 / 1000 = 6.01512279 /6.02214076e26 kg.

Wait, let me compute that. Let's compute 6.01512279 /6.02214076 ≈ approx 0.9988.

So 0.9988e-26 kg? Wait, no: 6.0151 /6.0221e23 = approx 0.9988e-23 grams, which is 0.9988e-26 kg. So about 9.988e-27 kg.

Wait, earlier I had 9.963e-27 kg, but this is more precise. So using 9.988e-27 kg.

So mc^2 is 9.988e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 = 9.988e-27 *9e16 = 9.988 *9 = 89.892e-11 J = 8.9892e-10 J.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * mc^2 = 3.57142857 * 8.9892e-10 J.

Compute 3.57142857 *8.9892e-10.

3.57142857 *8.9892 = let's compute that.

3 *8.9892 =26.9676.

0.57142857 *8.9892 ≈ 5.1222.

So total approx 26.9676 +5.1222= 32.0898e-10 J.

So 32.0898e-10 J is 3.20898e-9 J.

Convert to GeV: 3.20898e-9 J / 1.60218e-10 J/GeV = (3.20898 / 0.160218 ) ≈ 20 GeV.

Wait, 3.20898e-9 / 1.60218e-10 = (3.20898 / 0.160218) ) * (1e-9 /1e-10) ) = (20.023) * 10 = 200.23? No, wait, wait. Wait, 3.20898e-9 J is 3.20898e-9 / (1.60218e-10) GeV.

Wait, 3.20898e-9 /1.60218e-10 = (3.20898 / 1.60218 ) * 10^( -9 +10 ) )= (approx 2) *10^1=20 GeV.

Wait, 3.20898 /1.60218 ≈ 2.0023.

So 2.0023 *10 =20.023 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But perhaps I need to be more precise with the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more precisely.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28 because 0.28*0.28=0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857...

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise values for the molar mass of Li-6.

Let me look up the exact molar mass of Li-6. Oh, wait, but I don't have access to that. Alternatively, perhaps I can use exact formulae.

Wait, Li-6 has a molar mass of 6.01512279 g/mol, which is 0.00601512279 kg/mol.

So per nucleus: 0.00601512279 kg/mol / (6.02214076e23 nuclei/mol) ) = 6.01512279e-3 kg/mol / 6.02214076e23 nuclei/mol = approximately 9.9878e-27 kg.

So m = 9.9878e-27 kg.

Then mc^2 = 9.9878e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

(3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

So 9.9878e-27 *9e16 = (9.9878 *9) *1e-11 = 89.8902e-11 J = 8.98902e-10 J.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So total energy E = 3.57142857 * 8.98902e-10 J.

3.57142857 *8.98902e-10 = let's compute 3.57142857 *8.98902.

3 *8.98902 =26.96706.

0.57142857 *8.98902 ≈ 5.1222.

Adding, 26.96706 +5.1222=32.08926.

So 32.08926e-10 J = 3.208926e-9 J.

Convert to GeV:

3.208926e-9 J / 1.602176634e-10 J/GeV ≈ (3.208926 / 0.1602176634 ) GeV.

3.208926 /0.1602176634 ≈ 20.023 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 20.023 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's close but a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about using the atomic mass as the rest mass is incorrect. Wait, in reality, the rest mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons due to binding energy, but for heavy ions, this is usually approximated by the atomic mass. So perhaps I should use a more precise value for the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact gamma more accurately.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute gamma using the exact formula. Let's compute gamma as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v is 0.96c, so v²/c² = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 3.57142857...

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise values for c and m. Let me try that.

c = 299792458 m/s approximately.

So v = 0.96 * 299792458 = let's compute that.

0.96 *299792458 ≈ 287,814,  let me compute it properly.

0.96 *299,792,458 = ?

Well, 300 million times 0.96 is 288 million. 299,792,458 *0.96.

Compute 299,792,458 * 0.96:

= (300,000,000 - 207,542) *0.96.

= 300,000,000 *0.96 - 207,542 *0.96.

= 288,000,000 - 200,000 (approx). So about 287,800,000 m/s.

But perhaps the precise value of v doesn't affect gamma much because v is 0.96c regardless of the precise c value, since it's a multiple.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma again with more precise c.

Wait, v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216 as before. So gamma is 3.57142857 as before. So probably not the issue.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass energy.

Wait, using m = 6.01512279 u (since the molar mass is 6.01512279 g/mol, which is 6.01512279 u, because 1 u is approximately 1 g/mol).

So m =6.01512279 u.

1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.01512279 *1.6605390666e-27 kg.

Let me compute that.

6 *1.6605390666e-27 =9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.01512279 *1.6605390666e-27 = approx 0.02514e-27 kg.

So total m ≈ 9.963234e-27 +0.02514e-27 = 9.98837e-27 kg.

So m c² = 9.98837e-27 kg * (2.99792458e8 m/s)^2.

Wait, c is approximately 2.99792458e8 m/s.

So c squared is (2.99792458e8)^2 ≈ 8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So mc² =9.98837e-27 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s².

=9.98837 *8.987551787e-10 J.

Compute 9.98837 *8.987551787.

Hmm, 10 *9 =90, so subtract a bit.

9.98837 *8.98755 ≈ approximately 9.988 *8.98755.

Let me compute 9 *8.98755=80.88795.

0.98837 *8.98755≈ approx 8.906.

So total is about 80.88795 +8.906 =89.79395.

So 9.98837 *8.98755 ≈89.79395.

So mc² ≈89.79395e-10 J =8.979395e-9 J.

Then E = gamma * mc² =3.57142857 *8.979395e-9 J.

Multiply 3.57142857 by 8.979395e-9.

3.57142857 *8.979395 ≈ let's compute:

3 *8.979395 =26.938185.

0.57142857 *8.979395 ≈ approx 5.125.

Total ≈26.938185 +5.125 ≈32.063.

So E ≈32.063e-9 J =3.2063e-8 J.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, mc² was 8.979395e-9 J, so E=gamma * mc² =3.57142857 *8.979395e-9 J.

So 3.57142857 *8.979395e-9 = (3.57142857 *8.979395) *1e-9 J.

3.57142857 *8.979395 ≈32.063.

So E =32.063e-9 J =3.2063e-8 J? Wait, no, 32.063e-9 J is 3.2063e-8 J? Wait, no, 32e-9 is 3.2e-8. Wait, no. 32.063e-9 J is 3.2063e-8 J? No, wait, 32.063e-9 is 3.2063e-8? Wait, no. Because 1e-9 is 0.000000001. So 32e-9 is 0.000000032, which is 3.2e-8.

Wait, but earlier I thought mc² was 8.9e-10 J, but with more precise calculation, it's 8.979e-9 J.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go back.

Wait, mc² = m * c^2.

m =6.01512279 u.

1 u = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.01512279 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Compute 6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632343996e-27.

0.01512279 *1.66053906660e-27 ≈ let's compute that.

0.01 *1.6605e-27 =1.6605e-29.

0.00512279 *1.6605e-27 ≈ approx 8.48e-30.

Total for 0.01512279: 1.6605e-29 +8.48e-30 ≈2.508e-29.

So total m ≈9.963234e-27 +2.508e-29 =9.963234e-27 +0.02508e-27 =9.988314e-27 kg.

So m =9.988314e-27 kg.

c^2 = (2.99792458e8)^2 =8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So mc² =9.988314e-27 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s².

Multiply 9.988314e-27 *8.987551787e16.

= (9.988314 *8.987551787) *1e-27+16 =1e-11.

Compute 9.988314 *8.987551787.

Let me calculate that:

Approx 10 *9=90, but let's do it accurately.

9.988314 *8.987551787.

We can compute:

= (10 - 0.011686) * (9 -0.012448213)

Wait, perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, 9.988314 *8.987551787 ≈ let me compute:

9 *8.987551787 =80.887966.

0.988314 *8.987551787.

Compute 0.988314 *8 =7.906512.

0.988314 *0.987551787 ≈ approx 0.988314 *0.9875 ≈ 0.976.

So total for 0.988314 *8.987551787 is approx 7.906512 +0.976 =8.8825.

Adding to 80.887966 gives 89.7704.

So 9.988314 *8.987551787≈89.7704.

So mc² =89.7704e-11 J =8.97704e-10 J.

Now, E =gamma * mc² =3.57142857 *8.97704e-10 J.

3.57142857 *8.97704e-10 = (3.57142857 *8.97704) *1e-10.

Compute 3.57142857 *8.97704.

3 *8.97704 =26.93112.

0.57142857 *8.97704.

Approx 0.5 *8.97704=4.48852.

0.07142857 *8.97704≈0.641.

So total for 0.57142857 *8.97704 is 4.48852+0.641≈5.1295.

So total is 26.93112 +5.1295≈32.0606.

So E=32.0606e-10 J =3.20606e-9 J.

Now, convert to GeV: 3.20606e-9 J /1.602176634e-10 J/GeV.

3.20606e-9 /1.602176634e-10 = (3.20606 / 0.1602176634 ) GeV.

3.20606 /0.1602176634 ≈20.01 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.01 GeV. The options are:

C)20.132 GeV.

Hmm. The calculated value is approximately 20.01 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact values for c and m.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the exact formula for kinetic energy, but wait, the question is asking for the total energy. So it's not the kinetic energy, but the total energy (gamma * mc²).

Hmm, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 *8.97704e-10 more accurately.

3.57142857 *8.97704 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

3 *8.97704 =26.93112.

0.57142857 *8.97704:

=0.5 *8.97704=4.48852.

0.07142857 *8.97704 = approximately 0.64089.

So 4.48852 +0.64089 =5.12941.

Total E=26.93112 +5.12941=32.06053.

So E=32.06053e-10 J =3.206053e-9 J.

Now, convert to GeV:

3.206053e-9 J /1.602176634e-10 J/GeV = 3.206053e-9 /1.602176634e-10.

Which is same as (3.206053 / 0.1602176634) * (1e-9 /1e-10) = (3.206053/0.1602176634) *10.

Compute 3.206053 / 0.1602176634.

Let me compute 0.1602176634 *20 =3.204353268.

Which is just under 3.206053.

So 20 *0.1602176634=3.204353268.

The difference between 3.206053 and 3.204353 is 0.0017.

So 0.0017 /0.1602176634 ≈0.0106.

So approximately 20.0106 GeV.

So around 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Did I miscalculate the molar mass?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is using the rest mass energy as the mass of the ion in atomic mass units multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u, which is a common conversion factor.

So, the rest mass energy (m c²) for Li-6 is 6 u * 931.5 MeV/u =5589 MeV =5.589 GeV.

Then, the total energy is gamma * 5.589 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857, so E =3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.589=16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589≈3.197.

Total ≈16.767 +3.197=19.964 GeV.

Hmm, that's around 19.96 GeV, which is about 20 GeV. But the options don't have 20 GeV. Option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.589 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.589.

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.57142857 *5.589.

= (0.5*5.589) + (0.07142857*5.589).

=2.7945 +0.4017 ≈3.1962.

Total:16.767 +3.1962=19.9632 GeV.

Hmm, around 19.96 GeV. So that's about 20 GeV, but the options don't have that. So perhaps none of the options are exactly matching, but the closest is C) 20.132 GeV. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But the question says "energy of the RHIC", which typically refers to the total energy. But let's see.

Kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

So if we compute that, for our earlier numbers:

mc² =5.589 GeV.

gamma =3.5714.

Kinetic energy = (3.5714 -1)*5.589 =2.5714 *5.589 ≈approx 14.43 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So probably the question is about the total energy.

Hmm, but according to the calculation, the total energy is about 20 GeV. But the options don't have exactly that. The closest is option C at 20.132 GeV.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the molar mass. Let me double-check. Li-6 has a molar mass of 6.01512279 g/mol. So molar mass M =6.01512279 g/mol.

So per nucleus, the mass is M/(Avogadro's number) ) in grams.

Avogadro's number is 6.02214076e23.

So m =6.01512279 g/mol /6.02214076e23 nuclei/mol =6.01512279 /6.02214076e23 grams per nucleus.

Convert to kg: multiply by 1e-3.

So m = (6.01512279 /6.02214076e23 ) *1e-3 kg.

Compute 6.01512279 /6.02214076 ≈0.9988.

So m ≈0.9988e-26 kg =9.988e-27 kg.

Which is what I used earlier.

So using m c² =9.988e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Which is 9.988e-27 *9e16 =8.9892e-10 J.

E =gamma * mc² =3.5714 *8.9892e-10 =approx 32.06e-10 J =3.206e-9 J.

Convert to GeV: 3.206e-9 J /1.60218e-10 J/GeV=approx 20.01 GeV.

So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's not matching exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the available options have a typo.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma accurately using v =0.96c.

v =0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

gamma =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation using m c² in GeV was better.

Because 6 u *931.5 MeV/u =5,589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

Then E=gamma *5.589 GeV=3.5714 *5.589=approx 19.96 GeV.

So approximately 20 GeV. So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but that's not exactly matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using more precise beta and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the nucleus in terms of the atomic mass (including electrons), which might change the value a bit.

Wait, but that's unlikely because the rest mass of the electrons is negligible compared to the nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual calculation should use the exact formula.

Wait, let me try to compute everything again with more precise numbers.

m =6.01512279 u.

1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m =6.01512279 *1.66053906660e-27 = let's compute that.

6 *1.66053906660e-27 =9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.01512279 *1.66053906660e-27 = approx 0.02514e-27 kg.

So total m =9.963234e-27 +0.02514e-27 =9.98837e-27 kg.

c=299792458 m/s.

So c²=(299792458)^2 =8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So mc² =9.98837e-27 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s².

=9.98837e-27 *8.987551787e16 = (9.98837 *8.987551787) *1e-10.

9.98837 *8.987551787 = let me compute this accurately.

Let me compute 9.98837 *8.987551787.

= (10 -0.01163) * (9 -0.012448213).

But perhaps a better way is to compute as:

9.98837 *8.987551787 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

9 *8.987551787 =80.88796608.

0.98837 *8.987551787.

Compute 0.9 *8.987551787=8.088796608.

0.08 *8.987551787=0.719004143.

0.00837 *8.987551787≈0.0750245.

So summing these:

8.088796608 +0.719004143 =8.807800751.

+0.0750245 →8.882825251.

So total 80.88796608 +8.882825251=89.77079133.

So mc² =89.77079133e-10 J =8.977079133e-9 J.

E =gamma * mc² =3.57142857 *8.977079133e-9 J.

3.57142857 *8.977079133e-9 = ?

3.57142857 *8.977079133 = ?

Compute:

3 *8.977079133 =26.931237399.

0.57142857 *8.977079133 ≈5.12806.

So total approx 32.059297.

So E=32.059297e-9 J =3.2059297e-8 J.

Wait, no, 32.059297e-9 J is 3.2059297e-8 J? No, wait, 32e-9 is 3.2e-8, but 32.059297e-9 is 3.2059297e-8 J? That doesn't seem right. Wait, no, 32.059297e-9 J is 3.2059297e-8 J? No, wait, 32e-9 is 3.2e-8, so 32.059297e-9 J is 3.2059297e-8 J.

Wait, but earlier I thought mc² was 8.977e-9 J, so 3.5714 times that is 3.5714 *8.977e-9 =3.206e-8 J.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with exponents.

Wait, mc² is 8.977079133e-9 J.

E =3.57142857 *8.977079133e-9 J.

Which is 3.57142857 *8.977079133e-9 = 32.06006e-9 J=3.206006e-8 J.

Now, convert this to GeV:

1 GeV =1.602176634e-10 J.

So E (GeV) =3.206006e-8 J /1.602176634e-10 J/GeV.

= (3.206006e-8) / (1.602176634e-10) ) GeV.

= (3.206006 /1.602176634 ) * 1e2 GeV.

Because 1e-8 /1e-10 =1e2.

3.206006 /1.602176634 ≈2. So 2 *1e2 =200 GeV? Wait, that can't be right because earlier estimates were around 20 GeV.

Wait, no. Wait, 3.206e-8 J is 3.206e-8 J.

1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J. So 3.206e-8 J is (3.206e-8) / (1.602e-10) ) GeV.

= (3.206 /1.602) ) *1e2 GeV.

= (2 approx) *1e2 =200 GeV? That can't be right.

Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, 3.206e-8 J divided by 1.602e-10 J/GeV is (3.206e-8)/(1.602e-10) )= (3.206 /1.602) ) *1e2.

3.206 /1.602 ≈2. So 2 *1e2=200 GeV. But earlier calculations using the same numbers gave about 20 GeV. I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me compute it again.

E =3.206006e-8 J.

1 GeV =1.602176634e-10 J.

So E (GeV) =3.206006e-8 /1.602176634e-10.

= (3.206006 / 1.602176634 ) * (1e-8 /1e-10) ) 

= (approx 2.001) *100 GeV.

=200.1 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right, because earlier when I used the same mc² and gamma, I got around 20 GeV. So I must be making a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let's compute this accurately.

3.206006e-8 J divided by 1.602176634e-10 J/GeV.

= (3.206006 /1.602176634) ) * (1e-8 /1e-10) ) GeV.

= (approx 2.001) ) *100 GeV.

=200.1 GeV.

But that's way higher than previous estimates. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, I think I see the mistake. I think I messed up the exponent in mc².

Wait, mc² is 9.98837e-27 kg * (2.99792458e8 m/s)^2.

Which is 9.98837e-27 kg *8.987551787e16 m²/s².

So 9.98837e-27 *8.987551787e16 = (9.98837 *8.987551787) *1e-10.

9.98837 *8.987551787=89.77079133.

So mc²=89.77079133e-10 J=8.977079133e-9 J.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Then E =gamma * mc²=3.57142857 *8.977079133e-9 J.

3.57142857 *8.977079133e-9 = (3.57142857 *8.977079133) *1e-9.

3.57142857 *8.977079133=32.06006.

So E=32.06006e-9 J=3.206006e-8 J.

Now, convert to GeV:

3.206006e-8 J /1.602176634e-10 J/GeV.

= (3.206006 /1.602176634 ) * (1e-8 /1e-10) ) GeV.

= (2.001) *100 GeV.

=200.1 GeV.

Wait, that's 200 GeV, but our earlier calculation using m c²=5.589 GeV gave E=19.96 GeV. So which one is correct?

Ah, I see the mistake. Oh! Oh no, I think I messed up the calculation of mc² in the first method. Let me see.

Wait, in the first method, I used 6 u *931.5 MeV/u =5.589 GeV.

But when I calculated using exact SI units, I got E≈20 GeV, but when I did it more accurately, I'm getting 200 GeV. Which can't be right because 200 GeV is way higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation where I thought mc² was 8.977e-9 J. Let me compute that in GeV.

mc² =8.977e-9 J.

1 GeV=1.602176634e-10 J.

So mc² in GeV is 8.977e-9 /1.602176634e-10 ≈5.6 GeV. Which matches the earlier calculation of 5.589 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *5.6 GeV=3.5714 *5.6= approx 20 GeV.

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. Because when I multiplied mc² by gamma, I mistakenly thought it was in joules, but it's actually in GeV. So the correct way is:

mc² =5.6 GeV.

gamma=3.5714.

E=3.5714 *5.6 GeV ≈20 GeV.

So the correct energy is approximately 20 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) required to accelerate a lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) to a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we calculate the total energy using relativistic mechanics. The total energy \( E \) is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is defined as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass \( m \)
The rest mass of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is approximately \( 6 \, u \), where \( u \) is the atomic mass unit (\( 1 \, u \approx 1.66053906660 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)). Thus:

\[
m = 6 \times 1.66053906660 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 9.963234 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = m \cdot c^2
\]

where \( c = 299792458 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting:

\[
m c^2 = (9.963234 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \cdot (299792458 \, \text{m/s})^2
\]
\[
m c^2 \approx 8.977 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 4: Convert \( m c^2 \) to GeV
Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{GeV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J} \):

\[
m c^2 = \frac{8.977 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{J/GeV}} \approx 5.6 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
The total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma \cdot m c^2
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m c^2 \approx 5.6 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E \approx 3.5714 \cdot 5.6 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.01 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the closest option
The calculated total energy is approximately \( 20.01 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options, the closest value is:

**C) 20.132 GeV**

This slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or more precise intermediate calculations in the problem setup.

Answer: C
