Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation formula, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square. 

Wait, the setup: The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means that the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. So, I think I need to compute the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared, then use those to find the uncertainty.

Right, the formula for uncertainty is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). But wait, since the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, what does that imply about P_z? Well, in quantum mechanics, if the system is in an eigenstate of one operator, it's generally not an eigenstate of a non-commuting operator, unless they're compatible. P_x and P_z probably don't commute, so the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z. Therefore, the expectation values won't be straightforward.

But wait, the state is already given in the P_z eigenbasis. Oh, right! So the basis vectors are |+z>, |0z>, and |-z>, or something like that. Let me think: The operator P_z has eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ, right? Because looking at its matrix, the diagonal elements are (ħ, 0, -ħ). So the basis vectors are the eigenstates of P_z, meaning that each basis vector corresponds to one of these eigenvalues.

So the state is given as a vector in this basis, so the components of the state vector are the coefficients when expressed in terms of |+z>, |0z>, |-z>. But wait, the state is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T. Are these the expansion coefficients in the P_z basis? I think so.

Wait, but how do expectation values work in this scenario. For any operator, the expectation value is the sum over the basis states of the coefficient squared times the corresponding eigenvalue. Because the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value of P_z is just the weighted sum of its eigenvalues, where the weights are the probabilities (squares of the coefficients).

So, let's calculate <P_z>. The components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So their squares are (1/4, 1/2, 1/4). The eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ for each component. So:

<P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) 
= (1/4 - 1/4) ħ 
= 0.

Wait, that's interesting. The expectation of P_z is zero. Now, what about <P_z²>? Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value of P_z squared is the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities. So,

<P_z²> = (1/4)*(ħ)^2 + (1/2)*(0)^2 + (1/4)*( - ħ)^2. 

But (-ħ)^2 is ħ², same as (ħ)^2. So,

= (1/4 + 0 + 1/4) ħ² 
= (1/2) ħ².

So the variance is <P_z²> - (<P_z>)^2 = (1/2 ħ²) - 0 = 1/2 ħ². Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ√(1/2)) = ħ/(√2). Wait, that's one of the options. Looking back, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), and option C is ħ/2.

Wait a second, let me double-check the calculations.

The state components: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So each squared is (1/4, 1/2, 1/4).

For <P_z>:
(1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 -1/4) ħ = 0. Okay.

For <P_z²>:
(1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ². So variance is 1/2 ħ². Square root gives sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2). So the uncertainty is option B.

Wait, the options are:

A) sqrt(2) ħ

B) ħ / sqrt(2)

C) ħ /2 

D) ħ

So yes, the correct answer is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state vector is given as:

\[
\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The coefficients of the state vector correspond to the probabilities of the system being in each eigenstate of $P_z$. The squared magnitudes of the coefficients are:

\[
\left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value of $P_z$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0^2) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
