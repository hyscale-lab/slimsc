Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. The state is an eigenstate of the operator P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is provided as a column vector: [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]. The matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the state is being expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z.

So, the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the variance. The formula for the variance is <P_z²> - <P_z>², and the uncertainty is the square root of that.

Wait, but since the state is given as |ψ>, and it's expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, perhaps this simplifies things. Because in that case, the expectation value <P_z> can be found by the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities (the square of the amplitudes) of each state.

But wait, let me make sure. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which would mean that each basis vector corresponds to a specific eigenvalue of P_z. So the state is a linear combination of these basis vectors, and each component in the vector represents the amplitude for that eigenstate.

So, looking at the given state, which is a column vector [-1/2; 1/√2; -1/2], I think each component corresponds to the amplitude for each eigenstate of P_z. Let's denote the eigenvalues of P_z as λ1, λ2, λ3 for each basis vector.

Wait, but looking at the matrix for P_z, it's a diagonal matrix because the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. From the matrix given:

P_z has first row [ħ, 0, 0], second row [0, 0, 0], third row [0,0,-ħ]. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the basis vectors are |+z>, |0>, and |-z> with eigenvalues +ħ
