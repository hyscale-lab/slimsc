Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me start by breaking down the information given step by step.

First, the question describes a series of reactions. Let me jot down what each reaction is:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to figure out what each of these compounds (A, B, C, D, etc.) could be. Once I have E, I can determine its molecular symmetry group.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. The fact that it's a solid reacting with gas to form a bright red product makes me think of certain well-known reactions. Bright red products are often indicative of compounds like sulfur, but that's a solid. Alternatively, maybe something like rust? Rust is red, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in oxidation reactions, maybe some transition metals form red compounds. Wait, another thought: when metals like iron react with oxygen, they can form colored oxides. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not certain if that's the case here.

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like phosgene or perhaps a cyanide compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe something like chlorine gas or a strong acid, but E is a product, so maybe it's a gas itself?

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A and two acids. If F is strong (like H2SO4, HCl) and G is weak (like CH3COOH), that might give a clue. Alternatively, if C is a salt that hydrolyzes in water, maybe it's a sulfide or nitride? Wait, when a sulfide reacts with water, it can produce H2S (a weak acid) and the corresponding metal hydroxide, but that's more of a strong base. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal oxide. If C is a metal oxide, reacting with water might produce a metal hydroxide and release an acid (but I'm not sure how that works). Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, like FeS, but that's dark in color. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate or something else.

Let me think about reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). So D and B react in 1:1 ratio. H is a solvent, so maybe water? Or perhaps something like ethanol or something else. Wait, if D and B are gases, perhaps they form something like H2O. But B and D would need to combine 1:1. For example, if B is H2 and D is Cl2, they might form HCl, but HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H2O is formed, which is a solvent. But that might be a stretch.

Wait, another idea: Maybe B is O2 and D is H2. Then, H would be H2O. But then, in reaction 1, A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2. If A is Fe (solid iron), then 8 moles of O2 would form FeO4 (but I'm not sure about that, because typically Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3). Wait, but the product C is bright red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, so maybe C is Fe2O3.

So, let's think this through. Suppose A is Fe metal. Reaction 1: Fe (A) reacts with O2 (B) to form Fe2O3 (C), which is reddish. That fits.

Then Reaction 3: Fe2O3 (C) reacts with water. That's a hydrolysis reaction. Fe2O3 + H2O → Fe(OH)3 + something else? Wait, Fe(OH)3 is not an acid. Alternatively, perhaps the oxide reacts with water to form a metal hydroxide. But F and G are acids. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe C is a sulfide instead. Or perhaps another oxide.

Wait, wait. If C is Fe2O3, and when it reacts with water, perhaps it doesn't react directly. Wait, unless C is a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps the oxide is something else. Let me think again.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. So the oxide is being broken down into A (probably the metal), and two acids. So for example, if C is a sulfide, say, FeS, but that's not red. Alternatively, maybe a nitride. If C is Mg3N2, but that's white. Hmm
