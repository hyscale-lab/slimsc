Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The state is given as |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, that means it's not normalized yet, right? Because the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). So the first thing I need to do is find the normalization factor. The state should satisfy <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So, the normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. Let's compute that. The coefficients are a = 1+i and b = 2-i.

The magnitude squared of a is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |1+i| = sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared is 2.

For b, the magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So |2-i| = sqrt(5), squared is 5.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2 +5) = 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Next part: Calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix Aij. The matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so what is this operator like?

In a two-level system, the operator matrix would be:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Because for i≠j, it's ħ/2, and the diagonal elements are zero. Hmm, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, the given Aij = ħ/2 when i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. So for a two-state system (since the state is expressed in up and down, which are two states), the matrix is:

Row 1, column 1: 0
Row 1, column 2: ħ/2
Row 2, column 1: ħ/2
Row 2, column 2: 0

So this matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So the operator
