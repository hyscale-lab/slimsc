Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is all about the different planes and axes they possess. C3h symmetry... Wait, what's that exactly? Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. Let me think. C3h has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also be symmetric across a plane that's horizontal relative to the principal axis.

The question gives four options, all are organic compounds. I'll go through each option one by one.

First, let me list the options:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

Alright, so I need to figure out which of these has C3h symmetry.

Starting with option C: triisopropyl borate. That's a borate ester, right? Triisopropyl would mean three isopropyl groups attached to boron. I think the structure is B with three (CH(CH3)2) groups around it. Boron usually has a trigonal planar structure. Wait, but each isopropyl group is a substituent. So the molecule would have three identical groups around the central boron. So the symmetry here might be something like C3v or C3h.

Wait, if all three substituents are the same, then the molecule should have a C3 axis. But what about the mirror planes? Let's imagine the structure. Each isopropyl group is attached to B. The molecule is planar? Or is there a three-dimensional arrangement?

Wait, actually, triisopropyl borate has three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. So the central boron is like a trigonal center. So the molecule should have a C3 axis. Now, for C3h symmetry, the molecule must have a horizontal mirror plane as well. But if the molecule is non-planar, then the mirror plane might not exist. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically on a trigonal planar structure, perhaps it has a C3v symmetry, which includes a vertical mirror plane but not a horizontal one. Hmm.

Wait, C3h symmetry requires a horizontal mirror plane. So let's think about the molecule. If the boron is in the center, with three isopropyl groups arranged around it in a plane. Then, is there a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis? Wait, no, the horizontal plane would cut through the boron and the substituents. Wait, no, the horizontal mirror plane would be a plane that's like cutting through the middle of the molecule, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is flat enough to have a mirror plane in that orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate isn't flat. The isopropyl groups are bulky, maybe making the molecule non-planar. Wait, but does that affect the symmetry? For example, in a trigonal planar molecule, like BF3, which is trigonal planar, has D3h symmetry. But in this case, triisopropyl borate might not be planar because the substituents are larger. If the substituents are all the same, symmetry would still be high.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about C3h for triisopropyl borate. Let's think about another option.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, a bridged bicyclic amine. Its structure is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, I think. The molecule has a certain symmetry. Let me visualize it. It's a bicyclic structure with two bridgeheads. Wait, quinuclidine has a chair-like structure where the bridgehead atoms are connected in a way that creates a certain symmetry. Does it have C3h symmetry? Hmm. Quinuclidine is known to have a specific kind of symmetry. I recall that quinuclidine has C2v symmetry, not C3h. Because it has two mirror planes and a 2-fold rotation axis. So D is probably not the correct answer.

Now, options A and B are more complex structures with multiple rings. Let's look at option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, benzo...trifuran... so that's a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. Wait, trifuran is a tricyclic system with three furan rings? Or perhaps it's a fused system. Alternatively, it's a molecule with a benzene ring fused to a tricyclic furan structure. The numbering suggests multiple substituents. But I'm not sure about the symmetry here.

Alternatively, looking at the substituents, the molecule has three furan rings attached to a benzene ring. Wait, perhaps it's a corannulene-like structure or something similar. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the structure. Benzo refers to a benzene ring. The [1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c''] part probably refers to the way the rings are fused. So it's a tricyclic system? Maybe a tricyclo structure. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, right? So triphenyleno would imply that a triphenylene group is attached to something. But this molecule also has a trifuran part. So perhaps it's a more complex structure with several rings.

Wait, perhaps both options A and B have tricyclic or polycyclic systems, which can exhibit higher symmetry. Let me think about their structures.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the presence of a three-fold axis. For a molecule to have C3h symmetry, it must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must be symmetric in a way that it looks the same when rotated 120 degrees and also has a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis.

Wait, another approach: C3h symmetry is also known as trigonal pyramidal symmetry. Wait, no, C3h is more about a trigonal planar arrangement with a horizontal mirror. So for example, if the molecule has a trigonal planar structure and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, molecules with threefold symmetry can sometimes be found in compounds with three identical substituents arranged symmetrically around a central atom or group.

So let's go back to option C: triisopropyl borate. The structure is B with three isopropyl groups. If the molecule is planar and all three groups are identical, then it would have a C3 axis. But what about the horizontal mirror plane? The horizontal mirror plane would be a plane that cuts the molecule into top and bottom halves. If the molecule is planar, perhaps such a plane exists.

Wait, but in reality, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, so it's in a plane. So the molecule is flat, with the boron in the center and three isopropyl groups arranged around it. In that case, the molecule should have a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, in a planar molecule, a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as a vertical mirror plane if the molecule is in the plane. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry. D3h would include a horizontal mirror plane, as well as the C3 axis and other symmetry elements. But earlier, I thought that might be the case.

Wait, no. Wait, D3h is a different symmetry group. D3h has a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to the C3, a horizontal mirror plane, and others. But I'm not sure if triisopropyl borate has that. Alternatively, perhaps it has C3v symmetry, which includes a vertical mirror plane.

But the question is about C3h symmetry. So if the molecule has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then its symmetry group would be C3h.

So for triisopropyl borate, since the three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule has C3h symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's higher symmetry, like D3h.

Alternatively, let me think about the mirror planes. If the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror would coincide with the plane of the molecule, which wouldn't add any symmetry. Wait, that's confusing.

Wait, the horizontal mirror plane is perpendicular to the principal axis. So for C3h, the principal axis is C3. So the horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis, cutting through the molecule.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the C3 axis going through the boron atom, and a horizontal mirror plane cutting perpendicular to that, maybe through the center. So if the molecule has a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis, then it has a horizontal mirror plane.

So triisopropyl borate: the boron is at the center, with three isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically. So if the molecule has a mirror plane that goes through the boron and is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, that would be a vertical mirror plane, which would be part of C3v symmetry, not C3h.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about another approach. Maybe I can look for molecules known to have C3h symmetry.

Wait, another option is to think about the number of symmetry elements. For C3h, the molecule must have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation about that axis and also be symmetric with respect to the mirror plane.

Let me think about the structures again. If triphenyleno...trifuran... has a three-fold symmetry, perhaps the arrangement of the substituents is such that rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. So options A and B have 'trifuran' parts, which might have three substituents arranged around a central point.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. So the benzo ring is fused with the trifuran system. If the trifuran part has three substituents arranged symmetrically, then the molecule may have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents in option B are arranged such that rotating 120 degrees brings the molecule into itself.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the positions. The substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. Hmm, that's a lot of substituents. Maybe that's a bit complicated.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. So the triphenylene group is attached to a trifuran system. Triphenylene has three benzene rings fused in a symmetric pattern. So perhaps the entire molecule has a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, triphenylene itself is a symmetric molecule. It's a fused tricyclic system, which has D3h symmetry, I believe. So when it's attached to a trifuran system in a symmetric way, perhaps the whole molecule retains that symmetry.

So if option A has triphenylene attached in a symmetric fashion to the trifuran, maybe the molecule as a whole has C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, the trifuran part in option B has substituents at positions that might not be symmetric. It's hard for me to visualize without the actual structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of substituents. For C3h symmetry, the substituents should be arranged in a way that a 120-degree rotation would map them onto each other.

Wait, another approach: the molecule must look identical after a 120-degree rotation, and also have a horizontal mirror plane. So, perhaps looking for a molecule with threefold rotational symmetry and a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.

In option C, triisopropyl borate, the three isopropyl groups are symmetric around the central boron. So rotating 120 degrees would bring each group into the position of the next. So that's C3. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, if the boron is in the middle and the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar manner, then a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the boron and be perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. So, if the molecule is flat, such a mirror plane wouldn't add any symmetry beyond the planar structure. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is non-planar. If the central boron is in the center and the substituents are arranged symmetrically around it, but the whole molecule is three-dimensional, then a horizontal mirror plane could exist. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the other options. Quinuclidine (option D) has a C2v symmetry, as I thought earlier. So it's not C3h. So D is out.

So, between options A, B, and C.

Now, option B has substituents at 1,3,4,6,7,9. Let's count: six substituents. Hmm, six substituents arranged around a trifuran system. Trifuran is a five-membered ring with three oxygen atoms, perhaps. Wait, no, trifuran would have three oxygen atoms in a fused system. Hmm, not sure.

Option A's substituents are at 1,3,6,8,11,13. Again, six substituents, but possibly arranged in a symmetric way around a central point.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the substituents and their positions. For a molecule to have C3h symmetry, the substituents should be arranged symmetrically every 120 degrees. So, if the substituents are in positions that repeat every 120 degrees, that would support C3h symmetry.

In option B, the substituents are at positions 1,3,4,6,7,9. Let me imagine a hexagonal ring with substituents at these positions. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a fused ring system where substituents are placed at every 120 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps option B has three substituents at 120-degree intervals, and the others are in between. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe triphenyleno... has three substituents arranged symmetrically, making it have C3h symmetry.

Wait, another angle: The name 'trifuran' suggests three furan rings. So if the molecule has a central point with three substituents arranged symmetrically, then it could have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think I need to think about each option's structure again.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Structure is B with three isopropyl groups. So trigonal planar, which would have a C3 axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Because if the molecule is in a plane, a horizontal mirror would coincide with that plane, which doesn't add any symmetry beyond the planar structure. So perhaps it only has C3 symmetry, not C3h.

Wait, no. C3h symmetry requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. If the molecule is planar, then the horizontal mirror plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule. So, in that case, the presence of a mirror plane would be redundant because the molecule is already planar. So perhaps the symmetry is higher, like D3h.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try another approach. Which of these compounds is known to have C3h symmetry?

Alternatively, think about the examples in my notes. Triisopropyl borane is known to have a certain symmetry. Wait, triisopropyl borane is trigonal planar, so it should have D3h symmetry. Because it has a C3 axis, three vertical C2 axes, a horizontal mirror plane, and others. So in that case, triisopropyl borate would have D3h symmetry, which includes C3h as a subgroup.

Wait, but the question is asking which has C3h symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it also has C3h symmetry because D3h includes C3h. So does that mean option C has C3h symmetry? Hmm, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the other options don't exhibit C3h symmetry.

So, let me recap: Option C, triisopropyl borate, has D3h symmetry, which implies it has C3h symmetry as well. So, it would satisfy the condition.

But wait, the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So any molecule with C3h or higher symmetry would have C3h. So if a molecule has D3h, it has C3h, so option C would qualify.

But wait, the other options may not have C3h symmetry. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing D3h and C3h. Let me think, D3h has more symmetry elements than C3h. So any molecule in D3h would have the elements of C3h as well.

So, if triisopropyl borate is D3h, then it's also C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is only C3v. Because in C3v, you have a C3 axis and a vertical mirror plane. So no horizontal mirror plane. So in that case, it wouldn't have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but if the molecule is planar, then the horizontal mirror plane is the same as the plane of the molecule. So perhaps for planar molecules, that horizontal mirror plane isn't considered because it's the same as the plane itself. So in that case, the symmetry group would be C3v, not C3h.

But that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of a planar molecule (like being flat) has a natural horizontal mirror plane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that C3h symmetry requires a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, which is not the same as the molecule's plane. So if the molecule's plane is the mirror plane, which is horizontal, then it's part of the C3h group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

We've eliminated D (C2v). So considering the others.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. If it's trigonal planar with all three substituents the same, then it has a C3 axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Yes, because the molecule is flat, the plane of the molecule can be considered as a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but sometimes the principal axis is the highest symmetry element. For a planar molecule, the principal axis is usually the C2 axis perpendicular to the plane. But in this case, the boron is the central atom with a C3 axis in the plane. So perhaps the principal axis is C3, and the mirror plane is the plane of the molecule, which is horizontal relative to that axis.

So, yes, if the molecule is planar and has a C3 axis in the plane, then it would have C3h symmetry. So option C would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the molecule is non-planar, then it wouldn't have a horizontal mirror plane. But triisopropyl borate is a flat molecule because the boron is in the center with three identical substituents in a trigonal planar arrangement. So it's planar, making the horizontal mirror plane part of its symmetry.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option C, triisopropyl borate.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry elements required for **C₃h**: a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). The options provided are:

1. **A)** triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
2. **B)** benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
3. **C)** triisopropyl borate  
4. **D)** quinuclidine  

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a triphenylene group fused to a trifuran system. Triphenylene itself has **D₃h** symmetry, which includes a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. If the trifuran system is symmetrically attached to the triphenylene, the entire molecule would retain **C₃h** symmetry. However, the complexity of the fused system makes it less straightforward to confirm definitively.

#### **Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule features a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. The substituents are arranged at positions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. While the trifuran system may have some symmetry, the fused benzene ring introduces asymmetry, making it unlikely that this molecule has **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option C: triisopropyl borate**
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups, forming a trigonal planar structure. This arrangement gives the molecule a **C₃** axis. Additionally, the molecule is planar, and the plane of the molecule itself serves as a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ). Therefore, triisopropyl borate exhibits **C₃h** symmetry.

#### **Option D: quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane structure. It has **C₂v** symmetry, which includes a two-fold rotation axis and vertical mirror planes. However, it does not have a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane, so it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that clearly satisfies the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry, as it has both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
