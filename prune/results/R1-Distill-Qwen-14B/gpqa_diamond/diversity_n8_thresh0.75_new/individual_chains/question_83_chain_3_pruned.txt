Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when acetic acid is titrated with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, let's read the problem again carefully. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid being diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, this solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values and match them.

Alright, breaking this down. Dilution first. When we mix equal volumes of acetic acid and water, the concentration will change. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, so total volume becomes 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid can be calculated using Molarity = moles/volume (in liters). So, moles = Molarity * Volume (L). 

Wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M, so moles of acetic acid = 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After diluting to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, right, because when you double the volume, the concentration halves. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. At 25% titration, we've added 25% of the required moles of NaOH to neutralize the acetic acid.

Wait, what's the equivalence point? The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 moles, right? Because the initial was 0.001, and dilution doesn't change the number of moles, just the concentration. So, to reach equivalence, moles of NaOH needed = 0.0
