Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. The most common one is when an acid like HCl reacts with a base like NaOH. The reaction is exothermic, and the heat is often measured in kilojoules per mole of H+ ions consumed. But wait, I also remember that in some cases, especially with strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy change is around -57 kJ/mol per mole of H+.

But wait, the problem here involves three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I'll need to figure out the reaction between them. Let me write down their concentrations and volumes.

HCl: 0.2 M, 500 mL. H2SO4: 0.3 M, 300 mL. Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M, 200 mL.

I think the reaction will involve the acids (HCl and H2SO4) reacting with the base (Ba(OH)2). But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base too; each molecule can provide two OH- ions. So when they react, the H+ from the acids will neutralize the OH- from the base.

Let me calculate the moles of each component.

For HCl: moles = Molarity * Volume(L) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So moles of H+ = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so moles OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. But the stoichiometry depends on the available moles of each.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

So, I need to see which is the limiting reactant. H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is less, so it's the limiting reagent.

So all 0.2 moles OH- will react with 0.2 moles H+. That leaves 0.08 moles H+ unreacted.

So the total moles of H+ that have reacted is 0.2. Since the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+, the total heat released would be 0.2 moles * -57 kJ/mol. Wait, but wait! Is that correct? Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the case of dilute solutions, the second dissociation might not be 100% complete, but I think in this problem we can assume it's a strong acid, so both H+ ions are released.

Wait, but wait another thing. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will completely dissociate. So the calculation seems okay.

So the heat released is 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, wait! Because the problem is about enthalpy of neutralization, which is per mole of H+ or OH- consumed. So each mole of H+ that reacts contributes. Since OH- is the limiting reagent, all
