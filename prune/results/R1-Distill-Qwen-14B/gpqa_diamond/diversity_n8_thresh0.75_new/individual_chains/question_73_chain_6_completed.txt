Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for energy, each astronaut's energy would be calculated using the relativistic energy formula, then summed up.

Let me see. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. I think the first step is to find the relative speed between them. Since they're moving in the same direction, I should subtract their velocities, but not just like regular subtraction. Oh wait, the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/c²). So let's plug in v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that. 0.6 *0.5 is 0.3, and c squared over c squared is 1, so 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (0.1c) / 0.7 = approx 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c, so that's a clue.

Now for the energy. Each astronaut's energy is gamma times m c squared. Wait, but their masses are 2m and 3m. So I should calculate each one's gamma factor, multiply by their mass, and then sum E1 and E2.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

For the first astronaut, v=0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.36 c²)/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 *2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut, v=0.5c. Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈1/0.8660 ≈1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 *3m c² ≈1.1547 *3 *m c² = approx 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Hmm, that's about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² with v_rel 0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. So the correct energy is 5.96, and the relative speed is 0.14c. So option C must be the right answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the velocity part. When calculating relative velocity, it's (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)) = (0.1c)/(1-0.3) = 0.1/0.7 c = 1/7 c ≈0.1428c, so 0.14c when rounded. So yes, the relative speed is 0.14c.

So the correct option is C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the relative speed is approximately \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The relativistic energy of each astronaut is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

Thus, the relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and the total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} = 5.96m c^2\). Comparing these results with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
