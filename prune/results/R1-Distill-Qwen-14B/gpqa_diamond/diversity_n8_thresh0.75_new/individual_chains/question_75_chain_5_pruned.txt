Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the Chinese hamster ovary cells. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The researcher is using a plasmid to induce overexpression of GADD45G. They introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the cells with Lipofectamine, selected for antibiotic resistance, but the protein isn't showing up as expected.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, I need to check for any issues that would prevent proper translation. Let's analyze the sequence.

First, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. That's good because it means translation begins here. Then, the HA tag is probably right after the ATG since it's an N-terminal tag. So the next few codons should be part of the HA sequence.

Wait, perhaps there are issues with the reading frame or a stop codon appearing before the end of the coding region. Because if a stop codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) appears early, the ribosome would terminate translation and the protein would be truncated or not made at all.

Let's look for any in-frame stop codons in the given sequence. Each codon is three nucleotides. Let's go through them:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (tyrosine)
3. CCA (proline)
4. TAC (tyrosine)
5. GAT (aspartic acid)
6. GCT (alanine)
7. TCC (serine)
8. AGA (arginine)
9. GAT (aspartic acid)
10. TAC (tyrosine)
... and so on.

Wait a second, looking through the sequence, I should check if any triplet is a stop codon. Let me go through them one by one.

Looking for UAA, UAG, UGA. Let me scan:

After ATG, the next codon is TAC (no), CCA (no), TAC (no), GAT (no), GCT (no), TCC (no), AGA (no). Wait, AGA is arginine, not a stop. Next is GAT (no), TAC (no), GAC (no), etc. Hmm, I don't see any of the stop codons in the sequence provided. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Wait, maybe the HA tag is causing an issue. The HA tag is usually added as a short peptide, perhaps after the start codon. Let's check the first few codons. The sequence after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TAC. So that's Y P Y D A S R Y..., which seems like the HA tag might be part of that. However, the HA tag is a specific sequence, perhaps the researcher inserted a specific sequence. If the HA tag isn't correctly added, maybe there's a frame shift or a stop codon introduced.

Wait, but looking at the entire sequence, it's all in the same frame. It starts with ATG and doesn't have any in-frame stop codons. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Another possibility is that there's a mutation in the HA tag sequence. The options suggest that the HA determinant has a missense mutation. If the HA tag has a mutation, maybe it disrupts the proper folding or recognition by the purification method, but the question says the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed at all. So if the HA isn't correctly expressed, the purification might fail, but the initial expression issue would still be due to other reasons.

Wait, another thought: the gene might be under an inducible promoter, and perhaps the induction hasn't happened. But the question says they're using antibiotic selection, which suggests the plasmid is present. So that's probably not the issue.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Missense in HA determinant. That might affect binding but not necessarily prevent expression. They would see some protein but maybe not purify it well. But the question says they can't overexpress it, so perhaps the protein isn't made.

Option B: Ribosome terminates early. That would mean a stop codon in the mRNA. But I can't find any in the coding sequence. So maybe the construct is missing the termination codon? Or perhaps the termination codon is missing, but that usually leads to longer proteins, not no expression.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. So if the HA tag is missing a linker, the protein might be degraded. But then the construct would have the HA as part of the coding sequence. If the HA is correctly present, why would that happen? Maybe the HA tag is being recognized as a signal for proteolysis. But the question is about why the protein isn't being expressed, not why it's being degraded after.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait,
