Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about all the concepts yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read it again. It says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mentioned that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is Ca-EDTA, and the stability constant K is really large, which means the complex is very stable. So, the idea is that the calcium ions are mostly tied up in the complex and aren't free in solution.

Wait, the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric usually means that the molar ratio is exactly the same as the reaction. So, for the Ca-EDTA complex, the formula is probably CaY^2- or something like that. Oh wait, Y is the EDTA^4- ion. So the complex is CaY^2−, and each mole of CaY^2− contains one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M CaY^2−. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex, the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low because the K is so large.

I think the key here is to use the stability constant equation. The stability constant K is given by K = [CaY^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). But wait, in this case, since the solution is stoichiometric, the concentration of CaY^2− is 0.02 M. Also, the concentration of EDTA^4− and Ca²+ should be equal because for every mole of complex, one mole of each ion is used.

Wait, but wait. EDTA is a hexadentate ligand. So, when it forms a complex with Ca²+, each EDTA molecule binds one Ca²+. So, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA^2−.

The stability constant K is [CaEDTA^2−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] ). So K is 5e10.

In a stoichiometric solution, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− are the same because they're in a 1:1 ratio. Let me denote [Ca²+] as x. Then, [EDTA^4−] is also x.

So, the complex concentration is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M.

Putting this into the equation:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Wait, that can't be right. Because K is 5e10, which is a huge number. So, solving for x would give x² = 0.
