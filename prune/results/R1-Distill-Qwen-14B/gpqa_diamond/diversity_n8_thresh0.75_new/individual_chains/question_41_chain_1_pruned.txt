Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. And the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, so I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, when the medium itself is moving, does that affect the speed of light as measured in the lab frame?

I think this involves special relativity. Because when the medium is moving, we have to consider how velocities add according to relativity. But wait, glass is a non-relativistic medium? Or does the velocity v make this relativistic? Oh, but the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so maybe we're supposed to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of just adding the velocities as in Galilean relativity, but I doubt it because we're dealing with light, which is a relativistic phenomenon.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. The light is moving through the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n. But what's its speed relative to the lab?

So the glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. So to find the speed in the lab frame, we
