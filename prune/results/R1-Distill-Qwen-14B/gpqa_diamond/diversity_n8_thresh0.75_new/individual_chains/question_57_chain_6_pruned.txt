Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values: δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. Oh wait, right, in scattering theory, the phase shifts are denoted by δ_l where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. So each δ corresponds to a different l value. And the problem says to ignore the rest beyond δ4, so I guess we only consider l=0 to 4.

The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, the scattering amplitude is usually represented as f(θ, k'), where k' is the wavevector after scattering. But along the incident direction, θ would be 0 degrees, I think. So that's the case when the electron scatters directly back, maybe?

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is given by a sum over all l of (2l+1) * [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * (something) ]... Wait, no, more accurately, the amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over l from 0 to infinity of (2l +1) * [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ] * (something else). Or wait, no, the general expression is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] * (something with Legendre polynomials). Oh right, the exact formula is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ] * P_l(cosθ) ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial of order l.

But wait, since the question asks about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which would be θ=0°. Because when the angle is along the incident beam, that's like the direction the particle is coming from, but in scattering, sometimes that's considered as θ=0, but wait, no, in scattering, θ is the angle between the initial and final momentum. So when it's along the beam, the scattering angle is 180 degrees, but wait, no, θ=0 would be no scattering, same direction. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think: in the context of elastic scattering, the Mandelstam variables or the scattering angles... Oh wait, maybe I should just proceed with the formula.

So for the direction along the incident beam, that would be θ=0. So what's the value of the Legendre polynomials P_l(1), since cos(0)=1. Because cosθ would be 1 when θ=0. So P_l(1) is equal to 1 for all l, right? Because P_0(x)=1, P_1(x)=x, so P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)= (3x²-1)/2, which is 1 when x=1. Wait, P_2(1) = (3*1 -
