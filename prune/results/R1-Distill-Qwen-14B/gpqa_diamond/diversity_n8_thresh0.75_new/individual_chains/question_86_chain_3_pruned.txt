Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds. The products are given, and I need to determine the starting materials A and B from the options provided.

The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but with different stereochemistry: (R) for reaction A and (S) for reaction B. So, the product from A is R configuration, and B is S.

Hmm, wait, that's interesting. Both reactions lead to the same ketone but with opposite configurations. So the starting materials might be related in a way that their configurations lead to opposite results when reduced.

The reagents used are LiBH4 and BH3, both of which are reducing agents. Oh wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used in more polar aprotic solvents, while BH3 is typically used in a less polar solvent, like THF, and is a milder or more selective reducing agent. Or wait, noâ€”LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3? Or is it the other way around? I think LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent because it's more reactive due to the lithium ion stabilizing the BH4^- ion.

Wait, but in the context of ketones, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, no, in this case, the products are both ketones. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the product is a pyranone. So it's a cyclic ketone. So the starting materials must have been something that can form that upon reduction.

Wait, wait a second. So, reduction of a ketone? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. LiBH4 is typically a strong reducing agent that can reduce aldehydes and ketones to alcohols, but if the starting material is a ketone, why would you reduce it? Unless perhaps the starting material is a carbonyl with different groups.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the starting compounds are epoxides or something else that can be reduced to form a ketone. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure of that is a six-membered ring with a ketone at
