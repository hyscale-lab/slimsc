Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with the Boltzmann equation and maybe the Saha equation too. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. So, I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (n2) to a lower one (n1) is given by (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this problem, the excitation is higher in star_1. So, for star_1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2. Or wait, no, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Oh, wait, no, the exact wording is "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, that means the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level.

Wait, but the energy levels are the same for both stars, right? Because the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So E2 - E1 = delta E is the same for both stars.

Let me model this. Letâ€™s assume that for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor.

For star 1: n2_1 / n1_1 = exp( - delta E / (k T1) )
For star 2: n2_2 / n1_2 = exp( - delta E / (k T2) )

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. Or wait no, the population is twice. Let me clarify: The ratio n2/n1 for star_1 is twice that of star_2? Or is star_
