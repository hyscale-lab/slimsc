Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that means there are ester functional groups present. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) which absorbs around 1700 cm^-1 in IR. So that's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down. Two signals are for aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene (assuming the aromatic ring is benzene-like), the substitution pattern can influence the NMR. Di-substitution can be para, meta, or ortho. But wait, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic H. Hmm. If it's para substitution, the ring would have two equivalent protons in each position, so maybe two sets. But wait, in para substitution, each aromatic H is equivalent, so maybe only two signals. But wait, di-substituted benzene usually has two or maybe three signals. Let me think. For example, if it's para di-substituted, the two protons on each adjacent carbon are equivalent, so only two signals: each set of two H as a doublet or something else. Alternatively, if it's meta substitution, there are three different sets of H, but the question says two signals. Oh wait, maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two types of H. Wait, unless one substituent is an ester and another is something else. Hmm.

Wait, the aromatic ring is 6-membered. The substituents are two groups. Let's think about the structure. If the substituents are para, then the aromatic H would be in two sets. For example, if we have an ester group and another substituent, maybe an oxygen-containing group. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two different types of H environments, leading to two signals.

Then, the NMR also shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are typically the ones attached to a double bond. So the structure might have a double bond, perhaps from an ester group. Wait, esters are usually from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, so the structure could be something like an aryl ester. For example,
