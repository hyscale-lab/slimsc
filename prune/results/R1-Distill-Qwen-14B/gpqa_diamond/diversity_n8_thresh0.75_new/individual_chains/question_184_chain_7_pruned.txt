Alright, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

Okay, the question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. My task is to figure out which sequence will give the desired product with high yield.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down. Let me start by drawing the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, no, actually, wait. The numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think: the substituents are on positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So the ring has adjacent substituents in a meta arrangementâ€”wait, no, 1,2,3 are adjacent, so maybe it's a para substitution? Wait, no, 1, 2, 3 are adjacent positions, so it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Hmm, but wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1,2,3 are adjacent. So, substituents are at adjacent positions. That might make the synthesis a bit challenging because each substitution could affect the next.

So, the target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me write the structure mentally: positions 1, 2, 3 on the benzene ring each have a substituent. Position 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), position 3: nitro (NO2).

Now, the starting material is benzene. So I need to add these three groups in the correct order and positions. The order matters because each step will determine where the next substituent goes.

I remember that when you substitute aromatic rings, the directing effects of the substituents matter. Electron-donating groups (like -OCH2CH3) are ortho/para directors, while electron-withdrawing groups
