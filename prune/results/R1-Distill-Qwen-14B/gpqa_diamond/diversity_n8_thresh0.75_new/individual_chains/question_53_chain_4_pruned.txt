Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about determining the molecular formula of a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectral data. Hmm, I remember that di-substituted means there are two substituents on the aromatic ring. 

The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), so the IR would have a peak around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. That makes sense. So the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals. These are split into two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two CH3 groups. And there are no CH2 signals. Interesting.

Let me try to visualize the structure. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents could be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But given the NMR signals, perhaps one substituent is an ester group. Because esters are R-O-CO-O-R or wait, no, esters are like R-O-CO-R. Wait, no, the ester functional group is O-CO-O, but that's in the carbonyl. So the structure would have something like O-CO-O-R attached to the benzene, but more likely, it's an aryl ester or an alkoxy ester.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene could include an ester group. For example, maybe it's a group like O-CO-O-R attached to the ring. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like OCOOR) and another is something else.

Wait, but the NMR signals: two for aromatic H. In a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons can be in positions that are equivalent or not. Let's think about the substitution pattern.

If the substituents are in the para positions, then the aromatic ring would have two sets of protons. Let's say substituents are in the para positions. Then the H on the ring would be in two sets: perhaps two protons each in two positions, leading to two signals. Wait, in para substitution, the ring might have two equivalent H environments. For example, in para-xylene, the ring protons are all equivalent, but if substituents are different, maybe two different H environments
