Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described using the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, I think that means their excitation states are different. So the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state (or another lower state) is different between the two stars.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's a specific value. I think Boltzmann's equation relates the ratio of populations to the temperature and the energy difference. The equation is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (like the number of ways the energy level can be achieved) and k is Boltzmann's constant.

But in this problem, it's stated that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so the ratio for star_1 is 2, and star_2 has a ratio of 1, I think. Wait, no, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level", so maybe it's the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, let me read again.

Wait, it says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So the excitation in star_1 is higher. So if the ratio is n_upper/n_lower, then for star_1, this ratio is 2 times that of star_2. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

But wait, how does the temperature affect this ratio? The ratio is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), assuming that the statistical weights are the same (g_upper/g_lower is same for both stars). So R1 = (g_upper/g_lower) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and R2 similarly with T2.

Given that, R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] ) = exp( ΔE/(k)
