Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, and both photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the conditions there can be treated as similar to a blackbody in thermal equilibrium.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative populations of energy levels in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states. Oh wait, the formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So in this case, the energy difference is delta E, and the ratio of populations is given as 2. So for star 1, the population is twice that of star 2 for the same energy level. Wait, no, wait: wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. Does that mean n1/n2 = 2, or is it the other way around? Let me read again. "Iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, star_1's population is higher. So n1/n2 = 2.

But wait, no, I think the way the question is phrased is that the specific energy level in star_1 has twice the excitation (populated) compared to star_2. So the ratio n1/n2 is 2.

But wait, no. Wait, the energy level is specific, so same energy E. So the ratio is for the same E in both stars, but different temperatures. Because each star has its own temperature.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says, "the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J." Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Are they considering the same energy level in both stars, so the delta E is the same for both, but the temperatures are different? Or is the delta E the same as the energy level difference within each star's consideration?

Wait, I think the energy difference between the two levels (say, level i and level j) is the same for both stars. So for each star, the same transition (same delta E) is being considered. Then, for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the lower state would be determined by their respective temperatures.

Wait, but the question says that the energy difference, delta E, is 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, if they're considering the same energy levels, then the ratio of populations in those levels depends on their temperature.

So in star_1, the ratio is n_i1 / n_j1 = exp(-delta E/(k T1)), and in star_2, it's n_i2 / n_j2 = exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

But the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level. So perhaps n_i for star_1 is twice that of n_i for star_2. Wait, no, because the specific level could be the higher one. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it as the ratio for each star. Let me assume that in star_1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2's population in the same energy level. Or perhaps, the ratio is n1/n2 = 2. Hmm, but that depends on how the energy levels are structured.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the ratio of the excitation for the same energy level in each star. So for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the upper level (i) to the lower level (j) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star 1: (n_i1)/(n_j1) = exp(-delta E/(k T1)).

For star 2: (n_i2)/(n_j2) = exp(-delta E/(k T2)).

But the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So perhaps (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of n_i for star_1 to n_j for star_1 is twice the ratio of n_i for star_2 to n_j for star_2.

So,

n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2).

Alternatively, perhaps n_i1 = 2 * n_i2, but that's assuming that the lower level's population is the same, which I don't think is the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let me think about the ratio of the excitation.

The ratio (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ).

Since E_i is higher than E_j, the difference is delta E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J.

So,

n_i / n_j = exp( - delta E/(k T) )

So for star 1, this ratio is R1 = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

For star 2, R2 = exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2.

So,

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides,

- delta E/(k T1) = ln(2) + (- delta E/(k T2) )

Let me rearrange terms:

- delta E/(k T1) + delta E/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out delta E/(k),

delta E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, delta E is given. Let me compute delta E/(k) first.

Wait, delta E is 1.38e-23 J. Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, wait a minute, 1.38e-23 J is exactly k_B (Boltzmann's constant) times 1 K. Because k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K. So, delta E = k * 1 K. So, delta E/(k) = 1 K.

So substituting back,

1 K [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2)

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) / [1 K * ...? Wait, no, I think I messed up the substitution. Let me re-express it.

Wait, delta E is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k * T, where T is 1 K because k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta E = k * T, where T=1 K.

So, delta E/(k) = T = 1 K.

So substituting into the equation:

(1 K) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2) / (1 K) )

Wait, but 1 K is the same as 1, so maybe the units cancel out. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake with units here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without substituting numbers yet. Let me go back.

We have:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2) * (k)/(delta E)

Wait, delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k*1 K, because k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So, delta E = k * T, where T=1 K.

So, k/delta E = 1 / (k*(1 K)) ) * k ) = 1 / (1 K) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me just compute (k)/(delta E):

delta E = 1.38e-23 J = k * 1 K.

So, k/delta E = 1 K^{-1}.

Wait, no, because delta E = k * T, so T = delta E / (k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So, T = 1 K.

Wait, but in our equation,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2) * (k)/(delta E) )

Since delta E = k * 1 K,

k/delta E = 1 / T = 1 K^{-1}.

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

Wait, but the units on the left are K^{-1}, and on the right, it's (unitless) * K^{-1}, which is consistent.

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

Wait, no, because (k)/(delta E) is (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = 1/K.

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1/K) * K.

Wait, no, because delta E is in Joules, and k is in J/K, so their ratio is (J/(J/K)) )= K.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach it another way.

We have:

delta E = 1.38e-23 J = k * T, where T is 1 K.

So, k = 1.38e-23 J/K, delta E = k * 1 K.

So, (k)/(delta E) = (1.38e-23 J/K ) / (1.38e-23 J ) ) = 1/K.

So, substituting back into the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (1/K) )

Wait, no, because the equation after substitution was:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2) * (k)/(delta E )

Which is ln(2) * (1.38e-23 J/K ) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = ln(2) * (1/K )

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2) * (1/K ) )

Wait, but K is 1, right? Because delta E = k * 1 K. So, T is 1 K.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-express (1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ ln(2) ] * (k)/(delta E )

But since delta E = k*T, and T is the temperature, but for this particular delta E, T is 1 K. Because, as per the calculation, delta E = k * 1 K.

So, substituting delta E = k * T_star, where T_star is 1 K.

So,

(k)/(delta E) = 1 / (T_star) = 1/(1 K) = 1 K^{-1}

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to proceed. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed without substituting numbers yet.

So, the equation is:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2) * (k)/(delta E )

But since delta E is known, and k is known, perhaps we can express it in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but perhaps we can rearrange the equation.

Let me take the equation:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (k)/(delta E )

But since delta E = 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, their ratio is (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) * (J/K)/(J) ) = 1/K.

Wait, so (k)/(delta E) ) = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = 1 K^{-1}.

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

But K^{-1} is per Kelvin, so in this case, because delta E = k * 1 K, we have:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1 K * (1 K^{-1}) ) = 1.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me think:

If delta E = k * T => T=delta E/(k) = 1 K. So, (k/delta E) ) = 1/(1 K) )= 1 K^{-1}.

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

But since the left side is in K^{-1}, and the right side is ln(2) * K^{-1}, so it's:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1}) )

But that would make the left side have units of K^{-1}, and the right side as (unitless) * K^{-1}, which is correct.

But wait, in the equation, the right side is ln(2) multiplied by (k/delta E ), which is 1 K^{-1}.

So, the equation simplifies to:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

But since the units on the left are K^{-1}, and on the right it's (unitless) × (K^{-1} ), it's okay.

But wait, no, because ln(2) is dimensionless. So the equation is:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * ( 1 / (1 K) ) )

Which becomes:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But the units on the right would be (unitless) * K^{-1}.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the units. Let me think about the equation without units.

We had:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (k / delta E )

But delta E = k * T, where T is 1 K.

So,

k / delta E = 1 / (k * T ) ) * k = 1/(T )

Wait, no: k / (k T) ) = 1/(T).

So,

k/delta E = 1/(T) = 1/(1 K ) ) = 1 K^{-1}.

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

But I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere. Let me think about the form of the options given.

Looking back at the options, they all have ln(2) on the left side and some function of T1 and T2 on the right.

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2).

Hmm, but according to my equation, I have (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2) * (k / delta E )

Wait, but since k/delta E is 1 K^{-1}, and given that delta E is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k * 1 K.

So, substituting that in, the equation becomes:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} ) )

But wait, how can that be? Because the left side is (1/T2 - 1/T1 ), which is a function of T1 and T2.

But according to the options, perhaps the equation can be manipulated into one of the given forms.

Let me try to rearrange the equation:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = [ ln(2) ] * (k / delta E )

But since delta E = k * T, where T is 1 K, then:

k / delta E = 1 / T = 1 K^{-1}.

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) = ln(2) / 1

Because 1 K^{-1} multiplied by 1 K gives 1 (but I'm not sure if that's the right way to look at it).

Wait, perhaps I should multiply both sides by 1 K to make the units correct.

Wait, but this might complicate things further. Let me think differently.

Let me write the equation again:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (k / delta E )

We know delta E = 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k * 1 K.

So,

k / delta E = 1 K^{-1}.

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

Wait, but this seems tricky because the equation now is in terms of K^{-1}.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me go back to the beginning.

The problem says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. So, n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2 )

But wait, that's only if the lower level in star_1 and star_2 are the same. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio for each star is n_i / n_j = exp( - delta E/(k T) )

So,

for star_1: R1 = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

for star_2: R2 = exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

The problem says R1 = 2 * R2.

So,

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Take ln of both sides:

- delta E/(k T1) ) = ln(2) + ( - delta E/(k T2) )

Which simplifies to:

delta E/(k T2) - delta E/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor delta E/(k) from both terms:

delta E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

Now, delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so delta E = k * (1 K)

So, delta E/(k ) = 1 K.

Substitute back:

1 K [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But 1 K is 1, so (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

But wait, that can't be because units would be K^{-1} on the left and unitless on the right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting delta E/(k ). Let me see:

delta E/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) ) = 1 K.

So,

1 K * [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

Which implies:

[ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2 ) / (1 K )

But that would introduce a unit inconsistency. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me ignore the units for a moment and just focus on the algebra.

We have:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) / (delta E/(k )) )

But delta E/(k) = T, which is 1 K.

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) / (1 K )

But that doesn't make sense because the left side has units of 1/K and the right is unitless divided by 1/K, which would be K. That doesn't add up.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Another approach: Let's let x = (n_i)/(n_j) for each star.

So, x1 = exp( - delta E/(k T1) )

x2 = exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

The problem states that x1 = 2 x2.

So,

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( - delta E/(k T2) ):

exp( (delta E)/(k T2) - (delta E)/(k T1) ) ) = 2

Take natural log:

(delta E)/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

Now, delta E/(k) = T0, where T0 is 1 K (as delta E = 1.38e-23 J = k * 1 K).

So,

T0 [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

But T0 is 1 K, so,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) / T0 

Since T0 is 1 K,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2 ) / 1 K^{-1} )

Wait, but that would give units of K^{-1} on both sides. So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2 ) * (1 K^{-1} )

But looking at the options, none of them directly match this. Wait, perhaps I can rearrange this equation further.

Let's write:

(1/T2) = (1/T1) + ln(2 ) * (1 K^{-1} )

Wait, but that's not helpful for finding an equation between T1 and T2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2 ) * (1 K^{-1} )

But perhaps I should write this as:

[ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 ) * (1 K^{-1} )

Wait, because (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 ) * (1 K^{-1} )

But the right side has units of K^{-1}, and the left side is unitless (since T1 and T2 are in K, so (T1-T2) is K, but divided by T1*T2 which is K^2, so K^{-1} ), so both sides have units of K^{-1}, which is consistent.

Wait, but I'm trying to get an equation without units. Maybe I should consider that K^{-1} is just a number for the case where delta E = k *1 K.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me try to express the equation in terms of the given options.

Looking at the options, all of them have ln(2) on the left and some expression involving T1 and T2 on the right.

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, if I can manipulate the equation to get ln(2) on the left, perhaps that's the correct option.

Wait, from the earlier equation:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (k / delta E )

But since k/delta E = 1 K^{-1}, as delta E = k * 1 K.

So,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

But the left side is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2) * (1 K^{-1} )

Wait, but without knowing the value of 1 K^{-1}, I can't directly equate this to ln(2) unless the right side is just ln(2).

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the ratio (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2 )

Which is,

exp( - delta E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta E/(k T2) )

Take ln of both sides:

- delta E/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( - delta E/(k T2) )

Rearranged to:

delta E/(k T2) - delta E/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor delta E/(k):

delta E/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

As before, since delta E = k * T0, where T0 = 1 K,

delta E/(k) = T0 = 1 K.

So,

1 K [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2 )

Which gives:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2 ) / K

But K is 1, so,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

But that can't be correct because the left side has units of 1/K and the right is unitless.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that delta E/(k T) is unitless. Let me check the units:

k is J/K, delta E is J.

So,

delta E/(k T) = (J) / ( (J/K) * K ) ) = J/(J) )= unitless.

So, that's correct.

So, the equation (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (k ) / delta E )

k is 1.38e-23 J/K, delta E is 1.38e-23 J.

So,

k/delta E = (1.38e-23 J/K) / (1.38e-23 J) ) = 1/K.

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2) * (1/K )

But that would mean the left side is K^{-1} and the right is K^{-1}.

But the equation would then be:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2) / K 

But K is 1, so,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

Which is,

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = ln(2 )

But looking at the options, none of them match this. The options are:

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Hmm, none of these directly match (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but perhaps I can manipulate this equation to look like one of the options.

Let me write:

(1/T2) - (1/T1) ) = [ T1 - T2 ] / ( T1 T2 )

Which is correct. So,

[ T1 - T2 ] / ( T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

But according to our equation, [1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2 )

Which is,

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

But according to our equation, the left side is equal to ln(2 ), so:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is option D.

So the correct equation is option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the excitation of iron atoms in the photospheres of two stars, star_1 and star_2, under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution governs the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels, given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the upper and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. The energy difference between the energy levels is \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is equivalent to \(k \cdot 1 \, \text{K}\) (since \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)).
2. The excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, meaning:
   \[
   \frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}.
   \]

### Derivation:
For star_1 and star_2, the population ratios are:
\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Given the excitation ratio, we have:
\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K}\), we have \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\). Substituting this:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

### Matching with Options:
The left-hand side of the equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches **Option D**, which states:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

### Conclusion:
The correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is given by Option D.

**Answer: D**
