Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to parse through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about an electron's state, |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, and |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think that means |up> corresponds to spin-up along z and |down> to spin-down along z. Got it.

The first part of the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so what does that matrix look like? Let me think. For a 2x2 matrix, it would be:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Because the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal (i≠j) are hbar/2. So that's the operator matrix. Hmm, I remember that such a matrix might be related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A matrix is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so this operator is also Hermitian, meaning it has real eigenvalues, which makes sense for an observable.

Wait, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> and |-x>, right? Because the eigenstates of σ_x are (1,1) and (1,-1) up to normalization. So the eigenstates of operator A would be the same as those of σ_x, just scaled by a factor. So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because when you apply σ_x to |+x>, you get +1 times |+x>, and similarly for |-x> with eigenvalue -1.

So the question is, what's the probability of measuring the electron in each of these eigenstates when the state is |alpha>? Also, we need to find the average value of operator A.

First, let's handle the state |alpha>. It's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I think that means |alpha> = N[(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>], where N is the normalization factor. So I need to find N first.

To find N, we calculate the norm of the vector (1+i, 2 -i). The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2. Let's compute that:

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2.
|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.
So the total squared norm is 2 +5=7. So N is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x> as I wrote earlier. So to find the probability of measuring +x or -x, I need to compute the inner products of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Let me write down |+x> and |-x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Let's compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

Multiplying this out, it's (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ <up|up> (1+i) + <up|down> (2 -i) + <down|up> (1+i) + <down|down> (2 -i) ]

But <up|down> is zero because they're orthonormal. So simplifying:

(1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Because <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1. So the expression becomes:

(1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1 + i + 2 - i) ) ] = (1/(sqrt(14))) [3]

So the inner product is 3/sqrt(14). The probability is the square of the absolute value of this, which is (3^2)/(14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Because |alpha> is already normalized, so the inner product squared is the probability.

Hmm, 9/14 is about 0.6429. So that's approximately 0.64, which is one of the options. Let me see what the options say about probabilities. Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 ... so the probabilities sum to 1, which is correct.

Wait, but let's compute the other inner product, the one with |-x>.

< -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <
