Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about stellar abundances. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned about element ratios and the EW method.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. They've measured some elemental abundances using the equivalent width (EW) method, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The given values are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has these values:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So, (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

Wait, but I don't have [Si/H] or [Mg/Fe] given directly. Hmm. Let me think about what the notation means. The [X/Y] notation is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithmic abundance relative to the Sun.

First, let's handle Star_1. For Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. That means [Fe/H] = log10(nFe_1/nH_1) - log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0. So log10(nFe_1/nH_1) = log10(nFe_sun/nH_sun). 

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5
