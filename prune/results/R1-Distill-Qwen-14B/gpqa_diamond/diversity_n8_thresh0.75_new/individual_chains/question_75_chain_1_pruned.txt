Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let me walk through the problem step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They're using a construct that includes the coding sequence for GADD45G with an added hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine, selected for antibiotic resistance, but the overexpression isn't happening as expected.

The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand of their construct. Let me look closely at that sequence to spot any issues.

First, I'll think about the structure of the coding sequence. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be near the start of the sequence. The given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then comes TAC (tyrosine), CCC (proline), ATC (isoleucine), etc. Wait, but the HA tag is a peptide from the influenza hemagglutinin, which is about 11 amino acids long. So the first part of the sequence should encode that HA tag.

Looking at the sequence, after ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCC (P), ATC (I), CGA (R), TTA (L), CCA (P), etc. But wait, the HA tag is usually: YPYDVPDYA. Let me check if the codons match.

The HA tag amino acid sequence is Y P Y D V P Y D Y A. Let's translate the initial part of the DNA sequence to see if it matches.

The DNA sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC ATC GAT GTA TTA GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC GCG CGT CTC GAG GAG GAC GAG GGCGAC... 

Let me break this down into triplets:

ATG TAC CCC ATC GAT GTA TTA GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC GCG CGT CTC GAG GAG GAC GAG GGCGAC...

Wait, the first few amino acids would be:

ATG -> Met
TAC -> Tyr
CCC -> Pro
ATC -> Ile
GAT -> Asp
GTA -> Val
TTA -> Leu
GCC -> Ala
AAA -> Lys
TGA -> Stop? Wait, TGA is a stop codon (Ter), so that's a problem.

Oh wait, the construct is supposed to have the HA tag, but if the sequence leads into a stop codon after a few amino acids, that would terminate the protein early. So in this case, the HA tag isn't even getting fully expressed because a stop codon appears in the sequence.

Looking at the DNA sequence: after the start codon (ATG), the next codons are TAC (Y), CCC (P), ATC (I), GAT (D), GTA (V), TTA (L), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (Stop). So the HA tag would be Y, P, I, D, V, L, A, K, and then a stop. But the HA tag is longer than that. The HA tag is longer, so perhaps the construct was supposed to include the HA sequence, but in the provided DNA, the
