Okay, so I have this question about electron microscopy and vacuum conditions. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So Mike was working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, right? The accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, which is pretty high. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because that's better for electron microscopy—less scattering, I think.

But even with all that pumping, some gas particles remained. The mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment.

Then, when he started the electron beam, he noticed something interesting about the mean free path. Instead of being λ1, it became λ2. And the compartment's temperature stayed the same. So why would the mean free path change? The question is about what we can conclude about λ2 relative to λ1.

Wait, mean free path equation. I remember it's given by λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the molecule, and p the pressure. Alternatively, another version is λ = (1)/(sqrt(2)*n*π*d^2), where n is the number density. But another formula I recall is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), but I might be mixing up the variables.

Wait, the mean free path equation is λ = 1/(√2 * n * π * d²), where n is the number density of the gas molecules. Oh wait, but n is proportional to pressure over (k*T) times something. Alternatively, using the ideal gas law: p = n R T, so n = p/(R T). Substituting into λ, we have λ = 1/(√2 π d² (p/(R T))) ) = (R T) / (√2 π d² p) ). Hmm, but R is the gas constant, which is related to k, since R = N_A k. So maybe the exact formula isn't critical here, but the factors that affect it are.

In the scenario, the pressure is the same because the temperature is the same. Wait, no. Wait, initially, the mean free path was λ1 when the system was at a certain pressure. Then, when the electron beam is turned on, does the pressure change? Or is something else affecting the mean free path.

Wait, in ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is very long because the pressure is so low. So the gas molecules are sparse, so they don't collide with each other much. The mean free path is long. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the electrons are interacting with the gas molecules, causing them to scatter off the electrons.

Wait, wait, the question says Mike observed that after initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changed. So the presence of the electron beam affects this. How?

In a vacuum, the electron beam could cause gas molecules to ionize or perhaps heat up. Wait, but the temperature is the same, as per the problem statement. So maybe the effect is not due to temperature change but something else.

Oh, wait, when the electron beam is on, the electrons can collide with the gas molecules. So the gas molecules are now being hit by the electrons, which are part of the beam. So the gas molecules have another source of collisions—collisions with the electrons.

In the initial state (without the electron beam), the mean free path was determined by the collisions between gas molecules. But when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules can also collide with the electrons, which would effectively increase the collision rate, thereby decreasing the mean free path. Because the mean free path is the average distance between collisions. If there's another source of collisions (like electrons), the molecules would collide more often, so λ would be shorter.

So λ2 would be less than λ1 because the mean free path is now shorter due to additional collisions with the electron beam.

So looking at the options:

Option C says λ2 < λ1. That makes sense.

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22λ1. That would suggest mean free path increased, which I don't think is the case.

Option B: λ2 equals λ1. But the problem states that there's a change, so this can't be right.

Option D: λ1 < λ2 <1.22λ1. That would mean λ2 is longer, which doesn't fit because the mean free path should decrease.

Wait another thought: does the electron beam contribute to more collisions? Let me think. The mean free path λ is the average distance a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. If the electrons are moving, do they count as 'other molecules' in the gas? Or are the electrons moving so fast that their collisions are negligible?

Wait, gas molecules in the chamber are at a certain pressure and temperature. The electrons in the beam are moving at a high speed—since the accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, the electrons have a lot of energy. But the gas is at room temperature, perhaps?

The electrons are likely moving much faster than the gas molecules. So when an electron passes through the gas, it could collide with the gas atoms/molecules. Each collision would count towards the mean free path of the gas molecules.

Wait, but mean free path is about how often a gas molecule collides with another gas molecule or another object. In this case, the presence of the electron beam adds another type of collision—electrons hitting gas molecules. So for the gas molecules, their mean free path would be shorter because they are colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons.

But wait, the mean free path λ is about the gas molecules. So if the electrons are providing an additional scattering mechanism, each gas molecule would have a higher probability of colliding with an electron (if the beam is dense enough) or perhaps with other gas molecules.

Wait, but in the ultra-high vacuum, the gas density is very low. So the number of collisions between gas molecules is already very infrequent. The beam's electrons are moving quickly and may have a high flux. So each gas molecule might have a higher chance of colliding with an electron than with another gas molecule.

Wait, but the initial λ1 was calculated based on the gas molecules' own interactions. When the beam is on, the gas molecules can also interact with the electrons, so collisions increase, leading to a shorter mean free path.

So λ2 would be less than λ1. So the correct answer is option C: λ2 < λ1.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment with a mean free path of gas molecules, denoted as $\lambda_1$. The mean free path is determined by the frequency of collisions between gas molecules, which depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and molecular diameter. Initially, $\lambda_1$ was calculated based on the gas molecules' interactions in the vacuum state.

Upon initiating the electron beam, Mike observed a change in the mean free path to $\lambda_2$. The temperature of the sample compartment remained constant, so the primary factor affecting the change in $\lambda$ must be related to the electron beam. The electron beam introduces an additional source of collisions for the gas molecules. Specifically, the high-energy electrons in the beam can collide with the gas molecules, increasing the overall collision rate. This increased collision rate reduces the average distance a gas molecule travels before a collision, thereby shortening the mean free path.

Given this scenario, $\lambda_2$ must be less than $\lambda_1$ because the additional collisions with the electron beam reduce the mean free path. The other options can be ruled out as follows:

- **Option A ($\lambda_2 \geq 1.22\lambda_1$):** This suggests the mean free path increased, which contradicts the observed reduction due to additional collisions.
- **Option B ($\lambda_2 = \lambda_1$):** This implies no change in the mean free path, but the problem explicitly states that $\lambda$ changed upon initiating the electron beam.
- **Option D ($\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22\lambda_1$):** This also suggests an increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the scenario.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that $\lambda_2 < \lambda_1$ due to the increased collision rate caused by the electron beam.
