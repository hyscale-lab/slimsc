Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me write down what I know and think through it carefully.

The question is about determining the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The data given are from FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have a strong absorption around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group. Esters are usually something like R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are substituents.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let me break them down.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, there are two types of aromatic protons. Wait, in a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in different positions. If the substituents are para, then there are two sets of equivalent protons, each pair as doublets. But if they are ortho or meta, the splitting might be different. Hmm. Since it's a six-membered ring, I'm thinking about the substitution pattern. Wait, but the substituents here might not just be the ester; the di-substituted part refers to the ring. So the ring has two substituents besides the ester?

Wait, no. The compound is di-substituted, so the ring has two substituents. Let me think. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene (like two substituents on the ring), and one of those substituents is an ester group. Or perhaps both substituents are ester groups? No, that seems unlikely because the ester has O, and the formula options have O2, which could be from the ester and another oxygen source.

Wait, the formula options are C11H12O2, etc. So the compound is di-substituted, meaning two substituents on the benzene ring. One is an ester group, and the other could be another substituent. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a different group, but that may complicate things.

Looking back at the NMR:

- Two aromatic H signals: So the substituents create two different environments for the H's on the ring. That suggests that the
