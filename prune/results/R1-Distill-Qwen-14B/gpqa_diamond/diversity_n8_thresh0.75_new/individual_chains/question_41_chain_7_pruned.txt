Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, right? So normally, without any movement, the speed would be c/n, which is 1/n since c is taken as 1 here. But wait, the glass is moving. Does that affect the speed of light inside it?

I think about Galilean relativity. When you're in a train moving at a constant velocity, you don't notice it because the laws of physics are the same inside. So if the glass is moving at velocity v, from the lab frame, does that add to the speed of the light?

Wait, but light's speed is always c in a vacuum, right? But inside a medium, like glass, the speed is slower. But how does the motion of the medium itself affect this?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving, so from the lab frame, the light's speed is different. Or maybe not because the medium is moving. Oh wait, no. Because the speed of light depends on the medium's properties. So if the medium is moving, how does it affect the observed speed of light in that medium?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to
