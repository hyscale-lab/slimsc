Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

The target molecule has substituents on the benzene ring. Let's see: the substituents are tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. Wait, their positions matter a lot. The numbering would be such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3? Or wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So in benzene, substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, looking at the positions:

- Position 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH3)
- Position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH2CH3)3)
- Position 3: nitro (NO2)

So substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions. Oh wait, wait, waitâ€”wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering is such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, for 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, that would mean they are adjacent in a way that's possible. But wait, that's impossible because in benzene, three substituents can't all be adjacent. Wait, no, wait, if they are meta, but that's different. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused about the substitution pattern.

Wait, let me visualize the structure. Let's imagine benzene with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are ortho to each other. Because between positions 1 and 2 is ortho, 2 and 3 is meta, but wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the actual structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the directing effects of each group and how they would direct incoming substituents during electrophilic substitution.

Benzene is the starting material. So the first substitution would add one group, which will then direct the next substitution, and so on.

The target molecule has three substituents: eth
