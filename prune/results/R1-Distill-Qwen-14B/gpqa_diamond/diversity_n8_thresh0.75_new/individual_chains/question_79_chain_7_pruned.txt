Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me an experiment where compound X (C11H12O) is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what X is from the options.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh, right, that's a base, maybe used in an elimination reaction or something like that. So the reaction is probably causing some kind of ring-opening or elimination.

Looking at the options, all of them are epoxides except maybe option D? Let me check. Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Oh, oxirane is an epoxide. So all options are epoxides. So the reaction is probably opening the epoxide under basic conditions.

Wait, but what's the product after opening an epoxide with a base? If the epoxide is in a ring, maybe it's a transannular opening. Alternatively, perhaps the base is deprotonating something, leading to ring opening.

Wait, but the question says that the product's NMR is given. So the product is after the reaction, not the starting material. So the starting material X is reacting to form a product whose NMR we have.

Wait, but the question is to identify compound X, which is the starting material. The product is the one with the given NMR.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait no, the question says: compound X was subjected to reaction, and the NMR is of the resulting product. So X is the starting epoxide, and the product is something else. So perhaps the reaction is opening the epoxide. Let me think.

1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. So in the reaction, perhaps it's causing an elimination, but since epoxides can open under basic conditions, maybe it's ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's a retro-aldol or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed opening, but the solvent is nonpolar and the temperature is 403 K (which is about 230Â°C). Hmm, maybe
