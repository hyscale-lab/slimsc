Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene treated with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, probably ruthenium-based. It's used for ring-closing and ring-opening metathesis, and also cross metathesis.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no. Wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene: the pentene chain is five carbons long. The double bond starts at C1. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-? Wait, wait, wait. No. Let me count. Pent is five carbons, 1-ene means double bond from C1 to C2. So structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-? But wait, 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait no. Let me think again. So the parent chain is pentene, five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2 (because it's 1-ene). The substituents are on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Let me write it more clearly.

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5.

Structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, wait. No, the formula is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or maybe CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be 4-methyl
