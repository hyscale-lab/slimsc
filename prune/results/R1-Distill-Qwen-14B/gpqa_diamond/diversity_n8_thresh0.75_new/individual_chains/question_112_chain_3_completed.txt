Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that when a state is proportional, it means it's just a scalar multiple of that expression. So first, I probably need to normalize this state because the probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

Wait, but wait. The question asks about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i isn't equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that matrix looks familiar. Let me think. For a 2x2 matrix, if the diagonal elements are 0 and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2, the matrix would look like:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, no. Wait, no, actually, wait. Because the operator's matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. So in the standard basis (|up>, |down>), the operator matrix is:

[ 0      hbar/2      ]
[ hbar/2  0          ]

Wait, but if the operator is a 2x2 matrix, then its eigenstates would form a basis. So the problem is about measuring in the eigenbasis of this operator. So the state |alpha> is in the computational basis (|up>, |down>), but we need to express it in terms of the eigenstates of operator A.

But wait, to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate, I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize operator A and find its eigenstates, then project |alpha> onto each eigenstate.

Wait, let me think about the operator A first. The matrix is [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2,0]]. What are its eigenvalues and eigenvectors?

The characteristic equation is det(A - lambda I) = 0. So:

| -lambda       hbar/2        |
| hbar/2       -lambda       |  = 0

The determinant is lambda^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0. So lambda^2 = (hbar^2)/4. So lambda is ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenvectors for each eigenvalue:

For lambda = hbar/2:
(A - (hbar/2) I) v = 0.

Which gives:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 1), but let me normalize them. So one eigenstate is (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>).

For lambda = -hbar/2:
(A + (hbar/2) I) v =0.

Which gives:

( hbar/2 ) v1 - (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

Wait, no, wait, the matrix would be:

[ hbar/2      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2     hbar/2 ]

Wait, no, let me recalculate:

Wait, the matrix for lambda = -hbar/2 is A - (-hbar/2) I.

So:

A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]
So A + (hbar/2) I = [[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]]

So the equations are (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, -1), and normalized to 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

So now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me write this as a vector in the computational basis:

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, where a = (1 + i), b= (2 - i).

But since the state is a vector, we need to normalize it. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|a|^2 + |b|^2).

Compute |a|^2: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2.

Compute |b|^2: (2 -i)(2 +i) =4 +1=5.

So |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 2 +5=7.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A, we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

So |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Compute c_+ and c_-.

c_+ is the inner product of |alpha> with |+>.

So c_+ = < + | alpha >.

|+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So < + | is ( < up| + < down| ) / sqrt(2).

So c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | alpha > + < down | alpha > ]

Compute < up | alpha > = (1 + i)/sqrt(7).

< down | alpha > = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So c_+ = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i + 2 -i) / sqrt(7) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (1 + 2) + (i -i ) → 3.

So c_+ = (3)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute c_- = < - | alpha >.

|-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < - | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | alpha > - < down | alpha > ].

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7).

Compute numerator: 1+i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = ( (-1 + 2i) ) / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ).

But the magnitude squared of c_+ and c_- will give the probabilities.

Probability of measuring |+> is |c_+|^2.

|c_+|^2 = (3)^2 / (14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, 9 divided by 14 is approximately 0.642857... So about 0.64, right?

Probability of measuring |-> is |c_-|^2.

Compute | (-1 +2i) |^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5.

So |c_-|^2 = 5/(14) ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.6428, and 5/14 is ~0.3571. So the probabilities are approximately 64.3% and 35.7%.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → 64 and 36. Close to our 64.3 and 35.7.

But wait, let's compute the exact values. 9/14 is exactly 0.642857... which is approximately 0.643, which is about 0.64 if rounded to two decimal places. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36 when rounded up. So Option A's probabilities fit.

Now, the average value of operator A.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since |alpha> can be written in terms of the eigenstates of A, the expectation value is |c_+|^2 * (hbar/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-hbar/2).

Which would be (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [ (9 -5) / (14) ] * (hbar/2) ) = (4/14)(hbar/2) ) = (2/7)(hbar/2) )= hbar/7.

Wait, that's a clean result. So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. That matches.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Wait, but let me double-check the expectation value.

Another approach: calculate expectation value directly.

The operator matrix is [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

The density matrix is |alpha><alpha|.

So the expectation value is Tr( A rho ), which is the sum over i,j of A_ij <i| rho |j> = sum_ij A_ij <i| alpha > < alpha | j >.

Alternatively, more directly, <alpha| A |alpha> is sum_{i,j} A_ij <alpha| i ><j | alpha>.

But perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute it as:

(alpha*) A (alpha) component-wise.

Wait, |alpha> is a column vector [ a; b ], where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Then, A is as defined.

So <alpha| A |alpha> = [ a* , b* ] A [ a; b ].

Compute this:

= a* * (0 *a + (hbar/2) * b ) + b* * ( (hbar/2)*a + 0 * b )

= a* * (hbar/2 * b ) + b* * (hbar/2 * a )

= (hbar/2) [ a* b + b* a ]

Compute a* b and b* a.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* = (1-i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7), so b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

a* b = (1-i)(2 -i) /7.

Compute numerator:

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i)
= 2 -i - 2i + i^2
i^2 is -1.

So 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1-3i)/7.

Similarly, b* a = (2 +i)(1+i)/7.

Compute numerator:

2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i + i^2.

i^2 is -1.

So 2+3i -1 = 1+3i.

So b* a = (1 + 3i)/7.

Now, a* b + b* a = (1 -3i + 1 +3i ) /7 = (2)/7.

So <alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/(7).

Which confirms the earlier calculation.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A has average hbar/7 and probabilities approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Other options:

B: 0.54, 0.46, 3hbar/sqrt(7). Doesn't match.

C: 0.28, 0.72, hbar/sqrt(7). No.

D: 0.61, 0.29, 2hbar/sqrt(7). No.

So the correct option is A.


The problem involves an electron in the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The goal is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |alpha>
The state |alpha> is given as \( |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> \). To normalize it, compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- \( |1+i|^2 = 2 \),
- \( |2-i|^2 = 5 \).

The normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{2+5} = 1/\sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|alpha> = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up> + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down>.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and the corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up> + |down>), \quad |-> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up> - |down>).
\]

### Step 3: Express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->
The coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) for expressing \( |alpha> \) in terms of \( |+> \) and \( |-> \) are:
\[
c_+ = \langle + | alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle - | alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+> \) and \( |-> \) are:
\[
P(+>) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(->) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting \( |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with options
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
