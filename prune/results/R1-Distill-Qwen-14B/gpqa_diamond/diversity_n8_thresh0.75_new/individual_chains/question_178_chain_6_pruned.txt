Okay, so I've got this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that Lagrangians are used in quantum field theory to describe the dynamics of particles. The question is about finding the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ and determining if the theory is renormalizable.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I think σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the commutators of the gamma matrices. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism since it's F. So this looks like an interaction term between fermions (ψ) and photons (since F is from Maxwell's theory).

Wait, the process here is to find the mass dimension of κ. I remember that in QFT, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ=c=1). So each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension [mass]^4 because the integral over four dimensions (d^4x) has dimension [mass}^-4.

So let's look at each part of the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me figure out the dimensions of each field and coupling.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the kinetic term in the Dirac Lagrangian is i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, and that term must have dimension 4. So each ψ has dimension 3/2, because the derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, and the term is (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 = 4. So yes, each ψ is 3/2.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F_{μν} is built from the derivatives of the gauge field A. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1 because the kinetic term for A is (1/4) F^μν F_{μν}, which has each F with dimension 2 (since F is derivative of A, which is dimension 1, so F has 1+1=2), so F is 2. The term (1/4) F^2 has dimension 4, so everything checks out. So F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a tensor made of gamma matrices. Since the gammas are dimensionless (they are just matrices), σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. Because it's a product of gamma matrices and their commutators, which don't add any mass dimension.

So let's compute the dimensions of each part in the interaction term. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ̄ and ψ contributes (3/2) each, so together that's 3/2 *2 =3.

σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so that doesn't change anything.

F^{μν} is dimension 2.

So the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F.

Putting it together, the dimensions are [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F] = [κ] +3 +2 = [κ] +5.

But the entire term must have mass dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian density. So:

[kappa] +5 =4 → [kappa] = -1.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, the second part of the question is whether the theory is renormalizable. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a mass dimension less than or equal to 4. Because in perturbation theory, each vertex contributes factors of the coupling, and higher dimension couplings would bring in higher powers of the momentum, leading to non-renormalizable interactions (like higher than marginal or irrelevant operators in Wilsonian terms).

Wait, what's the rule for renormalizability? The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian with dimension D is renormalizable if D ≤4. So the interaction term here has dimension [κ] +3 +2 = 4 (since [κ] is -1, 4). So the term itself is renormalizable. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, and if the term is renormalizable, then the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, another approach is to look at the coupling's dimension. The dimension of the coupling must be ≤4. For a term like g ψ ψ ψ, each ψ is 3/2, so 3*(3/2) = 4.5. So g must have [g] = 4 -4.5 = -0.5. So such a term would have a coupling with negative dimension, which is non-renormalizable because negative dimension implies the coupling becomes relevant at high energies (or something like that).

Wait, but in this case, the interaction term is [κ] [ψ]^2 [F], which has dimensions:

[κ] is -1.

Each ψ is 3/2, so two of them contribute 3.

F contributes 2.

So total is 3 +2 =5. Then [κ] is -1, so -1 +5=4. So the term is dimension 4.

Which is exactly the dimension needed for a renormalizable term.

Wait, but wait, is the interaction term dimension 4? Yes, because the overall Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So each term is dimension 4. So the term
