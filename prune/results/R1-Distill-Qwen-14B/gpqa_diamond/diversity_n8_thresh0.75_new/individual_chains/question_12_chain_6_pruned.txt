Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the pion (Pi+) is at rest and decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, mu+ is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two values.

Wait, so in particle decays, conservation laws apply. Oh right, energy and momentum must be conserved. But since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the particles must come out in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me recall the formula. The energy of each particle after decay will be the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. But since the pion is at rest, all the energy comes from its rest mass.

So the total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion: 139.6 MeV. The total energy after decay is the sum of energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, neutrinos are massless, I think. Oh right, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are considered massless for these purposes, or at least their masses are negligible compared to the other particles here. So the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since it has no rest mass.

So let me write down the conservation of energy equation. The initial energy is the pion's rest energy, E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

The final energy is E_mu + E_nu. E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. And E_nu is just the kinetic energy of the neutrino, K_nu, since m_nu is zero.

So, E_initial = E_mu + E_nu. So,

139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

But also, momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So p_mu = -p_nu, meaning their magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Now, the energy of each particle is related to their momentum. For the muon, which has mass, the energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Since E_mu is known in terms of K_mu: E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

For the neutrino, which is massless, E_nu = p c.

So, let's set up the equations.

From the momentum conservation, the magnitudes are equal. So p_mu = p_nu = p.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? Wait
