Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativistic energy. But I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The question is asking for the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. The isotopes of lithium vary. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A would be protons plus neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, adding 3 neutrons gives A=6. So the nucleus is Li-6, right?

So the particle we're dealing with is a Li-6 nucleus. I need to find the energy it's accelerated to when its speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. Since it's in a collider, I think this refers to the kinetic energy or the total energy? Wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of the collider, I think it refers to the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, sometimes they might refer to just the kinetic, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, no, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But in the context of colliders, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy each beam has. Or wait, wait. For high-energy particles, the kinetic energy is a significant fraction of the total energy when speeds are relativistic. But perhaps the question is asking for the total energy? Let me think about the formula.

The formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m c^2. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. v = 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m c²). But wait, what is m here? The mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I need to find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus in kilograms or in some unit that can be converted to energy.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the rest mass energy
