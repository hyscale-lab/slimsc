Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, that researchers want to observe. They have limited time and want to pick the one with the highest chance of transiting. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, and both have circular orbits. 

The host stars are also different. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting, because usually more massive stars are bigger, but Planet_1's host is more massive yet same radius. Maybe it's an evolved star or something? Well, the question says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so Planet_1's host is probably main sequence or something else. But for this problem, the key is the radius and mass.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula I think is something like P = (R_planet / R_star)² * (a / (a * sin i))... Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity term (e) is zero, so that part is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2. Wait, but that's the geometric probability, right?

Wait, no, wait. The geometric probability of a transit is actually given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The formula is usually approximated by (R_s / a) / (distance), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the probability of a transit is: P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (
