Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Alright, let's break this down.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, I guess I need to figure out a couple of things: their relative velocity and the total energy.

Wait, relative velocity in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting speeds, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just do a simple subtraction. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity, when one object is moving at u and the other at v relative to the same frame, I think is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let's make sure. If frame S sees object A moving at u and object B moving at v, then the velocity of B as seen from A is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Suppose object A is moving at u relative to the lab, and object B is moving at v relative to the lab. Then, the speed of B relative to A would be (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Yes, that's right. Because from A's frame, the lab is moving at -u, and B is moving at v, so in A's frame, B's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Alternatively, wait, the relative velocity formula is (u' - v')/(1 - (u' v')/c²), but I might get confused with the signs. Let me make sure. Since both are moving in the same direction (positive x), the relative speed should be the difference in their speeds, but relativistic effects must be considered.

So, astronaut 1 has speed u = 0.6c, astronaut 2 has speed v = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So, from the perspective of astronaut 1, what's the speed of astronaut 2? That would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Plugging in the numbers: (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (
