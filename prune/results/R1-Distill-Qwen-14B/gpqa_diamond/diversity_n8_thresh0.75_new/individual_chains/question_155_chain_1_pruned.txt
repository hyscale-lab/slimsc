Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. It involves operators, specifically P_x, P_y, and P_z, and finding the uncertainty in P_z for a given state.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the variance. The variance, in turn, is the expectation of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation of the operator. So ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z^2> - <P_z>^2 ).

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x. So what's the expectation value of P_z in this state? Or maybe I should compute <P_z> first and then <P_z^2> to find the variance.

Wait, but wait. The basis vectors given are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state given is a linear combination of the P_z eigenstates. Let me see.

Let me think about the matrix representation of P_z. The matrix is diagonal because it's in its eigenbasis. The diagonal elements are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the eigenvalues for P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ.

The state vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me check if this vector is normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Calculating:

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4,
(1/√2)^2 = 1/2,
(-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So this state is a linear combination of the |+z>, |0z>, and |-z> states, with coefficients (-1/2), (1/√2), and (-1/2), respectively.

Wait, to find <P_z>, I can take the inner product of the state with P_z acting on the state. Alternatively, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, weighted by the probabilities (squares of the coefficients).

The coefficients are c1 = -1/2, c2 = 1/√2, c3 = -1/2.

The eigenvalues are λ1 = ħ, λ2=0, λ3= -ħ.

So <P_z> = |c1|^2 * λ1 + |c2|^2 * λ2 + |c3|^2 * λ3.

Wait, because the expectation value for an observable in its eigenbasis is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Compute |c1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, same for |c3|². |c2|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

So <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = ( ħ/4 ) - ( ħ/4 ) = 0.

Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Now, what about <P_z^2>? Since P_z is a diagonal matrix, P_z^2 is also diagonal, with each element being the square of the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues of P_z^2 are (ħ)^2, 0^2, and (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So the expectation value <P_z^2> is sum of |c_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i)^2.

So that's |c1|^2 * (ħ)^2 + |c2|^2 * 0 + |c3|^2 * (ħ)^2.

Compute:

(1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*
