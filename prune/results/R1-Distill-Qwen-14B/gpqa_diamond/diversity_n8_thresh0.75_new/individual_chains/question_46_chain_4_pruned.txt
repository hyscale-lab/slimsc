Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it says. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis usually involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. So, when Grubbs is involved, it's probably a ring-closing or cross-metathesis reaction. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene—let me draw its structure. 

The structure should be CH₂=CH-C(CH₂CH3)₂? No, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, that's not correct because the position is 1. Oh wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, the actual structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But in this case, it's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, no. Let's count the carbons. Pent implies five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, maybe I should number it. Carbon 1 is CH2=, then carbon 2 is CH-, carbon 3 is CH(CH3), then more carbons. Wait, perhaps it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, that can't be right. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, the formula would be C5H10. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Because that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's check the formula: each CH2 contributes 2 carbons, each CH contributes
