Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal in the mice after crossing with SOX10-Cre. Let me go through the problem step by step.

First, the setup: We have a ligand and a receptor. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding. So, both are membrane proteins, probably involved in cell signaling.

The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which allows for internal ribosome entry, so both can be expressed from the same vector, but perhaps in a different way.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, these are stop signals with different loxP sites. I remember that Cre recombinase can recognize loxP sites and excise the intervening DNA if the sites are in the correct orientation.

We made a mouse model that's homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. Then, we crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would be expressed in neural crest derivatives, like astrocytes.

After the offspring are born, we look under confocal for fluorescence. No green signal. So eGFP isn't being expressed, or the receptor isn't being expressed. Or maybe it's expressed but not in a detectable location.

Let me think about the vector setup. The ligand and receptor are both in a bicistronic vector. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is probably driving its expression. The receptor is after an IRES, which is a way to have two genes in one vector, allowing for separate translation initiation. So the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES allows for the receptor to be expressed as well.

But the ligand and receptor each have stop cassettes. The ligand's ORF has a stop between it and mCherry, and the receptor has a stop between it and eGFP. These are flanked by lox sites. SOX10-Cre would express Cre in the neural crest, which would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorophores to be expressed.

Wait, but what's the exact setup? The ligand is first: CBA promoter, then ligand ORF, then stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. The receptor is after an IRES, followed by its ORF, then another stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), then eGFP.

So, when Cre is present, which recognizes loxP sites, it would excise the stop cassettes. But wait, the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP. So Cre would recognize the loxP sites and excise the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, but wait, does Cre recognize lox2272? I thought lox2272 is a variant used for different Cre activities or perhaps for the same but in a way that requires a different Cre (like a mutant version). Or maybe in this case, the Cre can still recognize both. Or maybe it's a different recombinase? No, the question says it's SOX10-Cre, which I think is normal Cre.

Wait, but loxP and lox2272 are different. Lox2272 is a mutated version that is recognized by Cre but has a different arrangement. So
