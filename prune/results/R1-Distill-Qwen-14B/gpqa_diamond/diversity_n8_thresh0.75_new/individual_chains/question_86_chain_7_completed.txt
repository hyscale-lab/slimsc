Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about two reactions where two unknown compounds A and B are treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, respectively. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually looking again, A is treated with LiBH4 and gives (R), and B is treated with BH3 and gives (S). Hmm.

Wait, the products are both the same compound but enantiomers. So, the starting materials A and B must be epimers or something related to the configuration of a chiral center.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. Let me think about the structure. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. Tetrahydro means it's a partially hydrogenated ring, so maybe a five-membered ring? Wait, no, pyran is six-membered, so tetrahydro would have four double bonds or something? Wait, no, I think it's a five-membered ring with one oxygen. No, wait, no. Let me clarify. Pyran is a six-membered ring, similar to pyrone, which is a bicyclic structure. But I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, it's a six-membered ring, with one oxygen, and a ketone (2-one). So, the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the starting material was a ketone or an aldehyde that was reduced. But wait, the reagents are borohydrides. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters, ketones, etc. BH3 is usually used for reductions as well, but maybe in different contexts.

Wait, but the products are both cyclic ketones. So, perhaps the starting materials A and B are epoxides, or maybe they're ketals or acetals. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are esters or ketones that, upon reduction, form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, the starting materials are compounds A and B. The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but with R and S configurations. So, the starting materials must have been either esters or ketones that, when reduced, form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-keto esters. Because when a gamma-keto ester is treated with a reducing agent like LiAlH4 or LiBH4, it can undergo a reduction. Wait, but wait. Let me think about the mechanism. Gamma-keto esters can undergo a reduction to form cyclic ketones via a six-membered transition state, perhaps involving a cyclic intermediate.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides that are being opened. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering that the product is a cyclic ketone, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-hydroxy esters. Because when you reduce an alpha-hydroxy ester, you can get a cyclic ketone. Wait, that rings a bell. The Robinson annulation comes to mind, but that's about forming rings via conjugate addition and then cyclization. Alternatively, the reduction of an alpha-hydroxy ester (like a hemiacetal or something) could form a cyclic structure.

Wait, here's the thing: when you have a beta-keto ester, and you reduce it, you can form a cyclic ketone. For example, the reduction of a beta-keto ester with LiAlH4 can lead to the formation of a cyclic hemiacetal, but I'm not quite sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the products are (R) and (S) configurations. So, the starting materials must have had a chiral center that, upon reduction, leads to an inversion or retention of configuration.

Wait, but in the product, the configuration is R or S. So, the starting materials must have been either enantiomers or diastereomers, leading to the opposite configurations upon reduction. Let me think: if the starting material is an (R) ketone, and through reduction, it becomes (S), or the other way around.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 (like BH3-THF) are different in their reducing abilities. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can reduce more types of carbonyl groups. BH3 is typically used for the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but maybe in some cases, it can do other things.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, so perhaps the starting material is an alpha-hydroxy ester, and upon reduction, it forms a cyclic ketone. Let me think about the mechanism. For an alpha-hydroxy ester like CH2(OH)CH2COOR, when treated with a reducing agent, perhaps it would form a cyclic hemiacetal. Wait, but how does that form a ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones with an ester group. Wait, but I'm not getting closer.

Wait, another approach: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure would be a six-membered ring, where position 2 is a ketone (O), and position 4 has an ethyl group. The ring is tetrahydro, which suggests it's a partially hydrogenated ring, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-keto esters. Because when you reduce a gamma-keto ester, you can form a cyclic ketone. Gamma-keto esters have the structure (CH2)2CO-COOR. When reduced, perhaps the ester group is converted into a CH2OH group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, here's a thought: when a gamma-keto ester is treated with a reducing agent, it can undergo a process called the Julia–Kocienski olefination, but that's about forming alkenes. Alternatively, maybe it's about ring closure.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. If you have a gamma-keto ester, RCO-CO-O-R', upon reduction with LiBH4 or BH3, the carbonyl groups are reduced. Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-ketogamma-lactone or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals, and upon opening and reduction, they form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the reduction of an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the products are enantiomers, so the starting materials must have opposite configurations at a certain chiral center. Because when the same reagent is used, the configuration could change based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, but in this case, the reducing agents are different: LiBH4 and BH3. Do they affect the stereochemistry differently? For example, BH3 is a milder reducing agent and may not proceed via the same mechanism, perhaps leading to different configurations.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to look at the options.

The options are all about the starting materials A and B being either (S) or (R) configurations of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, so the structure of the starting material is: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the formula is CH2CH2CO-O-R... Wait, no, wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, the structure is likely: COOH-CH2-CH(Something)-CO-O-R. Wait, perhaps it's a pentanoic acid with substituents at position 3 and 5.

Wait, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let me draw the structure.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But here, it's 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxo.

So, numbering from the COOH end (carbon 1):

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: CH2 (but with an ethyl group attached?)

Wait, wait: the structure is:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3) (since it's 3-ethyl)

Position 5: O-isobutyl and an oxo group (so, position 5 is a carbonyl?)

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So, the chain is five carbons, with COOH on the first.

In the compound, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

So, position 3: ethyl group → so at carbon 3, there's a CH2CH3.

Position 5: isobutoxy and oxo. So, position 5 is the fifth carbon? Wait, but pentanoic acid is only five carbons. So, position 5 would be the same as the COOH group. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The parent chain is a five-carbon chain, with substituents on carbons 3 and 5.

Wait, 3-ethyl: so at C3, an ethyl group.

5-isobutoxy-5-oxo: so at C5, an isobutoxy group and a ketone. But wait, if C5 is the same as the COOH group, that can't have a ketone. Hmm, maybe I have the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The main chain is four carbons, but that doesn't fit pentanoic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOH-(CH2)n- where n=4, but substituents at specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the side chain.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to write the structure as:

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)

Position 4: CH(O-iBu)

Position 5: O=C-OH? No, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is (S) or (R) at a specific chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The compound is a pentanoic acid with substituents at C3 (ethyl) and C5 (isobutoxy and oxo). Hmm, perhaps it's more like:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-iBu)-O

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as a keto ester. Wait, but the starting material is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto acid. A beta-keto acid has the structure RCO-CO-COOH. When reduced with a strong reducing agent, LiBH4, perhaps it forms a cyclic ketone.

Wait, when you have a beta-keto ester or a beta-keto acid and you reduce it, you can form a cyclic ketone via a Claisen-like condensation. Wait, no, the Claisen is for esters. Maybe the reduction leads to a cyclic hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. Wait, when you reduce an alpha-keto ester, you get a secondary alcohol, but if it's in a cyclic structure, perhaps a ring forms.

Wait, let me think about the product. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So, the ring has five carbons and one oxygen. Wait, no, six: O is at position ?, and the numbering is such that the ketone is at 2.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via the reduction of a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ester is transformed, leading to a cyclic structure.

Wait, let me think about the reduction. Suppose the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, like CH2CH2CO-COOR. When you reduce it with LiBH4, perhaps the ester is converted to an alcohol, and the ketone is also reduced, but maybe the molecule cyclizes.

Wait, on reduction, the ester group (COOR) would become CH2OH, and the ketone (CO) would become CH2. But how does that lead to a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the gamma-keto ester upon reduction forms a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not an alcohol.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the possible products.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure would be a six-membered ring with one oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

So, the ring structure is O

| 

C2=O

Then, the ring goes around. So, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Position 2 is the ketone, and position 4 is ethyl.

So, perhaps the starting material is a diol or a hemiacetal which, upon reduction, forms the ring.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Let's think about the stereochemistry. The products are R and S configurations, so the starting materials must have been enantiomers or something else that leads to opposite configurations.

Looking at the options, all options have A and B as either the same or different compounds. So, for example, option D has A as R and B as S.

But since A is treated with LiBH4 and B with BH3, the reagents may affect the configuration.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and can cause different stereochemistry in some reductions, like in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, but wait, the product here is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents open them. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals. When you reduce a ketal, you get a diol. But the product is a ketone, so that can't be right.

Another angle: the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material was a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal which, upon reduction, is opened. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that, upon reduction, form the ring with a ketone. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the reduction of a diketone. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones). When reduced, they open up and form a diol. But the product is a cyclic ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are acyclic ketones with certain groups that upon reduction form the cyclic structure.

Wait, suppose the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. When reduced, the ester group is converted into an alcohol, and the ketone is converted into a methylene group. So, for example:

RCO-CO-O-R' → RCH2-CH2-O-R' ?

Wait, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, RCO-COOR', which upon reduction gives RCH2-COOR', but that doesn't form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic alpha-keto ester. Upon reduction, it forms a cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress. Let's think again about the options.

The options are about the starting materials being (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the structure is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Let's imagine the structure.

The main chain is five carbons, with COOH at position 1.

Position 3 has an ethyl group (so CH(CH2CH3)).

Position 5 has an isobutoxy group (O(CH2)2CH(CH2CH3)) and an oxo group (keto group).

Wait, so the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-iBu)-COOH? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, no. The structure is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, position 5 has both an isobutoxy group and a keto group. Wait, but in a pentanoic acid, how can position 5 have both?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-iBu)-O

Wait, maybe it's:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)

Position 4: CO-O-iBu

Position 5: O=C-OH? No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The compound is (S) or (R) configuration at a certain carbon. Maybe the starting material has a chiral center at position 3 or 5.

So, when it's reduced, the configuration of the chiral center in the product is opposite.

Wait, the product is (R) when treated with LiBH4 and (S) when treated with BH3. So, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration.

But I'm not sure how the reducing agents affect the configuration.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically provides a hydride in a way that follows the mechanism with a certain stereoselectivity. BH3, being a weaker reducing agent, might have a different mechanism.

Wait, but in the case of ketone reductions, which are not our case here, LiBH4 would reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol with a certain configuration based on the starting material.

Wait, but our product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an ester that upon reduction forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Upon reduction, the lactone would open to form a diol, but that's not a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, which is then reduced to form a cyclic ketone.

Wait, here's a thought: when a beta-keto ester is reduced with LiBH4 or BH3, the ester group is converted into a CH2OH group, and the ketone is reduced to a CH2 group. But that would give a diol. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the problem in terms of stereochemistry.

In the product, the configuration is R and S, depending on the reagent. So, if A is treated with LiBH4 and gives R, and B is treated with BH3 and gives S, then perhaps the starting materials A and B have opposite configurations.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S. That would mean that when A (R) is reduced with LiBH4, it gives R in the product. And when B (S) is reduced with BH3, it gives S in the product. Or wait, no: the products are R and S, but which reagent gives which.

Wait, the first reaction: A + LiBH4 → (R)-product.

Second reaction: B + BH3 → (S)-product.

So, the same starting material (same configuration) treated with different reagents gives opposite configurations. Or perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agents affect the configuration. Maybe LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion, or vice versa.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials have a certain configuration, and the reagents cause the product's configuration to be opposite.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone, which implies that the starting material must have had a structure that allows for ring formation upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar, and upon reduction, it forms the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. Upon reduction, it opens up to form a diol, but that's not a ketone.

Hmm. This is getting frustrating. Let me think about the possible reactions of LiBH4 and BH3 with the given starting materials.

The starting materials are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, they are pentanoic acids with substituents at 3 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that when reduced, the ester group (if present) forms a ring.

Wait, but the starting material is a carboxylic acid, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto acid. Beta-keto acids have the structure RCO-CO-COOH. When reduced, they can form cyclic ketones.

Wait, for example, if you have a beta-keto acid, like CH2(COOH)COCH2COOH, and reduce it, the two carboxylic acid groups would become alcohols, and the ketone becomes a methylene group. But I'm not sure how that would form a ring.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto acid, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto acid. Gamma-keto acids have the structure RCO-CH2-CO-COOH. Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ester groups would become CH2OH, but how that forms a ring is unclear.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agent leads to the elimination of a molecule of water, forming a ring.

Ah! That's a possibility. For example, in the reduction of a beta-keto ester, the ester and the ketone are in positions that allow for cyclization upon reduction.

Wait, but the starting material is a carboxylic acid, not an ester. So, perhaps the reaction is not a simple reduction but something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal derived from a beta-keto acid. Upon reduction, the acetal is opened, and a ketone is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a ring closure via an enolate intermediate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

The options are A to D, each with different configurations for A and B.

Since the product from A (using LiBH4) is R, and the product from B (using BH3) is S, perhaps the configuration of A and B depends on whether the reagent causes retention or inversion.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the effect of the reagents on the configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials have opposite configurations, leading to the opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, in the options, option D has A as R and B as S. So, when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it gives R, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it gives S.

But why would the reducing agent affect the configuration? Maybe because LiBH4 and BH3 have different mechanisms, leading to different stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material dictates the configuration of the product, regardless of the reducing agent.

Hmm. Another thought: the product's configuration is determined by the starting material's configuration because the reduction leads to the same configuration if the reagent's approach is the same.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 might approach differently, leading to different configurations.

Wait, maybe LiBH4 reduces from one face, leading to a certain configuration, and BH3 from the other, leading to the opposite.

Wait, that could be the case. For example, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride can attack from either the top or the bottom, leading to different configurations.

But in this case, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an ester, and the product is a ketone. So, the reduction of an ester to a ketone.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that works.

Another angle: the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone). Upon reduction, it would form a diol. But the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again. The options suggest that A and B are either (R) or (S) of the same compound. So, which pair would, when reduced with different reagents, give the products with R and S configurations.

Option D has A as R and B as S. So, if A (R) is treated with LiBH4 and gives (R), and B (S) is treated with BH3 and gives (S), that would make sense if the reducing agents do not change the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the configuration to invert, so that A (R) with LiBH4 gives S, but that's not matching the question.

Wait, the question states that A gives R when treated with LiBH4, and B gives S when treated with BH3.

So, the starting material A leads to R, and starting material B leads to S.

Looking at the options, the options have A and B as either same or different.

Option D says A is R and B is S. So, if A (R) gives R, and B (S) gives S, that would require the same configuration in the product as the starting material.

Alternatively, if A (R) gives R, and B (S) gives S, that would suggest that the configuration is retained in both cases. So the reagents don't affect the configuration.

But I don't know for sure.

Wait, considering that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and BH3 is a weaker one, perhaps LiBH4 leads to a different stereochemical outcome.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and upon reduction, the ring is broken, but another ring is formed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a cyclic ketone via a Aldol-like condensation.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. When reduced, the ester is converted to a CH2OH group, and the ketone is converted to a CH2 group, leading to a five-membered ring.

Wait, for example:

RCO-COOR' → RCH2-COOR' after reduction. But that doesn't form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, so RCO-COOR'. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes RCH2- and the ester becomes RCH2-OH. But again, not forming a ring.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. I think I need to make an educated guess.

The correct answer is likely option D. Because the product from A is R and from B is S, the starting materials must have been enantiomers. So, since A is treated with a different reagent than B, and gives an R product, and B gives S, the starting materials must have been R and S, so that the same configuration is retained. Wait, but why would that be the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the configuration to invert. So if A is R, and the reagent causes inversion, the product would be S. But that contradicts the question, which says A gives R.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is a chiral center that, upon reduction, leads to the product's configuration being the same as the starting material. So, if the starting material is R, the product is R, and if the starting material is S, the product is S. That would mean that the reagents don't affect the configuration, and the starting materials A and B are R and S respectively. So, looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S, which would fit.

So, the answer would be option D.


The problem involves two reactions where compounds A and B are treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, respectively, to produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The task is to determine the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent.

2. **Reducing Agents**: 
   - **LiBH4** is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces carbonyl groups to alcohols or other derivatives.
   - **BH3** is a milder reducing agent, often used for selective reductions. The stereochemical outcome of the reduction may differ between the two agents.

3. **Starting Material**: The starting materials are specified as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. These compounds are enantiomers, differing in the configuration of their chiral center.

4. **Stereochemical Relationship**: 
   - When A is treated with LiBH4, the product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - When B is treated with BH3, the product is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
   - This suggests that the configuration of the starting material directly influences the stereochemistry of the product. If A is (R), it produces the (R)-enantiomer of the product, and if B is (S), it produces the (S)-enantiomer.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This would result in both products being (S), which contradicts the given (R) and (S) products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. This would result in both products being (R), which also contradicts the given (R) and (S) products.
   - **Option C**: A is (S) and B is (R). This would result in the products being (S) and (R), respectively, which matches the given products.
   - **Option D**: A is (R) and B is (S). This would result in the products being (R) and (S), respectively, which also matches the given products.

6. **Conclusion**: Both options C and D are consistent with the stereochemical outcomes of the products. However, the problem specifies that A is treated with LiBH4 and B with BH3. Since the stereochemical relationship between the starting material and the product is direct, the correct pairing of starting materials is A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

ANSWER: D
