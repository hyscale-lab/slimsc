Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the substituents on the benzene ring. The positions are numbered as 1, 2, 3. So position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3 in a meta or ortho arrangement? Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering depends on the substituents' priority.

Wait, the substituents' priority for numbering in IUPAC nomenclature is based on the order of functional groups. Let me recall: the highest priority group gets the lowest number. The functional groups in the molecule are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The order of priority is usually based on the substituent with the highest priority, which is the nitro group, then perhaps the ethoxy, then the tert-butyl. Wait, no, the priority order is based on the substituent's functional group type. Nitro is a strong activating group? No, wait, nitro is a meta director because it's a strong deactivating group. But for numbering, the priority is based on the substituent's seniority according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.

The substituents are:

- tert-butyl (an alkyl group)
- ethoxy (an ether group)
- nitro (NO2)

In terms of functional groups, the nitro group is a meta director and is a high-priority substituent. The ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para director) and is a substituent as well. The tert-butyl is an alkyl group, so less priority than the ether, I think.

Wait, but for numbering, the first substituent gets the lowest number, so the group with the highest priority gets the lowest number. So which has the highest priority?

Looking at the substituents:

Nitro (NO2) is a substituent of higher priority than ethoxy (OEt), which is higher than alkyl groups like tert-butyl. So the nitro group will get the first position (lowest number) in the numbering.

Wait, but the target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So according to that name, the nitro is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, and tert-butyl in 2.

Wait, that doesn't align with the priority determined earlier. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, 3. The substituents are ethoxy (OEt) at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, but the numbering starts at the first substituent, but according to IUPAC rules, the numbering should start at the substituent with
