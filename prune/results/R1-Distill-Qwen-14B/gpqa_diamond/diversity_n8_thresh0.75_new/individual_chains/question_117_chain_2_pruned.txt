Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, specifically enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and can cause plane-polarized light to rotate. They only occur in compounds that have chiral centers.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A to D. Let me go through each one by one.

First, let's recall what a chiral center is. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has at least one chiral center and isn't symmetrical, it can have enantiomers, thus showing optical isomerism.

So looking at the first compound: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I think biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but if the substituents are in such positions, does that create any chiral centers?

Wait, the structure is dimethyl ester. So each of the 2 positions on the biphenyl has a carboxylate ester group (O-CO-OCH3). And each 6 position has a nitro group (NO2). So each benzene ring has two substituents: at 2 and 6. But wait, the main thing is if any of the carbons in the molecule are chiral.

I think the central carbon where the two benzene rings are connected is a single bond between the two rings. But that carbon is connected to two benzene rings. Are the substituents on that carbon making it a chiral center? Wait, the central carbon (if it's the point where the two rings are connected) would have two phenyl groups attached. So, for example, the structure is like Ph-Ph, where each Ph is a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, the substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each ring. So each ring is attached at position 1 to the central carbon. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. But the central carbon is bonded to two benzene rings and possibly other groups. Wait, no, the central carbon is only bonded to two benzene rings (since it's a single bond between the two rings).
