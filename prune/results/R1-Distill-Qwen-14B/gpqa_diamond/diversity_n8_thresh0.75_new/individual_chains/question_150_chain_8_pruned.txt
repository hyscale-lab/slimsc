Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, molecular formula analysis. Let me see: the degrees of unsaturation can tell me about rings and double bonds. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for a hydrocarbon is CnH2n+2. So, for n=8, it would be C8H18. But this has 9 H less 18 is 9, so 9 H missing. Each degree of unsaturation (DOU) accounts for 2 H. So, 9 H missing is (18-9)=9, so 9/2 is 4.5. Wait, that can't be right because DOU has to be an integer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X is 0 here, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That makes sense. So 5 could be a ring and some double bonds or rings and triple bonds. But more likely, benzene rings and maybe an ester or amide group.

Looking at the NMR data: 

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet around 9.7, which usually suggests an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, and if it's a triplet, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group.

6.98 (d, 2H) – aromatic protons. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. Or maybe a meta, but the doublet suggests two protons in a coupling pattern.

6.51 (d, 2H) – another set of aromatic protons, maybe adjacent to the substituents.

6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, possibly an -OH group, but wait, the integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe vinyl protons or something deshielded. But a broad peak could be OH, but two protons? Hmm.

3.66 (d, 2H) – a doublet, probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe OCH2 or something similar.

Putting this together. The aldehyde (9.72) suggests an aldehyde group. The aromatic signals at 6.98 and 6.51 could be from two different aromatic rings. Wait, but each has 2H. So maybe two para-substituted phenyl groups. Let me think: for a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually split into two doublets. So in the NMR, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) could be two para-substituted aromatic rings, but maybe in a conjugated system.

Wait, another possibility is that the 6.98 and 6.51 are from a single ring, perhaps a substituent causing the splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ring. But the integration is 2H each, so maybe two separate rings, each with two protons. Hmm.

The 6.27 (bs, 2H) is a bit puzzling. Could it be an enol proton, or perhaps an -OCH group? Or maybe adjacent to an oxygen? Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a conjugated system. Like a benzaldehyde with an adjacent substituent. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Oh! Because then you have the aldehyde, then double bond, and then perhaps other groups.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – that's a
