Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's break it down.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation of atoms follows the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The Boltzmann distribution formula is something like (n_i/n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations of two energy levels. Here, E_i is higher than E_j, so E_i - E_j is positive. 

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, no, actually, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, I think the ratio of excitation levels is n1/n2 = 2, where n1 is for star_1 and n2 for star_2. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, no, the wording is a bit tricky. It says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so the population in the excited state is higher. So the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher. So for each star, the iron atoms have a certain distribution. So for star 1, n1_upper / n1_lower = something, and for star 2, n2_upper / n2_lower = something else.

But the question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as populated as in star_2. So the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, the way it's phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So maybe the relative excitation for star_1 is higher. So the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. 

Wait, but I think the problem is comparing the excitation level between the
