Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice physics question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of a star where photosynthesis happens, or wait, no, photosphere is the outermost layer where light is emitted. And they're in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that the gas is interacting with radiation in such a way that the small volume can be considered to be in equilibrium. So, each region is emitting and absorbing radiation as if it's a blackbody at a certain temperature.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's maybe related to the Boltzmann constant? Because the Boltzmann constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, right! k equals 1.380649e-23 J/K. So the energy difference given is exactly k*T, where T is some temperature. Hmm, but wait, the energy difference ΔE between two levels is given by E = k*T. So ΔE = k*T. Oh, but wait, I think it's actually ΔE = k*T multiplied by some factor, maybe involving the excitation.

Wait, the excitation here refers to the population of atoms in higher energy levels. The excitation is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So the number of atoms in the excited state is higher in star_1. The ratio of the populations is 2:1 for star_1 to star_2.

In LTE, the distribution of particles in energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (n2)/(n1) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, n2 is the higher level, and n1 is the lower.

But wait, in this case, the question says star_1 has twice as excited atoms as star_2. So n1_excited / n2_excited = 2. Or is it the ratio of the excited states to the ground state? Hmm, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." Wait, specific
