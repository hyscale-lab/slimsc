Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I think adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? Like, it's a polycyclic structure, maybe a fused diamond structure. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions, probably on adjacent or diagonal carbons. 

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and heating usually suggests an elimination reaction. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination. But wait, elimination typically forms an alkene. But given the product is a light yellow solid, which might indicate some kind of epoxide? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product 1 probably has a ketone group.

So, if we have a structure with two bromines, heating with KOH could cause dehydrohalogenation. But wait, if two adjacent bromines are eliminated, that would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. But alternatively, if KOH is used in a context where it could form an epoxide, but 1720 suggests a ketone.

Wait, let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH could lead to the formation of an epoxide? No, wait, epoxide formation usually involves two adjacent bromines, but 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely to have a ketone. Wait, another possibility: it could be a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe each Br is on a different carbon, and elimination forms a ring. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form a diketone? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and eliminating HBr from each would form a bridge. Hmm, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, looking at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, 4.79 ppm is probably a CH₂ group with some deshielding, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. The 1.94 (2H) is maybe a CH₂ that's part of a ring, perhaps connected to the oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is a bunch of CH₂ or CH groups, probably in a ring structure, maybe adamantane derivatives.

Wait, considering IR at 1720 cm⁻¹, that's a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is likely an epoxide? No, wait, epoxide's carbonyl is around 1200-1250 cm⁻¹, but maybe more like 1720 is a ketone. So, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon elimination with KOH forms 1,3-adamantanone? Or another ketone.

Wait, but elimination of two HBr would form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a neighboring group participation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, wait, another thought: when you have a dihalide and eliminate, you form a double bond. But in this case, the product is a ketone, which suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps the initial dihalide is on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond, but somehow that isn't the case. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is such that elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is similar to bicyclo structures. Let me think about adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a bicyclo[3.3.1]decane, I think. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of that structure. So, when KOH is added and heated, perhaps the Brs are eliminated as HBr, and the double bond forms. But given the IR of product 1 is 1720, which is a ketone. So maybe each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination leads to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, bridgehead elimination. Oh! Bridgehead elimination is a reaction where a dihalide on a bridgehead undergoes elimination to form a double bond and a carbonyl group. So, for example, if you have a dihalide on two bridgehead carbons, elimination can lead to a conjugated diene, or perhaps a ket
