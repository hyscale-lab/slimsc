Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember from my studies that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts, especially for partial waves.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves. The general formula I think is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^infty (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ), where k is the wave number, δ_l are the phase shifts for each l, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Oh right, and for the forward direction, θ is 0 degrees.

But wait, the question asks specifically for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0. So I need to find the imaginary part of f(0).

Hmm, what's f(0) in terms of the phase shifts? Let me think. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l, right? Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So each term becomes (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l * 1.

So f(0) = sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l / k.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary part. So I need to compute Im(f(0)).

Let me think about how to separate the real and imaginary parts. Each term in the sum is (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l / k. Let me write e^{2iδ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So the term becomes (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) ] * sinδ_l /k.

So when I multiply this out, each term is (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) sinδ_l + i sin(2δ_l) sinδ_l ] / k.

The imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) sinδ_l /k.

Wait a second, but sin(2δ_l) is 2 sinδ_l cosδ_l. So substituting that in
