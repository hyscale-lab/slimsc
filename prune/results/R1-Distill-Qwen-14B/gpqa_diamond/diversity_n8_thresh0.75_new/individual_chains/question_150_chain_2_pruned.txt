Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to determine the final product from the given options.

First, I'll try to analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound.

The NMR spectrum shows the following peaks:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift. Triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. High shift often indicates an aldehyde proton, but wait, that's usually around 9-10 ppm. Aldehydes are deshielded. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton in a strongly deshielded environment, but that seems less likely. Hmm, but sometimes, it could also be an acidic proton like in a phenol, but phenol protons are usually around 5 ppm. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. Let's keep that in mind.

- 6.98 ppm: doublet with 2H. Aromatic region. Doublet suggests coupling with one adjacent proton. Maybe two equivalent aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted ring.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet with 2H. This might be adjacent to the previous set. Maybe this is a meta coupling, or perhaps another set of equivalent aromatic protons.

- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet with 2H. Broad suggests exchange with something else, maybe an acidic proton. Wait, but 2H as a singlet... Could this be an aromatic ring with two protons that are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons? Or perhaps some kind of conjugated diene? Alternatively, maybe it's an enol proton. Or perhaps an alpha proton to a carbonyl group, but that's usually more deshielded.

- 3.66 ppm: doublet with 2H. This is in the range for OCH2 groups, perhaps. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2 or something similar. Alternatively, maybe a CH2 connected to another CH2, but in a specific environment.

Putting this together, let's think about possible structures.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees: could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an amine (or nitrile, but more likely an amine here since we have O and N). Wait, but the molecular formula has O and N, but the starting compound's structure is unclear.

Wait, the reagents are: first NaNO2 and HCl, which is usually for diazotization. Then H2O, maybe hydrolysis? Then aqueous KOH and heat, which
