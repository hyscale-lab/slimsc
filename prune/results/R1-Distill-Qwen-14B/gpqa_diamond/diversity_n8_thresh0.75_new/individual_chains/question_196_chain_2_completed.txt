Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options given have various expressions involving c, the speed of light, so relativistic effects must be in play here.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy (which is (1/2)mv²) would be equal to that. Solving for v gives v = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so we have to consider relativistic effects. So option C is probably not the right answer here.

In relativity, we know that as an object's speed approaches the speed of light, its relativistic mass increases. The relativistic mass is given by gamma times the rest mass, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to incorporate this into the equations.

The potential energy in the relativistic harmonic oscillator probably isn't just (1/2)kA². Wait, in a relativistic context, maybe the potential energy is different. Or perhaps the equation of motion changes. Let's think about the energy.

In a classical oscillator, the total mechanical energy is constant and is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy E would be (gamma -1)mc² + U, where U is the potential energy.

But wait, the potential energy U for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². So in the maximum displacement, x = A, so the potential energy is (1/2)kA². At that point, the kinetic energy is zero, so E = (1/2)kA².

But wait, when the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So at x=0, the kinetic energy is E, which in this case is (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, no. Let me re-express that. The total energy is (gamma)mc², but in the oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach this more systematically.

In the non-relativistic case, the energy is E = (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². So v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But in relativity, the energy is higher because of gamma.

Wait, when the oscillator is at the maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2) k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy is E = (1/2) k A². But when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So in that case, (gamma -1) mc² = E = (1/2) k A². So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c²). Let me square both sides to get 1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Wait, that might not be the case. Because when you solve for gamma, it's 1/sqrt(...). Let me write it more clearly.

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

But gamma is also equal to 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So, 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²}) ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2}.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, say, alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Then, gamma = 1 + alpha.

So,

1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha

=> sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha)

=> 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2

=> v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2

Now, let's compute 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

1/(1 + alpha)^2 = [1/(1 + alpha)]^2.

Wait, perhaps we can write this as:

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ] 

= c^2 [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ (1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 -1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

= c^2 [ (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

But since alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), which could be small if the amplitude isn't too large, but not necessarily. Hmm, perhaps there's a better way to express this.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator. 2 alpha + alpha^2 = alpha (2 + alpha). But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, since alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), which is a dimensionless quantity. Let me plug that back in.

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (2 alpha + alpha^2) ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

But perhaps it's better to express this as:

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

Wait, because 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 minus 1 is 2 alpha + alpha². So, 2 alpha + alpha² = (1 + alpha)^2 - 1.

So,

v² = c² [ ( (1 + alpha)^2 -1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ]

= c² [ 1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2 ]

Which brings us back.

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 )

But let's express alpha in terms of k, A, m, c.

alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

1 + alpha = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see.

Option D: v_max= c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Wait, wait. Let me compute 1/(1 + alpha)^2. That's 1/( [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)] )^2.

So, 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 is 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

So, v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Which is exactly option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B: v_max= c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, that's not what we have. Our expression has 1 - [1/(1 + ...)^2], not 1 + something.

Option A: c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))² )

Wait, denominator is (1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2, but that might not be correct because in the denominator, in our case, it's (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2.

Option D seems to match.

Wait, but another approach. Another way to think about it is energy. The total energy E is (1/2) k A². But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So,

E = (gamma -1 ) mc² = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²) )

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as before.

Then, we can rearrange to find v.

So, the conclusion is that option D is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Let me compute the square in the denominator.

Another approach: let me square both sides.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) ]^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/ [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) ]^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ 1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ))^2 ]

Which is the same as,

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ))^2 ]

So,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2) ) )² )

Which matches option D.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must account for relativistic effects. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. 

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) is given by:

\[
E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the total energy is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, so:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we equate:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( 1 - v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we get:

\[
v^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2} \right).
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they either do not account for relativistic effects properly or misrepresent the relationship between the variables.

**Answer: D**
