Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I don't know if the mass plays a role here. Maybe it's a red herring, but I'll keep it in mind just in case.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which I think is standard for stellar spectroscopy. The given values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:

- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. Oh right, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant than Y compared to the Sun.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (nSi_1 / nSi_2) or (nSi_2 / nSi_1)? Wait, the wording says "ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2." So that's nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Hmm. Let's break it down.

For each star, I'll need to find the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen, then take the ratio between the two stars.

Starting with Star_1:

We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) = 0.

Which means log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

So the iron abundance in Star_1 is the same as the Sun. Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

Wait, let me think again. The definition is [X/Y] = log10(nX / nY) − log10(nX/nY)_sun. So:

[Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi
