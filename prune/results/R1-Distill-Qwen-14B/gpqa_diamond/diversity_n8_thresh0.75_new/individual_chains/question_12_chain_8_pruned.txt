Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with particle physics yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: Find the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Here, the Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D with various values.

Hmm, right. So this is a decay process where a pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, their energies and momenta are related through conservation laws—specifically, conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but wait, the neutrino has very little mass, right? I think for the sake of these problems, sometimes the neutrino is considered massless. But I'm not entirely sure. Oh, but wait, the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, which is given. So, when the pion (mass 139.6) is at rest, it decays into a muon and a neutrino. The neutrino's mass is negligible, so we can treat it as zero for this calculation.

So, let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the total momentum must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu.

But the neutrino is massless, so its energy is equal to its momentum times c (but since we're using MeV and such, maybe we can ignore the c, treating it as units where c=1). So E_nu = p_nu * c. Since c=1 in these units, E_nu = p_nu.

Wait, but in any case, for the muon, E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. Because that's the energy-momentum relation. But since p_mu = p_nu, and E_nu = p_nu, we can write E_mu^2 = (E_nu)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2.

But wait, maybe it's easier to consider the conservation of energy and momentum together.

The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

The final energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino: E_final = E_mu + E_nu.

Since energy is conserved, E_initial = E_final: 139.6 = E_mu + E_nu.

Also, from momentum conservation, the momenta are equal and opposite, so p_mu = p_nu = p.

But for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). For the neutrino, since its mass is zero, E_nu = p c. So let's set c=1 for units.

So, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²), and E_nu = p.

Substituting E_nu = p into the energy conservation equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

Hmm, that's an equation in one variable, p. Let me write that down:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now, I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Left side squared: p² + (105.7)^2.

Right side squared: (139.6 - p)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p².

So,

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

The p² terms cancel out.

So,

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p.

I can rearrange:

2 * 139.6 p = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Compute the right-hand side. Let's calculate that.

First, compute (139.6)^2.

139.6 * 139.6: Let me calculate that.

139^2 is 19321. 0.6^2 is 0.36. The cross term is 2*139*0.6 = 166.8. So,

139.6^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19321 + 166.8 is 19487.8, plus 0.36 is 19488.16 MeV².

Now 105.7^2: Let's compute that.

105^2 = 11025. 0.7^2 = 0.49. The cross term is 2*105*0.7=147.

So (105.7)^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11025+147=11172, plus 0.49 is 11172.49.

So,

(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = Let's subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
= 8315.67.

So,

2*139.6*p =8315.67

2*139.6 is 279.2.

So,

p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 × 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 29.8? Let's see: 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can approximate. Alternatively, maybe compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do that division:

279.2 into 8315.67.

First, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.
