Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. It says, "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed." The options are A, B, C, and D, with some values in kcal and kJ.

Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization usually involves an acid and a base reacting to form water. The enthalpy change is typically around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases. But wait, in this case, there are two acids and one base. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So this is a reaction between two acids and a base. But how do they react? I guess the base will react with both acids. Or maybe the reaction is more complex.

Let me break down the problem. I need to find the moles of each substance first. So, moles = concentration (M) * volume (L). 

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole can give two H+ ions. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and is diprotic. Each mole releases two OH- ions. So OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait a minute, so when these are mixed, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

The total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the reaction will proceed until either H+ or OH- is exhausted. Which one is in less quantity here? OH- is 0.2 moles, H+ is 0.28, so OH- is the limiting reagent.

So the reaction will consume 0.2 moles of OH- and 0.2 moles of H+.

The remaining H+ will be 0.08 moles (0.28-0.2). These will remain in solution, but since the problem is about neutralization, probably only the reaction up to the limiting reagent counts.

Wait, but what about the excess H+? No, because the neutralization is about the reaction between acid and base, so only the OH- part matters.

Wait, but let me think about the neutralization reaction. Each mole of OH- reacts with a mole of H+ to form water.

So the moles of water formed in neutralization are 0.2 moles, each releasing energy. So the enthalpy change depends on the
