Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, making them non-superimposable mirror images. So, each compound in the list needs to be checked for any chiral centers or other forms of stereoisomerism.

The question lists four organic moieties, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. The first one is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds can sometimes have stereoisomerism because the two phenyl rings can rotate relative to each other. But wait, in this case, the substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', and the carboxylate esters are at 2 and 2'. So, the substituents are all in the para positions. Now, if there are substituents on both rings, can the biphenyl have a plane of symmetry? I think that when the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetrical, like para, they might not lead to stereoisomerism. But wait, if the substituents are such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then there could be cis and trans isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl has a single bond between the two rings, allowing rotation. Oh wait, noâ€”biphenyls can have restricted rotation in some cases, leading to possible stereoisomerism. So, if the substituents are in positions that allow for different configurations, like if the two rings are connected but their substituents are arranged differently, then there's a possibility of cis or trans isomerism. If the molecule has such substituents that it can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral. Let me think about this. The substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, so each ring has a carboxylate and a nitro group. Wait, but the 2 and 6 positions on each ring are where the substituents are. The numbering is a bit tricky. So, for each ring, position 2 is adjacent to the connecting bond. The 6 would be across from that. So, the substituents on
