Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a' from the given options.

Hmm, right, so in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding the particle at a certain position. The probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of the modulus squared over that region. Since all particles are found between x=1 and x=3, the probability of finding them outside this region must be zero. So the integral of the wave function from x= -infty to 1 and from 3 to +infty should be zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, I see, because it's a complex function. So to find the probability, we take the modulus squared, which would be |ψ|².

The modulus squared of a complex number (a + bi) is a² + b². So for ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, the modulus squared is (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2.

But wait, integrating this modulus squared from x=1 to x=3 should give the total probability of 1 because all the particles are found in that region. Alternatively, the integral of |ψ|² from all space should equal 1. But since the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, the integral from 1 to 3 is 1.

Wait, no, the way the problem is phrased is that when they measure, none are found outside 1 and 3. So that implies that the wave function must be zero outside that interval because the probability is zero there. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, that doesn't look like it's zero outside 1 to 3. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps
