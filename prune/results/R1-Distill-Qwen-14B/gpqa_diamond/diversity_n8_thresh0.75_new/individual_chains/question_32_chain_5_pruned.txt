Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativistic energies. But I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is asking for the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay, Li usually has 3 protons because it's lithium, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons total. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, the options are in GeV, so I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the total energy isn't just kinetic; it includes the rest mass energy. Oh wait, no, wait—actually, the question is about the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Or maybe the total energy? Hmm, I might get confused here. Let me think.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. In colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes they talk about total energy. I think the problem is asking for the total energy because the options are specific. Let me proceed and see
