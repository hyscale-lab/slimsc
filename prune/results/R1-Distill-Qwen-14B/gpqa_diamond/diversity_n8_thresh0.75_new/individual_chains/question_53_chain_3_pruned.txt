Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, so I know there's an ester functional group present. Esters typically have carbonyl groups (C=O), and in IR, that's usually around 1700 cm⁻¹. So that's a clue.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Two for aromatic H, two for vinyl H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets), and two for CH3 groups. No CH2 signals. Hmmm.

So, the aromatic ring has two substituents. Since it's di-substituted, the ring might have two groups attached, which could be ester groups or one ester and another group.

Wait, but the ester group is a carbonyl, so it's likely that one substituent is an ester. Let's think about the structure. Maybe the benzene ring has an ester group and another substituent, which could be a vinyl group or another ester.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets or other multiplets because of coupling with adjacent protons. So, perhaps there's a vinyl group (like a CH₂=CH– group) attached to the ring. But wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. That might suggest a more complex splitting, like maybe a trans coupling or some other arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted ester. For example, if the ester is connected to a vinyl group or a branch. Let's think about the structure.

So, considering the substituents on the benzene ring: one is an ester group, and the other could be something else that has vinyl or CH3 groups.

Wait, the NMR says two CH3 signals. So two different methyl groups. Maybe each is attached to a different part of the molecule, like two different ester groups or one ester and another group with methyls.

Wait, but the IR shows an ester. Esters have the structure R-O-CO-R'. So, perhaps the molecule has an ester group and another substituent. Let's consider the structure.

Let me think about possible structures. Let
