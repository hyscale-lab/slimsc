Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about identifying a compound from its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, no, that's for haloforms. Oh wait, maybe it's for the dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions? Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, I think red phosphorus and HI are used to convert alcohols to alkyl halides, especially in the presence of an acid. Or maybe it's for dehydrohalogenation. Wait, no, maybe it's related to the Clemmensen reduction? Oh wait, no, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat for ketones to alkanes. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, when an alcohol reacts with HI, it's typically an SN1 or SN2 substitution. Red phosphorus is sometimes used to help in the conversion of alcohols to iodides, especially in the presence of HI. So perhaps the reaction is converting an -OH group to an -I.

So the initial step is to figure out what compound X is by looking at the spectral data.

Let's look at the IR data first. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which is a broad region that might indicate O-H stretches, like from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong absorption, which could be a carbonyl group. 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching.

So possible functional groups here: an alcohol (if O-H is present) or a carboxylic acid (since they have O-H as well). The 1720 cm⁻¹ could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H in IR, and the carbonyl is around 1700 cm⁻¹. Or if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720-1760 cm⁻¹. But here, the IR also has a broad region, which could suggest OH (like carbox
