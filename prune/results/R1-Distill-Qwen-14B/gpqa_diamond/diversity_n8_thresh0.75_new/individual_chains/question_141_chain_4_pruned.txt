Okay, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. So the question is about 1-bromobenzene-2-d being treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Wait, but wait, what's the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, that's bromobenzene with a deuterium attached. Wait, no, wait. 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have a bromine on position 1 and a deuterium on position 2. So the molecule is bromobenzene with a D (deuterium) at the ortho position relative to Br.

So the reaction is with a strong base, NaNH2, in ammonia. I think this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, possibly leading to elimination. But wait, wait, bromobenzene is an aromatic compound. Elimination usually requires adjacent H and X, like in alkenes. But in aromatic rings, the substituents are on the ring. Oh, wait, but in this case, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because benzene is already a conjugated ring. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but wait, bromobenzene is typically unreactive under such conditions unless there are activating groups.

Wait, but wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Oh, maybe it's an elimination where the Br is removed, and a double bond forms. But wait, benzene is aromatic and doesn't typically form alkenes because that's not possible due to the aromaticity. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe this is a substitution reaction where the Br is replaced by something else. But in this case, the solvent is ammonia. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution where the amide ion (NH2-) acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, but for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the aromatic ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Bromobenzene is deactivated because Br is an electron-withdrawing group. So normally, nucleophilic substitution on bromobenzene doesn't happen under ordinary conditions. Unless there are strong activating groups, but in this case, the ring is brominated and deuterated. Wait, but the deuterium is in the ortho position. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene
