--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is about finding the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest, so I guess higher l values beyond l=4 don't contribute here. The electrons are 50 MeV, but I'm not sure if that's relevant for the calculation they're asking for.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. The formula for f(θ) in terms of partial waves is something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ] Pl(cosθ)

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Oh right, because each partial wave contributes to the amplitude. Also, for the scattering amplitude, the imaginary part might be related to the cross-section or something else.

Wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. The incident direction would be θ=0°, I think. Because that's when the scattered particle is moving in the same direction as the incident beam.

So when θ=0, cosθ=1. So Pl(cosθ) becomes Pl(1). But Pl(1) is 1 for all l, because the Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are all 1. So for each term, Pl(cos0) = 1.

So the scattering amplitude f(0) would be (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ]

Wait no, e^{i δ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So when you expand that, and multiply by sin δ_l, which is the imaginary part?

Wait, let me think. Actually, the expression for f(θ) in terms of the phase shifts is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l + 1) ( e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ) ] Pl(cosθ)

Wait, because e^{i δ_l} = (1 + i tan δ_l) / sqrt(1 + tan² δ_l), but maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, I remember that the real and imaginary parts of f can be written using the phase shifts.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude f can be written as:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ] Pl(cosθ)

Wait, perhaps. Because when you have e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, and you have terms like e^{i δ_l} - 1. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing formulas.

Wait, another formula comes to mind: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by (1/(2k)) * sum over l of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l). Or something like that. Wait, I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) ( sin δ_l ) e^{i δ_l} Pl(cosθ) ]

But wait, since e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, so when you multiply by sin δ_l, that gives (cos δ_l sin δ_l) + i (sin² δ_l). So the imaginary part of each term is (sin² δ_l), multiplied by (2l+1) Pl(1), which is (2l+1)(1) for l=0, and something else for higher l.

Wait, but Pl(1) is 1 for all l. So for each term, the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So the total imaginary part of f(0) would be (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Because f(θ) is a complex quantity, and the imaginary part would be the sum of the imaginary contributions from each term.

So if f(θ) = real part + i * imaginary part. So yes, for each partial wave, the contribution to the imaginary part comes from the (e^{i δ_l} - 1) term? Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with the formula for f.

Wait, another approach. The scattering amplitude f can be written as:

f(s,θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] Pl(cosθ)

Where s is the squared energy, but here we're considering θ=0, so cosθ=1.

So at θ=0, f(0) is (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] * Pl(1).

But Pl(1)=1 for all l, so:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ]

Now, let's compute the imaginary part of f(0). Let me compute [e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ]:

e^{2i δ_l} = cos(2 δ_l) + i sin(2 δ_l)

So e^{2i δ_l} - 1 = [cos(2 δ_l) - 1] + i [sin(2 δ_l)]

Then, (1/(2ik)) multiplied by this is:

(1/(2ik)) [ [cos(2δ_l) -1 ] + i sin(2δ_l) ]

Let me separate into real and imaginary parts:

= [ (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) / (2ik) ) ] + [ i sin(2δ_l) / (2ik) ) ]

Simplify the imaginary part first. The second term:

i sin(2δ_l) / (2ik) = [ sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k )

Because i/i=1, and 1/k remains. So this term is real.

The first term is [ (cos 2δ_l -1) ] / (2ik ), which is imaginary. Because 1/(ik) = -i/k.

Wait, let's compute:

1/(2ik) = -i/(2k)

So [ (cos 2δ_l -1) ] * (-i/(2k) ) = [1 - cos 2δ_l ] * i/(2k )

So the entire f(0) has an imaginary part from the first term, and a real part from the second term.

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is [1 - cos(2 δ_l)] / (2k )

Wait, because the first term's coefficient is [ (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) ] * (-i/(2k) ), which is i [ (1 - cos 2δ_l) ) ]/(2k). So the imaginary part is [ (1 - cos 2δ_l) ) ]/(2k )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) [1 - cos(2 δ_l) ]

Alternatively, using the identity 1 - cos(2θ) = 2 sin²θ, so this becomes (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) 2 sin²(δ_l) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin²(δ_l)

Ah, so that's the same conclusion I reached earlier: Im(f(0)) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So then, the question is to compute this sum for l=0 to l=4, using the given δ's.

Wait, but what is k? Because the formula involves k, the wave number. The electrons have energy 50 MeV, but I need to compute k in appropriate units.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So, the relation between energy E and wave number k is E = ħ² k²/(2m). Wait, but wait, the energy here is given as 50 MeV, but electrons have rest mass energy of about 0.511 MeV. So E is much larger than m c², so we can treat it as a relativistic electron, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, but in scattering problems, the wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Alternatively, for high energies, E ≈ (ħ c k)^2 / (2 m c²) ) ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute k using the relativistic expression. The total energy of the electron is E = γ m c². The momentum is p = γ m v, and with v ≈ c for high energies, p ≈ γ m c.

In terms of the Compton wavelength, but perhaps I should just use the relation E = p² c²/(2m c²) + m c². But for high energies, m c² is negligible compared to E. So E ≈ p² c²/(2m c²) → p^2 ≈ 2 m E c^2.

Wait, but ħ is in units of MeV fm, so let me compute k as p / ħ.

Wait, wait, no. The wave number k is related to the momentum p by k = p/(ħ c) * c, or perhaps not. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

The correct relation is that the wave vector k is given by k = p/(ħ), but wait, actually, in natural units where ħ=1 and c=1, the momentum p is equal to k. But when you're using units where ħ and c are not 1, you have to be careful.

Wait, let's get back to the basics. The wave number k is k = p/(ħ c), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since E = p c for relativistic particles (when E >> m c²), so E = p c → p = E/(c).

Then, k = p/(ħ) → E/(c ħ) ?

Wait, but for an electron, the non-relativistic formula is E = p²/(2m), but when E is much larger than m c², the non-relativistic formula isn't valid. So perhaps it's better to use the relativistic expression.

But maybe for the purposes of this problem, we can assume that k is approximately sqrt(2 m E)/ħ. Let me check the units.

Wait, 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. The mass of an electron is about 9.1e-31 kg. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.055e-34 J s. 50 MeV is 50e6 * 1.6e-13 J ≈ 8e-7 J.

So E = 50 MeV = 8e-7 J.

So k = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ.

Compute 2 m E: 2 * 9.1e-31 kg * 8e-7 J = 1.456e-37 kg J.

Then sqrt(1.456e-37) ≈ 1.206e-18 kg sqrt(J).

Wait, but J is kg m²/s², so sqrt(J) is kg^(1/2) m/s.

So sqrt(2 m E) has units kg^(1/2) m/s.

Divide by ħ, which is J s = kg m²/s.

So, (kg^(1/2) m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) = (1/ (sqrt(kg) m ) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled in units. Maybe it's easier to use the relation in terms of MeV and fm.

I recall that the wave number k for an electron with energy E (in MeV) can be approximated as k ≈ 0.1973 * sqrt(E) / (ħ c) )? Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the formula for the Compton wavelength.

Wait, the Compton wavelength is λ = ħ/(m c), which for the electron is about 2.426e-12 m, which is 2.426 fm. So 1/ k = λ → k = 1/(2.426e-15 m) ≈ 4.12e14 m⁻¹. But wait, that's for rest mass energy, which is about 0.511 MeV.

Alternatively, the Compton wavelength can be written as λ = (ħ c)/(E) ) * (1/(1 + (E/(m c²)) )^(1/2) ). Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula k = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ. Let's compute that numerically.

m = 9.109e-31 kg

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.6e-13 J = 8e-7 J.

So 2 m E = 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8e-7 J = 1.457e-37 kg J.

Wait, sqrt(2 m E) = sqrt(1.457e-37) ≈ 1.207e-18 sqrt(kg J).

But J is kg m²/s², so sqrt(kg J) is sqrt(kg * kg m²/s²) ) = kg^(3/2) m/s.

Wait, perhaps this isn't the best way. Let me think in terms of units where I can express k in inverse femtometers.

Wait, I know that 1 fm is 1e-15 m, and ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

Thus, for an electron with energy E (in MeV), the momentum p is given by E = p c → p = E/(c). But wait, that's only for ultra-relativistic speeds, which 50 MeV electrons are.

So p = E/(c) → but wait, E in MeV, c in units where c=1 in MeV fm? Hmm, perhaps an alternative approach.

Wait, since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, then p (in MeV/c) * ħ c (MeV fm) = p * ħ c = (MeV/c) * (MeV fm) ) → (MeV^2 fm)/(c) → that's not dimensionless, so perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, let's express p in terms of E. For ultra-relativistic particles, E ≈ p c. So p = E / c. But in units where ħ c is in MeV fm, perhaps p can be expressed in terms of E and ħ c.

Wait, knowing that p = E/(c), then k = p / ħ → substituting p from E= p c, we get k = E/(c ħ) → E in MeV, c in appropriate units, and ħ in MeV fm.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try a different approach. Let's compute k in units of inverse femtometers.

We have ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm → so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) → which is (1 fm)/(197.33 MeV).

Now, for a particle with energy E, the momentum p is given by E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). But since E = 50 MeV is much larger than m c^2 (≈0.511 MeV), we can approximate E ≈ p c → p ≈ E/(c).

So p ≈ (50 MeV) / c → but units? Let me see.

Wait, in natural units where ħ=c=1, E (in MeV) equals p (in MeV/c) * c → so p (MeV/c) = E (MeV) / c → but that's abstract. Alternatively, since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm, and p = E/(c) → p (MeV/c) = E (MeV) / c → but in terms of units, perhaps p can be expressed as E (MeV) * (1/c^2) * (c) → not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express k as k = E/(ħ c). Because E in MeV, ħ c in MeV fm → so k would be (E)/(ħ c) → which would have units 1/fm.

So given E=50 MeV, ħ c =197.33 MeV fm → k = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that seems more manageable. So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So now, let's compute the sum.

The sum is over l from 0 to 4.

Each term is (2l+1) sin²(δ_l), where δ_l is given.

So for each l:

l=0: (2*0 +1) =1, sin(90°) =1 → sin²=1 → term=1*1=1.

l=1: 3, δ=67 → sin(67) ≈ 0.9205 → squared ≈ 0.8473 → 3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5, δ=55 → sin(55) ≈0.8192 → squared ≈0.6710 →5*0.671≈3.355.

Wait, wait, sin(55 degrees)= approximately 0.8192. Square is about 0.671. Multiply by 5 gives approx 3.355.

l=3:7, δ=30 → sin(30)=0.5 → squared=0.25 →7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9, δ=13 → sin(13)=approx 0.22495 → squared≈0.05058 →9 *0.05058≈0.455.

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0:1 → sum=1.

l=1: +2.5419 → sum=3.5419.

l=2: +3.355 → sum=6.8969.

l=3: +1.75 → sum=8.6469.

l=4: +0.455 → sum≈9.1019.

So the sum is approximately 9.1019.

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) times this sum. Since k≈0.253 fm⁻¹,

Im(f(0)) = (9.1019) / (0.253) fm.

Compute this: 9.1019 / 0.253.

Let me compute 9.1 / 0.25 → 36.4. 0.253 is a little more than 0.25, so the result will be a bit less than 36.4.

Compute 0.253 × 36 = 9.108 → which is a bit higher than 9.1019. So 36 ×0.253=9.108 → but our numerator is 9.1019, which is 9.108 - 0.0061.

So 36 → 36 - (0.0061/0.253) → ≈ 36 - 0.024 ≈35.976.

But since 0.253 ×35.976 ≈ 9.1019.

So approximately 35.976 fm.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 355.351 fm → that's much larger.

Option C is 177.675 fm.

Option D is 251.271 fm.

Wait, my calculation gives about 35.976 fm. But none of the options are close to that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let's double-check.

Wait, the initial assumption that k = E/(ħ c) → E=50 MeV, ħ c =197.33 MeV fm → k=50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

But wait, perhaps the formula is different. Because for the wave number k, it should be:

k = sqrt( (2 m E) ) / ħ.

Wait, let's compute this properly.

m is the mass of the electron: 9.1093837e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV =50e6 * 1.60218e-13 J = 8.0109e-7 J.

So 2 m E =2 *9.1093837e-31 kg *8.0109e-7 J = 1.458e-37 kg J.

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so 2 m E is 1.458e-37 kg² m²/s².

sqrt(2 m E) = sqrt(1.458e-37) ≈ 1.207e-18 kg m/s.

Wait, because sqrt(kg² m²/s² )=kg m/s.

Then, ħ =1.0545718e-34 J s =1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s.

So k = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ = (1.207e-18 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s) ) → let's compute the division.

(1.207e-18) / (1.0545718e-34) ) → approximately 1.207 / 1.05457 ≈ 1.144 → exponent: 1e16.

So k≈1.144e16 m⁻¹.

Convert to inverse femtometers: 1 m =1e15 fm → 1 m⁻¹=1e-15 fm.

So 1.144e16 m⁻¹ → 1.144e16 *1e-15 fm⁻¹ =11.44 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's a very different number than before. So k≈11.44 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that makes a big difference. So earlier approach was wrong.

So with k=11.44 fm⁻¹, and sum of terms≈9.1019.

So Im(f(0)) = (9.1019) / (11.44) ≈0.795 fm.

Wait, that's even smaller. But none of the options are near 0.8 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Because perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is different.

Wait, going back, perhaps I should re-examine the formula for Im(f(0)).

Earlier, I thought Im(f(0)) = (1/k) * sum( (2l+1) sin² δ_l )

But perhaps I missed a factor of (2) or something else.

Wait, let's go back to the formula for f(θ=0):

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] * Pl(1)

Pl(1)=1, so:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ]

Expanding e^{2i δ_l} -1 = (cos 2δ_l -1) + i sin 2δ_l.

So:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) [ Σ (2l+1)(cos 2δ_l -1) + i Σ (2l+1) sin 2δ_l ]

So the imaginary part of f(0) is [ 1/(2k) ] * Σ (2l+1) sin 2δ_l.

Ah! So I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Not sin² δ_l, but sin(2 δ_l).

So that changes everything. So let's recompute with this in mind.

So the sum is Σ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) for l=0 to 4.

Compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1)=1, δ=90° → 2*90=180°. sin(180)=0 → term=0.

l=1:3, δ=67 → 2*67=134°, sin(134)=approx sin(180-46)=sin(46)=0.7193 → term=3 *0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2:5, δ=55 → 110°. sin(110)=sin(70)=approx 0.9397 → 5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7, δ=30 →60°, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660 →7 *0.866≈6.062.

l=4:9, δ=13 →26°, sin(26)=approx 0.4384 →9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum these terms:

l=0:0 → sum=0.

l=1: +2.1579 → sum=2.1579.

l=2:+4.6985 → sum=6.8564.

l=3:+6.062 → sum=12.9184.

l=4:+3.9456 → sum≈16.864.

So the sum is approximately 16.864.

Then, Im(f(0))= (1/(2k)) * 16.864.

We have k=11.44 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))= (16.864)/(2 *11.44 ) fm → 16.864/(22.88)= approx 0.737 fm.

Wait, that's around 0.737 fm. But the options are way larger, like 177 fm, 355, etc. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, but wait, how did I get k=11.44 fm⁻¹? Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute k.

E =50 MeV.

The formula for k is k= sqrt(2 m E) / ħ.

m is electron mass: 9.1093837e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.60218e-13 J =8.0109e-7 J.

Compute 2 m E = 2 *9.109e-31 *8.0109e-7 = 1.458e-37 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg m²/s². So 2 m E has units kg² m²/s².

sqrt(2 m E) has units kg m/s.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s → which is kg m²/s.

So k = sqrt(2 m E) / ħ → units (kg m/s) / (kg m²/s) ) → 1/(m) → m⁻¹.

Compute the numerical value.

sqrt(2 m E) = sqrt(1.458e-37) = 1.207e-18 kg m/s.

Divide by ħ=1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s: 

k= (1.207e-18 ) / (1.0545718e-34 ) = approx 1.144e16 m⁻¹.

Convert to fm⁻¹: 1 m⁻¹ = 1e-15 fm⁻¹.

So 1.144e16 m⁻¹ = 1.144e16 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ =11.44 fm⁻¹.

So k ≈11.44 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))= (16.864)/(2*11.44 ) =16.864/(22.88) ≈0.737 fm.

But none of the options are near 0.737 fm. The options are in the 100s of fm. So perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another possibility is that the formula for the imaginary part includes a factor of 2, or perhaps I used the wrong expression for f(θ=0).

Wait, another approach: the differential cross-section is given by |f(θ)|², but the question is about the imaginary part of f(0), not the cross-section.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part of f(0) multiplied by some factor, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Hmm, because earlier I thought it was (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l), but perhaps it's (1/k) instead.

Wait, let's re-examine the formula for f(0):

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ]

As computed earlier, the imaginary part is [1/(2k)] * Σ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

Which is what I used earlier, leading to Im(f(0))=0.737 fm.

But that's not matching any option. So perhaps the initial approach was wrong, and I should use the first formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) * Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l, as I thought earlier.

Let me re-do that.

Sum for l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin² δ_l:

l=0: 1 * sin^2(90) =1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67)=3*(0.9205^2)=3*(0.8473)=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55)=5*(0.8192^2)=5*(0.6710)=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30)=7*(0.5^2)=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13)=9*(0.22495^2)=9*(0.05058)=0.455.

Sum:1 +2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.455=9.1019.

If this sum is multiplied by (1/k), and k=11.44 fm⁻¹, then Im(f(0))=9.1019/11.44 ≈ 0.795 fm.

Still way below the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the imaginary part of f, but about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the scattering amplitude f, but about the optical theorem, which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross-section.

Wait, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is (4π/ k² ) * Im(f(0)).

But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, let me think. The total cross-section is given by:

σ_total = (4 π / k ) * Im(f(0)).

Wait, wait, no. The optical theorem says:

σ_total = (4 π /k ) * Im(f(0)).

Wait, but wait, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), as calculated earlier.

So, in this case, Im(f(0))=0.737 fm, but in terms of units, I need to ensure that everything is in the correct units.

Wait, but perhaps the question is not about the scattering amplitude, but about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by some factor, perhaps 1e15 or so.

Wait, the options are in the order of 10^2 to 1e5 fm.

But my calculation gives Im(f(0)) ≈ 0.737 fm, which doesn't match any option.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me recompute k.

E=50 MeV.

Another approach: The wave number k is given by k = sqrt( (2 m E ) ) / ħ.

But using natural units where ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

Wait, perhaps we can express k in terms of E and the Compton wavelength.

The Compton wavelength is λ_c = ħ/(m c) ≈ 2.426 fm for the electron.

The relation between k and E is E = ħ c sqrt( k² + (m c )^2 / ħ^2 ) ) → for high E, E ≈ ħ c k → k≈ E/( ħ c )

So for E=50 MeV, k≈50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

But earlier, using the formula with units leads to a much larger k of ~11.44 fm⁻¹.

This discrepancy suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps in the non-relativistic case, the formula is k= sqrt(2 m E ) / ħ, but in the relativistic case, it's different.

Wait, let's compute k using relativistic energy.

E= sqrt( (p c )^2 + (m c² )^2 )

For E>> m c², E≈p c → p≈E/(c)

So, since p= ħ k → k= p/ ħ → k= E/(c ħ )

Thus, k= E/(c ħ )

Compute with E=50 MeV → 50e6 * 1.6e-13 J =8e-7 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k= (8e-7 J ) / (3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J s )

Calculate denominator: 3e8 * 1.05457e-34 =3.1637e-26.

So k=8e-7 /3.1637e-26 ≈2.528e19 m⁻¹.

Convert to fm⁻¹: 1 m⁻¹=1e15 fm⁻¹.

So 2.528e19 m⁻¹ = 2.528e19 * 1e-15 fm⁻¹ =2.528e4 fm⁻¹ → which is 25280 fm⁻¹.

That's way too big, so I must have messed up.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation E=pc for relativistic electrons.

Thus, p=E/(c). Then, k=p/ħ → k= E/( c ħ )

But E is in Joules, c in m/s, ħ in J s.

So E=50 MeV=50e6 *1.6e-13 J=8e-7 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

k=8e-7 / (3e8 *1.0545718e-34 ) → compute denominator:3e8 *1.05e-34 =3.16e-26.

k=8e-7 /3.16e-26 = approximately 2.529e19 m⁻¹.

Which is 2.529e19 m⁻¹ = 2.529e19 *1e-15 fm⁻¹ =2.529e4 fm⁻¹ → 25290 fm⁻¹.

That's a very large k. Hmm.

But earlier, using the non-relativistic formula, I got k=11.44 fm⁻¹.

Wait, something's wrong here. Let me think about the correct formula for k in terms of E.

Wait, I think the correct formula for k when E is the kinetic energy is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

The correct relation is E^2 = (p c )^2 + (m c^2 )^2.

For E=50 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV, so E>>m c². Thus, p c ≈ E → p≈E/(c).

But then, k= p/(ħ).

So substituting, k= E/( ħ c )

E is 50 MeV, ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

Thus, k=50 /197.33 → approx 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So that's correct. So k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So with this k, let's compute Im(f(0)) using the two different formulas.

First, using the first approach, where Im(f(0))=(1/k) * sum( (2l+1) sin² δ_l )

sum≈9.1019.

Im(f(0))=9.1019 /0.253 ≈35.97 fm.

That's about 36 fm.

Looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about ten times larger. Option C is ~177 fm.

Hmm, but 36 is nowhere near any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula should include a factor of 2, making it Im(f(0))= (2/k) * sum.

Wait, let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the differential cross-section is (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

Wait, but the question is specifically about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, not the cross-section.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let's recompute the sum for the first approach (Im(f)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l )

l=0: (2*0+1)=1, sin^2(90)=1 → term=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67)=3*(0.9205)^2=3*(0.8473)=2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55)=5*(0.8192)^2=5*(0.6710)=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13)=9*(0.22495)^2=9*(0.05058)=0.455.

Sum=1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.455=9.1019.

So sum≈9.1019.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

Im(f)=9.1019 /0.253≈35.97 fm.

So about 36 fm.

But options are B) 355.35, C) 177.675, D)251.27.

So 35.97 fm is not among the options. So perhaps I missed a factor. For example, if the sum is multiplied by 10, 35.97 *10=359.7 fm, which is close to option B (355.351).

But why would there be a factor of 10?

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by something. Let's see.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude f includes a factor of (1/k). If k is in inverse fm, then 1/k is in fm.

But perhaps the sum should be multiplied by 2, as in the formula I thought earlier.

Wait, earlier, when I thought the correct formula was Im(f)= (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), and with sum≈16.864, and k=0.253, that gives Im(f)=16.864/(2 *0.253)≈33.36 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum includes a factor of (2l+1) multiplied by sin^2 δ_l, but perhaps the actual formula includes a factor of (2l+1) multiplied by sin δ_l.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is (1/(k)) sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )

In that case, the sum would be:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*(0.9205)=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*(0.8192)=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9*(0.22495)=2.0245.

Sum=1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Then Im(f)=13.382 /0.253 ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, 35.97 is about 36, which is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) * sum ( (2l+1)^2 sin δ_l )

Wait, that's not likely, but let's try it.

Compute sum:

l=0: (1)^2 *1=1.

l=1:3^2 *sin(67)=9*(0.9205)=8.2845.

l=2:5^2 *sin(55)=25*(0.8192)=20.48.

l=3:7^2 *sin(30)=49*(0.5)=24.5.

l=4:9^2 *sin(13)=81*(0.22495)=18.252.

Sum=1 +8.2845=9.2845 +20.48=29.7645 +24.5=54.2645 +18.252=72.5165.

Im(f)=72.5165 /0.253≈286.6 fm.

Which is near option D (251.27) and option B (355.35). Not exact, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is (2l+1) sin(δ_l), not squared.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l). So let's compute that.

Sum=(1 *1) + (3*0.9205) + (5 *0.8192) + (7 *0.5) + (9 *0.22495).

Compute each term:

1*1=1.

3*0.9205≈2.7615.

5*0.8192≈4.096.

7 *0.5=3.5.

9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Im(f)=13.382 /0.253≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/k) * sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) )

Which, using the sum of 16.864:

16.864 /0.253≈66.65 fm.

Still nowhere near the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula involves a factor of 2 in the denominator, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the total cross-section. The total cross-section σ is given by:

σ = (4 π /k² ) * Im(f(0)).

But the question is about Im(f(0)), not σ.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the imaginary part multiplied by 1e6 or some other factor, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum. Let me recheck the sum for the first approach.

Wait, sum for the first approach (sin^2):

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3*(0.9205^2)=3*(0.8473)=2.5419.

l=2:5*(0.8192^2)=5*(0.6710)=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.5^2)=7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.22495^2)=9*(0.05058)=0.455.

Sum=1+2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.455=9.1019.

Correct.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0))=9.1019 /0.253 → approx 35.97 fm.

Hmm.

Looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 5 times 35.97.

Wait, 35.97 *5=179.85, close to option C's 177.675.

So perhaps I missed a factor of 5 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (5/k) * sum(...), but I don't remember seeing a factor of 5 in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are in degrees, but I should have converted them to radians.

Wait, that could be it!

Because in mathematical functions, phase shifts are often in radians, not degrees.

Ah! That's a crucial mistake.

So, all the phase shifts δ are given in degrees, but when computing sin(δ), we need to compute it in radians.

So, I should convert each δ from degrees to radians before computing sin.

So let's recalculate the sum correctly.

Convert each δ to radians:

δ₀=90° → π/2 ≈1.5708 rad.

sin(π/2)=1.

δ₁=67° → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

sin(1.16937)=approx 0.9205.

δ₂=55° →55 * π/180≈0.95993 rad.

sin(0.95993)=approx 0.8192.

δ₃=30° → π/6≈0.5236 rad; sin=0.5.

δ₄=13° →13 * π/180≈0.2269 rad.

sin(0.2269)=approx 0.22495.

So, the sum remains the same as before, since the sines of the angles in degrees and radians give the same numerical value, because we're using the same degrees for the computation.

Wait, no. Wait, no! Wait, no, because when you compute sin(67 degrees), you get sin(67°)=0.9205.

But when you compute sin(67 radians), that's not the same. So, the mistake is that in the formula, the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees.

Wait, no, the phase shifts are given in degrees, but when you compute, say, sin(δ), you have to compute it in radians.

Wait, but the phase shifts as given are in degrees, so when computing sin(δ), you have to convert δ into radians first.

So let's recompute the sum with δ in radians.

For each l:

l=0: δ=90° → π/2 rad. sin^2(π/2)=1.

l=1:67° → sin(67°)=sin(1.16937 rad)=0.9205 → sin^2=0.8473.

l=2:55° → sin(55°)=0.8192 → sin^2=0.6710.

l=3:30° →0.5 → sin^2=0.25.

l=4:13° →0.22495 → sin^2=0.05058.

So the sum is the same as before:9.1019.

So converting degrees to radians doesn't change the sum. Therefore, that's not the issue.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k was calculated incorrectly.

Wait, when I used k= E/(ħ c ), with E=50 MeV.

E=50 MeV, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So k=50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

But perhaps the correct formula is k= (E in MeV) / (ħ c) → so 50 /197.33=0.253 fm⁻¹.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is k= (E in eV) / (ħ c in eV fm ).

Wait, 50 MeV=5e7 eV.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm=1.9733e8 eV fm.

So k=5e7 /1.9733e8 =approx 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

So the value of k is correct.

At this point, I'm stuck because my calculation doesn't match any of the options. But I think I must have made a mistake in the formula for the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) )

Which for sum=16.864, k=0.253 → Im(f)=16.864/(2*0.253)=16.864/0.506≈33.32 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(k).

Which gives sum≈13.382 → 13.382/0.253≈52.9 fm.

No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (sum (2l+1) ) * something.

sum (2l+1) from l=0 to4:1+3+5+7+9=25.

If I multiply 25 by some factor, perhaps.

But 25 * something= option.

Option C is 177.675 fm.

25 *7.107=177.675.

Where would 7.107 come from?

Wait, 7.107 is approximately (2π)/ (0.253) → 2π is about6.283, 6.283/0.253≈24.82.

No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum as (2l+1) sin( δ_l ), and then multiply by (1/k).

Which gives sum=13.382, Im(f)=13.382 /0.253≈52.9 fm.

No match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )) * (1/(2k)).

Which gives 16.864/(2*0.253)=33.32 fm.

No match.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(k)).

Which is 13.382 /0.253=52.9 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is 177.675 fm, option C.

Because 35.97 fm is close to option C (177.675) divided by 5.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 4π or something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is (4 π /k ) * sum ( (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) * (1/(2k)) )

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total cross-section, which is (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

If Im(f)=35.97 fm, then σ=4π *35.97 /k.

Wait, but k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

σ= (4 *3.1416 *35.97 ) /0.253.

Compute numerator:4 *3.1416≈12.566; 12.566 *35.97≈450.5.

Then 450.5 /0.253≈1781.4 fm².

But the options are in fm, not fm², so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part as (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ), but with k in a different unit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another approach: The wave number k is given by k=√(2mE)/ħ.

But perhaps I should use E in the rest frame of the target, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using non-relativistic units, so E= (ħ^2 k^2)/(2m).

So k= sqrt(2 m E )/ ħ.

Let me compute that again.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV=8e-7 J.

k= sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *8e-7 ) /1.0545718e-34.

Compute numerator inside sqrt: 2*9.109e-31 *8e-7=1.457e-37.

sqrt(1.457e-37)=1.207e-18.

Divide by ħ=1.0545718e-34 →1.207e-18 /1.0545718e-34 = approx 1.144e16 m⁻¹.

Convert to fm⁻¹: 1 m⁻¹=1e-15 fm⁻¹ →1.144e16 m⁻¹=1.144e16 *1e-15 fm⁻¹=11.44 fm⁻¹.

So k=11.44 fm⁻¹.

So using this k, and the formula Im(f)= (1/k)* sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Sum=9.1019.

So Im(f)=9.1019 /11.44≈0.795 fm.

Not matching any options.

Wait, option C is 177.675 fm. Which is roughly 200 times 0.795.

Hmm, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (1/(2k)) sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ), which gives sum=16.864.

Im(f)=16.864/(2 *11.44)=16.864/22.88≈0.737 fm.

No match.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ), which would be 16.864/11.44≈1.473 fm.

Still not matching.

I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ) / (k), but with k in units of fm.

Wait, sum=9.1019, k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

Im(f)=9.1019 /0.253≈35.97 fm.

Which is not among the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is half of that, 177.675 fm. But I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recompute the sum for (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l:

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*(0.9205)^2=3*0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5*(0.8192)^2=5*0.671≈3.355.

l=3:7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.22495)^2≈9*0.05058≈0.455.

Sum=1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.455=9.1019.

Yes, correct.

So unless there's a factor of 20, which I can't justify, I can't see how to get to the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be (sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ) * (1e3) /k.

But why 1e3?

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is in 1/(fm), but in the formula, it should be in inverse meters. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, and in the formula for f, k is in 1/m, so when I compute 1/k, it's in meters, which is 1e15 fm.

Wait, let me think.

If k is 0.253 fm⁻¹ → 0.253 /fm.

But 1 fm⁻¹=1e15 m⁻¹.

So k=0.253 fm⁻¹=0.253e15 m⁻¹=2.53e14 m⁻¹.

Then, when calculating Im(f), which is (sum) /k [unit: fm], because sum is dimensionless, but k is in fm⁻¹.

Wait, sum is 9.1019.

Im(f)=9.1019 / (0.253 fm⁻¹) )= (9.1019/0.253) fm →35.97 fm.

Which is the same result as before.

So no, that doesn't help.

I think I must have made a mistake in the approach, but I'm not seeing it. Maybe the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f is (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l)) * (1/k).

Which gives sum=13.382, Im(f)=13.382/0.253≈52.9 fm.

No option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) ) * sin^2 δ_l.

Sum (2l+1)=25.

25 * sin^2 terms.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the phase shifts are summed as (2l+1) multiplied by sin(2δ_l ), but only up to l=4.

Wait, if the sum is 16.864 and k=0.253, then Im(f)=16.864/(2 *0.253)=33.3 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula has a factor of 2π.

So 35.97 * 2π≈226 fm.

Which is close to option D (251.271 fm).

Hmm, 226 is close to 251.27, but not exact.

Wait, 35.97 * 7.006 ≈251.27.

Hmm, but why 7.006?

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the relativistic expression for k, which gives k=11.44 fm⁻¹.

Then, Im(f)=9.1019 /11.44≈0.795 fm.

But that's not matching.

At this point, I think I'm stuck and might have to make an educated guess based on the options.

The sum for the first approach is 9.1019, and k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

Im(f)=35.97 fm.

But none of the options match. However, option C is 177.675, which is about 5 times that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me re-calculate the sum for the first approach with correct radian measurements.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, so I should compute sin in radians.

Wait, but earlier calculation shows that doesn't change the sum. Because the phase shifts given are in degrees, but when I compute sin(67 degrees), it's the same as sin(67°) in radians.

Wait, but if the phase shifts were in radians, 90 radians is way more than 2π, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula requires the phase shifts to be in radians, but the given values are in degrees, which I should convert.

So, for each δ_l, compute sin(δ_l_radians).

Let me recompute the sum with that.

l=0: δ=90° → π/2 rad. sin(π/2)=1 → term=1.

l=1:67° →67 * π/180≈1.16937 rad. sin(1.16937)=0.9205 → term=3 *0.9205²=3*0.8473=2.5419.

l=2:55° →55 * π/180≈0.95993 rad. sin=0.8192 →5 *0.6710=3.355.

l=3:30°→ π/6=0.5236 rad. sin=0.5 →7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:13°→13 * π/180≈0.2269 rad. sin=0.22495 →9 *0.05058=0.455.

Sum=9.1019.

Same as before.

So that doesn't help.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm.

But I can't see how to reach that number. Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct expression is (sum) * 20 /k → 9.1019*20 /0.253 → 728.15 ≈ option A.

But that's not it either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) ) * something.

Wait, sum (2l+1)=25.

25 * (50 MeV /197.33 MeV fm )=25 *0.253≈6.325 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, but that's not helpful.

I think I'm stuck and will have to choose the closest option, which is none. But since the options don't match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, going back to the initial formula: f(θ) = (1/k) sum ( (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) Pl(cosθ).

At θ=0, Pl(1)=1.

So Im(f(0))= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l Im(e^{i δ_l} )

Which is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * sin δ_l → (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Which brings us back to Im(f)=35.97 fm.

But that's not an option.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which is approximately 10 times 35.97.

But why would there be a factor of 10?

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in units of 1 radian, not degrees. Wait, but the question states the phase shifts are in degrees.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the wave number calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for k is k= (E in eV) / (ħ c in eV fm )

E=50 MeV=5e7 eV.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm=1.9733e8 eV fm.

So k=5e7 /1.9733e8= approx 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

So I'm back to the same result.

I think I'm missing something here, but given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. The sum for the first approach gives Im(f)=35.97 fm, which is not an option, but option C is about 5 times that, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I can't justify it.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic electron scattering at the incident beam direction (\( \theta = 0^\circ \)). The given phase shifts are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and the energy of the electrons is \( 50 \, \text{MeV} \). The formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) is derived from scattering theory as:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, calculated using the relativistic relation \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), with \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm} \). For \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), \( k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \).

### Step 1: Compute the sum \( \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l) \)
Each term in the sum is calculated as follows:
- \( l = 0 \): \( (2(0)+1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- \( l = 1 \): \( (2(1)+1) \sin^2(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.8473 = 2.5419 \)
- \( l = 2 \): \( (2(2)+1) \sin^2(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.6710 = 3.355 \)
- \( l = 3 \): \( (2(3)+1) \sin^2(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \)
- \( l = 4 \): \( (2(4)+1) \sin^2(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.05058 = 0.455 \)

Summing these terms:
\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l) \approx 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.455 = 9.1019.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \)
Using the formula:
\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin^2(\delta_l),
\]
and substituting \( k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{9.1019}{0.253} \approx 35.97 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 35.97 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, option **C) 177.675 fm** is approximately 5 times the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either a missing factor in the formula or an issue with the interpretation of the phase shifts. Given the options, the closest match is:

**C) 177.675 fm**

### Final Answer:
C) 177.675 fm
