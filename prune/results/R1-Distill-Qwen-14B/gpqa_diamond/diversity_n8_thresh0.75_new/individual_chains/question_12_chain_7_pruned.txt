Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and their kinetic energy after a decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem is about a pion (Pi+) at rest decaying into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The reaction is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles, which are the muon and the neutrino. The options are given, so the answer must be one of them.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think in most cases, they're considered massless, or at least their mass is negligible compared to other particles. So for this problem, I'll probably treat the neutrino's mass as zero. That might simplify things.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let's think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After the decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The total energy of each particle is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy. The muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy.

Let me write down the equations:

Total energy before decay: E_initial = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV.

Total energy after decay: E_after = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu (kinetic energy of muon)
E_nu = K_nu (since m_nu ≈ 0)

So, E_after = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

Setting E_initial = E_after:
139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu.

So, K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.
