Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's pretty rigid with multiple bridged rings.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has some specific peaks. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. But in the presence of KOH and a dihalide, maybe it's an elimination reaction. Oh wait, when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination to form an alkene, right? So maybe it's dehydrohalogenation twice, removing two HBr molecules to form a double bond.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules. But wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, not 1,2-dibromo. Oh, right, the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in a diamondoid structure. So elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. That would give us an adamantyl structure with a double bond, making it an alkene. But wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is more
