Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so it has two bromine atoms attached to adjacent carbons in the adamantane framework.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with bases, it's often an elimination reaction, like the E2 mechanism. But wait, in some cases, especially with vicinal dihalides, it can lead to elimination to form alkenes. Oh right, because when two adjacent halogens are present, removing them with a base can abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

So, the product after KOH would probably be an alkene. The problem mentions a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Hmm, what's that? Oh, I think that's a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. Wait, but wait—this product is formed by elimination, so if it's an alkene, where's the carbonyl coming from? Unless maybe I got the reaction wrong.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination. Another possibility is that KOH is acting as a nucleophile. Oh wait, no, dibromide reacting with base—could it be a dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. But then, why the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.)?

Wait a second, maybe I'm mixing up the reactions. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's not an elimination but a substitution. But substitution would require a good leaving group, and KOH would provide hydroxide ions. However, dibromides under basic conditions could undergo elimination, but I thought that leads to alkenes. Alternatively, maybe it's not elimination but a substitution, but with two bromides, maybe two substitutions occur.

Wait, another possibility is that the KOH is causing the formation of a diol. But if
