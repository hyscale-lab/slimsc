Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's break this down.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), so I think that means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor. So, the ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level (n_upper) to a lower one (n_lower) is (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, star_1 has twice as excited iron atoms as star_2. Let me clarify what that means. I think it means that the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2. So, n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2. But wait, wait. Oh, no, wait—the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited." So maybe it's the excitation, which is the ratio of excited to ground state. So for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the populations in the specific level compared to another.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. So, perhaps the ratio of the populations in the two energy levels in each star is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me denote for star 1: n1_upper / n1_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
Similarly, for star 2: n2_upper / n2_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

But wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. Does that mean that the excitation (n_upper) in star_1 is twice that in star_2? Or is it that the ratio (n_upper /
