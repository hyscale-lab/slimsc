Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a specific nucleus moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use Einstein's equations, especially the one that relates energy to mass and velocity.

Wait, the nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, lithium has an atomic number of 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, that's like lithium-6. So the mass number A is 6. So the mass of the nucleus would be approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, since protons and neutrons are about the same mass. But wait, I should probably use the exact mass of the nucleus. Alternatively, maybe I can just use the atomic mass unit (u) and convert that into energy later.

So the problem is asking for the total energy of the nucleus. I think the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So I need to calculate gamma first.

Given v is 0.96c. Let me compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c² = 0.96^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me think, 0.28 squared
