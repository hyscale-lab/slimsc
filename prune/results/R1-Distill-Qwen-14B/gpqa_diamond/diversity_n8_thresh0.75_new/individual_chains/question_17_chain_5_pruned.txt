Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The question says it's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, what do I remember about formation constants? Oh right, the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. In this case, Ca²+ and EDTA (Y^4-) form the CaY²- complex. The reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²-.

So the formula for Kf would be [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]). Since the solution is stoichiometric, I think that means the concentration of Ca²+ and Y^4- before they form the complex is the same. Or wait, maybe in the solution, all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex because the concentration is high enough.

Wait, the concentration given is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. Because the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

But wait, Kf is a huge number here, 5e10. That's a very strong complex, so the dissociation would be minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ and Y^4- should be really low.

So the formula is Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]). Let's denote [Ca²+] = x and [Y^4-] = y. But in a stoichiometric solution, the amount of Ca²+ and Y^4- should be the same because the reaction is 1:1. So x = y.

So substituting, Kf = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Kf is 5e10. So, 5e10 = [CaY²-]/(x^2). Because [CaY²-] is 0.02 M, and x is the concentration of both Ca²+ and Y^4-
