Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in elimination or deprotonation reactions. The solvent is ammonia, which I think is a good solvent for such reactions, maybe also acting as a base sometimes.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, maybe that's 1-bromo-2-diethylaminobenzene? Because when I see 'd' after the substituent, that usually stands for diethylamine. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a Br in position 1 and a diethylamino group in position 2. So numbering the ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, so they're meta to each other? Wait no, 1 and 2 are adjacent, so they are ortho positions.

So when you have 1-bromo-2-(diethylamino)benzene, treating it with NaNH2 in ammonia. I think NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it causes an elimination reaction. Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, producing a benzene ring with a double bond or something?

Wait, no, benzene is aromatic, so you can't form a double bond. Oh wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's about a substitution reaction. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. Or maybe it causes elimination, but in such a case, what would eliminate?

Wait, perhaps the diethylamino group is a good leaving group? No, diethylamine is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonated or something else happens. Wait, but the molecule has a bromine attached to the benzene ring. So maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution? But for that, the ring should be activated towards nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but in this case, the diethylamino group is a strong activating group, which would typically direct incoming nucleophiles. But wait, the bromide is in position 1, and the diethylamino in position 2. So in a nucleophilic substitution, perhaps the bromide leaves, and the amino group attacks? But wait, that would require the ring to undergo substitution, which usually requires specific conditions. Or maybe elimination occurs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: when you have a bromide adjacent to a strongly activating group like an amino, maybe an elimination reaction occurs where the amino group acts as a base. But how?

Wait, let me think about the structure again. Benzene ring with Br in position 1 and N(Et)2 in position 2. So positions 1 and 2 are ortho to each other. So the substituents are ortho.

NaNH2 is a strong base, but maybe it will abstract a proton from the ring. Wait, where would the acidic protons be? The amino group is a strong activating group, so it's ortho/para directing. But I'm not sure about the acidity of the protons on the ring here. Wait, the amino group is a strong base, so the adjacent protons (ortho and para) would be more acidic.

Wait, but the diethylamino group is attached to the benzene ring. So the ring is activated, and adjacent protons (ortho and para to the amino group) would be more acidic. So if the base (NaNH2) abstracts a proton, where would that be?

Wait, the Br is in position 1, and the amino in position 2. So the positions ortho to Br would be 2 and 6. But the 2 position is already occupied by the amino group. So where else?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring adjacent to the Br. But I thought the amino group is more activating. Alternatively, maybe the Br is a leaving group, and the amino group could act as a base, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another reaction possibility: the amino group could deprotonate, but I'm not sure how that would help. Alternatively, maybe the NaNH2 is causing a dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond between the ring and the diethylamino group? That doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide leaves, and the amino group attacks. But that would require the ring to form a new bond, which seems unlikely unless it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But nucleophilic substitution on benzene rings usually requires specific activating groups and conditions, like a strongly activated ring with strong electron donating groups, and perhaps a deactivating group adjacent to the leaving group.

Wait, but in this case, the amino group is a strong activating group. So maybe the bromide is a good leaving group, and the ring's ortho and para positions are activated. So in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the amino group directs the attack.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are adjacent. So the amino group is in position 2, and the bromide is in position 1, which is adjacent. So if the Br leaves, the amino group is in position 2, which is the ortho position to the leaving group. So in such a case, perhaps the substitution would occur where?

Alternatively, perhaps an elimination occurs, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's probably not with NaNH2.

Wait, perhaps the diethylamino group is a good enough base to abstract a proton from the ring. Let's think about the ring. The diethylamino group is in position 2, and the Br is in position 1. So the position 3 would be meta to the amino group, but I'm not sure if that's where the proton would be abstracted.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, producing a benzene ring with a double bond to the amino group. But wait, the ring is already aromatic, so I don't think you can form a double bond like that. Maybe it's a substitution but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, another possibility: this is a case of the Hofmann elimination, but that's usually for amines. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene is already a six-membered ring with three double bonds. So maybe it's a different kind of elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethylamino group is a good leaving group, but I don't think that's the case because amines are not good leaving groups. Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps it abstracts a proton from the diethylamino group, making it a better leaving group? Or maybe it's more about the benzene ring's acidity.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring substitution. Let me think about the structure. The benzene ring has Br in position 1 and diethylamino in position 2. So when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, maybe the Br leaves, and the amino group attacks, but that would require the ring to form a new bond. Alternatively, perhaps the amino group could lose a proton, acting as a base.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of dehalogenation. So, when you have adjacent substituents, sometimes elimination can occur. For example, in some cases, if you have a leaving group like Br and a good base, you might form a double bond. But the benzene ring is already a conjugated system, so I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a benzidine rearrangement or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of an aromatic ring with a double bond, but that's not possible since benzene is already fully conjugated.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. So the Br leaves, and the amino group acts as a nucleophile, but that would lead to a ring contraction or expansion, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps another group attacks.

Wait, perhaps the diethylamino group is deprotonated by the NaNH2, becoming a stronger base. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a reaction.

Wait, maybe it's a SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) reaction. For that, the leaving group (like Br) should be activated, meaning the ring should be electron-deficient. Wait, but in this case, the ring has a strong activating group (diethylamino), which is electron-donating. SNAr typically occurs in rings that are electron-poor, such as those with strong deactivating groups like nitro groups. So maybe this isn't SNAr, because the ring is activated, not deactivated.

Hmm, maybe the reaction is a elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond adjacent to the amino group. But again, I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, another angle: when NaNH2 is used in ammonia, it's often for deprotonation, especially for acidic protons. So which protons in this molecule are acidic enough to be deprotonated by such a strong base?

The diethylamino group is attached to the benzene ring. The amino group is a strong base, so the alpha protons (the ones on the adjacent carbon) are acidic. Wait, but the amino group is connected to the benzene, so the adjacent positions are the ring positions. Wait, the ring's protons adjacent to the amino group would be more acidic.

So, the base could abstract a proton from the ring that's next to the amino group. Let's picture the structure: benzene with Br at position 1 and diethylamino at position 2. So the adjacent positions to the amino group (position 2) are positions 1 (Br), 3, and 6. But position 1 is Br, so positions 3 and 6 are adjacent (ortho) to the amino group.

So if the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or 6, which are ortho to the amino group, then that would form a benzene ring with a negative charge or a carbanion. Wait, but benzene is aromatic, so deprotonation might lead to some sort of resonance-stabilized structure.

Alternatively, maybe the abstraction of a proton leads to a ring expansion or a different structure, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. So the Br leaves, and a proton is abstracted from the adjacent carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond. But in this case, the adjacent position is position 2, which is the amino group. So that wouldn't form a double bond between C1 and C2 because C2 has the amino group.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br in position 1 leaves, and the base abstracts a proton from position 2, but position 2 is the amino group, which is connected to N. So maybe an elimination where the Br- leaves and a proton from position 3 is abstracted, leading to a double bond between C1 and C3? But that would make the ring non-aromatic. I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. If the Br leaves, what comes in? If it's a substitution reaction, perhaps the amino group is a good nucleophile, but that would require the ring to form a new bond. Alternatively, maybe another substituent attacks.

Wait, perhaps the base isn't acting as a nucleophile but as a deprotonating agent. So in this case, the diethylamino group is in position 2, and the Br is in position 1. So perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or 6, which are ortho to the amino group.

If a proton is abstracted at position 3, perhaps the ring becomes deprotonated, leading to a resonance structure. But I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the ring undergoes some kind of coupling or rearrangement.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a Suzuki coupling or some kind of cross-coupling, but I don't think NaNH2 is used for that. Or maybe it's a Grignard reaction, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethylamino group is a good enough base to cause an elimination, leading to the formation of a quinoline structure. Wait, quinoline has a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring. But how would that form from this structure?

Wait, the diethylamino group is in position 2, and the Br is in position 1. If elimination occurs, perhaps the amino group loses a proton and the Br leaves, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But that would require the formation of a ring with a double bond, but the ring is already aromatic. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring. For example, in a benzidine rearrangement, but that's when you have two amino groups in certain positions. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a case of the benzene ring undergoing a substitution where the Br is replaced by the amino group. But that would require the amino group to act as a nucleophile, attacking the ring, but that's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which usually requires the ring to be activated. Wait, but the amino group is already there; wait, the ring has both Br and the amino group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination of HBr. The Br is at position 1, and the base abstracts a proton adjacent to it, leading to the formation of a double bond. But benzene is already a conjugated system; I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the diethylamino group, making it a better leaving group. But I don't think that's feasible because amines aren't good leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring, making the ring more electron-rich, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the amino group attacks the adjacent bromide position, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, another possibility: the base could deprotonate the diethylamino group, turning it into a stronger base, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction where the base facilitates the loss of Br, and a new bond forms. But without a clear mechanism in mind, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products there are. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the reaction leads to a single product, then option B would be correct. If multiple products are possible, then other options come into play.

Wait, maybe the diethylamino group is so bulky that it causes steric hindrance, leading to different products depending on where the attack occurs. Or perhaps the base can abstract protons from different positions, leading to different elimination products.

Wait, another angle: when NaNH2 is used in ammonia, it's often used to form anilines via dehydrohalogenation. For example, in the formation of aniline from a benzene ring with a leaving group and a strong activating group.

Wait, so maybe in this case, the diethylamino group is in position 2, and the Br is in position 1. The base abstracts a proton from position 3, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But that would require the formation of a non-aromatic ring, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a new substituent. For example, after elimination of HBr, the ring could have a double bond adjacent to the amino group, but that again would disrupt aromaticity.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the possible products.

If the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But what? If the amino group is in position 2, and the Br in position 1, perhaps the substitution would result in the amino group moving to position 1, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the Br leaves, and the amino group remains. So the product would be benzene with diethylamino in position 2 and a hydrogen in position 1. But wait, that's just removing the Br. But that would require the ring to lose Br, but with what coming in? Wait, substitution would require a nucleophile. But if the nucleophile is something else, like the other substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination of HBr, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2. But that would require the ring to lose two substituents and form a double bond, which would break aromaticity. That doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the diethylamino group is a good enough leaving group, but that's not the case because amines are not good leaving groups. So that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where the Br is replaced by another group. But in the presence of NaNH2, which is a strong base, maybe it's more about elimination than substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a nitro group or something else, but that's not indicated.

Wait, another thought: maybe the diethylamino group and the Br are undergoing some kind of rearrangement. For example, in a benzene ring, sometimes substituents can move positions through various mechanisms. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a new amine group. But I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a demethylation or dealkylation, but I don't think that applies here.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible products again. Since the question gives options up to 4, perhaps the reaction leads to multiple products.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-(diethylamino)benzene. When treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the base deprotonates the benzene ring at a position ortho or para to the amino group. Once deprotonated, a resonance structure might form, leading to the loss of Br as a leaving group.

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3 (meta to the Br), then position 3 becomes deprotonated. Then, perhaps the Br in position 1 leaves, and the structure forms a double bond between positions 1 and 2. But I'm not sure if that's feasible without breaking aromaticity.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 4 (para to the amino group), leading to a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with only the diethylamino group, as the Br is eliminated. But how would that happen? If the Br leaves, perhaps it's via an E2 mechanism, where a proton is abstracted from a position adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, if the Br is in position 1, the adjacent positions are 2, 6. The position 2 is already occupied by the amino group, so the proton abstraction would have to be from position 6. Then, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C6, but that would require the ring to lose a hydrogen from C6 and the Br from C1, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6. But that would disrupt the aromaticity of benzene. So that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But without a clear nucleophile, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible products. If the reaction occurs, what could the molecule look like?

If the Br leaves and the amino group remains, then the product would be 2-diethylaminobenzene (aniline derivative). But that seems too simple, and why would the reaction lead to that? Because the Br is a good leaving group, perhaps under basic conditions, it could be displaced, but by what?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new substituent. Wait, maybe the diethylamino group could attack the adjacent Br, but that would require the ring to form a new bond. But in that scenario, perhaps the product would be a ring with the amino group in position 1 and a hydrogen in position 2. But that seems unlikely without a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for similar reactions online or in my notes. Oh wait, I can't do that right now. Let me think again.

Another thought: Maybe the reaction is a ring expansion, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling between the two substituents, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a benzyne formation. Benzyne is a diradical intermediate formed by dehalogenation of a dihalobenzene. But in this case, we have only one bromine and one amino group. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but wait, maybe the NaNH2 is causing two eliminations, removing HBr twice. But that would require two bromines, which we don't have here.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the possible number of products.

If the reaction produces only one product, then the answer is B) 1.

If it produces two products, then C) 2.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from position 3 or position 6, leading to two different products. But I'm not sure what those products would look like.

Alternatively, the reaction could form a para and an ortho product, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the starting material has substituents in positions 1 (Br) and 2 (N(Et)2). When the Br is eliminated, perhaps the amino group can form a new substituent in different positions.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think of the reaction as a substitution where the Br is replaced by a hydrogen, but that would be a simple dehalogenation. Would that require the base to abstract a proton and the Br to leave?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an E2 elimination, where the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a double bond and the loss of Br-. But in this case, adjacent positions to the Br (positions 2 and 6) are either occupied by the amino group (position 2) or empty (position 6). So the base would abstract a proton from position 6, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6. But that would require the ring to lose H from C6 and Br from C1, forming a double bond between C1 and C6. But then the ring would no longer be aromatic, as it would have four double bonds (since benzene has three). That's not possible, so this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the ring but the diethylamino group. Could the base abstract a proton from the diethylamino group, leading to some kind of elimination? For example, the diethylamino group could lose a proton, becoming a stronger base, and then eliminate something.

But the diethylamino group is attached to the benzene ring. If it loses a proton, perhaps it becomes a strong base, leading to the elimination of the Br. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, another thought: The diethylamino group is a good leaving group under certain conditions, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the diethylamino group, making it a better leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diethylamino group is deprotonated, leading to a carbanion, which then attacks the Br. But that would require some kind of intramolecular attack, which I'm not certain about.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the amino group acts as a nucleophile, attacking the adjacent Br. But that would require the Br to leave, and the amino group to move to position 1, but that seems unlikely without a good leaving group and the right conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a new ring. For example, the amino group could attack the adjacent carbon, but that's more of a coupling or addition reaction, which I'm not sure about.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible products again. Let's say the base abstracts a proton from position 3, leading to a deprotonated ring. Then, the Br leaves, and a new substituent forms. But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a quinoline structure. Quinoline has a benzene ring fused with a pyridine ring. To form quinoline, you typically have an adjacent amine and a leaving group. So in this case, the amino group is in position 2, and the Br is in position 1. If the Br leaves, and the amino group moves, perhaps forming a second ring. But that's a stretch, and I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the number of possible products depends on the possible sites of attack or elimination. If the base can abstract a proton from two different positions, leading to two different products, then the number of products would be two.

But I'm not sure which positions those would be. Alternatively, if the reaction leads to the formation of a single product, then the answer is one.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the reaction is a simple dehydrohalogenation, leading to the loss of HBr and the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But as I thought earlier, that would disrupt aromaticity. So perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is replaced by the amino group. But how?

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of what the actual product would be.

If the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by something else, perhaps a hydrogen, but that's just dehalogenation. But under what conditions would that happen? Maybe the base abstracts a proton, and the Br leaves, replacing with a hydrogen. But that would be a simple elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: in aromatic rings, sometimes ortho and para positions are involved in reactions. Suppose the base abstracts a proton from the para position relative to the amino group. The amino group is in position 2, so the para position would be position 5. But if the base abstracts a proton from position 5, perhaps the Br in position 1 leaves, leading to a new structure.

But I'm not certain about this. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from the meta position (positions 3 or 6), leading to different products.

If the base can abstract protons from two different positions, leading to two different products, then the number of possible products would be two. So option C) 2 would be the answer.

Wait, but the amino group is in position 2. The ortho positions are 1 and 3. The para position is 6. So the base could abstract a proton from position 3 or 6, leading to different products.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the base can abstract protons from positions 3 and 4, leading to two different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of two different isomers depending on where the elimination occurs. For example, if the Br is eliminated along with a proton from position 3, forming a double bond between C1 and C3, but that would require a lot of rearrangement.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe the correct answer is that only one product is formed, so the answer is B) 1.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two products because the base can abstract protons from two different positions, leading to two different elimination products.

Wait, another approach: the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in ammonia. I remember that this is a condition used for dehydrohalogenation in some cases, like the formation of aniline from benzene rings with halides and amino groups.

Wait, I think in the case where you have a halogen adjacent to an amino group, treating with a strong base can lead to the elimination of HX (here, HBr) and the formation of a new ring structure, like in the synthesis of aniline.

Wait, in such cases, the amino group and the halide are adjacent, which allows for the elimination of HX, forming a new ring. For example, if you have an amino group in position 2 and a bromide in position 1, elimination would form a bond between C1 and C2, but that's already part of the benzene ring. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a new ring, like a five-membered ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction simply results in the loss of Br, leaving the amino group in place. So the product would be 2-diethylaminobenzene, which is aniline derivative. If that's the case, then only one product is formed, so the answer is B)1.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of multiple products depending on where the base abstracts the proton.

Wait, the problem is that I'm not entirely sure about the reaction mechanism. So I'll have to make an educated guess.

In similar reactions, when a benzene ring has a leaving group (like Br) and an adjacent strongly activating group (like amino), the base can abstract a proton, leading to the elimination of the leaving group and the formation of a new ring structure. For example, the formation of quinoline from o-aminophenyl bromide.

Wait, quinoline is formed when an adjacent amino and bromide group undergo elimination to form a fused pyridine ring. So in this case, 1-bromo-2-(diethylamino)benzene would lose HBr and form a quinoline-like structure, but with diethylamino substituents.

Wait, but wait. Quinoline is formed when you have o-aminophenyl bromide. When you lose HBr, the amino group loses a proton and forms a bond with the adjacent carbon, creating a new ring. So the product would be a fused bicyclic structure.

In our case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-(diethylamino)benzene. So if the base abstracts a proton from the amino group (but that's not likely, as the amino group is already deprotonated?), or perhaps from the ring.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, leading to the elimination of Br and the formation of a bond between C2 and C3, creating a bicyclic structure. But I'm not sure.

If that's the case, the product would be a single structure, so one product. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from two different positions, leading to two different products. For example, abstracting from position 3 and from position 6 would lead to two different structures.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Wait, I think the correct answer is that only one product is formed because the reaction leads to a single elimination product. So the answer is B)1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (1-bromo-2-(diethylamino)benzene) with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for deprotonation or elimination reactions. The molecule has a bromine atom at position 1 and a diethylamino group at position 2 on the benzene ring, which are ortho to each other.

Key considerations for the reaction mechanism include:

1. **Reactivity of the Substituents**:  
   - The diethylamino group is a strong electron-donating group, activating the benzene ring and making the ortho and para positions more acidic.  
   - The bromine atom is a good leaving group, and its position adjacent to the diethylamino group suggests that elimination or substitution reactions are plausible.

2. **Role of NaNH₂**:  
   - NaNH₂ can act as a strong base, abstracting acidic protons from the benzene ring. The positions ortho and para to the diethylamino group (positions 3 and 6) are likely candidates for deprotonation.  
   - The reaction conditions favor elimination rather than substitution, as the strong base promotes deprotonation and the removal of the bromine atom.

3. **Possible Products**:  
   - If a proton is abstracted from position 3, elimination of HBr could occur, potentially forming a resonance-stabilized structure or a new aromatic compound.  
   - Similarly, deprotonation at position 6 could lead to a similar outcome.  
   - However, the steric and electronic effects of the diethylamino group at position 2 may favor a single pathway, leading to a single product.

4. **Elimination vs. Substitution**:  
   - Substitution reactions (e.g., nucleophilic aromatic substitution) are less likely because the benzene ring is strongly activated by the diethylamino group, making it electron-rich and less prone to nucleophilic attack.  
   - Elimination is more plausible, as the base can abstract a proton, and the bromine atom can leave, forming a new structure.

Given the reaction conditions and the structure of the starting material, the most likely outcome is the formation of a single product through elimination. The steric and electronic environment of the molecule does not favor the formation of multiple products.

**Answer: B**
