Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. All right, so I remember that when acids and bases are mixed, they undergo a neutralization reaction. The general idea is that H+ ions from the acid react with OH- ions from the base to form water. The enthalpy change for this reaction is what we're after.

Wait, but each of these solutions has different concentrations and volumes. So, I think the first step is to calculate the moles of H+ ions from the acids and the moles of OH- ions from the base. Then, figure out which is the limiting reagent because that will determine how much reaction actually happens.

Let's break down each solution:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. The formula for moles is Molarity × Volume (in liters). HCl gives one H+ per molecule. So for HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl, which is 0.1 moles H+.

2. H2SO4: This is sulfuric acid, also a strong acid. But wait, sulfuric is a diprotic acid. In dilute solutions, it's usually fully ionized to give 2 H+ ions per molecule. So, the moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each provides 2 H+, that's 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: This is a strong base. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH-. So, moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but wait. When you mix an acid and a base, the H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio. So I need to find the total moles of H+ and OH-.
