Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The setup involves a bicistronic vector, which I remember means it has two genes in one construct. The ligand is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus. There are these stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. Oh wait, I think those are used with Cre recombinase to control gene expression. So Cre would excise the stop cassette, allowing the gene to be expressed.

So the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I believe is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which I think allows for internal ribosome entry, so maybe it can be expressed without the need for a separate promoter? Or perhaps the IRES is part of the expression system, like in some bicistronic vectors where the second gene is expressed using IRES after the first.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them for Western blot. Wait, but the blot didn't show a signal proportional to actin. Oh, but that's maybe because the proteins weren't expressed? Or maybe the blot's controls were okay because actin was used as a loading control.

Then they made a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wildtype background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is involved in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest cells. Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

They look for green signal under confocal. eGFP is green, so the idea is that the receptor-eGFP should be expressed in the cells where Cre was active. But they don't see green. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. If the ligand is secreted, maybe they act on other cells, not the same. But how does that affect expression in the mouse? The question is about why eGFP isn't showing. If the ligand is
