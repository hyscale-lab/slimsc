Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But wait, I think the mass part might not directly affect the abundance ratios, unless it's about their lifespans or something. But the problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe I can ignore the mass for this particular calculation.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh right, [X/Y] notation is logarithmic, meaning it's log10 of (X/Y ratio divided by the solar ratio). Wait no, actually, the [X/Fe] notation is log10 (X/Fe ratio relative to the Sun). Or wait, no, I think [X/Y] = log10 (n_X / n_Y) - log10 (n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's like the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So let me parse that. Wait, what does that mean?
