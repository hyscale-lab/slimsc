Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets for binding. They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. 

Wait, bicistronic means two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Oh, I remember IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it can drive expression of a second gene in a bicistronic construct. 

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I think these are stop cassettes that prevent expression unless the Cre recombinase is present to excise them. Because loxP is recognized by Cre, and lox2272 is a variant that only Cre from certain sources (like the mouse Cre) can recognize. So, when Cre is expressed, the stop cassette gets removed, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. 

So the setup is that in primary astrocyte culture, they transfected the plasmid and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They did a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin loading. So, the proteins are expressed, but when they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Then, the offspring didn't show a green signal under the confocal. 

Wait, the green signal is from eGFP, which is on the receptor. So the eGFP isn't being expressed, or not in the right place. 

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that affect the expression of GFP? Maybe if the ligand is secreted and acts elsewhere, but I'm not sure how that would prevent GFP expression. Doesn't seem directly related. 

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface, so you wouldn't see the GFP under confocal, which looks for surface or specific subcellular locations. But the Western blot detected the protein, which would include any cellular location. So the eGFP is made but not at the surface. But why would that happen? Maybe if the construct is misfolded, but the question says the receptors are normally expressed in neural crest cells. Alternatively, perhaps the expression isn't happening because of the construct's design.

C) Enhancer missing for ligand and receptor. If the enhancer is missing, the genes might not be expressed. But the question says that in the primary culture, the proteins were expressed as shown by Western blot. So the enhancer is present and working in culture. But in the mouse model, maybe the construct isn't properly regulated. Hmm, but the vectors use specific promoters. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The IRES is for the receptor. So perhaps the issue isn't the enhancer.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Wait, the construct is the receptor ORF fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. If they're not in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But wait, in the vector, the ORF is for the receptor, and then eGFP is after. So if the stop cassette is between them, the stop would prevent eGFP expression unless the
