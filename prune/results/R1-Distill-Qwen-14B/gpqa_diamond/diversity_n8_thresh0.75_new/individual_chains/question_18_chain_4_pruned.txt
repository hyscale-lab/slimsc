Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, I've heard about things like [Fe/H] and [Mg/Si] ratios before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's see if I can work through this step by step.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun, but I don't think the masses matter directly for this problem. The key data points are their elemental abundances.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5)

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2]?

But wait, how do I find the silicon abundance in each star?

I remember that the brackets notation [X/Y]_star = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the element abundances in the star compared to the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_Star1 / log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_Sun) = 0.3.

Wait, no. The definition is [X/Y]_star = log10(n_X/n_Y in star) - log10(n_X/n_Y in Sun). So [X/Y]_star = log10( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Si/n_Fe)_{Star1} / (n_Si/n_Fe)_Sun ) = 0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_{Star1} = (n_Si/n_Fe)_Sun * 10^{0.3}

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] = log10(n_Fe/n_H)_{Star1} - log10(n_Fe/n_H)_Sun = 0 → (n_Fe/n_H)_{Star1} = (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun.

Wait, the Sun's log(n_Fe/n_H) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So n_Fe/n_H in Star_1 is the same as in
