Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Hmm, let me read it again.

So Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. That's really low pressure, right? The idea is to minimize gas molecules so that the electron microscopy is better because there's less stuff interfering.

But even with that, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path depends on pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment, I think. Oh right, mean free path (λ) is inversely proportional to pressure and proportional to the square root of temperature. So λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules, p is pressure, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

But when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, not λ1. But the temperature is the same, so why would λ change?

Wait, the question says the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So temperature isn't the issue here. Then why is the mean free path different?

Maybe the pressure changed? Because when the electron beam is on, does it affect the pressure? Perhaps the electron beam interacts with the gas molecules, causing them to be ionized or somehow altering their presence. Oh, right, in electron microscopy, when the electron beam enters the sample chamber, it can cause gas molecules to be ionized. These ions might be pumped away or stick to the chamber walls, effectively reducing the number of gas particles in the chamber.

If the number of gas molecules decreases, the pressure would decrease. Since mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, a lower pressure would result in a longer mean free path. So λ would increase. So λ2 should be larger than λ1.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. Let me think again. The mean free path is calculated based on the initial pressure. So λ1 is based on the initial pressure when the system is at ultra-high vacuum. But when the electron beam starts, perhaps the gas is being further pumped out or something else happens. Or maybe the gas particles are being scattered more, affecting their movement.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path is the average distance a molecule
