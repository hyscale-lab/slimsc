Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, like for a regular harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency and A is the amplitude. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are probably different.

The problem says it's 1-dimensional and obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential is probably (1/2)kx². But since it's relativistic, I can't just use the classical formulas. I think relativistic mechanics involves using the Lorentz factor and maybe the total energy is important here.

Wait, in relativity, the total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So maybe I need to consider the total energy and how it's distributed between kinetic and potential energies.

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx² and the kinetic is (p²)/(2m) in the non-relativistic case. But relativistically, the kinetic energy is higher because of the gamma factor. So, in the relativistic case, the expressions for energy would involve the Lorentz factor γ.

Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is conserved. So E_total = K + U, where K is the kinetic and U is the potential. But since it's relativistic, I need to express K properly. So K = (γ - 1)mc², right? Because the total energy is γmc², and subtracting the rest energy gives the kinetic part.

Hmm, but the potential energy U is (1/2)kx²? Or is it different in relativistic cases? I'm not sure. Maybe it's still (1/2)kx². So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x = A), the potential energy is maximum, and the kinetic energy is zero. But wait, in relativity, can the kinetic energy ever be zero when x is maximum? Because in non-relativistic, yes, but perhaps relativistically, not so much. Or maybe not, because the equations might still hold.

Wait, no. At maximum amplitude (x=A), the velocity is zero in the non-relativistic case, so kinetic energy is zero, and all energy is potential. But in relativistic case, perhaps the situation is different. Or is it the same? Hmm, maybe not because even when the velocity is zero, the energy expressions might
