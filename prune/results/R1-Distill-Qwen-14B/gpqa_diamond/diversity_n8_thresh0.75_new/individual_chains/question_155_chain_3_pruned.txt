Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, let's try to remember what all this means.

First, the setup: there are operators P_x, P_y, P_z, and their matrix forms are given in the basis of the eigenvectors of P_z. The state of the system is a column vector given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So this is the state vector in the eigenbasis of P_z. And I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z.

Wait, the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to calculate ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

But wait, since the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, which for an operator means that the matrix of P_z in that basis is diagonal. Let me look again at the matrix form of P_z. Oh, right, the matrix is:
[ħ  0  0]
[0  0  0]
[0  0 -ħ]
So in this basis, each diagonal element is the eigenvalue for that state. So when the state is an eigenstate of P_z, the expectation value is simply the eigenvalue. But wait, our state isn't an eigenstate of P_z, it's an eigenstate of P_x. So I can't directly read off the expectation value from the diagonal.

So I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

Wait, but P_z is diagonal in this basis, so maybe I can compute these expectation values more easily. Let me think.

The state ψ is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So it's a three-component vector. Let me denote it as ψ = [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

Since P_z is diagonal, the matrix is diag(ħ, 0, -ħ). So when I apply P_z to ψ, I get:

P_z ψ = [ħ * a, 0 * b, (-ħ) * c]^T = [ (ħ a), 0, (-ħ c) ]^T.

Similarly, P_z squared would be diag(ħ², 0, ħ²), so P_z² ψ = [ (ħ² a), 0, (ħ² c) ]^T.

Wait, but I need to compute the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Let's compute each step by step.

First, the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩. That's ψ† P_z ψ.

So, ψ† is [a*, b*, c*], since it's a row vector. Assuming all the elements are real, which they are in this case, so it's just [a, b
