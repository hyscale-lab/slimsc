Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The system's state is provided as a column vector.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So in this case, A is P_z. So I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I can't directly use eigenvalues for P_z here. I'll need to compute the expectation values using the given state.

The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I'll denote this as |ψ⟩. 

So first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z in the state |ψ⟩. And then ⟨P_z²⟩, the expectation value of P_z squared.

Wait, but how do I compute these? Because P_z is a matrix, right? So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I have to compute ψ† P_z ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ.

Let me look at the matrix for P_z. It's given as:

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

Wait, so the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. The off-diagonal elements are zero. That makes it a diagonal matrix. That should make calculations easier.

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can write it as the sum over i (ψ_i * P_z_ii ψ_i). Since the matrix is diagonal, each term is just the product of the state component, the diagonal element, and the conjugate of the state component.

But wait, the state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write them down:

ψ₁ = -1/2
ψ₂ = 1/√2
ψ₃ = -1/2

Since all the components are real, the conjugate transpose will just be the transpose, so ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ = sum_{i=1 to 3} ψ_i * P_z_ii * ψ_i.

Let's compute each term:

For i=1: ψ₁ * P_z_11 * ψ₁ = (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.

For i=2: ψ₂ * P_z_22 * ψ₂ = (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0.

For i=3: ψ₃ * P_z_33 * ψ₃ = (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/4) ħ.

Wait, wait. Because P_z_33 is -ħ. So ψ₃ is (-1/2), so ψ₃ * P_z_33 is (-1/2) * (-ħ) which is (1/2) ħ, but then multiplied by ψ₃ again, which is (-1/2). So (1/2 ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/4) ħ.

So adding up all three terms: (1/4 ħ) + 0 + (-1/4 ħ) = 0.

Hmm, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's interesting.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Let's compute that. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So P_z² is:

Row 1: (ħ)^2, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, (-ħ)^2 = ħ²

So P_z² is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, compute each term:

i=1: ψ₁² * ħ² = (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

i=2: (1/√2)^2 * 0 = 0.

i=3: (-1/2)^2 * ħ² = (1/4) ħ².

So sum is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² which is (1/2) ħ² - (0)^2 = (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance, so sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

For ⟨P_z⟩: ψ₁^2 * ħ, ψ₂^2 *0, ψ₃^2 * (-ħ).

Wait, no, because P_z is diagonal, so the expectation is sum of |ψ_i|^2 * P_z_ii.

Wait, yes, correct. Because for each i, |ψ_i|^2 multiplied by P_z's diagonal element at i.

So let's re-calculate that.

|ψ₁|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * ħ = (1/4) ħ.

|ψ₂|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. 1/2 * 0 = 0.

|ψ₃|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. 1/4 * (-ħ) = - (1/4) ħ.

So adding them: (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So the expectation is indeed zero.

For ⟨P_z²⟩: each |ψ_i|^2 multiplied by (P_z_ii)^2.

So, (1/4) * (ħ^2) + (1/2) * 0 + (1/4) * (ħ^2) = ( (1/4) + (1/4) ) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the variance is 1/2 ħ², so sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

So the uncertainty ΔP_z is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) sqrt(2) ħ

B) ħ / sqrt(2)

C) ħ/2

D) ħ

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is a diagonal matrix with elements:

\[
P_z = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_{i=1}^3 |\psi_i|^2 P_z_{ii}.
\]

Substituting the values:
- For $i=1$: $|\psi_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $P_z_{11} = \hbar$, so $\frac{1}{4} \hbar$.
- For $i=2$: $|\psi_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $P_z_{22} = 0$, so $0$.
- For $i=3$: $|\psi_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $P_z_{33} = -\hbar$, so $-\frac{1}{4} \hbar$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar + 0 - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, which is also diagonal with elements:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_{i=1}^3 |\psi_i|^2 (P_z^2)_{ii}.
\]

Substituting the values:
- For $i=1$: $|\psi_1|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $(P_z^2)_{11} = \hbar^2$, so $\frac{1}{4} \hbar^2$.
- For $i=2$: $|\psi_2|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $(P_z^2)_{22} = 0$, so $0$.
- For $i=3$: $|\psi_3|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $(P_z^2)_{33} = \hbar^2$, so $\frac{1}{4} \hbar^2$.

Adding these contributions:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
