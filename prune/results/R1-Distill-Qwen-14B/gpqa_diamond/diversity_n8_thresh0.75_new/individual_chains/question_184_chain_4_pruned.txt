Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. Let me try to unpack what's being asked here.

The question is about the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product.

First, I should probably sketch the desired molecule to visualize where each substituent is. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Let me number the positions. In benzene, numbering starts to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. Let's see: if the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that's meta to each other? Wait, no, 1,2,3 are adjacent. Wait, wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent positions. Let me think: the compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering the benzene ring, the ethoxy is in position 1, tert-butyl in position 2, and nitro in position 3. So all three substituents are adjacent in a sort of 1,2,3 arrangement? That's like each substituent is at every other carbon. Hmm.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent or meta? No, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, but 1 and 3 are meta. So, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, which are all adjacent. So, that's a meta arrangement for the substituents.

Wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Let me think again. The IUPAC name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are on carbons 1, 2, and 3 of the benzene ring. So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, each adjacent. So, substituents are at every other carbon, but it's a three-substituted benzene.

Now, the main challenge is to figure out the order of reactions that would introduce these groups in such a way that the substituents are correctly positioned. Also, considering the directing effects of each substituent.

Benzene is the starting material. So, I'll need to perform several electrophilic substitutions. Let's think about each substituent:

1. tert-butyl group: This is a bulky substituent. It's an activating group since it's an alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating because they donate electrons through sigma bonds. They are ortho/para directors.

2. Ethoxy group: An ether group, which is an activating, ortho/para director. It's a strong activating group because of the lone pairs on oxygen.

3. Nitro group: A strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but the nitro group is a meta director, which is a problem because if you introduce it after the other groups, it might direct meta to itself, but if you introduce it earlier, it could affect where the other groups go.

So, the order of introducing substituents is crucial. Let's think about their directing effects.

The challenge here is that once a substituent is added, it affects where the next substituent will go. So, for three substituents, the order needs to be such that each new substituent is added in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

Another consideration is the number of substituents and their activating or deactivating nature. Since nitro is deactivating, adding it later might be tricky because deactivating groups can slow down further substitution. Alternatively, activating groups can make the benzene more reactive, which is helpful
