Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because when objects are moving close to the speed of light, you can't just add or subtract their velocities. So I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/c²), right? Or is it the other way around? Let me get that straight.

Wait, so if two objects are moving at v1 and v2 relative to the same frame, their relative speed u is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²) when v1 and v2 are in the same direction. So in this case, both are moving in the same direction, positive x. So astronaut A is 2m mass moving at 0.6c, astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the two astronauts are each moving at these speeds. So the frame of one is moving at some speed relative to the other. So if I want to find the speed of astronaut B relative to astronaut A, I think I should use the velocity transformation formula.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. The velocity u of B as seen from A's frame is (vB - vA) / (1 - (vB vA)/c²). Wait, but I need to be careful about the signs. Since both are moving in the same direction, let me say vA is 0.6c and vB is 0.5c. So in the rest frame of astronaut A, the speed of astronaut B would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²]. Let's compute that.

Calculating numerator: (0.5 - 0.6) c = (-0.1 c). So the numerator is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 -
