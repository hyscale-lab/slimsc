Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then they provided the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. My task is to identify what compound X was from the given options.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Hmm, I remember that this reagent is used in the process called the Sharpless epoxidation. Oh right! Sharpless epoxidation is for epoxidizing epoxides from epoxides, wait, no. Wait, Sharpless is for epoxidizing epoxides, but wait, no, Sharpless epoxidation is the process of forming epoxides from epoxides, but wait, no. Wait, Sharpless epoxidation is for making epoxides from epoxides? No, no, wait. No, Sharpless epoxidation is a method for epoxidizing epoxides, but wait, no, actually, wait. I think it's the other way around. Sharpless epoxidation is for epoxidizing alkenes. Oh right, yes. Sharpless epoxidation converts alkenes into epoxides, typically in an asymmetric manner. So the starting material has an alkene, and after reaction with this reagent, it becomes an epoxide.

So in this case, compound X is reacting with the Sharpless reagent to form an epoxide. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, compound X is the starting material. So if it's reacting to form an epoxide, that would mean compound X is an alkene, and the product is an epoxide.

But wait, the product's NMR is given. So the product is the epoxide. So looking at the product's NMR, which is an epoxide, and we need to find out what the starting alkene (compound X) was.

So to solve this, perhaps I should look at the product's structure based on the NMR and then work backward to find the starting material.

Let me start by analyzing the NMR data.

First, the 1H NMR:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s). Two singlets integrating to 3H each. So two methyl groups. Singlets imply they are attached to something that doesn't split their signals, like being adjacent to an electronegative atom or in a symmetric environment.

Then, 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So four aromatic protons with different shifts. Let's think about coupling here. The doublets could indicate a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, in a para-substituted styrene, but wait, let's see.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

So, 197.7 is a carbonyl carbon? Wait, but epoxides don't have carbonyls. Oh wait, wait. Wait, epoxide rings are ethers, so their carbons are connected to two oxygen atoms. Wait, no, the epoxide ring is two adjacent carbons each connected to an oxygen. So the carbons in the epoxide would be in a ring, each with two adjacent carbons and an oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, but the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7. That
