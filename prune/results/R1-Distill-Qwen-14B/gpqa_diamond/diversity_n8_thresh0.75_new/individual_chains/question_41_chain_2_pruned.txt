Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question states: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer? The options are given as A to D.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards me, and the light is going through it in the same direction. But since the glass is moving, how does that affect the speed of light inside it as observed in the lab?

I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium. So if the medium itself is moving, we have to consider how the velocity transforms.

Oh right, this is probably a problem involving special relativity, specifically the addition of velocities. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities classically. But wait, glass moving at velocity v; if v is much smaller than c, maybe the classical approach suffices. But I'm not sure. The question doesn't specify whether v is small or not, so perhaps it's better to consider the relativistic approach.

Wait, but the speed of light in the medium is c/n, but in the lab frame, if the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of the light. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So let's model this. Let me denote:

In the rest frame of the glass (S'), the light is moving at speed u' = c/n in the direction of motion (assuming the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, as per the problem statement).

The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame (S). So using the velocity addition formula from special relativity, the speed u observed in the lab would be (u' + v)/(1 + (u' * v)/cÂ²).

But wait, wait. Because the light is in the same direction as the glass's movement, so when I apply the velocity addition, it's u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c^2)).

But wait,
