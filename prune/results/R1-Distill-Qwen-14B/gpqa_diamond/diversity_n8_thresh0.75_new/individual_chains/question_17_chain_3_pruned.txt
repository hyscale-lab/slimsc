Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember from my notes that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The question says we've got a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, which I think means a 1:1 ratio. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the K value is 5e10. 

Wait, K is the formation constant, right? So the formation constant K for the complex CaEDTA^2- would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Oh, but wait, I think EDTA can have different forms depending on the pH. Oh, the question says the pH is ideal, so maybe I don't have to worry about that. So I can consider that the majority of EDTA is in the Y^4- form. But wait, no, the problem says the pH is ideal. So perhaps the alpha fraction for Y^4- is 1, meaning [EDTA^4-] is equal to the total EDTA concentration.

Wait, but the complex is stoichiometric, so initially, the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA^2−. Let me think about the dissociation. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. 

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me model this. When the complex dissociates, the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would each be x, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of each ion. So the concentration of Ca²+ is x, and EDTA^4− is x. But wait, wait—the initial complex is 0.02 M. As the complex dissociates, it's [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 – x. But x is going to be very small compared to 0.02 because K is large (5e10), so the dissociation is minimal. So I can approximate [CaEDTA^2−] as approximately 0.02 M. So the K expression would be K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10. 

So setting up the equation: 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 4
