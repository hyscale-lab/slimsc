Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to unpack what it's asking. 

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I guess I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor relates the population of energy levels. The formula is something like N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), right? Here, E_i is the higher energy level. But wait, in the question, the excited state is probably the higher energy level. So if the energy difference is ΔE = E_i - E_j, then the ratio of populations would depend on that.

But wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So probably, the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. 

Let me think. Let's denote the ratio as N1/N2 = 2, where N is the number of excited atoms. Or wait, actually, the problem states that the excitation is twice as much. So maybe the ratio is [N_excited in star_1] / [N_excited in star_2] = 2. Alternatively, number of excited atoms in star 1 is twice that in star 2 for the same level.

But wait, the problem says the energy difference is fixed. So in each star, the energy levels are separated by 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, I can model the excitation using the Boltzmann equation.

Assuming that the ground state is much more populated. Let me denote the ground state as j and excited as i. So the ratio for star 1 is (N_i / N_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ). 

Same for star 2: (N_i' / N_j') = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) ). 

Wait, but since it's the same element (iron), the g_i and g_j (statistical weights) should be the same for both stars, right? So when taking the ratio of the ratios, the (g_i/g_j) terms would cancel out.

So (N_i1/N_j1) / (N_i2/N_j2) ) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_1) + ΔE/(k T_2) ] )

But the question says that N_i1 / N_j1 is twice N_i2 / N_j2. So:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_2) - 1/(T_1) ] )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] [ (1/T_2) - (1/T_1) ) ]

Wait, let me rearrange that. Let's write it as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, but our options don't seem to have this form. Let me think about the options. The options involve T1 and T2 with factors.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation. Let me see:

Let's write the equation as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) )

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me check that.

Yes, 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So substituting that in:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, the question provides the value of ΔE as 1.
