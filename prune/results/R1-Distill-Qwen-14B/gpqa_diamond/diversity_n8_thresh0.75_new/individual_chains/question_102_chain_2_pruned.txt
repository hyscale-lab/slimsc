Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, there's a lot going on here with the vectors and the expression constructs. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

The question is about why there's no green signal when the mice are visualized. The green signal is from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. So the eGFP should be expressed if the receptor is correctly made and transported.

First, the vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs in one vector. The ligand is at the 5' end, followed by mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, so that should drive expression of the ligand. The receptor uses an IRES element, which allows internal ribosome entry, so it can be expressed in a different tissue or under different conditions if needed.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between it and mCherry. The same goes for the receptor with lox2272. LoxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. So, when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed.

The setup is that the mouse model is homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They cross it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I believe. So the Cre should be active in neural crest-derived cells. The idea is that Cre will excise the stop cassettes in those cells, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But when they look under the confocal, there's no green signal. So the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed, or it's not functional.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the ligand and receptor are in the same cell, they might act autocrine. If they're paracrine, perhaps the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But how does that affect the expression of eGFP? If the Cre is only active in certain cells, maybe the eGFP isn't expressed widely. But why would they see no green at all? Maybe if the ligand and receptor aren't co-expressed, but the question is about eGFP expression.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean the eGFP isn't reaching the cell surface or isn't being secreted. But if the construct is properly made, why would it be stuck? Unless the signal sequence is missing, but the question says the vector is correctly made. So maybe this isn't the issue.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The CBA promoter is supposed to drive expression, but maybe it's missing an enhancer. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, but without an enhancer, perhaps expression is low. But the question says the antibodies were raised against overexpressed proteins, suggesting that the expression is happening. Also, the IRES for the receptor should allow some expression without a strong promoter. But if the enhancer is missing, perhaps neither ligand nor receptor is expressed. But the problem is that the mice are homozygous, so maybe the enhancer is present. Not sure.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, wait, the vector has the receptor ORF at 3' fused to eGFP. So, in the construct, is the eGFP in frame with the receptor? If the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP, then when Cre excises it, the receptor and eGFP should be in frame. If the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP should be under the same reading frame. But if they're not in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed correctly. So that would mean the eGFP isn't being made because the frameshift caused a premature stop or no proper eGFP.

Wait, but the vector is designed with the receptor ORF followed by a stop in a lox cassette, then eGFP. So when Cre is active, it removes the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a single protein. If the eGFP is not in frame, the resulting protein would be a fusion, but if the frame is wrong, maybe the eGFP isn't produced. Or perhaps the stop codon is in the wrong frame, causing a premature termination.

So, if the eGFP is not in frame, then when the stop is excised, the receptor and eGFP would be in the same ORF. Wait, no: the receptor is the ORF, then the stop, then eGFP. When the stop is removed, the receptor is followed by eGFP, but without a stop. So the construct would be receptor-eGFP as a fusion, but in the same frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP would not be correctly translated.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed. If the eGFP is not in frame, then the protein would be a receptor with possibly a frame shift, leading to a nonfunctional protein, but eGFP might not be expressed because it's out of frame. So the Western blot wouldn't show eGFP. Alternatively, if the frames are incorrect, the eGFP might not be expressed, so no signal.

Alternatively, the stop cassette between ligand and mCherry and the other between receptor and eGFP could have issues. But according to the setup, the ligand is under CBA and the receptor uses IRES. So when Cre is present, in neural crest cells, the ligand and receptor should be expressed.

But in the Western blot, the
