Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about particles and symmetries. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

First, I'll need to remember what each of these particles is. I know that phonons are related to vibrations in a crystal lattice. They're quantized sound waves, right? And they arise from the quantization of lattice vibrations. I think phonons come into play in solid-state physics rather than particle physics.

Skyrmions, if I recall, are a type of soliton. They were originally proposed by Skyrme as a model for particles like pions. Skyrmions are solutions in the context of certain field theories, and they have applications in nuclear physics and also in magnetism. They're associated with a kind of topological structure, maybe related to the symmetry breaking in the theory.

Magnons are the quasiparticles associated with the quantized spin waves in a crystal lattice. They describe the spin excitations in magnetic materials. I remember that magnons are related to the NÃ©el state in antiferromagnets, but I'm not entirely sure about their relation to symmetry breaking.

Pions, on the other hand, are the lightest mesons in particle physics. They are pseudoscalar particles, meaning they have zero spin and their wave function changes sign under parity. Pions are the Goldstone bosons resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the strong interaction. So pions are definitely tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Wait, so the question is about which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. So I need to find the one that doesn't arise from such a breaking.

Phonons: I'm not sure about phonons. Do they come from symmetry breaking? Phonons are more about lattice vibrations. They arise when you have a periodic crystal structure, so maybe they have something to do with broken translational symmetry. Because in a crystal, the translational symmetry is broken into a periodic lattice. But I'm not certain if phonons are Goldstone bosons from spontaneous symmetry breaking, or if they're more about the structure of the solid.

Alternatively, maybe phonons are more about the restoring forces in the crystal lattice, kind of like how atoms oscillate around their equilibrium positions. So perhaps phonons are not directly tied to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the same way as pions or other Goldstone bosons.

So, considering that,
