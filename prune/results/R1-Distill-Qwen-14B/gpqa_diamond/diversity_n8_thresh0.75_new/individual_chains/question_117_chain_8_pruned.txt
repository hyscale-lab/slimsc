Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, right? Wait, no, actually stereoisomerism includes different types like cis-trans, enantiomers, diastereomers, etc. Optical isomerism specifically refers to compounds that have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These compounds usually have chiral centers or some sort of asymmetry leading to the presence of enantiomers.

The question is asking which of the given compounds show optical isomerism. The options are four different organic compounds, and I need to check each one.

Let me review each compound:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can sometimes have stereoisomerism if there's a substituent on each ring that creates a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry. Wait, but biphenyls are connected by a single bond, so the arrangement around that bond can lead to different isomers. But for optical isomerism, which is about enantiomers, I think the substituents should be in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. Let's see: the substituents are at 6,6' and 2,2'. So on each ring, the substituents are at opposite positions. Wait, 2 and 6 are across on a benzene ring, right? So on each benzene ring, there's a carbonyl group (from the dicarboxylate) and a nitro group. Are those positions leading to any symmetry? If the substituents are symmetrical across the central bond, then maybe it doesn't have enantiomers. But wait, in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions (same on both rings) and 6,6' (same on both). So the molecule is symmetrical with respect to the central bond, perhaps? Because each ring has substituents in the same positions. Wait, but wait, how are they arranged? If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule not symmetrical, then maybe it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other, the molecule might be achiral. Hmm, but I'm not very confident. Let me think again: the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, and the central bond is between the two rings. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carbonyl (from the dicarboxylate) at 2. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So for each ring, the substituents are para to each other. So the two substituents on each ring are para. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making the molecule symmetrical. Therefore, it wouldn't have optical isomers because it's achiral. So maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. If the substituents are in such a way that the whole molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. But in this case, because each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other, the molecule might be symmetrical. So perhaps compound 1 is achiral and doesn't show optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should get back to this after I check the other compounds.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(CH3)OH? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH2CH(OH)COOH, but wait, the ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure would be methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is (CH3)COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not right because the structure would be:

The acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH? Wait, wait, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But wait, that can't be because the numbering would be from the COOH end. Let me correct: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So the est
