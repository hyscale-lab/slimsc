Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. The question involves identifying Compound X based on some NMR data after a reaction. I remember that NMR spectroscopy is all about the structure of molecules, so I need to parse the given data carefully.

First, let's read the question again. Compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what Compound X was from the options.

Wait, I think 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, maybe used in an elimination reaction or some kind of deprotection. Oh right! It's often used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes. Oh wait, no, wait. Diazabicyclooctane is a strong base, so maybe it's used in ring-opening reactions? Or perhaps it's part of a specific reaction like the Sharpless epoxidation? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's used in an elimination reaction, like to form an epoxide from a diol? Or maybe it's a base that abstracts protons in some kind of rearrangement.

But wait, the product's NMR data is given. Let's look at that. The product is the result of reacting Compound X with this base. So, perhaps the product is an epoxide, since the options given include "epoxide" in some of them.

Wait, looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Oh, all options are epoxides with styryl groups or derivatives. So, the product must be an epoxide. So, Compound X must have a double bond that was epoxidized.

Wait, but the reaction is between X and diazabicyclooctane. Oh, wait, I think that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base that can deprotonate something. Oh, wait, when epoxides are formed, usually an acid
