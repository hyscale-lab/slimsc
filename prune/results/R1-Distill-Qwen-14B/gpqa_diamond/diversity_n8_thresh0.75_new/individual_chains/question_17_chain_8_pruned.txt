Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. So the complex here is CaEDTA^2-? Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, right? So when it complexes with Ca^2+, it forms CaEDTA^2-.

The concentration given is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think this means [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. But I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca^2+], in solution.

Formation constants, K, are usually for the reaction where the metal and ligand combine to form the complex. The formation constant expression is K = [Complex]/([Metal][Ligand]). But wait, in this case, the complex is already formed, and I need to find the dissociation of the complex into Ca^2+ and EDTA.

Wait, actually, the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- â†” CaEDTA^2-
K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming that the solution is at ideal pH where EDTA is in its proper form (like deprotonated enough to be a good ligand), the problem simplifies.

Wait, but in reality, EDTA exists in different protonated forms, but the problem says pH is ideal, so we don't have to worry about that. So I can assume that EDTA is in the form that can bind to Ca^2+.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration as follows:

At equilibrium, if some of the complex dissociates, then:
