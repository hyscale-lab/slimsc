Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves NMR data and reaction mechanisms, so I'll need to break it down.

First, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees: probably a benzene ring (3) plus a double bond or ring (maybe an enal or something else) and maybe an amine or ketone group.

Looking at the NMR data: 

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a strong deshielded proton. This could be an aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons, maybe on a CH2 group. 

6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – these are typical of two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted on a benzene ring. So maybe two substituents on a benzene ring, each with two protons. Like a para-substituted group with two substituents in the ring? Or perhaps two different substituents on the benzene.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, maybe two protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a hydroxyl group or an enol. Or maybe they're part of a conjugated system, like in a vinyl group. 

3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – this is a singlet or a doublet, but for two protons. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2 or CH2 connected to an aromatic ring. The d suggests they're next to each other, maybe attached to something like a CH2 that's part of a chain attached to another group.

Wait, looking again, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. So perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl or another CH2. Or maybe it's part of an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has an aromatic ring with substituents. The aldehyde group would be at one position. Let me think about the possible structure.

If there's an aldehyde (from the 9.72 ppm), and perhaps a benzene ring with substituents, maybe it's something like benzaldehyde but with more substituents. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be two para-substituted benzene rings. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO, so perhaps it's a diphenyl compound.

Wait, C8H9NO. Benzene is C6H6. So the other part must be C2H3NO. That's a bit tricky. Wait, C2H3NO? Let's see, possible functional groups. Maybe a CH2 group attached to a carbonyl and something else. Wait, C2H3NO could be something like an amine, but more likely a carbonyl group with some substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with another substituent. Let me think about the NMR. The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps part of an ether or ester, but in this case, maybe an alkoxy group. But wait, the O is in the molecular formula, so maybe it's a hydroxyl? Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent to a CH2.

Wait, the aldehyde is at 9.72. Then, maybe a CH2 group next to that. So, R-CHO where R is a group with a CH2 attached. The CH2 at 3.66 ppm might be connected to another group, perhaps a benzene ring or another substituent.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with water or an alcohol. Or perhaps it's part of an enol structure, which could be in equilibrium with a carbonyl.

Putting it all together, maybe the structure is something like diphenylbut-3-enal. Let's see. But wait, how does that fit.

Wait, another approach: The reaction steps. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: this is typically used for diazotization, which is usually for aromatic amines. So perhaps the compound has an aromatic amine group. But wait, the initial compound's formula is C8H9NO. So N is present. If it's an amine, then perhaps after diazotization, it would undergo some reaction.

Wait, but the initial step after adding NaNO2 and HCl is usually used for diazotization. So if the compound is an aromatic amine, it would form a diazonium salt. Then, what's next?

Second step is H2O. Hmm, that's not enough info. Third step is aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds like a hydrolysis reaction, perhaps of a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts under aqueous KOH and heat can undergo hydrolysis, especially if they are aromatic diazonium salts. For example, if the position allows, it can form a phenol after hydrolysis. Or, if it's an aliphatic amine, maybe it's a different process, but more likely, this is about an aromatic amine.

So the initial compound likely has an aromatic amine group. But wait, let's look again
