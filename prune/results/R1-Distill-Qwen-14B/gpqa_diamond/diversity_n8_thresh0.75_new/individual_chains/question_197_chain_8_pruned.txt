Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the product. The options are A, B, C, D, all different organic compounds. Let me look at the IR and NMR data first.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which suggests there's either an -OH group or an alkyne because those regions usually show up there. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (a broad singlet, 1H), which might be an aldehyde proton or possibly an -OH, but considering the IR, the aldehyde would have a strong peak around 2800-2700 for the C-H stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. The 8.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 7.2 ppm doublet (2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. So maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) might be a CH group attached to something else, perhaps near an electronegative group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is probably a CH3 group attached to a CH which is itself attached to something elseâ€”like a branch. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a CH2CH2CH3 group, maybe a methyl at the end of a chain, like an ethyl or propyl group.

Putting this together, I'm thinking the structure has a benzene ring with substituents. The IR has a carbonyl, so maybe an ester or acid. The NMR shows a peak at 10.5, which might be a carbonyl group. Wait, if it's a carbonyl, the 10.5 could be a carboxylic acid proton because those typically show up around 10-12 ppm as broad signals. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but I don't see the characteristic aldehyde triplet. So more likely, it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait: the IR has a 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. A carboxylic acid typically has a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes higher. So that fits.

The aromatic region in the NMR supports a para-substituted benzene. So perhaps two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is at position 4, another at position 1? Or maybe it's a substituent at position 4 and another elsewhere. Hmm. Let me think.

Looking at the substituents, the 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester group or an acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the structure could be a benzene ring with a COOH group. But the other groups?

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (2H) as a multiplet suggests maybe a CH2 group attached to another group. The 1.4 ppm (3H) as a doublet suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to something else. The 0.9 ppm triplet is a CH2CH2CH3 group, so maybe a ethyl or propyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a chain ending in a carb
