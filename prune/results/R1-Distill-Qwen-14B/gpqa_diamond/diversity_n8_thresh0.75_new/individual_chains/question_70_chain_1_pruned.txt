Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. My goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, molecular symmetry groups... I remember that these are part of group theory, which is used to classify the symmetry of molecules. Common symmetry groups include things like C2, which is a two-fold rotation; D4h is a higher symmetry with a four-fold rotation and inversion, maybe; D∞h is like a linear molecule with infinite symmetry, and C2v is a two-fold rotation combined with a mirror plane.

First, I need to figure out what each of these compounds is. Let's start breaking down the reactions.

1. Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.

What forms a bright red product when a solid reacts with a gas? I'm thinking of metals reacting with gases. One possibility is the formation of a metal oxide. For example, maybe A is iron, and B is sulfur dioxide? Wait, but if you have a solid reacting with a gas, perhaps it's a metal reacting with a diatomic gas. The bright red color makes me think of something like Fe2O3, but that's reddish. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide. Wait, another thought: if A is Fe and B is Cl2, but that usually forms FeCl3, which is more yellow. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Wait, 8 equivalents. That suggests that B is a diatomic molecule, because 8 would be a multiple that fits with diatomic. Let's think about nitrogen. If A is magnesium and B is nitrogen, but Mg3N2 is the product, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, what about a reaction where A is a metal and B is O2? Like, say, aluminum and O2 forms Al2O3, but that's white. Wait, maybe the reaction is more about a sulfur containing compound. Oh, wait, if B is bromine (Br2), then maybe A is a metal that reacts with Br2. For example, Fe reacts with Br2 to form FeBr2 or FeBr3. But does that give a bright red product? Alternatively, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move to the next reaction and
