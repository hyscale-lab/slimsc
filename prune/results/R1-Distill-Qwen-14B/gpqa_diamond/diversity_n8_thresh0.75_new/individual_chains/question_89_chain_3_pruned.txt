Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several transformations. The final part is about determining the NMR coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in product 3.

First, I'll try to outline what each reaction does.

The first part says 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to give a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester. The NMR shows a signal at 4.79 ppm integrating for 2H. That region is often around where alcohols or maybe ethers protons show up, but considering the IR, maybe it's an alcohol turning into something else. Wait, KOH is a strong base. Oh, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would undergo elimination when treated with a base like KOH. So maybe it's an E2 mechanism, eliminating HBr twice and forming an alkene. But wait, where would the alkene form? 1,3-dibromoadamantane... when you eliminate two HBr, you form a diene? No, wait, 1,3-dibromo would eliminate in such a way to form a double bond. So perhaps the product is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's a bridge structure.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Each Br is on adjacent carbons? Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the Brs on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. When treated with KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules, probably forming an alkene. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on opposite ends of the structure. Eliminating two HBr would form a double bond. But where?

Wait, another possibility: elimination of two HBr could form a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps we get an epoxide? No, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent for epoxide. Wait, but the product has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. Hmm. So maybe the initial reaction isn't
