Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to relativity, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. So, the first astronaut (let's call him A) has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. The second (B) has 3m and 0.5c.

The question has two parts: the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other, and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. So the relative speed isn't simply 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c, right? Because that's what the non-relativistic approach would say. But since they're moving at significant fractions of c (they're 60% and 50% of c), we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The relativistic formula for relative velocity is v = (u - v') / (1 - (u v')/c²), where u is the velocity of one object as observed in the other's frame. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If object A is moving at u in the lab frame, and object B is moving at v in the lab frame, then from A's perspective, B's velocity is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, no, the formula is v = (v' + u)/(1 + (u v')/c²), but that's when you're transforming from one frame to another moving at u. Wait, maybe I should get the formula correct.

Wait, the general velocity addition formula is: if frame S' is moving at speed u relative to S, then the velocity v' of an object in S' is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/c²). So if, in the lab frame, A is moving at u=0.6c and B at v=0.5c, then from A's frame, B's speed is v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²).

Let me compute that numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So the numerator is -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.5 * 0.6) c² / c² → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (-0.1c) / 0.7 → approximately -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates that from A's perspective, B is moving at -0.142857c, which is 0.142857c in the opposite direction. But since the question is about relative speed, which is a magnitude, so it's 0.142857c, approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. Total energy in relativity includes the rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but wait, wait. Wait, no. In the system's rest frame, the total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut as seen from that frame.

Wait, but the problem says "the total energy of the system." Hmm. Wait, in relativity, energy is frame-dependent. But the problem must be referring to the total energy in the lab frame, perhaps, or the center-of-momentum frame? Or maybe it's the sum of their rest energies plus kinetic energies in the lab frame.

Wait, no, but the way the question is phrased, perhaps it's the total energy measured in the lab frame. But wait, each astronaut has their own kinetic energy. But wait, the total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies.

Wait, each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A (2m, 0.6c), let's compute gamma_A: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) =1/0.8=1.25.

So energy of A: gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (3m, 0.5c), gamma_B: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) =1/sqrt(0.75) ≈1/0.8660≈1.1547.

So energy of B: gamma_B * 3m c² ≈1.1547 *3 m c²≈3.464 m c².

Total energy would be their sum: 2.5 +3.464 ≈5.964 m c²≈5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c², and D says E=5 mc². So the total energy is around 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

But wait, let me check if the energy is calculated correctly. Oh wait, because each astronaut's energy is gamma * mass * c². So for A, mass is 2m, speed 0.6c. So gamma is 1.25, so 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c². For B, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) =1/sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(4/3)=~1.1547. So 1.1547 *3m c²=3.464 m c². Sum is 5.964 m c².

So that's about 5.96 mc², which is option C's energy. The relative speed is 0.14c, so option C is the one that matches both. Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

Option D: same speed but E=5 mc^2. So option C is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The total energy is the sum of their energies in the lab frame? Or is it something else? Because in the lab frame, each has their own energy. So if the lab frame is the one where the two astronauts are moving with 0.6c and 0.5c, then the total energy is indeed the sum of their individual energies.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic relative velocity and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Velocity
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of one astronaut as seen by the other. For astronaut A (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)) and astronaut B (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)), the relative velocity \(v_{\text{rel}}\) is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A (\(2m\), \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B (\(3m\), \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

This matches **Option C**, which states \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and \(E = 5.96m c^2\).

### Final Answer
Answer: C
