Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, the ring has two substituents. The FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Ester groups usually have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm^-1, right? So that's a key point—this compound has an ester functional group.

Now, the 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let's break that down. The signals are categorized as two aromatic-H signals, two vinyl-H signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals for –CH3 groups. Also, there are no –CH2 signals. Hmm.

Wait, so the aromatic ring is 6-membered, so benzene. Di-substituted benzene would have two substituents. The substituents could be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But the NMR signals for aromatic protons would depend on the substitution pattern. If it's para, there are two sets of equivalent protons. For meta, maybe two doublets or something else. Or if it's ortho, perhaps a more complex splitting.

But wait, the aromatic signals in the NMR are two. So that suggests that the two substituents create two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, in para substitution, the two aromatic H environments are equivalent, giving two signals. Or maybe it's something else, like substituents in such a way that the ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons. But I'm not entirely sure about that part yet.

Next, the vinyl-H signals. Two signals here. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, which is adjacent to substituents. So, perhaps the ester is part of a vinyl group attached to the aromatic ring. Wait, esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R, but in this case, the substituent on the benzene might be an ester group. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, the substituent could be an ester group attached to the ring. But esters are typically RCOOR', so maybe the substituent is an acyloxy group? Or perhaps part of a vinyl ester.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl-H
