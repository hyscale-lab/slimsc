Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... I think that's a reaction to form an acid from an ester or something like that. Wait, no, maybe it's more about the hydrolysis of an ester or another functional group.

First, I'll look at the IR data to get an idea of what functional groups are present. The IR shows strong absorption between 3400-2500 cm-1. That's probably O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the other peaks, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak which usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the peak around 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let's break it down.

The 1H NMR shows:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually broader and around 10-12 ppm. But wait, wait, in the case of a carbonyl, if it's an acid, the proton would be around 10-12. But the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which for a carboxylic acid would be more like 1700-1725, but if it's an ester, it's around 1735-1765. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone? No, because then the IR wouldn't have that O-H stretch in 3400-2500.

Wait, maybe the peak at 1720 is an ester. Because esters have carbonyls around 1720-1750. So if that's the case, then the IR's 3400-2500 might correspond to an O-H from a hydroxyl group, but wait, if it's an ester, where would the O-H come from? Or maybe it's an acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde and some other group. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone adjacent to an aromatic ring.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, so that's key. Another possibility is a ketone, but then the 3400-2500 might be from something else. Wait, the 1H NMR has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet. That could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group, like a ketone. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but let me look at the NMR more carefully. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet. Could that be an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but sometimes a bit higher. But the broadening suggests maybe a hydrogen exchange, like an acidic proton. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the 1H NMR would have a broad peak, but wait, the 1720 in IR would then correspond to a carboxylic acid's carbonyl. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a carbonyl around 1700-1725 cm-1. So that fits. But then, how about the O-H in the IR? Carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is in the given IR range. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but the problem says that the compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What happens when you treat a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI? Oh, wait, I think that's the HWE (Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons) reaction, but no, that's for making alkenes from esters. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, when you treat a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus, it might be a way to make an acid chloride or something else. Wait, or perhaps it's a case of the Clemmensen reduction? No, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat for ketones to give alkanes. Alternatively, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an ester. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of esters. Wait, no, more commonly, esters hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions. Alternatively, if it's a nitrile, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester, and when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. Or perhaps it's a Wittig reaction condition.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me first figure out what compound X is.

Looking at the NMR again:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Maybe an aldehyde proton, but I'm not sure because it's a broad peak. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid, but the broad singlet might indicate exchange, but in that case, the 1720 in IR would be a carboxylic acid's carbonyl.

Wait, the other NMR peaks:

-8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So for example, in para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to the substituent would be one doublet, and the other two would be another doublet. So that would fit, like in para-substituted benzene, perhaps with substituents at 4 positions.

So perhaps the ring is para-substituted with two substituents. But wait, no, wait, in para-substituted benzene with one substituent, the coupling would be between the two protons on either side. So maybe it's a para-dimethyl, but that's just thinking. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent with more than one group attached. Wait, but the IR doesn't show a peak for CH3 groups attached to the ring, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, the NMR also shows a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That could be a methine (CH) group adjacent to a carbonyl group. So maybe it's a ketone, like Ar-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2 or something. Hmm, but wait, looking at the other peaks: 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which would be a CH3 attached to a CH2. Also, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, so perhaps part of an ethyl group.

Wait, putting it all together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a ketone or ester group, a CH2 group, and an ethyl chain. Alternatively, maybe it's an aryl ester with a side chain.

Wait, another approach: Let's assign the NMR data.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): This could be an aldehyde proton. If so, then the compound has an aldehyde group.

But wait, if it's an aldehyde, then the IR would have a peak around 2800-2700 cm-1 for the aldehyde's C-H stretch, but the given IR data says 3400-2500, which is a broader range, maybe including O-H.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid. Let me check: The 1H NMR of a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak around 12 ppm or lower, but 10.5 is a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but if the aldehyde is at 10.5, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde, like in an aromatic aldehyde. For example, para-ethoxybenzaldehyde or something like that.

Wait, but let me think about the other parts of the NMR. The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm doublets could be a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group. For example, a nitro group or a carbonyl group.

So, considering that, if the benzene ring is para-substituted with a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde), then the ring protons would appear as doublets.

Wait, if it's an aldehyde, then the structure would be Ar-CHO. So the aldehyde proton would be around 10 ppm. But then, the other groups would be attached via the aldehyde. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which for an aldehyde would be lower than an ester. Wait, no, aldehydes have lower carbonyl frequencies than esters. Wait, no, esters are around 1720-1750, while aldehydes are around 1700-1720. So 1720 could be either, but perhaps more likely an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester, like an aryl ester, such as benzyl acetate or something similar.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR shifts again. The 2.9 ppm multiplet is 1H, which might be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2, and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2, perhaps part of a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Wait, but 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group.

So putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is an ester group, maybe something like OAc (acetate) attached to a chain.

Wait, but let me consider the IR again. 1720 cm-1 suggests an ester. So perhaps the compound is an aryl ester. For example, something like Ar-O-CO-R.

So, for instance, if the benzene ring is para-substituted with an ester group, say, R-O-CO-phenyl.

Wait, but let's try to sketch the possible structure. The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5, but wait, if it's an ester, then the aldehyde proton wouldn't be there. Hmm. Maybe I got that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is not an aldehyde but something else. Wait, another possibility: Could it be an aromatic ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester, and another substituent that's a CH group, as per the 2.9 ppm peak.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of the correct approach.

Let's look at the options given:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so the options are either benzoic acids, or substituted toluenes.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, which would be a phenyl group attached to the alpha carbon of a propanoic acid. Wait, that would be like Ph-CH2-COOH.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative, with a sec-butyl group in the para position relative to a methyl group.

Option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which would be a toluene with an isobutyl group in the para position.

Wait, but looking back, the IR has a peak at 1720, which would suggest a carbonyl group. So options B and D are alkanes, so they wouldn't have a carbonyl. So the correct options are A and C.

So the compound X must have a carbonyl group, so options A and C are the possibilities.

Now, looking at the NMR data for option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Benzoic acid would have a COOH group. So the 10.5 ppm peak would be the COOH proton, which is a broad peak. The NMR of benzoic acid usually has that around 10-12 ppm. Then, the aromatic protons would be at around 8 ppm. But wait, in 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the ring substituents would be a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Wait, but the NMR of the given compound has two doublets in the aromatic region, which suggests two sets of two protons each, meaning a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but if it's benzoic acid, where the substituent is in the para position, then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, each with 2H, which matches the NMR data. So maybe that fits.

Wait, but wait. Benzoic acid is a meta director, but when you have a substituent in the para position, the ring's other protons would be in two doublets.

But looking at the NMR, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) would correspond to the two sets of protons. In a para-substituted benzene, the two adjacent protons would be equivalent, so each pair would be a doublet. So that makes sense.

So, the aromatic region fits a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with a COOH group in one position and another group in the para position. Wait, but if it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the substituents are COOH and sec-butyl in para positions. So the ring would have two substituents: COOH and sec-butyl. But then the NMR would show more complexity, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that only two distinct protons are present.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider the other parts of the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would correspond to a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. In the case of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2- ?

Wait, perhaps the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group attached in a certain way.

Wait, maybe in the given compound, the CH group at 2.9 ppm is part of a chain adjacent to the benzene ring. So let's think of it as:

Ph-COOH, but perhaps with some branching. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester group attached to the benzene, like Ph-O-CO-R, where R is a branched chain.

Wait, but the NMR shows peaks at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). That looks like a chain with a terminal ethyl group. So perhaps it's a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2 or something similar.

Wait, another approach: the NMR peaks could correspond to a chain like this: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. Hmm, that's an iso-butyl group. Wait, but let me think. An iso-butyl group would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached where? So, for example, in iso-butyl, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) which is a terminal CH3 group. That suggests an ethyl chain. So maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CO-O-R, where R is an ethyl group. But then, the 10.5 ppm peak would be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH group at 2.9 ppm is part of a cyclopropane ring, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester, like PhCOOR, where R is a branched alkyl chain.

So, for example, if the structure is Ph-CO-O-R, where R is a branched chain. But then the NMR would show peaks for the R group.

Wait, considering the NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): this could be the CH adjacent to the carbonyl oxygen in an ester group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group next to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH2.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): another CH3 at the end of a chain.

Putting this together, the R group in the ester would be something like CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, perhaps it's a butyl group. Wait, perhaps it's a iso-butyl group. Wait, an iso-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2, but that would make the NMR peaks for the CH2 and CH3 groups.

Wait, maybe the R group is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. No, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, the R group could be a tertiary butyl group, but that would have a different NMR.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of an ester to form an acid. Wait, no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, what reaction occurs when a carbonyl group is treated with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. For example, if the compound is an ester, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would lead to the formation of a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it could be a reduction. But wait, red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another thought: HI is a strong acid and a good source of H+ and I-. Red phosphorus might be acting as a catalyst or in some other role. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the Fittig reaction, but that involves aryl halides and is not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. In that case, if the starting material is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid. So if the starting material is an ester, which is option C, which is a benzoic acid, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but options A and C involve a benzoic acid or a propanoic acid group.

Wait, no: option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid. So if X is an ester, then upon hydrolysis, it would form a carboxylic acid. So if X is, say, an ester like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Alternatively, perhaps the ester is something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is an ester, and after hydrolysis, it becomes the corresponding acid.

So, if the starting material is an ester, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data for the starting material X, the 10.5 ppm peak may be the aldehyde proton. But if X is an ester, then that would not fit. So perhaps that peak is something else.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak is not an aldehyde but a carboxylic acid. So if X is a benzoic acid, then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is a reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. But the options don't show alcohols. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid from an ester. So if X is an ester, and after reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

So, let's consider option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Suppose X is the corresponding ester, like methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate. Then, upon hydrolysis, it would form benzoic acid.

But then, the NMR of the starting material would show the ester's methyl group as a singlet around 3.7 ppm, which isn't present in the given data. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propanoic acid ester, like option A. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the ester would be something like ethyl 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoate. The NMR would have the ethyl group's CH2 around 4.2 ppm as a quartet, which isn't present here. So perhaps that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the starting material X is an aldehyde. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a reduction. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. So if X is an aldehyde, then the product would be an alkane.

But looking at the options, none of them are alkanes except B and D, which are toluene derivatives. So perhaps that's the case.

Wait, let's think again. If X is an aldehyde, its NMR would have a peak around 9-10 ppm, and the IR would show the aldehyde carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. The other substituents would fit an aromatic ring with an aldehyde group. Then, upon Clemmensen reduction, the aldehyde would become a methylene group, CH2.

Wait, the given options for the product after reaction include options B and D, which are toluene derivatives with alkyl substituents. For example, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which would be a toluene with a sec-butyl group and a methyl group at the para position.

So, perhaps X is an aldehyde attached to a benzene ring, with a substituent that upon reduction forms a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let me try to reconstruct X.

If the product after reaction is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a methyl group, then perhaps X was an aldehyde adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms a sec-butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an aldehyde with a substituent that is a ketone, which upon reduction becomes a CH2 group, leading to a branching.

Wait, perhaps the structure of X is a benzaldehyde with a side chain that includes a ketone. For example, something like benzaldehyde with a -CH2-CO-R group. Upon reduction, the ketone would become a CH2 group, so the aldehyde becomes a CH2, leading to a longer chain.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think about the NMR of the starting material X again.

The NMR of X has a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which could be an aldehyde proton. Then, the aromatic peaks would be for a para-substituted benzene. The other peaks suggest a chain with a CH, CH2, and terminal CH3.

So, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 group attached to the ring. Wait, but that would be a butyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3)2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is para-substituted with a group like -CH2-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2. Hmm, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group that's branched.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the IR and NMR data for the starting material X.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, possibly an aldehyde or ketone or ester.

The NMR has a 10.5 peak (maybe aldehyde), and the aromatic protons as two doublets, so para-substituted.

Then, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl (like in a ketone), and the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) and 1.4 ppm (d,3H), 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be a chain like -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait, that would make a pentyl group, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the chain is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but how would that fit into the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO- group attached to the benzene, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a branched side chain. For example:

Ph-CHO-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

But then, the NMR would have the aldehyde proton at 10.5, and the chain would show up as CH2 and CH(CH3)2.

But the NMR has 2.9 ppm for 1H (m), which could be the CH in CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CHO-CH2-CH(CH3)2, but that would make the chain a bit long.

But then, looking at the options, after the reaction, the aldehyde would be reduced to CH2, and the ketone (if present) would also be reduced. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2 group, making X an aromatic ketone with a substituent that's a secondary carbon.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, if X is the corresponding ester, then it would form option C.

But the NMR of X doesn't show the ester's oxygenated CH2 (like around 4 ppm), which would be present in an ester. So maybe X is not an ester but a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in that case, the 1720 cm-1 in IR would be a carboxylic acid's carbonyl. So, the compound X could be a benzoic acid derivative.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, I'm not certain about the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is a dehydration. For example, if X is a carboxylic acid, perhaps it loses water to form an anhydride, but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. So if X contains a carbonyl group that's a ketone or aldehyde, then the product would be an alkane.

Wait, but if X is a benzoic acid, then it doesn't have a ketone or aldehyde group to reduce. So that wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it gets hydrolyzed into a carboxylic acid. So in that case, X would be an ester, and the product would be the acid.

Looking at the options, option C is the acid. So if X is the corresponding ester, then the product would be option C.

But then, the NMR of X would have the ester's oxygenated CH2 groups, which I don't see in the given data. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid from an acid chloride. But without knowing for sure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a hydrolysis but a substitution. If the starting material is an alkyne, but that's not indicated by the data.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options again and see which one fits the NMR data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The NMR would have:

- 10.5 ppm: COOH proton (broad, singlet).
- Aromatic protons as two doublets, integrating to 2H each, at around 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.
- The sec-butyl group: So the structure would be:

Ph-COOH with a sec-butyl group in the para position. The sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH3)2.

In the NMR, the CH(CH3)2 would show up as a multiplet around 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) for the methyl groups attached to the CH, and the CH2 adjacent would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). Wait, no, perhaps the CH group in the sec-butyl would be at 2.9 ppm.

But wait, the NMR shows a peak at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could be the CH2 groups adjacent to the benzene ring and the CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-COOH with a substituent that's -(CH2)2CH(CH3)2. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached via a CH, but I'm not sure.

In any case, considering the options, and the reaction conditions, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying a compound (Compound X) based on its IR and NMR data and determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows strong absorption at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (indicative of O-H or N-H stretching), 1720 cm⁻¹ (a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid or ester), and peaks at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretching). The NMR data provides further details about the molecular structure.

### Key Analysis of IR and NMR Data:
1. **IR Data**:
   - The peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or ester.
   - The broad absorption at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ is consistent with an O-H stretch, supporting the presence of a carboxylic acid.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of the acidic proton in a carboxylic acid.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet likely corresponding to a CH group adjacent to the carbonyl group.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** and **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Peaks consistent with a CH₂ group and a CH₃ group, respectively, part of a branched alkyl chain.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A terminal CH₃ group, indicating an ethyl chain.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are commonly used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. If Compound X is an ester, the reaction would yield the corresponding carboxylic acid.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This compound does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the sec-butyl group indicated by the peaks at 2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, and 1.4 ppm.
- **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This is an alkane and does not contain a carbonyl group, inconsistent with the IR data.
- **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: This compound fits the data:
  - The carboxylic acid group explains the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the NMR peak at 10.5 ppm.
  - The para-substituted benzene ring matches the aromatic peaks at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm.
  - The sec-butyl group accounts for the peaks at 2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, and 1.4 ppm.
- **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This is an alkane and does not contain a carbonyl group, inconsistent with the IR data.

### Conclusion:
Compound X is most consistent with **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. Upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, if X were an ester, it would hydrolyze to form this carboxylic acid. Given the data, X is already the carboxylic acid, and no further reaction occurs. Thus, the final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

Answer: C
