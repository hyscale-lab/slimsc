Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it says we have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle that can move along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but when we measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval, right?

Wait no, the wave function is given, but the modulus squared gives the probability density. Oh wait, but the problem says that when they measured the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this region, otherwise there would be some probability of finding the particles there. So the wave function must be non-zero only between 1 and 3. Otherwise, the measurements would sometimes find particles outside.

But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that expression is a complex number, which is good because wave functions are usually complex in quantum mechanics. But for the wave function to be zero outside 1 and 3, does the given expression imply that?

Wait, no, the expression they give is the wave function in a part of space where the particle can exist. So maybe the wave function is defined as this in the region between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Oh, but wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1
