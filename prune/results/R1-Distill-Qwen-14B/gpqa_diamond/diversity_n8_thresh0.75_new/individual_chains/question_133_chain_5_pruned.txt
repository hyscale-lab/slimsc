Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again and figure out what's going on. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? 

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Their molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation unless it's about activity coefficients, which I probably don't need to worry about here.

The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The species in solution depend on the pH, but I'm looking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The various species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The different Ka values tell us the strengths of each deprotonation step.

So the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate decahydrate or something? Wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the formula can be written as Na2HPO4·2H2O, which upon dissolving would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Each mole of this salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait—since HPO4^2- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become PO4^3-) or a base (gaining a proton to become H2PO4^-). So in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Depending on the pH, these can interconvert.

But wait, the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the solution is a buffer solution, because it contains a weak acid and its conjugate base. Because H2PO4^- is a weak acid (since H3PO4 is a triprotic acid) and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base.

So, the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests that the solution is a buffer. The pH of the solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH to the pKa and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base and acid.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Hmm. PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

But wait, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3- (since Ka3 is very small). Alternatively, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2- (with Ka2). So, the PO4^3- concentration will be determined by the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

But since HPO4^2- is a weak base (because PO4^3- is a stronger base), it can accept a proton from water to form H2PO4^-? Or wait, no. The reaction is HPO4^2- + H2O ↔ H2PO4^- + OH^- (with Kb = Kw / Ka3). Because Ka3 is the third ionization, for HPO4^2- losing a proton to become PO4^3-.

Wait, correction: H3PO4 donates protons in three steps.

First ionization: H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 = 7.5e-3

Second ionization: H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8

Third ionization: HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12

So, in solution, the HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3- (which is a very weak acid, since Ka3 is so small, so the reverse is favored: HPO4^2- is a base,
