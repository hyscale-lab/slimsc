Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about optical isomerism, which I know has to do with molecules that can rotate plane-polarized light. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centersâ€”atoms bonded to four different groups. Those molecules are then called enantiomers, and they can be mirror images of each other, which is why they rotate light in opposite directions.

The question gives four organic compounds and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing a combination of the four compounds.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
Hmm, okay. Biphenyl rings connected at the 1,1' positions. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions on each ring, and carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2' positions. Wait, so each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. 

Do these substituents create any chiral centers? Let me think. The biphenyl structure itself can have some stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral. For example, if the substituents are in positions that don't allow a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the rings are connected at positions 1 and 1', so the numbering in biphenyl is such that the two rings are attached at their 1 positions. Then positions 2 are adjacent to the connection, and 6 is across from that on the same ring. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

Wait, but nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing, but that's not relevant here. The question is about chiral centers. Are the ester groups (carboxylate esters) on the biphenyl rings? So each ring has at position 2 a COOCH3 group and at position 6 a NO2 group.

If the substituents are such that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it would be ch
