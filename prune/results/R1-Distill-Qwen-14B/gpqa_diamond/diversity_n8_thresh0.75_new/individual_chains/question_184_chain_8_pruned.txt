Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I need to figure out which sequence of reactions in the options leads to the desired product.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw its structure mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), position 2 is a tert-butyl group (C(CH2CH3)3?), and position 3 is a nitro group (NO2). Wait, actually, the numbering might be such that position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So, in the benzene ring, we have three substituents in adjacent positions, but each in specific spots.

I remember that when substituents are in a meta arrangement, the order of reactions matters because each new group is added based on the directing effects of the existing groups.

Let me think about the possible reaction steps. The starting material is benzene. The substituents we need are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. 

Nitro is a strong meta director. Ethoxy is an activating group (ortho/para director), and tert-butyl is a bulky group, but it's an activating, ortho/para-directing group because it's an alkyl group.

Wait, no, wait. The tert-butyl group is a bulky alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating (since they donate electrons through sigma bonds) and are ortho/para directors.

Wait, but nitro groups are deactivating (they withdraw electrons via resonance) and meta directors. So, when adding nitro after ethoxy, the directing effect depends on the order.

Wait, but the order of adding substituents is crucial. Let me think about how substituents are added.

We need to have three substituents on the benzene ring. Let's break it down.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Because in numbering, the positions should be as low as possible. Let me imagine the benzene ring.

Let me number such that the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions relative to each other. Let me visualize it:

Imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Alternatively, maybe position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 4 positions? No, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitro
