Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me think about what I know about parallax and how stars are distributed.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky as observed from Earth at different times of the year. The closer a star is to us, the larger its parallax. So, a star with a larger parallax is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question states that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution probably means that on average, stars are evenly spread out in all directions. But how does that relate to the number of stars per unit range of parallax as a function of parallax itself?

Hmm, I remember that distance in astronomy often relates to parallax inversely. The formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax: distance d = 1 / plx. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and smaller parallax means more distant.

Now, the problem is about how the number of stars per unit of parallax (per unit plx) changes with plx. So, if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would fall into that range?

Wait, but wait. The number of stars in a volume depends on how much volume there is at that distance. Because stars are spread uniformly, the number density is uniform, so the number of stars in a certain volume depends on that volume.

So, volume around a star at distance d would be a spherical shell with radius d and thickness delta_d. The volume of that shell is 4π d² delta_d. Because the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume.

But wait, I'm dealing with parallax here. Since d = 1/plx, parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. Let me express everything in terms of parallax. So, d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d.

So, the volume element in terms of parallax. Let's see. When plx changes by a small amount dplx, how does that relate to the distance change delta_d? Let's calculate delta_d in terms of dplx. 

Differentiating both sides of d = 1/plx, we get:

delta_d = - (1 / plx²) * delta_plx.

Wait, but since plx is positive, and as plx increases, d decreases. So maybe I should take the absolute value. So, the change in distance delta_d is proportional to 1/(plx)^2 times delta_plx.

But wait, I'm more interested in the volume. The volume shell at distance d with thickness delta_d is 4π d² delta_d. Let's substitute delta_d in terms of delta_plx.

delta_d = (delta_plx) * (1 / (plx)^2 )

So, the volume shell is 4π d² * (delta_plx / plx² )

But d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/(plx^2). Substitute that:

Volume = 4π * (1/plx²) * (delta_plx / plx² )

Which simplifies to 4π * (delta_plx) / plx^4.

Oh, so the volume is proportional to 1/(plx^4) times delta_plx. Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume (assuming uniform density), the number of stars in a small range of plx (delta_plx) around plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. If the number of stars per unit plx is N, then dN/dplx is the number of stars per unit plx. From the above, the number of stars in delta_plx is proportional to delta_plx / plx^4. So, dN/dplx = 1/plx^4.

So, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A
