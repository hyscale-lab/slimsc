Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the reactions are as follows:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. Gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. I need to figure out what E is, and then its molecular symmetry. Let me try to deduce each compound step by step.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. So A is a solid, B is a gas, and C is bright red. Bright red solids or products... maybe something like iron(III) oxide? But wait, iron oxides are usually more of a reddish color. Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen? No, because B is a gas, so possible gases like Cl2, Br2, but they're diatomic. Alternatively, maybe B is O2, but that's not a gas that would form a red product necessarily.

Wait, another thought: if A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, then reacting 8 equivalents would mean a high oxidation state. Maybe A is iron, because iron(III) chloride is a possibility. Let me think.

Wait, wait—bright red product C. What else is bright red? Copper(II) compounds are blue, so that's not it. How about Mn compounds? MnO2 is dark brown. Wait, maybe C is a polyatomic ion or molecule. Another possibility is that C is a transition metal complex.

Wait, perhaps C is a transition metal with a high oxidation state. Let me think of the reactions.

In reaction 3, C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So when C reacts with water, it's probably an acid-base reaction. Suppose C is a salt. For example, if C is a metal chloride, when it reacts with water, maybe it doesn't produce two acids. Wait, but F and G are both acids, so perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids.

Wait, also
