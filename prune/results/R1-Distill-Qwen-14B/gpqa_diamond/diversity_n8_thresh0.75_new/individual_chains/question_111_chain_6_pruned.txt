Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting out. Let's take a deep breath and tackle each part step by step.

The question has two reactions, A and B, and I need to choose the major products from the options given. Let's start with the first reaction.

Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK.

Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So this is likely an enolate formation reaction. The starting material is a ketone, cyclohexanone derivative. Enolate chemistry usually involves deprotonation at the alpha position. But wait, where are the alpha positions here?

Looking at 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1. The alpha carbons would be positions 2 and maybe 6, but position 6 has a methyl group as well. Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 (ethyl), 6 (methyl?), and the carbonyl is at 1. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a ketone at C1, an ethyl group at C2, and methyl groups at C2 and C6? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylâ€”so C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl? Or is C2 ethyl, and C6 methyl, along with another substituent?

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the numbering is such that the ketone is at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl? Or is it that C2 has an ethyl substituent and C6 has a methyl substituent. Wait, no, the name says 2-ethyl, 2,6-dimethyl. Oh, so C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. Because 2,6-dimethyl means C2 and C6 each have a methyl. But wait, no. Wait, the parent chain is cyclohexanone, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone at C1. Then, substituents are at C2 and C6.

Wait, the structure would be: C1 is the carbonyl, C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl substituent? No, wait. Let me draw this out mentally. The ring is cyclohexane, with the ketone at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group (since it's 2-ethyl), and position 6 has a methyl group. But wait, the name says 2,6-dimethyl. So, does that mean that both C2 and C6 have methyl groups? Or is it that C2 is ethyl and C6 is methyl?

Wait, no. The name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, on the ring, C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (because 2,6-dimethyl implies two methyls). So, C2 has ethyl and methyl substituents. So, that's a substituent at C2: ethyl and
