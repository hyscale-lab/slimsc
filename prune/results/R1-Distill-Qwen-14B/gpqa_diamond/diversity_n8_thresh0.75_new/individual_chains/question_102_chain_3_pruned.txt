Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which means the vector contains two genes (ligand and receptor) under a single promoter. They've introduced some stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites.

So, the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' with eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. I remember that IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so maybe the receptor is being expressed as a separate transcript? Or perhaps both are expressed from the same transcript but using IRES for the second gene. Wait, no, bicistronic vectors typically have a single promoter but allow for two open reading frames. So the CBA promoter would drive the ligand ORF, and then maybe the IRES is before the receptor ORF.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after the IRES. So the vector would have: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF (with stop in loxP cassette), then IRES, then receptor ORF (with stop in lox2272). So when the Cre is active, it would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the proteins to be expressed.

But wait, the vector is bicistronic, so maybe the CBA promoter drives both, but with internal ribosome entry for the second gene. Or perhaps it's a matter of how the ORFs are arranged. The ligand is at 5', so perhaps the vector is ligand first, then receptor, each with their own fusions.

They transfected primary astrocyte cultures and used Western blot with antibodies against the proteins. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, which probably means the loading is correct. But when they bred mice, crossed them with SOX10-Cre, and looked for GFP signal, they saw none. So the eGFP wasn't expressed.

Hmm, the possible options are A to D. Let's look at each.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but here, the issue is whether the proteins are expressed. If they are paracrine, the expression would be in different cells, but the question is about the construct expression. If the proteins aren't expressed, the paracrine relationship isn't the issue here. So maybe not A.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean the protein isn't trafficking correctly to the cell surface. But if the eGFP is stuck, why no signal? Wait, eGFP is a reporter, so if it's expressed, you should see it. But maybe the receptor isn't being processed. But the question says they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on Western blot. So the Western blot might show if the receptors are being made. But the construct's expression:
