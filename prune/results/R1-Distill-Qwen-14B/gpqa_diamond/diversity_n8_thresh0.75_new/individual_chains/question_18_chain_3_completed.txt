Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about elemental abundances in stars. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try my best.

So, the problem states that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here because the question is about elemental abundances, specifically silicon in their photospheres. Maybe mass doesn't affect this particular calculation? I'll keep that in mind and proceed.

The given data for the stars are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, the square brackets here denote logarithmic abundances relative to hydrogen or another element. Oh right! [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic difference between the star's abundance and the Sun's.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Wait, wait. How do I interpret these? Let me compute the actual values. 

For the Sun:
log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5
So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5

Similarly for Mg:
log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5
So nMg/nH = 10^(-5) = 1e-5

But wait, the problem is about silicon. The Sun's [Si/H] isn't given. Hmm. So I need to figure out the Sun's [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] perhaps.

Wait, maybe I can find the Sun's [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] because I have the [Mg/Fe] perhaps? Let me think.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero? Or no, [Fe/H] is the abundance of Fe relative to H. Wait, the problem says [Fe/H]_1 = 0 for Star_1, meaning [Fe/H] is the same as the Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0, same as the Sun.

Wait, let's clarify. The [X/H] for Star_1 is zero. So Star_1 has the same Fe abundance as the Sun relative to H. Similarly, Star_2 has same Mg abundance as the Sun relative to H.

But wait, the problem is about [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] for the stars. Hmm.

So, for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, Star_1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. So the [Si/Fe] is higher by 0.3 dex. So Si is more abundant relative to Fe in Star_1.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. And [Mg/H]_2 is 0, same as Sun. So Mg is 0.3 dex higher than what the Sun's Mg is relative to Si.

Wait, but how do I find the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2?

I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star and then compute their ratio.

Wait, but for that, I need to find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then compute (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2) = 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

But how do I find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2?

Let's start with Star_1.

Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means Fe abundance relative to H is same as Sun. So n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Which is log10(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

So, log10(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = 0.3 + log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

But wait, what's n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun? I don't have that directly. But I know the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, so n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 3.16e-5 as calculated earlier.

Wait, but I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe] value. Hmm. Maybe I can express n_Si_sun in terms of Mg? Because I have [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Si/Fe] from its [Fe/H] and [Mg/Si] data.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Let me first try to find the Sun's [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si].

Wait, the Sun has [Fe/H] such that log10(n_Fe / n_H) = -4.5. Similarly, [Mg/H] is log10(n_Mg / n_H) = -5.

So, to find [Si/Fe]_sun, I need n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun. But I don't have that directly. Hmm. Maybe this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that we can find the [Si/H] for each star using the given ratios.

Wait, let me think for Star_1.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) + 0.3

Because [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X_sun / n_Y_sun). So [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which means n_Si_1/n_Fe_1 = n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun * 10^0.3.

But I don't know n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun. Wait, but perhaps I can find it from the Sun's composition.

Wait, the Sun's n_Fe/n_H is 3.16e-5, and n_Mg/n_H is 1e-5.

But without knowing the Sun's n_Si/n_H, I can't proceed directly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can express the [Mg/Si] for Star_2 in terms of the Sun's values.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So log10(n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) = log10(n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) + 0.3.

But I also know that [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so n_Mg_2 / n_H_2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun.

Hmm, maybe I can express n_Si_2 in terms of n_Mg_2.

Wait, let's process Star_1 first.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) → since [Fe/H] is 0, same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) + 0.3.

Let’s denote (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) as (S_F)_sun.

So, n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * (S_F)_sun * 10^{0.3}

But n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) * [Fe/H] = 0 → n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) ? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, [Fe/H] measures log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) = 0 → log(n_Fe_1/n_H_1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun → n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun)

But since we're dealing with ratios, perhaps the H abundance cancels out when we calculate (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should model the ratios.

Let me denote for Star_1:

n_Si_1 = n_Fe_1 * (S_F)_sun * 10^{0.3}

But n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) → because [Fe/H]_1 = 0.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun)

And [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10(n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) = log10(n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) + 0.3

So, n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2 = (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) * 10^{0.3} → n_Si_2 = (n_Mg_2 * n_Si_sun) / (n_Mg_sun * 10^{0.3})

But n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun) → substitute that in.

So, n_Si_2 = (n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun) * n_Si_sun) / (n_Mg_sun * 10^{0.3}) )

Simplify, n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun) * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun) / 10^{0.3}

So, n_Si_2 = n_Si_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun) / (10^{0.3})

Hmm, but I don't know n_Si_sun. How can I proceed without that?

Wait, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] from the data given. Let me try.

The Sun's [Fe/H] is not given, but for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which is the same as the Sun. Oh wait, no, wait! The problem says the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so that's log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH_sun = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH_sun = 1e-5.

But what about silicon in the Sun? The problem doesn't provide [Si/H]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun and [Mg/Si]_sun from the given data for the Sun.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun would be log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0? No, wait no. Because [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun. So [X/Y]_sun is zero. But the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero by definition, right? Because it's the reference. So, [Si/Fe]_sun is zero. Same for [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero, then for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 implies that Si is more abundant relative to Fe in Star_1 than in the Sun.

But then, how to find n_Si_1 and n_Si_2 in terms of the Sun's values?

Wait, perhaps I can express [Si/H] for each star in terms of known values.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) =0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) → because n_Fe/n_H for Star_1 is same as Sun.

So, n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun) → n_Fe_1 = (3.16e-5 ) * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun)

Wait, but I don't know n_H_1. But perhaps when taking the ratio of Star_1 to Star_2's [Si/H], the H terms will cancel.

Wait, perhaps I should find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 in terms of the Sun's [Si/H].

Let me proceed.

For Star_1:

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3.

We also know [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun.

So, n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is log10(n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

Which can be rewritten as log10( (n_Si_1 / n_H_1) / (n_Fe_1 / n_H_1) ) - log10( (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) / (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

But n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun → this term is same as the Sun, so the denominator in the first log is 1.

Wait no, let me think again.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 = log( (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) / (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So, n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe_1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1.

So, n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) * 10^{0.3} * (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H_1 )

Simplify: n_Si_1 = (n_Si_sun) * 10^{0.3} * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun )

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10( n_Si_1 / n_H_1 ) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_H_sun )

Which is log10( (n_Si_sun * 10^{0.3} * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun )) / n_H_1 ) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_H_sun )

Simplify inside the log: (n_Si_sun *10^{0.3} * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun )) /n_H_1 = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) * 10^{0.3}

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) *10^{0.3} ) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_H_sun )

= log10(10^{0.3}) = 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3. So, Star_1 has [Si/H] of 0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So, despite not knowing the Sun's [Si/H], the [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Wait, how does that happen? Because the [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means the Fe abundance is the same as the Sun relative to H.

But [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, so Si is 0.3 dex higher than Fe in Star_1. So, Si is more abundant. But how does that translate into [Si/H]?

Ah, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so the H abundance in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun (in terms of Fe). But wait, no, because n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H_1 / n_H_sun). So, if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means the ratio n_Fe_1 / n_H_1 is same as the Sun's.

So, combining these, Star_1's n_Si_1 is higher than the Sun's, because [Si/Fe] is positive.

But then, the [Si/H]_1 comes out to be 0.3. That's because the 10^{0.3} scaling from [Si/Fe] increased the ratio, but since [Fe/H] is same, the [Si/H] increases by the same 0.3.

Wait, that's a bit confusing, but the calculation says [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Now, moving to Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So, [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) = 0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 = log( (n_Mg_2 / n_H_2) / (n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun) ) = 0.

So, n_Mg_2 / n_H_2 = n_Mg_sun / n_H_sun → n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun )

Substitute into [Mg/Si]_2 equation:

log( ( (n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun )) / n_Si_2 ) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

Simplify numerator inside the log:

( n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) ) / n_Si_2 → (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 )

Wait, no, perhaps better to factor it as:

(n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2 ) = (n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun )) / n_Si_2 )

Divided by (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) → gives (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2 ) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) = [ (n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun )) / n_Si_2 ) ] * [n_Si_sun / (n_Mg_sun) ) ]

Simplify → (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun )

So, log10( (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) ) ) = 0.3.

But that's the same as log10( (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) ) + log10( n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) ) = 0.3.

Hmm, but I don't know n_Si_sun or n_H_2 and n_H_sun.

Wait, Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, so n_Mg_2 is same as Sun. So, n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun )

But I can express n_Si_2 in terms of n_Si_sun.

Let me rearrange the equation:

log10( (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) ) ) = 0.3

Which can be rewritten as:

log10( n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) + log10( n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) = 0.3

But I don't know n_H_2 or any other relation involving H.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Si/H]_sun. Let me think.

[Si/H]_2 = log10( n_Si_2 / n_H_2 ) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_H_sun )

Which is log10( n_Si_2 / (n_H_2 ) ) - [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, but I don't know [Si/H]_sun, do I?

Hmm, perhaps I can find [Si/H]_sun from the Sun's data. But I don't have n_Si_sun, but maybe I can find it from the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio is [Mg/Si]_sun = log10( (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun ) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) =0 → [Mg/Si]_sun is 0. So, the Sun's Mg/Si ratio is equal to the Sun's Mg/Si ratio, which is the same as itself. So that doesn't help.

Wait, but wait—since we don't have the Sun's [Si/H], perhaps we can express the ratio of [Si] in Star_1 and Star_2 in terms of [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

Because the ratio n_Si_1 / n_Si_2 would be 10^([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 )

So, if I can find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, I can find their ratio.

From earlier, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

Now, let's try to find [Si/H]_2.

From Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

We have:

log( (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2 ) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun ) ) = 0.3.

We also know that n_Mg_2 = n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) → [Mg/H]_2 =0.

Substituting into the [Mg/Si] equation:

log( ( (n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun )) / n_Si_2 ) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) = 0.3.

Simplify numerator inside the log:

( n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) ) / n_Si_2 → (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) * (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun )

So, the entire expression becomes:

log( [ (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) * (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) ) ] / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) terms cancel out, leaving:

log( (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) ) ) = 0.3.

Which can be written as:

log( (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) ) + log( (n_H_2 / n_H_sun ) ) = 0.3.

Hmm, but without knowing either of these logs, it's hard to proceed. Wait, but perhaps I can relate (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) to [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Si/H]_2 = log( n_Si_2 / n_H_2 ) - [Si/H]_sun.

But I don't know [Si/H]_sun. Let me denote [Si/H]_sun as S.

So,

log( n_Si_2 / n_H_2 ) = S + [Si/H]_2.

So, n_Si_2 = n_H_2 * 10^{S + [Si/H]_2}.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, let's express (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) / (n_Si_2 / n_H_2 ) * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun )

Wait, so:

(n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) = (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) * (n_H_2 / n_H_2) / (n_Si_2 /n_H_2 )

= (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) * 1 / (n_Si_2 / n_H_2 )

= (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) * 10^{ - [Si/H]_2 - S }

Wait, because n_Si_2 / n_H_2 = 10^{ [Si/H]_2 + S }.

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is zero, because [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2 ) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) =0.3, but [Mg/Si]_sun is zero.

Wait, no, for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is zero by definition. So, the Sun's n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun = n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2.

Wait, the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

So, that's (n_Si_1 ) / (n_Si_2 )

Using the [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2:

n_Si_1 / n_H_1 = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 + log10(n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) }

Wait, no. [Si/H]_1 is defined as log10(n_Si_1 / n_H_1) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_H_sun) ) = 0.3.

So, log10(n_Si_1/n_H_1) = 0.3 + log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)

So, n_Si_1 = n_H_1 * 10^{0.3 + log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun)} }

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log10(n_Si_2/n_H_2) - log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) = ?

But I don't know [Si/H]_2.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [Si/H]_2 in terms of the given data.

From Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

We have [Mg/Si]_2 = log( (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2 ) / (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun) ) =0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg_2 =n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 / n_H_sun )

Substitute into [Mg/Si] equation:

log( ( (n_Mg_sun * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun )) / n_Si_2 ) / (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun ) ) =0.3.

Simplify:

log( (n_Si_sun * n_H_2 ) / (n_H_sun * n_Si_2 ) ) =0.3.

So, (n_Si_sun / n_Si_2 ) * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun ) = 10^{0.3}.

Hmm, but n_H_2 is H in Star_2, which I don't know. But perhaps I can find [Si/H]_2.

Let me denote [Si/H]_2 as X.

So, [Si/H]_2 = log10(n_Si_2 /n_H_2) - log10(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) )

Which implies:

n_Si_2 /n_H_2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) * 10^{X}.

Wait, but from the earlier equation, (n_Si_sun /n_Si_2 ) * (n_H_2 /n_H_sun ) = 10^{0.3}.

Substituting n_Si_2 = (n_Si_sun * n_H_2 ) / (n_H_sun *10^{0.3} )

Dividing both sides by n_H_2:

n_Si_2 /n_H_2 = (n_Si_sun ) / (n_H_sun *10^{0.3} )

But also, n_Si_2/n_H_2 = (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *10^{X}.

So,

(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ) *10^{X} = (n_Si_sun ) / (n_H_sun *10^{0.3} )

Divide both sides by (n_Si_sun /n_H_sun ):

10^X = 1/(10^{0.3} ) = 10^{-0.3}.

Taking log10 of both sides,

X = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_2 has [Si/H] of -0.3.

So, Star_1 has [Si/H]=0.3, Star_2 has [Si/H]=-0.3.

So, the ratio of Si is (n_Si_1/n_H_1) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2 ) ) * (n_H_2 /n_H_1 )

Wait, no. The ratio is (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 ) = (n_Si_1/n_H_1) * (n_H_2 /n_H_1) * (n_H_1/n_H_2) * (n_H_2/n_Si_2 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio as:

(n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 ) = (n_Si_1/n_H_1) / (n_Si_2/n_H_2 ) ) * (n_H_1 / n_H_2 )

Wait, but I don't know the ratio of H in the two stars. How are the H abundances related?

Wait, [H] abundance is not given for either star. So perhaps the H ratios are the same as the Sun? No, that's not necessarily true. Or perhaps, because we're considering photospheric composition and using the same method (EW), but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any information about the hydrogen abundance in the stars beyond what's implied by their [X/H] values. But in Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which means Fe is same as Sun relative to H. Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0.

But without knowing the overall [H] abundance, perhaps I can assume that the H is the same in both stars as the Sun? No, that's not necessarily true; for example, metal-poor stars have lower [Fe/H], but here Star_1 is solar [Fe/H].

Hmm, but wait—maybe the H abundance is the same in both stars as the Sun, so n_H_1 =n_H_sun * (n_H_sun /n_H_sun )= same as Sun.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Fe is same as Sun relative to H. But H could be different. Wait, but [Fe/H]_1 = log(n_Fe_1/n_H_1) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) ) =0 → n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → so H is the same as Sun in terms of Fe, but overall H could vary.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Another approach: perhaps the ratio of (n_Si_1 /n_Si_2 ) can be found using [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, regardless of H.

Because:

n_Si_1 = n_H_1 * 10^{ [Si/H]_1 + log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) }

n_Si_2 = n_H_2 * 10^{ [Si/H]_2 + log10(n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) }

So, the ratio n_Si_1/n_Si_2 = (n_H_1 / n_H_2 ) * 10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }

But I don't know n_H_1/n_H_2.

Wait, but perhaps I can find (n_H_1 /n_H_2 ) from other data.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe_1 = n_Fe_sun * n_H_1 /n_H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 →n_Mg_2 =n_Mg_sun *n_H_2 /n_H_sun.

Hmm, I don't see a direct way to find n_H_1 and n_H_2.

Wait, but perhaps if I can express the ratio (n_H_1 /n_H_2 ) in terms of other known quantities.

But I don't have any other data about the stars, so perhaps (n_H_1 /n_H_2 ) cancels out when considering the ratio of Si.

Wait, another approach: since in both stars, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are set to zero, perhaps the H abundances are the same as the Sun, but that's not necessarily correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance in each star is the same as the Sun, making n_H_1 =n_H_sun and n_H_2 =n_H_sun. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.

If that's the case, then n_H_1 =n_H_2 =n_H_sun → so the ratio (n_Si_1/n_Si_2 ) =10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ) }.

Which would be 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close.

But wait, that's a big assumption. Is it valid to assume that the H in both stars is the same as the Sun?

Wait, the problem states that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means n_Fe_1/n_H_1 =n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun, but if n_H_1 is different from the Sun, then n_Fe_1 would adjust accordingly. Similarly for Star_2.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is designed so that the H is the same in both stars as the Sun. Otherwise, without knowing the H ratio, we couldn't solve the problem. So, probably, the intended approach is to assume that H is the same in both stars as the Sun and that the ratio of Si is 3.98.

So, the ratio would be approximately 3.98, which is option A (~3.9).


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the definitions of logarithmic abundance ratios.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5

### Step 1: [Si/H] for Star_1
For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 implies that the Si abundance relative to Fe is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun.
- Using the relationship:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_1 = [\text{Si/Fe}]_1 + [\text{Fe/H}]_1
  \]
  Substituting values:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3 \, \text{dex}.
  \]

### Step 2: [Si/H] for Star_2
For Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 implies that the Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 implies that the Mg abundance relative to Si is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun.
- Using the relationship:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -([\text{Mg/Si}]_2) + [\text{Mg/H}]_2
  \]
  Substituting values:
  \[
  [\text{Si/H}]_2 = -0.3 + 0 = -0.3 \, \text{dex}.
  \]

### Step 3: Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{([\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2)}.
\]
Substituting values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{(0.3 - (-0.3))} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
