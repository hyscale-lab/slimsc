Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it out.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. We have a solution made by diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration decreases, which affects the pH. Then during titration, the pH changes as the acid reacts with the base.

First, let me figure out the initial situation before any titration. We diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be 0.05 M * 0.002 L = 0.001 mol. Then, after dilution, the concentration is (0.001 mol) / (0.04 L) = 0.025 M. So the initial solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but when you dilute it, the concentration of H+ will decrease, making the pH higher, since acetic acid is a weak acid. Without any titration, the pH would be around maybe 2.9 or something because of the dilution. But that's just the initial step; the question is about the titration.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions and water.

But wait, how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point?

The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH reacts 1:1 with acetic acid (because the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O), the moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added. But the question is about 25% titration, which is a quarter of that volume, so 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, 25% titration is when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Alternatively, it's when 25% of the required NaOH volume has been added. Let me think. The total NaOH needed is 10 cm³, so 25% would be 2.5 cm³ added. That's correct.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added
