Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, especially in nuclear physics, the scattering amplitude plays a crucial role. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross-section or something like that. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is connected to the differential cross-section through the formula |f(θ)|², but here they're specifically talking about the imaginary part.

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest are ignored. I recall that the scattering amplitude can be written as a sum over all angular momentum channels. The general form is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l} ( (2l+1) * [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] * P_l(cosθ) ), where δ_l are the phase shifts, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials.

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0°, since that's the direction of the incident beam. So we'll need to evaluate f(θ=0) and find its imaginary part.

But wait, the problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. So I guess we're only considering l=0 to l=4. So for each l from 0 to 4, I need to compute the contribution.

But wait, when θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is equal to 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1, since P_l(1) = 1. So that simplifies things a lot. So each term becomes (2l+1)*(e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * 1, divided by k.

Wait no, the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ). So for θ=0°, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1.

So the scattering amplitude f(0) would be (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ].

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is f(0) in the standard notation.

So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

So each term in the sum is (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1). Let's compute each term's imaginary part.

Note that e^{iθ} - 1 can be written as [cosθ + i sinθ] -1 = (cosθ -1) + i sinθ. So the imaginary part is sinθ.

But wait, in our case, it's e^{2iδ_l} -1. So that's e^{i(2δ_l)} -1. So let me write it as
