Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. They've given phase shifts for different l values, I think. The phase shifts are δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, and δ4, with values 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. And we're told to ignore the rest, so probably higher l values beyond 4 aren't contributing.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed using partial waves. Each partial wave contributes terms involving spherical harmonics and the phase shifts. The general formula is something like f = sum over l of ( (2l+1) (sin δ_l / (2l+1)) ) * e^{i(δ_l - lφ)} times some factor involving Legendre polynomials. Oh wait, maybe I should be more precise.

The formula I recall is:

f(θ, φ) = ∑_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l + 1) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * (P_l(cosθ)) ) / (2i) ]

Where P_l are the Legendre polynomials, and δ_l are the phase shifts for each l. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, right, when the scattering is along the incident direction, θ would be 0°, so cosθ is 1. That might simplify things because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is known.

What's P_l(1)? Well, for Legendre polynomials, P_l(1) is equal to 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1 when x=1, regardless of l. So that simplifies the expression.

So, the scattering amplitude f becomes:

f = sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l+1) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ) / (2i) ]

But since we're only considering up to l=4, we'll sum from l=0 to l=4.

Wait, but the question asks for the imaginary part along the beam direction. So, perhaps we can compute the imaginary part of f.

Let me think. Let's compute the sum for each l, compute (e^{iδ_l} - 1), then multiply by (2l+1)/(2i), and then sum all these. Then take the imaginary part.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute each term's contribution and sum them up, then take the imaginary part of the total.

But wait, perhaps I can express each term in terms of sine and cosine. Let's expand e^{iδ_l} as cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So (e^{iδ_l} - 1) becomes (cosδ_l - 1) + i sinδ_l.

Then, each term in the sum is:

(2l+1) * [ (cosδ_l - 1) + i sinδ_l ] / (2i )

Which can be split into real and imaginary parts.

Let me compute that. Let's write it as:

(2l+1)/(2i) [ (cosδ_l - 1) + i sinδ_l ]

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= (2l+1) [ (cosδ_l - 1) + i sinδ_l ] / (2i )

Let me separate the real and imaginary parts. Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Multiply numerator and denominator by i to rationalize the denominator:

Wait, 1/(2i) is the same as -i/(2), because 1/i = -i.

So, 1/(2i) = (-i)/(2).

So, substituting that, each term becomes:

(2l+1) * [ (cosδ_l - 1) + i sinδ_l ] * (-i) / 2

So, let's distribute (-i):

= (2l+1)/2 [ (cosδ_l - 1)(-i) + i^2 sinδ_l ]

But i^2 is -1, so:

= (2l+1)/2 [ (-i)(cosδ_l - 1) - sinδ_l ]

Now, let's compute this:

= (2l+1)/2 [ -i (cosδ_l -1) - sinδ_l ]

So, the term can be written as:

[ (2l+1)/2 (- sinδ_l ) ] + [ (2l+1)/2 (-i)(cosδ_l - 1) ]

So, the real part is (2l+1)(- sinδ_l ) / 2, and the imaginary part is (2l+1)(- (cosδ_l - 1)) / 2.

Wait no, wait. The real part is the term without i, and the imaginary part is the term with i.

So, for each term in the sum:

Real part: (2l+1) * (- sinδ_l ) / 2

Imaginary part: (2l+1) * [ - (cosδ_l - 1) ] * (1/2) * i

Wait, no, the term is [ - i (cosδ_l -1) ] so that is [ -i (cosδ_l -1) ].

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1)/2 * [ - (cosδ_l -1) ] multiplied by i.

So, when we sum all the terms, the total f is the sum of each term, which has real and imaginary parts.

But since we are to compute the imaginary part of f, we can sum the imaginary parts of each term.

So, the imaginary part of f is sum_{l=0}^4 [ (2l+1)/2 * (- (cosδ_l - 1) ) ].

Wait, wait: because each term's imaginary part is (2l+1)/2 * (- (cosδ_l -1)) times i.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express this more carefully.

Each term's contribution to the imaginary part is:

Imaginary part (for each l) = (2l+1) * [ - (cosδ_l - 1) ] / 2

Wait, since the term is [ -i (cosδ_l -1) ] multiplied by (2l+1)/(2), so the coefficient for i is (2l+1)/(2) * [ - (cosδ_l -1) ]

So, the imaginary part is the sum over l of (2l+1) * [ -(cosδ_l - 1) ] * (
