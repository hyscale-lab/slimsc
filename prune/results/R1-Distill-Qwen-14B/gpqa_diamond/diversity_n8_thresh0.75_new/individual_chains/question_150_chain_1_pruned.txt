Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me think about that formula. So, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Wait, what's the degree of unsaturation here? Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, plugging into the degree of unsaturation formula:

(2*8 +2 - 9 - 0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings, double bonds, triple bonds, etc. So five could be something like one ring and four double bonds, but that's unlikely. More probably, maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 degrees), a double bond (1 degree), and an aromatic ring maybe another one. Wait, no, benzene is 3, another benzene would make 6, but that's more than 5. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR data is given. Let's look at that. The 1H NMR shows several peaks:

9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, but wait, or maybe it's a triplet from coupling with two adjacent groups. Alternatively, it could be a vinyl proton adjacent to an aldehyde. Hmm.

6.98 ppm: a doublet with 2H. So maybe aromatic protons. If it's a doublet, perhaps para-substituted aromatic protons. Because in para substitution, each proton is equivalent and splits into a doublet when coupled with the other.

6.51 ppm: another doublet, 2H. Also aromatic, but perhaps a different substitution pattern. Like meta or ortho?

6.27 ppm: a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like an -OH group. Or maybe it's an =CH2 group where the protons are deshielded but not split much.

3.66 ppm: a doublet for 2H. That's a bit upfield. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2. Or perhaps a CH2 group next to an electron-withdrawing group.

Now, putting this together. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The aldehyde proton at 9.72 is a triplet. Wait, how does an aldehyde proton split into a triplet? Aldehydes are typically deshielded and have a high chemical shift. The aldehyde proton usually has no neighboring protons because it's RCHO, so it's a singlet. So why a triplet here? Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group that's split into a triplet. Wait, or perhaps the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 that has two protons, which would split the aldehyde's proton into a triplet. Wait, but aldehyde proton is at the end; the adjacent would be the R group attached. So perhaps the aldehyde is attached to a CH2 group that's adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think: the aldehyde is at one end, and then we have a chain leading into another aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data again: the triplet at 9.72 could be the aldehyde proton coupled with two adjacent protons. So perhaps the structure is something like R-CH2-CHO, but then the aldehyde proton would be next to the CH2, which has two Hs. So the aldehyde's proton would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. That makes sense. So
