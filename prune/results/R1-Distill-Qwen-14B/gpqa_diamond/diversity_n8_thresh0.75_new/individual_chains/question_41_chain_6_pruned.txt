Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light traveling through glass that's moving. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it, but let's see. The question is about finding the speed of light in the glass as observed in the laboratory frame. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, right? But the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Oh, but wait, no, the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass towards the observer? Or is the glass moving towards the observer while the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion? Hmm, the wording says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the question again carefully. Oh, "the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory." So the glass is moving toward the observer, and the beam is also moving in that same direction. Wait, that seems a bit contradictory because if the glass is moving towards the observer, then the beam, which is inside the glass, would be moving towards the observer as well. But the glass is moving, so how does that affect the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame?

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula is involved. Oh right! The formula is u' =
