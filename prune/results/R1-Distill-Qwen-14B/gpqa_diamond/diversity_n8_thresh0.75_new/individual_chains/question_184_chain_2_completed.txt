Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The options give different sequences of reactions, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll try to break down the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. Wait, numbering can be a bit tricky. Let's imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the actual numbering might not be exactly that. Let me imagine the structure. It's 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. But in a benzene ring, the numbering depends on the substituents' priority. The substituents have different priorities: nitro is a strong deactivating group, ethoxy is activating, and tert-butyl is a bulky substituent but not activating or deactivating.

Wait, actually, the substituents' priority for numbering is based on alphabetical order, but sometimes based on functional groups. Wait, no, the priority is for substituents when numbering, it's based on the substituent that comes first in alphabetical order. Let's think: ethoxy (-OEt) would be first, nitro comes after, and tert-butyl is a substituent.

But perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. So, the ring has three substituents in a row.

So, the main thing is to figure out the order of adding these substituents. The synthesis process can be done via electrophilic substitution, and the order matters because each substituent affects where the next will attach.

So, benzene can undergo substitution reactions. Each substituent directs the next substitution based on its nature: activating (ortho/para) or deactivating (meta), and directing (ortho/para) or meta.

Wait, ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Nitro is deactivating and meta-directing. tert-Butyl is an activating group? Wait, no. Wait, substituents can be either activating or deactivating. tert-Butyl is an alkyl group, so it's activating (electron-donating) and ortho/para-directing.

Wait, so all three substituents are activating? No, wait, nitro is a strong deactivating group. So, the nitro group will be meta-directing. So, when you have multiple substituents, the positions are determined by the most influential groups.

Wait, but when adding substituents step by step, each step affects where the next group goes.

So, let's think about the target molecule: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. So, how to add them in the correct order.

Looking at the target, the positions are 1, 2, 3. So, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, the numbering starts at a substituent and goes in a way that the numbers are as low as possible. So, let me try to visualize the structure. Let's imagine the ring as a hexagon. If we have substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3, the ring would have ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

Alternatively, the substitution could happen in any order, but the order in the reaction sequence must lead to the correct positions.

So, the problem is to figure out the correct order of adding these groups to benzene.

Let me think about the possible steps.

Optionally, the steps are as follows:

First substitution: introduce a substituent. Then second substitution, then third.

But each substituent affects the next positions.

Let's consider the substituents:

- tert-butyl group: from a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is tricky because tert-butyl chloride is not very reactive. Wait, but AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride would be used for Friedel-Crafts alkylation. However, Friedel-Crafts can be problematic with bulky groups because the carbocation can rearrange, but tert-butyl is a stable carbocation, so maybe it's okay.

Wait, but wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is typically done with alkyl chlorides, and the AlCl3 helps in generating the carbocation. But the thing is, Friedel-Crafts is only possible when the ring is activated. So, if the ring is already substituted with an activating group, that's fine. But if the ring is deactivating, Friedel-Crafts may not work.

So, let's think about the order of substituents.

Option D: Starts with nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). So, first substituent is nitro group. Then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction? Wait, Fe/HCl is acidic conditions, maybe a substitution? Alternatively, could be a nitration, then something else.)

Wait, let me go through each option.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation, adds tert-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration.

iii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonation.

iv) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4: hydrolysis?

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: perhaps acid workup or hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr: ethoxylation via an SN2 reaction, like Williamson?

viii) Fe/HCl: maybe a reduction, but with what?

ix) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration?

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So maybe I need to see.

Wait, wait, let me think. The target has an ethoxy group, which is an OEt group. How is that introduced? Probably via an alkoxy group, which would come from an ether formation. So, perhaps after a substitution, we introduce an ethoxy group via a nucleophilic substitution, like using NaOH and ethyl bromide (EtBr) in a Williamson-type ether synthesis.

Wait, but wait, the ethoxy group would require a good leaving group in the ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's introduced by nitration, then reduction, then alkylation.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think step-by-step.

The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. Let's think about the order of their introduction.

First, which substituent is introduced first?

If we start with benzene, the first substituent is either tert-butyl, ethoxy, or nitro.

But nitration is a standard first step. Alternatively, Friedel-Crafts is another option.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, which would make the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So if nitro is introduced first, subsequent substitutions would be difficult because the ring is deactivating.

So maybe nitration is done later.

Alternatively, if you introduce an activating group first, like tert-butyl or ethoxy, that would make the ring more reactive for the next substitution.

But ethoxy is a strong activating group, so it might be better to add it later if possible, because after adding a deactivating group, you could have trouble adding others.

Wait, but in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, perhaps the order of substitution is:

1. Introduce tert-butyl.

2. Introduce ethoxy.

3. Introduce nitro.

But wait, let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the order is:

1. tert-butyl.

2. nitro.

3. ethoxy.

But wait, after adding a nitro group (which is meta-directing), the next substitution would be directed by that.

Wait, let's think.

If first substitution is tert-butyl (which is activating, ortho/para-directing), then the next substitution (ethoxy) would be added at ortho or para to tert-butyl.

But then, when adding the nitro group, which is meta-directing, it would go into a position influenced by the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add the ethoxy group (strong activating, ortho/para) first.

2. Then add the tert-butyl group (activating, ortho/para), which would go preferably para to ethoxy.

3. Then add the nitro group, which would be influenced by the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups.

Wait, but nitro is meta to which groups?

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Add nitro group.

But this would deact the ring, making subsequent substitutions difficult.

So the order might be: first tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to plan each substitution step and see where they get added.

Let me think about each substituent's influence.

First substituent: let's say we add ethoxy first. Since ethoxy is activating and ortho/para-directing, the second substituent would go ortho or para to it.

Suppose the second substituent is tert-butyl. So, para to ethoxy. Then, adding nitro as the third substituent. Nitro is meta-directing, so where would it go? It would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring has two substituents. The tert-butyl is para to ethoxy. Now, adding nitro. The nitro group is a meta director. So the existing substituents would influence the next substitution.

In the case where two substituents are present, the next substitution occurs at a position that is dominated by the strongest directing groups. So, ethoxy is a stronger activating group than tert-butyl. So, the nitration would be directed by ethoxy, but ethoxy is at position 1, so the nitro would go meta to ethoxy, which would be position 4. But wait, the target has nitro at position 3. Hmm, maybe that's not the right order.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

Add tert-butyl first. Since it's activating, the next substitution (ethoxy) would go ortho or para to it.

Then, add nitro group.

Wait, let's see.

First step: add tert-butyl to benzene. Now, the ring has a tert-butyl group, which is activating and ortho/para-directing. So the next substituent (ethoxy) would go ortho or para to it.

If we add ethoxy in the para position of tert-butyl, then the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (assuming tert-butyl is at position 1, then ethoxy at position 3). Wait, but that may vary based on how the ring is numbered.

Alternatively, suppose tert-butyl is at position 1. Then adding ethoxy could be at position 3 (meta to position 1 would be 4, but ortho would be 2). Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me try to imagine the benzene ring:

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Let's say tert-butyl is at position 1.

Then, ethoxy can be added either at position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para).

If ethoxy is at position 2, then the next substitution (nitro) would be directed by both substituents. tert-Butyl at 1 (ortho/para), ethoxy at 2 (ortho/para). The nitro group is a meta director, but since it's a deactivating group, it would direct meta relative to itself.

Wait, but when adding a nitro group, the existing substituents are activating or deactivating. So, after adding tert-butyl and ethoxy, the ring has two activating groups.

Then, when we nitrate, the nitro group would go into a position directed by the existing groups.

The ethoxy at position 2 is ortho to the tert-butyl at position 1.

Now, when adding the nitro group, which is meta directing, but wait, the nitro group is being added as a substituent, so it's the incoming group. So, the existing substituents (tert-butyl and ethoxy) will direct where the nitro group goes.

Wait, no. The existing substituents are directing where the new nitro group will attach. Since ethoxy is activating, it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions relative to itself. Similarly, tert-butyl directs to ortho and para relative to itself.

So, in the ring with substituents at positions 1 (tert-butyl) and 2 (ethoxy), where would the nitro group go?

The ethoxy at 2 would direct the nitration to positions 1 (meta?), wait no. Wait, ethoxy is ortho/para-directing. So, positions adjacent (ortho) and across (para) from ethoxy (position 2) would be positions 1, 3, and 6.

But position 1 is already taken by tert-butyl. So the possible positions for nitration are 3 or 6.

Similarly, the tert-butyl at 1 directs to positions 2 and 4. Position 2 is taken, so position 4 is available.

So, the nitro group could end up at position 3 or 4, depending on which directing group is more influential.

But ethoxy is a stronger activating group than tert-butyl, so it might have a stronger influence. Therefore, the nitro group could go to position 3 (ortho to ethoxy at 2) or position 6 (para to ethoxy). Alternatively, position 4 is para to tert-butyl.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

Another approach: the target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, in order to have the nitro at 3, considering the substituents in the ring when adding nitro.

At that point, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. So, when adding nitro, where would it go?

The substituents are ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). So, the nitro group must go to position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (at 1) and across from tert-butyl (at 2 is ortho to 3? No, position 2 is adjacent to 3).

So, position 3 is meta to ethoxy (position 1) — wait, no. Wait, ethoxy is at 1, nitro at 3: that's two positions away, which is meta.

Wait, no, because in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 3 are meta if the ring is numbered in order.

Wait, for benzene, positions 1 and 3 are adjacent to position 2.

So, let's imagine the ring:

1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro), 4, 5, 6.

So, when adding nitro, the substituents at 1 and 2 would influence where it goes.

Ethoxy at 1 is ortho/para-directing. So, the nitro would come ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). But position 2 is already taken by tert-butyl. So, position 4 is the para position relative to ethoxy.

Alternatively, tert-butyl at 2 is ortho/para-directing. So, nitration would occur at positions 1 (already taken) or position 3 (ortho to 2) or position 6 (para to 2).

So, nitro could go to position 3 or 6.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3.

So, in this scenario, if the substituents are at 1 and 2, adding nitro would go to position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl at 2) or position 6 (para to tert-butyl at 2).

But which is more favorable?

Alternatively, perhaps the order of substituents is ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Let's see.

First substitution: ethoxy (position 1).

Second substitution: tert-butyl. Since ethoxy is ortho/para-directing, tert-butyl would be added at position 3 (ortho) or 4 (para).

If tert-butyl is at position 3, then the ring has substituents at 1 and 3.

Adding nitro next. Ethoxy at 1 is ortho/para, directing to positions 2 and 4. Tert-butyl at 3 is ortho/para, directing to positions 2 and 4 (since position 3's ortho is 2 and 4).

So, both substituents would direct to position 2 and 4. So the nitro could go to position 2 or 4.

But in the target, nitro is at 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the correct order.

Another approach: let me think about the substituents and their positions.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

So, the order of substitution could be:

1. Ethoxy (position 1).

2. tert-butyl (position 2).

3. Nitro (position 3).

But how does the third substitution happen? Let me see.

After ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2), adding nitro at 3.

But when adding nitro, the existing substituents are ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Ethoxy is ortho/para-directing, so the next substituent (nitro) would go ortho or para to ethoxy, i.e., position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But position 2 is already taken by tert-butyl.

Alternatively, the tert-butyl is ortho/para-directing, so the next substituent would go to position 1 (taken) or 3 (ortho to 2) or position 6 (para to 2).

Since position 1 is taken, the nitro could go to 3 or 6.

So in this case, if the nitro group is added to position 3, that would fit the target.

But how does the nitration occur in that position? Because the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are both directing.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is directed by both substituents. Since both ethoxy and tert-butyl are at positions 1 and 2, their directing effects might overlap to position 3.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are added in a different order.

Another possibility is that the nitro group is added first. But then, the ring becomes deactivating, making further substitutions difficult.

Wait, but if you add nitro first, then the ring is less reactive. So, let's see.

First substitution: nitro at position 1.

But then, the ring is deactivated. Adding ethoxy next would be difficult because it's an activating group and needs an activated ring.

Alternatively, perhaps that's not the way. Let me think about each option.

Looking at the options, each option has a different sequence of reactions. Let me try to analyze each.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: first substitution is nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl: maybe reduction? Fe/HCl is a common reagent for some reactions, like the reduction of nitro groups. Wait, but Fe/HCl is acidic conditions and perhaps used for other substitutions.

Wait, if the first step is nitration, the ring has a nitro group. Then, perhaps in step ii, it's reduced to an amine. But the target doesn't have an amine. Alternatively, perhaps this is a nitration followed by something else.

Alternatively, Fe/HCl is used for the formation of a Grignard or other reagents, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Fe/HCl is used for the Staudinger reaction, but that's probably not here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, not sure.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But after nitration, the ring is deactivating. So, Friedel-Crafts would not work because the ring is not activated. So, perhaps that's not possible. That would make option D incorrect unless there's a way to reactivate the ring.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is less reactive. So, Friedel-Crafts alkylation would be difficult. So, perhaps option D is incorrect.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts, add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate.

iii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4: hydrolysis, perhaps.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: hydrolysis again.

vii) NaOH/EtBr: introduce ethoxy group.

viii) Fe/HCl: ?

ix) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration.

Wait, but in this case, after step ii, the ring has nitro and tert-butyl. Then, sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) would add a sulfonic acid group, but the target doesn't have that. So, that would be adding an extra substituent, which is not desired. So, this option might not be correct.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl: perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat: hydrolysis, possibly to introduce a group.

vii) NaOH/EtBr: introduce ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4: ?

Wait, this seems to be adding multiple nitro groups, which doesn't match the target. The target has only one nitro group. So option B is probably incorrect.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4: sulfonate.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl: ?

v) NaNO2/HCl: diazotize.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4: nitrate again.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat: hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4: ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr: ethoxylation.

Hmm. Adding sulfonic acid group (ii) would add another substituent, which isn't present in the target. So, option C is probably incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. So, the steps to introduce them must be in an order that allows each substituent to be added without conflicting.

The ethoxy group is an ether. It's often introduced via an SN2 reaction, perhaps via a Williamson ether synthesis. But for that, you need a good leaving group attached to the benzene ring. Alternatively, it can be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which is difficult without strong activating groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has been nitrated and then reduced.

Wait, another possibility: the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution from a nitro group.

Wait, the nitro group can be converted to an amine, then to a diazonium salt, and then undergo a substitution.

Wait, here's a possible pathway:

- Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

- Nitro to amine: reduction with H2 and catalyst, or using Fe/HCl (like in a Sandmeyer reaction? No, more likely a reduction).

- Then, the amine can be converted to a diazonium chloride with NaNO2 and HCl.

- The diazonium salt can then be subjected to a coupling reaction or substitution.

But wait, how to introduce ethoxy group?

Alternatively, after nitration, perhaps a substitution occurs where the nitro group is replaced with something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution if the ring is activated enough.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so I'm not sure.

Another approach is to consider that the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether formation, which would require a good leaving group. That could be achieved by converting a nitro group to a leaving group.

Wait, but converting nitro to a leaving group might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But that requires an activating group.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce ethoxy group via alkylation. But wait, ethoxy is an electron-donating group, so maybe it's added via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an alkoxy group substitution using an SN2 mechanism. But benzene isn't very good at that unless there's a good leaving group attached.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each step in the options.

Looking again at the options, perhaps option D is the correct one. Let's see.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. So, benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: reduce nitro group to amine. So, nitrobenzene becomes aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, aniline is strongly activating, so Friedel-Crafts should work.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating group. Aniline is activating, so adding tert-butyl via AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride would introduce the tert-butyl group.

So, after step iii, we have tert-butyl group attached to the ring, along with the amine group.

Wait, but then step iv is HNO3/H2SO4: nitration again.

But the target only has one nitro group. So, that would introduce a second nitro group, which is not desired. So, option D may not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in step ii, the nitro group is reduced, but not to an amine. Maybe it's reduced to a phenyl amine, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the Fe/HCl is for a different purpose, like introducing a substituent via some other reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me think about each step in the options.

Option D:

i) Nitration: nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl: perhaps this is for a substitution reaction. Wait, maybe the nitro group is being converted into something else.

Wait, but nitro groups are not easily replaced. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis under acidic conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, the ring has a nitro group, which is then used in some substitution.

But I'm not very confident about this.

Another thought: the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 type substitution, perhaps after converting a nitro group into a good leaving group.

Wait, but nitro groups can't be directly converted into leaving groups easily. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is first reduced to an amine, then to a leaving group.

Wait, for example:

Nitrobenzene → reduce → aniline → then convert to a diazonium salt (using NaNO2 and HCl) → then, perhaps, perform a substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, in the target molecule, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So, perhaps the nitro group is introduced last, but that would require the ring to have activating groups to allow for substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce ethoxy via substitution.

3. Introduce nitro via nitration.

Wait, but that would require the ring to have activating substituents.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option D again.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: maybe the nitro group is being reduced to an amine. So, nitrobenzene → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → tert-butyl group is added.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration again, which would introduce another nitro group.

But that leads to two nitro groups, which is not desired. So, probably incorrect.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The target has an ethoxy group. Let's think how that's introduced.

The ethoxy group is OEt. It can be introduced via an SN2 substitution, but that requires a good leaving group on the ring. Such a leaving group could be a nitro group converted into a nitroso, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the steps that introduce the ethoxy group. One common way is through the nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong activating groups to make the ring reactive enough.

Alternatively, the ethoxy group can be introduced via an alkylation using an alkyl halide, but that's typically done via Friedel-Crafts, which requires an activating group.

Wait, but in the target, the ethoxy group is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the order of adding these groups could be:

- Add nitro first, then add tert-butyl, then add ethoxy.

But nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts would be difficult after adding nitro. Alternatively, maybe ethoxy is added via another method.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after the nitro group is attached.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butyl group added.

ii) Nitration → nitro group added.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

iv) Nitration again → another nitro group.

v) Diazotization → create diazonium salt.

vi) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis to introduce something.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy group via SN2.

viii) SO3 and H2SO4 → sulfonate group.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

Wait, but this would add multiple substituents, which is not desired. Plus, sulfonate group isn't in the target.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Nitration → nitro.

iii) Sulfonation → SO3 group.

iv) Diazotization → create diazonium.

v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy.

viii) Fe/HCl → ?

ix) Nitration again.

Hmm, again, multiple substituents which aren't in the target.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) Sulfonation → add SO3.

iii) Nitration → nitro.

iv) Fe/HCl → ?

v) Diazotization.

vi) Nitration again.

vii) H3O+ and heat.

viii) Dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH and EtBr → ethoxy.

But again, the sulfonate group is present, which is not in the target. So, option C is probably incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, option D:

i) Nitration → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl.

iv) Nitration → nitro again.

Wait, but this would add a second nitro group, which the target doesn't have. So, option D is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the order is:

1. Nitration: add nitro.

2. Reduction: convert nitro to amine.

3. Friedel-Crafts: add tert-butyl.

4. Diazotization: convert amine to diazonium.

5. Hydrolysis: replace diazonium with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the steps in option D.

Option D:

Step i: nitration → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

So, we have aniline.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl group. Since aniline is strongly activating, this should work. So, we have tert-butylaniline.

Step iv: Nitration → add nitro group. But the target has only one nitro group, so adding another would not fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the steps are different. Maybe after the first nitration, the ring is nitrated again, but that's not the case in the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

i) Nitration → nitro at position x.

ii) Reduction → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl added.

iv) Diazotization and substitution → ethoxy added.

Wait, but the target has three substituents. So, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution where the amino group is replaced with OEt.

But that would require converting the amine to a good leaving group, which is possible via diazotization.

So, let me outline:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl group. But wait, after aniline, the ring is highly activated, so Friedel-Crafts would work. So, tert-butyl group is added.

4. Now, the ring has amine and tert-butyl groups.

5. Then, nitrate again → but the target only has one nitro group, so that can't be.

Hmm, this isn't aligning with the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after the nitro group is converted into a diazonium salt.

Wait, let me think: after nitration, reduction to amine, then convert amine to diazonium salt, then replace it with ethoxy.

But that would replace the nitro group with ethoxy, which would lead to a different structure.

Wait, but the target has nitro and ethoxy both present.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't right.

Another thought: the ethoxy group can be introduced via a nucleophilic substitution on a nitro group. Wait, but nitro groups aren't good leaving groups. So, perhaps the nitro group is first converted into a nitroso group, which can be a better leaving group.

Wait, but I don't remember the exact reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Introduce nitro group via nitration.

3. Introduce ethoxy group via substitution.

But in that case, how to introduce ethoxy without another nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an alkoxy group substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, perhaps after nitration and some other steps, the ring is reactivated.

But I'm not making much progress here.

Looking back at the target molecule, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first. Let me think:

Start with benzene.

1. Introduce ethoxy group via alkylation. But ethoxy is an activating group, so perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution after forming a good leaving group.

Wait, but how to form a good leaving group on benzene? Maybe through nitration, then some substitution.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Alkylation: introduce ethoxy group via substitution. But how? Maybe the amine is converted into a diazonium salt, which is then replaced with ethoxy.

Wait, yes! That's possible.

So, here's a possible pathway:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro group to amine → aniline.

3. Treat with NaNO2 and HCl → diazonium chloride.

4. Perform substitution: replace the diazonium group with ethoxy group. How? Perhaps via a coupling reaction or using a suitable reagent.

Wait, but ethoxy group substitution from a diazonium salt is possible under certain conditions, like with a good nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps using a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact steps.

Assuming that after the diazonium salt is formed, the ethoxy group can be introduced, then we proceed.

Then, after introducing ethoxy, we add the tert-butyl group.

But how? Because the ring now has ethoxy (activating) and the nitro group is gone, replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, but the target has both ethoxy and nitro. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts after activating the ring.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. So, maybe the order is:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butyl group.

2. Nitrate → nitro group.

3. Introduce ethoxy via substitution.

But then, how to introduce ethoxy without another nitro group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after converting a nitro group into a better leaving group.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Convert nitro to a nitroso group (using H2S and H2SO4 or similar), but I'm not sure if that helps.

3. Then, convert nitroso to a leaving group, like using H2O2 to form a hydroxylamine which can leave.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkylation after the nitro group is attached.

Wait, perhaps using a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced by ethoxy, but I don't think that's feasible without a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction after the nitro group is attached.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

Wait, let me think. Option D's steps are:

i) Nitration → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group.

But that can't be correct because the target only has one nitro group.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the steps required for each substituent.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, the order of adding substituents must be such that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

Assuming I add the nitro group last.

So, first add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how?

First, benzene → ethoxy group via Friedel-Crafts? No, because ethoxy isn't a good electrophile for Friedel-Crafts. Wait, ethoxylation is typically done via nucleophilic substitution, but the ring must have a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after the ring has a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps:

1. Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Alkylation → introduce ethoxy group via substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating. So, perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, which requires a metal catalyst, but that's beyond the current options.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to imagine each option's process.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add tert-butyl.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group.

So, after step iv, we have nitro, amine (now substituted with tert-butyl?), and another nitro group. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the correct order in the steps. Let me step through each option's steps.

Let's look at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → FeCl3 and HCl. Wait, maybe a substitution reaction. Alternatively, could be a reduction of the nitro group to aniline.

So, nitrobenzene → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Aniline is strongly activating, so this would add tert-butyl at ortho or para to the NH2 group.

Since the ring now has NH2 and tert-butyl, then:

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

Since the ring has NH2 (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para), the nitro group would be added at a position directed by these groups.

Wait, but the target has nitro at position 3. Let me visualize:

Aniline (NH2 at position 1). After adding tert-butyl, which is added via Friedel-Crafts. Since NH2 is ortho/para-directing, the tert-butyl would go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para).

Assume it's added to position 2. Then, the ring has NH2 at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

Now, nitration would be directed by NH2 (strongest) and tert-butyl. NH2 directs to ortho and para, which are positions 2, 4 (ortho to 1 would be 2 and 6; para is 4).

So, position 4 is available (if tert-butyl is at 2). So, nitro would go to position 4.

But the target has nitro at 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl is at position 3.

Wait, but with NH2 at 1, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts would direct to ortho (2) or para (4). So, nitro would be added to 2 or 4, but target has nitro at 3.

Hmm, this isn't adding up.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

After nitro is added, then tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts, then ethoxy via substitution.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But I'm not confident. After thinking through all the options, I think option D is the correct one. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think again.

Another approach: the target has the nitro group at position 3. Let's see in which option the nitration occurs in such a way that the nitro group is added at position 3.

Looking at the options, only option D's step iv is a nitration after adding tert-butyl.

Wait, in option D:

After step iii, the ring has nitro (from step i) and tert-butyl (step iii).

So, the substituents are nitro (position 1) and tert-butyl (position ?).

Then, step iv is another nitration. So, adding another nitro group.

But the target only has one nitro group, so that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration in step iv is the first nitration, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the steps wrong. Let me think about the order.

Wait, perhaps the correct order of substituents is:

1. Ethoxy group.

2. tert-butyl group.

3. Nitro group.

So, the steps would be:

i) Introduce ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts? No, because ethoxylation is via a different method.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after activating the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

i) Nitrate.

ii) Reduce to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl.

iv) Diazotize and introduce ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

After considering all the options and steps, I think the correct answer is option D.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the order of introducing substituents and the reactions involved must align with the target structure. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The synthesis must ensure that each substituent is added in the correct position relative to the others, considering the directing effects of activating and deactivating groups.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
3. **Step iii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is not present in the target molecule.  
4. Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and ethoxylation, but the introduction of an extra sulfonic acid group makes this option incorrect.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
3. **Step iii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
4. **Step iv**: Nitration adds another nitro group, resulting in two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.
5. Subsequent steps include diazotization, hydrolysis, and ethoxylation, but the presence of two nitro groups makes this option incorrect.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is not present in the target molecule.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
4. Subsequent steps include reduction, diazotization, and ethoxylation, but the introduction of a sulfonic acid group makes this option incorrect.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
2. **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
4. **Step iv**: Nitration adds another nitro group, resulting in two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.
5. Subsequent steps include diazotization, hydrolysis, and ethoxylation, but the presence of two nitro groups makes this option incorrect.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** is the closest match, as it involves the correct general sequence of nitration, reduction, Friedel-Crafts alkylation, and subsequent steps, despite the issue of introducing an extra nitro group.
