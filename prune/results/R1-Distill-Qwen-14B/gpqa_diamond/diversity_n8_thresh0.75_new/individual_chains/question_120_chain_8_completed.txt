Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax itself. Hmm, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position when observed from different points in Earth's orbit, right? And it's inversely related to distance—like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So that probably means that their spatial distribution is uniform, like they're spread out evenly in all directions. Wait, but how does that translate to the number of stars we observe with a given parallax range?

I remember that parallax (p) is related to distance (d) by the formula p = 1/d, but wait, no, it's more precise to say that in parsecs, p (in arcseconds) is equal to 1/d where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/p.

Now, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density (n) of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's say n is the same everywhere. So the number of stars in a certain volume should depend on how much volume we're considering.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So for a given parallax range, say from p to p + dp, how many stars would we expect?

Let me think about how the volume element relates to parallax. Parallax p relates to distance d as d = 1/p. So a small change in p, dp, corresponds to a change in d. Let's see: if p increases by dp, then d = 1/(p + dp) ≈ 1/p (1 - dp/p). Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the volume between distance d and d + dd.

The volume between d and d + dd is a spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd. The volume of a shell is 4π d² dd. So if we have a uniform distribution, the number of stars in this shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But parallax is p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So let's express the volume in terms of p. Let me substitute d with 1/p.

So, the number of stars in terms of p would be N = n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (dd). But wait, dd and dp are related. Since d = 1/p, dd = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with small increments, maybe I can ignore the sign for now, as we're considering ranges.

So, dd = (1/p²) dp. Let me plug that in.

N = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, wait, that would be n * 4π (1/p²) * (dd), and dd is (1/p²) dp. So substituting, N = n *4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp.

So that's N = n *4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So if I consider a small range dp, the number of stars in that range is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number density in terms of parallax would be ~1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer would be A.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through the steps again.

Stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number in a volume is proportional to the volume. The volume per unit distance is a shell, volume = 4πd² dd. So for a given distance range, the number of stars is proportional to d².

But since d = 1/p, we can write d² as (1/p)^2. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to (1/p)^2.

But wait, each shell corresponds to a parallax p. But when considering a range of parallax, say from p to p + dp, that corresponds to a distance from d to d - dd, because as p increases, d decreases. Hmm, perhaps I should model it differently.

Alternatively, the number of stars with parallax between p and p + dp is proportional to the number of stars in the shell at distance d = 1/p, multiplied by the thickness in terms of p.

Wait, let's think in terms of parallax. The number of stars with parallax in [p, p+dp] is N = n * volume between p and p+dp.

But wait, how does the volume change with p? Since p is 1/d, a change dp in p corresponds to a change in d of dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So the volume at a given p is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the answer should be A, 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as 1/p^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space. This means the number density of stars, \( n \), is constant. The number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

Parallax (\( p \)) is inversely related to distance (\( d \)) as \( p = 1/d \) (in parsecs). For a small change in parallax, \( dp \), the corresponding change in distance is \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). The volume of a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = \frac{1}{p^2} dp \), the volume becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.
\]

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( dp \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~1/plx^4**
