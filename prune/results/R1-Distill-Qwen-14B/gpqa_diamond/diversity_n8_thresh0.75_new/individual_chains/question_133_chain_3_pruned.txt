Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and all that. But let's take it step by step. I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is just to remind me that we're at standard conditions, maybe for the Ka values.

Wait, the Ka values are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So H3PO4 can donate three protons, each with these dissociation constants.

The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? Because H3PO4 is the fully protonated form, H2PO4^- is after losing one proton, HPO4^2- after two, and PO4^3- after three. So the orthophosphate here is the HPO4^2- ion.

So, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both of these are phosphate salts. Let me write down their formulas.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. When it dissociates, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water, but in solution, the water is just solvent, so the main ions are Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so the solution contains H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. So this is a buffer solution, right? Because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Or wait, in this case, H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So this is a buffer solution where the acid is H2PO4^- and the conjugate base is HPO4^2-. The pH of the solution can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Since we know the Ka2 value, which is the second dissociation step: H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 would be log(1/(6.2e-8)) ≈ 7.207, since log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 8-0.79=7.21. Wait, no, wait. pKa is -log10(Ka). So Ka2 is 6.2
