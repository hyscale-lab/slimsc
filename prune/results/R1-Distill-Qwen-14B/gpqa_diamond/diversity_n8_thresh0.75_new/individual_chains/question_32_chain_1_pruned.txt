Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope is Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that relativistic energy calculations involve the concept of gamma, which is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. v is 0.96c, so v squared over c squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. Then gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 times 3.5714 is roughly 1, so that's correct.

Now, the energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is the mass of the nucleus multiplied by c squared. But wait, the question is about the kinetic energy or the total energy? Oh, right, when they ask for the energy in particle physics, they usually mean the total energy, which includes rest mass plus kinetic. Or wait, sometimes in these problems, the kinetic energy is what's being referred to. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." RHIC accelerates ions to high speeds, and the energy they refer to is the kinetic energy imparted to the ions, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes the total energy (gamma * m*cÂ²) is what's considered as the beam energy.

Wait, I think in these contexts, the energy mentioned is the kinetic energy. Because the
