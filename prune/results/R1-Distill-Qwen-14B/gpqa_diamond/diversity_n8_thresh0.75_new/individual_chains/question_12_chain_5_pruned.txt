Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and nu. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products, mu and nu. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. So the reaction is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. The pi meson is a boson, right? And the products are a muon and a neutrino. Neutrinos have very small masses, but I think for these kinds of problems, sometimes their mass is considered negligible. Or maybe not? Hmm.

Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. So the total initial momentum is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. Therefore, their magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

I remember that in such decay processes, conservation of energy and momentum applies. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion because it's stationary. The final energy is the sum of the rest masses plus the kinetic energies of the products.

Wait, but wait. The neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the muon's. Because the muon's rest mass is about 105.7 MeV, while the neutrino's is like a few eV, which is way smaller. So maybe we can approximate the neutrino's mass as zero. That might simplify things.

Let me write down the equations.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c².

After decay, the total energy is the sum of energies of mu and nu. So,

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c².

But E_nu is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. Since its rest mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ p_nu c. Because for a particle with negligible mass, E ≈ pc.

Similarly, E_mu is the total energy of the muon: E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ).

Since momentum is conserved, p
