Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in a vacuum. Hmm, let me start by breaking down what's given.

So, Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum (like less than 1e-9 Torr) in the sample compartment. The idea is to remove as many gas molecules as possible to improve imaging because gas can scatter the electrons, right?

But despite the vacuum pumps, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detects them. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I think. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment.

Then, when Mike turns on the electron beam, something happens. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. The temperature is the same, so that doesn't change. But why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

Wait, the mean free path in the absence of the electron beam is λ1. When the beam is on, the gas molecules might interact differently. Oh, right! The electron beam would cause the gas molecules to ionize or perhaps get excited. Because when high-energy electrons (from the beam) hit the gas molecules, they can knock off electrons, creating ions or charged particles.

So if the gas molecules become charged, they would interact with the electric fields in the microscope. Transmission electron microscopes have strong electric and magnetic fields. The charged gas ions would be influenced by these fields, which could cause them to move differently—maybe they'll be accelerated or deflected. 

But how does that affect the mean free path? Well, if the gas particles are ionized, they can't just float around as neutrals anymore. They become charged and might either stick to the walls or be repelled, depending on the setup. Alternatively, the ions could form a plasma or something, but in a high vacuum, maybe they're just more likely to be captured by the walls or other parts of the microscope.

Wait, but in the original scenario, the mean free path is λ1 when the beam is off. When the beam is on, it's λ2. If the gas molecules are now charged, perhaps they have a shorter mean free path because they're being more easily captured by the walls or other surfaces. Because charged particles might stick more easily—like through electrostatic attraction or because the walls can have a charge as well.

So if the mean free path decreases, λ2 would be less than λ1. Because the gas molecules are now more likely to collide with the walls or other ions, so they don't travel as far on average.

Let me think about the factors affecting the mean free path. The mean free path formula is λ = 1/(n * π * d² * sqrt(2)), where n is the number density, d is the collision diameter, and the sqrt(2) comes from the averaging in all directions. But wait, if the beam is causing the gas to ionize, maybe the effective cross-section changes.

Alternatively, the presence of an electric field could influence the motion. If the ions are accelerated, their speed might increase, which could increase the mean free path, but that's if the pressure is lower. Wait, but the pressure is already ultra-high. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: when the beam
