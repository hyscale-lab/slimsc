Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me read it carefully.

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, right? The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr. But some gas particles are still there, and he measures their mean free path as λ1. Mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. But the temperature in the compartment is the same as before. So why would the mean free path change?

Hmm. Mean free path (λ) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, d the diameter of the molecule, and P pressure. So, λ is inversely proportional to pressure. But in this case, the pressure didn’t change because he already created the vacuum, so why would λ change?

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, maybe the gas is getting ionized or something. Oh, right! High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize. So the gas becomes a plasma or charged particles. That might affect how the electrons scatter.

In a normal vacuum, the gas molecules are neutral. But when the electron beam is active, the gas could become ionized. Ionized gas particles have different properties. How does ionization affect the mean free path?

Well, if the gas becomes ionized, the ions could interact with the electron beam. But I'm trying to think about how that affects the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves. Maybe when the gas is ionized, the effective diameter of the particles changes, or their mass, or other factors influence collisions.

Wait, another thought: when a gas is ionized, the mean free path might change because the ions can have different interaction cross-sections compared to neutral molecules. For example, if the electrons cause the gas to ionize, the ions (or charged molecules) might have a larger effective size, making collisions happen more frequently. That would decrease the mean free path because λ is inversely related to the collision rate.

So, if λ1 was the mean free path before the beam was on (neutral gas), and λ2 is after (maybe ionized, so more collisions), then λ2 would be less than λ1. So λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. That makes sense.

Wait, another angle: when the electron beam is on, it might also heat the gas. Oh, but the question says the temperature remained the same. So heating isn't a factor here.

So the main change is the ionization. Neutral molecules vs. charged particles. Charged particles would have more interactions, leading to shorter mean free path. So yes, λ2 would be less than λ1. So option C.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment with a mean free path of gas molecules, λ1, determined based on pressure, temperature, and compartment volume. Upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the mean free path to λ2, despite the temperature remaining constant.

The mean free path (λ) is influenced by factors such as pressure, temperature, and the interaction cross-section of the gas particles. In this scenario, the pressure and temperature did not change, so the change in λ must be due to a modification in the gas's properties. The electron beam likely ionized the gas molecules, converting them into charged particles (ions). Charged particles typically have a larger effective interaction cross-section compared to neutral molecules, leading to more frequent collisions and a shorter mean free path. This implies that λ2, the mean free path after ionization, is smaller than λ1.

Thus, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
