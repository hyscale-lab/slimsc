Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

So the question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting and chemical shifts can give clues about the structure.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. Triplets usually mean each proton is next to two others, like in a CH2CH3 group. The 6H suggests maybe two CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2. Oh wait, maybe it's a diethyl group or something like that. Because diethyl groups have two CH3CH2 groups. Each CH3 would be a triplet if the adjacent CH2 has two protons. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If a CH2 is next to another CH2, the splitting could be more complex. Or maybe it's a geminal situation or something else.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm is likely from a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. Oh, right! If you have a CH2CH3 group, the CH3 would be a triplet because it's next to a CH2 (which has two protons). But wait, wait, if each CH3 is a triplet, and there are 6H in total, that would mean two CH3 groups each coupled to a CH2. So that would be two CH2CH3 groups. So maybe compound A has two ethyl groups attached somewhere.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each of these protons is next to a group with three protons. Wait, but wait, if it's a quartet, the splitting is into four peaks. So each of these protons is adjacent to a group with (n+1) =4, so n=3. So each of these protons is next to a CH3 group. So maybe these are CH2 groups next to CH3.

Putting this together: Compound A has two ethyl groups (each CH2CH3) and possibly a central structure where the CH2 is adjacent to another group. Wait, but wait, if the quartet is 4H, that suggests two CH2 groups each next to a CH3. So maybe the structure is something
