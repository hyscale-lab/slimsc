Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are various symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by breaking down each reaction.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A + 8B → C. I'm thinking about reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in a high ratio. Maybe something like a metal reacting with a halogen? Or perhaps a nitride or something. Wait, 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe A is something like sulfur, and B is oxygen? But sulfur reacting with oxygen forms SO2 or SO3. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like Cl2 or O2.

Wait, the product is bright red. Bright red solids are a bit unusual. Maybe it's a compound like FeO·nH2O? No, that's more of a black or greenish color. Wait, perhaps it's a transition metal. Oh! What about vanadium compounds? Vanadium(V) oxide is bright orange or yellow. Or maybe it's a different element.

Wait, another thought: if C is a compound formed by A and B in a 1:8 ratio, maybe A is something like sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). But sodium reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio, forming NaCl. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms an 8:1 ratio with B.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide. Wait, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen. Wait, another approach: the product is bright red. What about something like Fe(SCN)3? No, that's more of a solution color. Wait, perhaps it's a different compound.

Wait, the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form product E, which is extremely hazardous. So C + 2D → E. And E is dangerous, so maybe something like a toxic gas or a strong acid.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So when C is in water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Since F
