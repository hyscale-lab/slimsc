Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think it through.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh right, that's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Or wait, maybe the numbering is different. Oh wait, no, it's 1-bromo and 2-deutero, so the bromine is at position 1, and a deuterium (a hydrogen isotope) is at position 2.

Wait, but in benzene, positions are numbered such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if the bromine is at position 1 and deuterium at 2, that's the case here. So the structure is bromobenzene with a deuterium adjacent to the bromine.

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. What does that do? I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, it's commonly used for elimination or for dehalogenation, especially in the presence of a good leaving group.

Wait, but in this case, we have a bromine attached to benzene. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Oh right, the reaction where a benzene ring has a leaving group like bromine, and under strong basic conditions, it undergoes elimination, possibly forming a triple bond or a diene.

Wait, another thought: when benzene rings have adjacent substituents, sometimes elimination can lead to the formation of a triple bond. For example, if there are two leaving groups adjacent to each other, you can get a triple bond via elimination. But in 1-bromobenzene-2-d, there's a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. Wait, deuterium is a hydrogen isotope, so it's like a proton but heavier.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. It could abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine. Wait, but in this case, the adjacent position (position 2) has a deuterium. So if the base is trying to abstract a proton (H), but that position has a deuterium, maybe that's less reactive. Hmm. Or perhaps the base is strong enough to abstract the deuterium as well? Wait, deuterium is a
