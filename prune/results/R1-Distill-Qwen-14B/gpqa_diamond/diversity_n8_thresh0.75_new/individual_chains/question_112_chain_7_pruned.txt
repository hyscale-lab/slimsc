Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it.

The question is about an electron's state, which is given as |alpha>. It says that |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first things first, I should probably normalize this state because it's only proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, right. To find the actual state, I need to divide by the norm. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. So, let's compute that.

The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1² +1²) = sqrt(2). So squared, that's 2. For (2-i), the magnitude is sqrt(2² + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1)=sqrt(5). So squared, that's 5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the norm is sqrt(7), so the state is (1+i)|up>/sqrt(7) + (2-i)|down>/sqrt(7).

Okay, now the next part: the operator whose matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, matrix elements. Let's think about the basis here. Since |up> and |down> are eigenstates of S_z, the operator we're considering must be a 2x2 matrix.

So, for a two-level system, the matrix would be:
[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Because when i≠j, the element is ħ/2, else zero. So this is similar to the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Or wait, the Pauli X matrix has 1s off-diagonal. So this operator A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (ħ/2) sigma_x. That makes sense.

Now the question is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of this operator A. Hmm, but wait, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of sigma_x, right? Because A is proportional to sigma_x. So, the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or wait, let me make sure. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are the superpositions in those ways.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are the eigenstates of sigma_x.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, its eigenstates form an orthonormal basis. So, the probabilities are the square of the absolute values of the coefficients when |alpha> is expressed in that basis.

So, let's define the eigenstates of A as |+> and |->, where |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|
