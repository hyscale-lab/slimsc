Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is written as CaY^2- maybe? Because EDTA is often Y^4- when it's deprotonated, so Ca^2+ and Y^4- would combine to make CaY^2-. 

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, which I think means that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the initial concentration [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M. And we need to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in solution.

I think this involves the formation constant, which is K. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-. 

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] ). So, rearranging that equation, [Ca^2+] = [CaEDTA^2-] * K / [EDTA^4-].

But wait, in this solution, the only source of EDTA is the complex itself, right? Because it's a stoichiometric solution, so I think that all the EDTA is tied up in the complex. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Because the complex dissociates a little, so there's some free EDTA^4- present.

But wait, maybe we can make an assumption here. Because the formation constant is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. That means that the concentration of free Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would be very low compared to the complex.

So, let me model this.

Let’s let’s denote [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M initially. Let's assume that the complex dissociates a little, with x being the amount that dissociates. So,

At equilibrium:
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x (because for every complex that dissociates, one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4- are released)

So, plug into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So, solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-12 / 5e10 → wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2 /5) * 1e-12 = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13.

So, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me calculate that.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So, 2 * 3.16e-7 = approximately 6.32e-7. So, x≈6.32e-7 M.

So, the concentration of Ca^2+ is x, which is about 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check my steps. Let me go through again.

The formation constant K is 5e10. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so [CaEDTA] is ≈ 0.02. Then, [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

So, K = 0.02/(x²) =5e10.

x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) )= (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 =4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Yes, that's correct. So, the answer is C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻), we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated complex be \( x \). At equilibrium:
- \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since \( x \) is small compared to 0.02 M),
- \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ] = x\),
- \([ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ] = x\).

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]}{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{EDTA}^{4-} ]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ]\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**
