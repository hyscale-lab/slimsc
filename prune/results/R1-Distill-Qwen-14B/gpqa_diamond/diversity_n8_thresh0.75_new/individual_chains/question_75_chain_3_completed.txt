Alright, let me try to work through this problem. Okay, so the question is about a genetics experiment gone wrong, and we're supposed to figure out why the protein isn't overexpressing. Hmm.

So, the setup: someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They added a sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus of the coding sequence. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with a plasmid and used Lipofectamine. But when they tested, the protein wasn't overexpressed. They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and found something wrong.

Looking at the options, the possible reasons are:

A) Missense mutation in the HA tag sequence
B) Ribosome terminated early
C) Lack of linker causing proteolysis
D) Mouse lacks tRNA for UAA

Wait, what's the problem with the given DNA sequence? Let me look. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. That's good. Then, it's followed by some codons. Hmm, let me see... Wait, I should check the reading frame and see if there's a stop codon early on.

Oh! Stop codons are UAA, UAG, or UGA. So, in the DNA, the complementary sequences would be TAG, TAA, or TGA on the coding (sense) strand. So looking at the provided plus strand, any of these in frame?

Looking at the start: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Wait a second, wait, the sequence after ATG is TAC. So TAC is Tyrosine. Then CCA is Proline, TAC is Y, GAT is D, GTT is V, etc. Let me look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the right reading frame.

The plus strand is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. So, the mRNA would have the same sequence as the plus strand but with T replaced by U.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the mRNA is synthesized from the template (non-coding) strand, which is complementary to the plus (coding) strand. So the mRNA would read the same as the plus strand but with T's to U's. So any TGA in the plus strand would be a UAC in mRNA, which is not a stop codon. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let's clarify.

The coding strand is the one that's the same as mRNA (except Tâ†’U). So the sequence given is the coding strand. So, any in-frame TAG, TAA, or TGA in this sequence would be a stop codon.

Looking at the sequence:

Looking for TAG, TAA, TGA in triplets. Let's scan through.

After ATG, let's look for any of these. Let's see:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

Wait, there's a TGA here. Oh! TGA is a stop codon. Oh wait, the sequence is 5' to 3', and the reading frame starts at ATG.

So the first codon is ATG (Met). Next is TAC (Y). Then CCA (Pro). TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (Pro), GAT (D), TAC (Y), GCC (A), AAA (K), TGA (stop).

Wait, so TGA is the 12th codon in the sequence. Because let's count:

1. ATG
2. TAC
3. CCA
4. TAC
5. GAT
6. GTT
7. CCA
8. GAT
9. TAC
10. GCC
11. AAA
12. TGA

So, the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh! So the construct has a stop codon in the coding sequence. That would cause the ribosome to terminate early, right? Because the ribosome reads the mRNA, and when it hits TGA, it stops.

Wait, but why is the stop codon there? The person was adding a HA tag. The HA tag's sequence should be from the influenza virus, right? So they introduced a coding sequence for HA. But perhaps in their construct, they included a stop codon too early. Or maybe the HA sequence or the way they inserted it introduced a stop codon.

Looking back at the problem: the HA is at the N-terminus, so it's the first part of the coding sequence. So in the DNA sequence, the HA's coding sequence is at the beginning, then GADD45G follows. But wait, in the given sequence, the HA's coding is probably where the early stop is.

Wait, the HA tag is probably just a short sequence, maybe something like YPYDVPDYA or similar. Let's say the HA tag is, for example, 11 amino acids. So the coding DNA would be about 33 nucleotides.

Looking at the sequence: the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the given sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. Then TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), etc. Wait, maybe the HA sequence is causing the problem.

But the problem is that the stop codon occurs early on, at position 12. So the construct's coding sequence includes the HA tag and then GADD45G. But if the HA tag has a stop codon, that would terminate the translation too early.

Wait, looking at the sequence, right after ATG, the first codon is TAC (tyrosine), then CCA (proline), then TAC again (Y), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), etc. So the HA tag is probably the first few codons. But why is there a TGA stop codon at position 12?

Wait, maybe the HA tag wasn't correctly inserted, leading to a frame shift or an early stop. Alternatively, perhaps the person included the stop codon in the HA tag's sequence, mistakenly.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon, but that's unlikely because the HA is a tag at the N-terminus, so you wouldn't want a stop codon there.

Wait, but the construct is supposed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G. So the HA is at the N-terminus, so the first part of the coding sequence should be HA, then the rest is GADD45G. So the stop codon at position 12 would cut the HA sequence short, or perhaps in the middle of GADD45G's sequence.

Wait, perhaps the HA coding sequence wasn't correctly designed, leading to a stop codon in the middle of it. But wait, in the given DNA sequence, the construct starts with ATG, then HA sequence, then GADD45G.

Wait, but the first 12 codons include the HA part and then ends with TGA, which would cause the protein to terminate early. So the protein product would be truncated, maybe not expressed at all if the stop is in the HA.

So why is the stop codon there? Let me think about the options. The options are A to D.

Option A: the HA sequence has a missense mutation. So that would change an amino acid, but not necessarily introduce a stop codon. Unless the mutation is a nonsense mutation.

Option B: the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if the mRNA has a stop codon, which is what we see here. So the stop codon is in the construct.

Option C: No linker, leading to proteolysis. A linker is usually between the tag and the protein. If there's no linker, proteases might cleave the HA tag. But the problem here is that the protein isn't expressed, not that it's cleaved.

Option D: Mouse lacks tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon in the mRNA. So the mouse would have tRNA for UAA? No, because UAA is a stop codon, so during translation, the ribosome stops. So if the mRNA has UAA, the ribosome would stop regardless of the presence of tRNA for that codon, because the stop codons are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs.

Wait, no. Wait, tRNAs are for amino acids. The stop codons don't have tRNAs; instead, release factors recognize them. So the presence of a stop codon in the mRNA would cause termination regardless of the presence of a tRNA. So if the construct has a stop codon, the protein would be truncated or not made at all. So option D is not the cause because the issue is a stop codon, not a lack of tRNA.

So looking back, the problem is that the construct has a stop codon in the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate early. So option B is the reason.

Wait, but why is the stop codon present? Maybe during the plasmid construction, a stop codon was introduced. Perhaps in the HA tag sequence, a TGA was accidentally included. Or perhaps a frameshift occurred during cloning, leading to a premature stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence was designed correctly, but in the plasmid, there's an unintended TGA. So when the construct is expressed, the mRNA has this TGA, which is a stop codon.

So the reason the protein isn't overexpressed is that the coding sequence includes a premature stop codon, leading to early termination of translation.

Looking at the options:

A) Missense mutation in HA: that's a change in amino acid, but unless it's a nonsense mutation, it wouldn't cause a stop.

B) Ribosome terminated early: yes, due to the stop codon.

C) No linker causing proteolysis: the protein wouldn't be expressed, but the issue is the stop codon, not proteolysis.

D) No tRNA for UAA: as explained, this is not the reason.

So the correct answer is B.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, tagged with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) sequence at the N-terminus, fails to produce the expected protein. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals a premature stop codon (TGA) at the 12th codon, which is within the HA tag sequence. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated or non-functional protein.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:**  
  A missense mutation would alter an amino acid in the HA tag but would not necessarily introduce a stop codon. Since the issue is a premature stop codon, this option is incorrect.

- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:**  
  The presence of the TGA stop codon in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. This directly explains why the protein is not overexpressed, making this the correct answer.

- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:**  
  Proteolysis occurs after the protein is synthesized, but the issue here is the absence of the full-length protein due to premature termination. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:**  
  Stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) are recognized by release factors, not tRNAs, during translation. The absence of tRNA for UAA is irrelevant to the termination caused by the stop codon in the mRNA. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence is the root cause of the failed protein expression. This stop codon leads to early termination of translation by the ribosome.
