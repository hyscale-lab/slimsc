Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually used for ring-closing metathesis, but it can also do other things like breaking double bonds and rearranging them.

So first, let's figure out what the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is. Pent-1-ene means it's a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, that's pent-1-ene. But the compound here is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the pentene has a methyl group on the third carbon.

Wait, the formula is probably CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent-1-ene is five carbons, with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, right? But if it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, the methyl is on the third carbon. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the parent chain is pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that's six carbons. No, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent has five carbons. So the structure must be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that's six carbons, so that can't be right. Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent wrong. Let me draw it properly.

Wait, pentene is five carbons,
