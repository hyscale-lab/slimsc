Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let's see. I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei or something similar, but in this case, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So Li-6 maybe? Because Li typically has 3 protons and if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, which is a stable isotope. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The question is about relativistic energy. I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c. So, I guess I should start by finding the relativistic gamma factor because that's part of the energy equation.

Gamma is equal to 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Let me write that down: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's plug that in.

So v = 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2, which is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me think, what's sqrt(0.0784)? Well, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, wait, let me double-check. 0.28 times 3.5714 is approximately 1? 0.28 *3 is 0.84, and 0.28 *0.5714 is about 0.16. So 0.84 +0.16 = 1. Yeah, that's right. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy E0 is m*c². So I need to find the rest mass of the Li nucleus. Li-6 has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. So the mass is approximately the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons. Wait, but protons and neutrons are nucleons, each with a mass of about 938 MeV/c². So each proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for each neutron.

So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass is 6 * 938 MeV/c². Wait, is that right? Let me think. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So 6 nucleons would be 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which
