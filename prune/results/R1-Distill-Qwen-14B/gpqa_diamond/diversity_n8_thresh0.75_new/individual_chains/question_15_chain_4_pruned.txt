Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question involves two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, so similar in size. They've been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh wait, but both have the same mass, so that's the same for both. The orbital period is different though. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3.

They both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things. I remember that for a planet to transit, its orbit must be edge-on relative to us. The probability of that depends on the star's size and the planet's orbit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same size as Planet_1's. Interesting. So M1 = 2*M2, R1 = R2.

I need to find the probability of each planet transiting, and see which is higher.

The transit probability formula... I think it's something like (R_planet / a) * (1 / (something with the star's radius and maybe other factors)). Wait, no, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) * (something else? Or is it more about the orbital distance and star size?)

Wait, I think the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula: (R_star + R_planet) / a, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, the formula for the probability P is (R_star / a) * (something else), but I might be getting mixed up.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can cover when passing in front of it. The probability depends on the size of the planet's orbit (semi-major axis, a) and the size of the star. The formula I recall is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (some geometric factor), but perhaps more accurately, the probability is (R_star / a) * (something involving the impact parameter), but maybe that's getting too detailed.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the formula for the transit probability. Oh right, the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_*/ a) * (1 + (R_p / R_*) ), but since the planets are Earth-like, their radius is much smaller than the star's, so that term is negligible. So approximately, P ≈ (R_* / a) * something else perhaps. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_star / a) * (something else), but I'm not recalling exactly. Alternatively, the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (1 / e), where e is the eccentricity, but both have circular orbits, so e=0. But wait, for a circular orbit, the probability is (R_star / a) * (something involving the star's size relative to the orbit). No, perhaps that's not right.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_*/ a) * (1 / (1 + (m_planet / m_star)^(1/3))) ), but that might be more related to the Doppler method's detectability. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The more closely the planet orbits (small a), the higher the probability, because the planet has a higher chance of crossing our line of sight.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because for a given orbital distance, the chance that the planet's path crosses our line of sight (i.e., the transit occurs) is proportional to the star's size relative to the orbit. So P = (R_*/ a). Because if the semi-major axis is much larger than the star's radius, the chance of transit is lower.

Wait, no, that can't be right because if a is much bigger than R_*, the probability would approach zero, which makes sense. But I'm not sure if that's the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the probability is the area of the star divided by the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit projects onto the sky. But that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_* / a)^2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I should look up the formula. But since I can't do that right now, let me think. Oh, I remember that the transit probability is given by (R_*/ a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is such that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight. The exact formula, I think, is P ≈ (
