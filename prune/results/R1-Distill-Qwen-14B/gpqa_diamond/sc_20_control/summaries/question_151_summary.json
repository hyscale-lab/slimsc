      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the state of a system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector has to be normalized. So I should probably check if this vector is normalized first. Let me compute its norm.\n\nThe vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized yet. So I need to normalize it for the calculations. Right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized.\n\nSo the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). Let me write that down. The normalized state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. Got it.\n\nNow, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P is given with three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, wait. Let me represent that properly.\n\nP = [\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n[0, 1/\u221a2, 0]\n]\n\nHmm, I'm trying to remember what this means. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, an observable is represented by a Hermitian matrix, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the matrix. So the eigenvalues of P would give me the possible results when I measure the observable.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the probability of getting the measurement 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the projection of the state onto that eigenvector.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a 3x3 matrix, maybe it's easier to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P first.\n\nLet me start by finding the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nSo, let's set up the matrix (P - \u03bb I):\n\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n[1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nNow, the determinant of this matrix should be zero.\n\nCalculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tedious, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * [...] \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to expand along the first row.\n\nExpanding the determinant:\n\n= -\u03bb * det[ (-\u03bb, 1/\u221a2), (1/\u221a2, -\u03bb) ) ] \n- (1/\u221a2) * det[ (1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2), (0, -\u03bb) ) ]\n+ 0 * det(..., which is irrelevant since multiplied by zero)\n\nSo the first term is -\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ) ] \n\nThat's -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nThe second term is -(1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ) ] \n\nWhich simplifies to -(1/\u221a2) * ( -\u03bb / \u221a2 ) \n\nWhich is -(1/\u221a2) * ( -\u03bb / \u221a2 ) = -(1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) = (\u03bb) / 2\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ndet = -\u03bb (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (\u03bb/2) \n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2 )\n\nWait, no: because the expansion is:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) + (-1/\u221a2) * ( (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - 0 ) ) + 0\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let's recount.\n\nThe expansion for the determinant is:\n\n= a(ei \u2212 fh) \u2212 b(di \u2212 fg) + c(dh \u2212 eg)\n\nSo for the first row:\n\na = -\u03bb, b = 1/\u221a2, c=0.\n\nThe minors are:\n\nM11 is the determinant of the submatrix:\n[ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[ 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nWhich is (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2.\n\nM12 is the determinant of the submatrix:\n[1/\u221a2, 1/\u221a2 ]\n[0, -\u03bb ]\n\nWhich is (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/(\u221a2)\n\nNow, the determinant is:\n\na*M11 - b*M12 + c*M13\n\nc is 0, so the last term is zero.\n\nSo:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2)( -\u03bb/(\u221a2) ) \n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (\u03bb/2) )\n\nBecause (1/\u221a2)*( -\u03bb/(\u221a2) ) is (-\u03bb)/(2), and because of the sign in the determinant equation, it's minus that: - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/(\u221a2)) ) = lambda/(2).\n\nSo the determinant becomes:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + (lambda/2) \n\nHmm, combining the terms: (lambda/2 + lambda/2 ) is lambda.\n\nSo det = -lambda\u00b3 + lambda.\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 \u2192 \u03bb( -\u03bb\u00b2 + 1 ) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb (1 - \u03bb\u00b2) = 0 \u2192 \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb = \u00b11.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nSo the possible measurement outcomes for the observable P are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability of getting 0. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb=0.\n\nLet's find the eigenvectors for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe'll solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 \u2192 P v = 0.\n\nSo the matrix P is:\n\nRow 1: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nRow 2: [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\nRow 3: [0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nSo the equations are:\n\nEquation 1: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 \u2192 (1/\u221a2) v2 = 0 \u2192 v2 =0.\n\nEquation 2: (1/\u221a2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/\u221a2) v3 = 0 \u2192 (v1 + v3 ) /\u221a2 =0 \u2192 v1 +v3 =0.\n\nEquation 3: 0*v1 + (1/\u221a2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 \u2192 v2=0, same as equation 1.\n\nSo the conditions are v2=0, and v1 = -v3.\n\nSo the eigenvectors are of the form (v1, 0, -v1) ) \u2192 which can be written as v1 (1, 0, -1)^T.\n\nSo the eigenspace for \u03bb=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1)^T.\n\nNow, the probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to 0 in the state vector.\n\nBut wait, the state vector we have is the normalized one: [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ) ]^T.\n\nThe eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)^T, but we need to normalize it as well.\n\nWait, the eigenvector (1,0,-1) has a norm of sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.\n\nSo the probability is the square of the inner product between the state vector and the eigenvector.\n\nLet me compute that inner product.\n\nLet me denote the state vector as |\u03c8> = [ -1/sqrt(6) , 2/sqrt(6) , 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.\n\nThe eigenvector |v> is [ 1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ]^T.\n\nThe inner product <v | \u03c8> is:\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6) )\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSecond term: 0.\n\nThird term: (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).\n\nSo the inner product is [ (-1)/(2\u221a3) ) ] + [ (-1)/(2\u221a3) ) ] = (-2)/(2\u221a3) ) = (-1)/\u221a3.\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3 )^2 = 1/3.\n\nSo the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, but looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's another approach, just to be thorough.\n\nAnother approach: The observable is P. The matrix P is given. The possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1, as we found. The probability to get 0 is the expectation value of the projection onto the eigenspace of 0.\n\nBut since it's a non-degenerate eigenvalue (eigenspace is 1D), the probability is the square of the amplitude as I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the expectation value, but wait no, the expectation is the average value. The probability is the modulus squared of the inner product.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is 1/3. So option C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state vector. The state vector is initially given as \\( \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). Its norm is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{6}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the normalized state vector is:\n\n\\[\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we analyze the observable \\( P \\), represented by the matrix:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix} \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\ \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \n0 & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe eigenvalues of \\( P \\) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \\( \\det(P - \\lambda I) = 0 \\). Expanding the determinant and solving, the eigenvalues are found to be \\( \\lambda = 0, 1, -1 \\).\n\nThe question asks for the probability of measuring \\( \\lambda = 0 \\). To find this, we determine the eigenvector corresponding to \\( \\lambda = 0 \\). Solving \\( (P - 0I)|v\\rangle = 0 \\), the eigenvector is:\n\n\\[\n|v\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThis eigenvector is normalized to:\n\n\\[\n|v\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe probability of measuring \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the normalized state \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) and the normalized eigenvector \\( |v\\rangle \\). The inner product is:\n\n\\[\n\\langle v | \\psi \\rangle = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}) + 0 \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}} + \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\langle v | \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{12}} + \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n\\]\n\nThe absolute value squared is:\n\n\\[\n|\\langle v | \\psi \\rangle|^2 = \\left( \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of measuring \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**C) \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)**\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state vector.

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:\n\n**C) \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)**",
