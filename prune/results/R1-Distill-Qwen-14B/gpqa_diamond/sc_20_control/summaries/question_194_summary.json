      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe problem says each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-\u03b2 E), where \u03b2 is 1/(kT). \n\nWait, each spin has two possible states, so with three spins, the total number of states should be 2^3 = 8. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being either +1 or -1.\n\nI need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states and then sum the exponentials of each energy multiplied by \u03b2.\n\nBut calculating each state individually might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way to group the states by their energies.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's call this sum H, so H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H, so each term in the partition function is exp(\u03b2 J H), since E = -J H \u2192 -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 J H.\n\nSo Z = sum_{all states} exp(\u03b2 J H). Now I need to find how many states have each possible value of H.\n\nLet me consider what H can be. Each term in H is the product of two spins. Since each spin is \u00b11, each product S_i S_j is also \u00b11. So H is the sum of three terms, each \u00b11. So possible values of H are from -3 to +3, in steps of 2. Wait, can it be any of -3, -1, +1, +3?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me think about all possible combinations. Maybe the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3, depending on the number of +1 and -1 terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only certain values are possible. Let's compute H for some example states.\n\nCase 1: All spins up (S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1). Then H = (1*1) + (1*1) + (1*1) = 3.\n\nCase 2: Two up, one down. Let's say S3=-1, others +1. H = (1*1) + (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute each term:\n\nS1S2 = 1*1 = 1\nS1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1\nS2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1\nSo H = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nAnother case: One up, two down. Let's say S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\nH = (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) + ((-1)*(-1)) \u2192 (-1) + (-1) + 1 \u2192 -1 -1 +1 = -1.\n\nWait, same as before. Hmm, perhaps when there's only one up, H is -1.\n\nWhat about all spins down: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then each product is 1, so H=3.\n\nAnother case: Two down, one up. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. H = ((-1)(-1)) + ((-1)(1)) + ((-1)(1)) \u2192 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, same as earlier. So in all cases where the number of +1 spins is not all three or all zero, H is -1? Wait no, wait another case: Let me think of a state where two are up and one down, but with a different configuration. Maybe S2 is down, others up.\n\nWait, no, let's think of S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then:\n\nS1S2 = 1\nS1S3 = -1\nS2S3 = -1\nH = 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nAnother case: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. H = (-1) + (1) + (-1) \u2192 -1 +1 -1 = -1.\n\nWait, so in all cases except when all are up or all are down, H is -1. Wait, but wait another case: What about when two are opposite and the third is opposite to both? Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering all possibilities.\n\nWait, let me think of the state S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1: H=3.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nH = (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) + ((-1)*(-1)) \u2192 (-1) + (-1) + 1 \u2192 -1.\n\nAnother state: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 same as above, H=-1.\n\nWait, so all the states except the all-up and all-down have H=-1. But wait, wait, when H is the sum of three terms, each \u00b11. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about another state. Suppose S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nH = S1S2 = (-1), S1S3 = (+1), S2S3 = (-1). So H = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 \u2192 H = 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 H = (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1.\n\nWait, but what about a state where two are the same and the third is same as one of them? No, that's the same as above. Hmm, I'm not seeing any states that give H=1 or H=-3 except when all are same.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some possibilities. Wait, let me think of all possible states and see what H is.\n\nSo the 8 possible states are:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 H=3.\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1 \u2192 H=1*(1) +1*(-1) +1*(-1) \u2192 1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1 \u2192 H= (-1) + (+1) + (-1) \u2192 -1.\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 H= (-1) + (-1) + (+1) \u2192 -1.\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1 \u2192 H= (-1) + (-1) + (+1) \u2192 -1.\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1 \u2192 H= (-1) + (+1) + (-1) \u2192 -1.\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1 \u2192 H= (+1) + (-1) + (-1) \u2192 -1.\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1 \u2192 H=3.\n\nWait, that's strange. All the other states except the all-up and all-down have H=-1. So in all 8 states, two have H=3 (all up and all down), and the other six have H=-1.\n\nSo H can be 3 or -1. Wait, but wait: when H=3, that's when all are same, so two states (all +1 and all -1).\n\nAnd for H=-1, it's the other six states.\n\nSo each state contributes exp(\u03b2 J H) to the partition function.\n\nSo the partition function Z is:\n\nZ = 2 * exp(\u03b2 J * 3) + 6 * exp(\u03b2 J * (-1)).\n\nWait, because two states have H=3 and six have H=-1.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. In our calculation above, when the state is all +1, H=3, so each term is exp(\u03b2 J *3) for each of the two states. And for the other six states, each contributes exp(\u03b2 J * (-1)).\n\nSo Z= 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} + 6 e^{- \u03b2 J}.\n\nBut looking at the options, option B is Z=2 e^{3 J \u03b2} +6 e^{-J \u03b2}, which matches this.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. Oh wait, wait, the energy E is -J H. So the Boltzmann factor is exp(-\u03b2 E) = exp(\u03b2 J H), correct.\n\nSo in the two states where H=3, the energy E is -3J, so exp(\u03b2 * 3J) because -\u03b2 E = \u03b2 * 3J.\n\nIn the six states where H=-1, E is J, because E = -J*(-1) = J. So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -\u03b2 E ) = exp(-\u03b2 J ( -1 )) = exp(\u03b2 J * 1) = exp(\u03b2 J).\n\nWait wait, wait a minute, that's a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nIf H is S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = H.\n\nThen E = -J H.\n\nSo each state's energy is E = -J H.\n\nThe Boltzmann factor is exp( -\u03b2 E ) = exp( \u03b2 J H ).\n\nSo for the two states where H=3, E = -3J, so the factor is exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nFor the six states where H=-1, E = -J * (-1) = J, so the factor is exp(-\u03b2 J * (J)).\n\nWait, no, wait: E is -J H, so for H=-1, E = - J*(-1) = J. So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -\u03b2 E ) = exp( -\u03b2 J ). \n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Oh, I see where I went wrong. So in the states where H=-1, the energy is E = J, so the factor is exp(-\u03b2 J).\n\nSo each of the six states contributes exp(-\u03b2 J), and the two states contribute exp(3 \u03b2 J).\n\nSo Z = 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} + 6 e^{- \u03b2 J}.\n\nWait, but looking at the options: option B is Z=2 e^{3 J \u03b2} +6 e^{-J \u03b2}.\n\nYes, that matches. So the correct answer should be option B.\n\nBut wait, another way to compute this: perhaps I should think about the sum of H. Let me think, for each state, H can be 3, 1, -1, -3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier analysis, only 3 and -1 occurred. Did I miss any state where H=1 or H=-3?\n\nLet me pick another state: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nH = S1S2 = 1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1.\n\nSo H=1 -1 -1 = -1.\n\nAnother state: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.\n\nH = (-1) + (-1) + (1) = -1.\n\nWait, that's the same as before.\n\nWhat about S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.\n\nH = (-1) + (-1) + (1) = -1.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's no state where H=1 or H=-3 except when all three are same. So the possible H values are 3 (two states), and -1 (six states).\n\nSo the partition function is as I calculated before, leading to option B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \\( Z \\) for a system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, S_3 \\), where each spin can take values \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\). The energy of the system is given by \\( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \\), and the partition function is defined as:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} e^{-\\beta E},\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\beta = 1/(kT) \\). Substituting \\( E = -JH \\), where \\( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\), the partition function becomes:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} e^{\\beta J H}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Determine the possible values of \\( H \\)\nEach spin product \\( S_iS_j \\) can only be \\( +1 \\) or \\( -1 \\), so \\( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \\) can take values \\( 3, 1, -1, -3 \\). However, by analyzing all 8 possible states of the three spins, it is found that:\n\n- When all spins are the same (\\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = +1 \\) or \\( S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = -1 \\)), \\( H = 3 \\). There are **2 such states**.\n- For all other states, \\( H = -1 \\). There are **6 such states**.\n\nThus, the possible values of \\( H \\) are \\( 3 \\) and \\( -1 \\), with 2 states contributing \\( H = 3 \\) and 6 states contributing \\( H = -1 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the partition function\nThe partition function is the sum of contributions from all states:\n\n\\[\nZ = 2e^{\\beta J \\cdot 3} + 6e^{\\beta J \\cdot (-1)}.\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\nZ = 2e^{3\\beta J} + 6e^{-\\beta J}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Match with the options\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option B**:\n\n\\[\nZ = 2e^{3J\\beta} + 6e^{-J\\beta}.\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]",
