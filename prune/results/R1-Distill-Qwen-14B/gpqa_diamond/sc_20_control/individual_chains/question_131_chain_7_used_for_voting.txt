Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is about. So, the question describes a series of reactions and the resulting NMR spectra of the products. The goal is to figure out which two resonances are connected by a cross-peak in the major product's NOESY spectrum.

First, let me break down the information given. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is provided: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Hmm. So, dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene would typically form an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride would probably have two ester groups connected by an oxygen bridge. Wait, no, more accurately, the dehydration of a diacid with an alkene would form an anhydride with two carbonyl groups.

The 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a singlet at 7 ppm. That's a region where aromatic protons usually show up, but aromatic protons typically have more splitting. A singlet suggests that the protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkyne proton, but that's less likely. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with equivalent protons, like a para-substituted benzene. Wait, but if it's an anhydride, maybe we're looking at an aromatic ring? Or maybe it's a conjugated diene? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the 7 ppm peak is due to a ketone or another group. Wait, no, 7 ppm is more likely to be an aromatic proton, but in that case, why is it a singlet?

Wait, maybe the anhydride isn't aromatic. Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes are in the structure. Oh wait, the initial compound is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration would form an anhydride, probably with two ester groups and a conjugated double bond.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is cyclic. For example, in the case of maleic anhydride, which is a cyclic structure with two ester groups. The structure of maleic anhydride has a double bond, and the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be deshielded. Wait, but in maleic anhydride, the protons on the double bond are at around 6-7 ppm. So perhaps that's the 7 ppm singlet. But wait, in maleic anhydride, the protons are on adjacent carbons, so why would they be a singlet? Oh wait, no, in maleic anhydride, the protons are on the same carbon, giving a doublet. Wait, no, let me think. Maleic anhydride has an oxygen bridge between the two carbonyl carbons. The structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The protons on the double bond are on the same carbon, leading to a triplet perhaps? Or maybe it's trans.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me think about the 13C NMR. The anhydride has 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is likely a carbon with a double bond (sp²), and 165 is probably a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester). Since it's an anhydride, the carbonyl would be around 165-180 ppm. So the 137 ppm is probably a sp² carbon adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps as part of a double bond.

So the anhydride has a structure where a double bond is present. Maybe something like succinic anhydride, but that wouldn't have a double bond. Alternatively, think of a cis-dehydro structure. Wait, perhaps the anhydride is formed from fumaric acid (which is a diacid with a trans-diene) or maleic acid (cis diene). Wait, but the starting material is a cis-alkene. So when it's dehydrated, the structure would form a cyclic anhydride with a double bond.

Wait, maybe the anhydride isn't cyclic. Let me think. If the starting acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but no, that's not a diene. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's no diene either. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's a straight chain, and dehydration would form an anhydride with a longer chain. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's butanedioic acid. If it has a cis-alkene, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not an alkene. Oh, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH becomes HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH? No, that's more than a diacid.

Wait, maybe the structure is a diacid with a double bond, so something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-carbon diacid with a double bond in between. So, HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH isn't right. Maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-... No, wait, the starting material has a cis-alkene. So perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond in the middle, making it HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? Wait, but that's a five-carbon diacid. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like HOOC-CH2-CR=CH-CH2-COOH, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the diacid is a substituted compound, but I'm not getting it. Let me think about the anhydride's structure. The 1H NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm. That suggests equivalent protons. So perhaps two protons that are equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, if the anhydride has a structure where the two protons are on a double bond and are equivalent, that would give a singlet. So, for example, in a cyclic anhydride like maleic anhydride, the protons are on adjacent carbons and are a doublet. But if the structure is such that the protons are on the same carbon, perhaps as a geminal diol, but that's not an anhydride.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride structure is such that the protons on the double bond are adjacent to an oxygen, making them equivalent. Wait, maybe the structure is something like:

O
||
O-C-O
   ||
   C=C
   ||
O-C-O
   ||
O

No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride with a double bond where the two protons are equivalent. For example, if the double bond is symmetric, like in a five-membered ring, perhaps the two protons are equivalent.

Wait, maybe the structure is similar to succinic anhydride, but with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is formed by losing water from the diacid, creating a ring. So, for instance, if the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, but that doesn't have a double bond. So maybe the diacid has a double bond in the chain.

Wait, perhaps the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, that's too long. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH, but that would have a four-carbon chain with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3.

Wait, when we dehydrate this, water is lost, and the two carboxylic acid groups form an anhydride. So the double bond would be part of the anhydride structure. Let me draw this.

HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH → dehydrate to form anhydride.

So in the dehydration, two -OH groups from the carboxylic acids are lost, and the double bond forms between the adjacent carbons. So the anhydride would have the structure where the two oxygen bridges are connected, and there's a double bond somewhere.

Wait, maybe it's more like:

O
||
O-C-O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-C
   ||      ||
   O       O

No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between the two carbonyls. For example, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure where the double bond is between the two carbonyl carbons. Wait, that's not possible because the carbonyl groups are on the same side.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between the carbons next to the carbonyl groups. So, for example:

O=C-O-C-O=C=O

Wait, that's not right. I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should move on and see if I can figure out the rest.

The anhydride is reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So what's that structure? 1,3-cyclopentadiene means it has double bonds at positions 1 and 3, making it a conjugated diene. All the remaining positions (2 and 4) have methyl groups, but wait, the name is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the cyclopentadiene has substituents at positions 1,2,3,4. Wait, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with one double bond, but the numbering here is 1,3, so perhaps it's a conjugated diene.

Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring. So positions 1,2,3,4 are substituted with methyl groups. But that's four methyl groups on four consecutive carbons? That can't be possible because the ring is five-membered. Wait, positions 1,2,3,4 can't all have methyl groups because that would leave position 5 without a substituent. Wait, perhaps it's 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl meaning that four of the five ring carbons have a methyl group, but that's unlikely since in a 1,3-cyclopentadiene, some positions are double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentadiene with all four substituents as methyl groups, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclopentadiene that can undergo Diels-Alder reactions.

The reaction between the anhydride and this diene produces two products, major and minor, both with molecular formula C13H16O3.

Wait, the anhydride is a diacid anhydride, so when it reacts with a diene, perhaps it's undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction. But Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. Anhydrides can act as dienophiles, especially those with electron-withdrawing groups. So the anhydride (the dienophile) reacts with the diene (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene) in a Diels-Alder reaction to form a six-membered ring with two ester groups attached.

So the products would be the adducts of the Diels-Alder reaction. The major and minor products would depend on the possible endo and exo transition states, but perhaps in this case, the structure leads to two different regioisomers or stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride has two equivalent carbonyl groups, so the Diels-Alder could form two products based on which carbonyl is attacked. But if the anhydride is symmetrical, then both carbonyls are equivalent, leading to a single product. So why are there two products?

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is a substituted cyclopentadiene, and the reaction leads to endo and exo products. The endo rule suggests that the endo transition state is favored, leading to the major product. But the minor product might be the exo form.

But the question is about the NOESY spectra. NOESY detects through-space proximity between protons. So if two protons are close in space (like in a chair conformation or a particular ring structure), their cross-peak would appear.

In the major product, a cross-peak exists between two resonances, but not in the minor. So the major product has certain protons that are near each other in space, while the minor does not.

Looking at the options, the choices involve different pairs of protons. Let me go through them.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. 6H singlet suggests perhaps three equivalent methyl groups. The 1H at 1.5 is a doublet, maybe adjacent to a CH2.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 2H singlet suggests equivalent protons, perhaps on an oxygen-bearing carbon, like OCH2O.

Option C: Two singlets, 6H each. Both probably from methyl groups.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

So the cross-peak connects these two sets of protons. Now, in the major product, which protons are close to each other?

In a Diels-Alder product, the endo transition state would have the substituents (like the oxygen from the anhydride) being on the same face as the diene's substituents. So, perhaps the substituents from the diene (like methyl groups) are close to the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride).

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So each of the four positions on the ring (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. Wait, no, that can't be because in a five-membered ring, numbering 1,2,3,4 would imply five positions. Oh, wait no, the numbering is 1,2,3,4, so the substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4. So that's four methyl groups on four adjacent carbons of a five-membered ring. But that's a bit odd because in cyclopentadiene, positions 1 and 3 are double bonds. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a substituted cyclopentadiene where four of the five carbons have methyl groups, but positions 1 and 3 are double bonds. Wait, but cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, so 1,3 positions have double bonds. So the structure would be:

CH2=C-CH2-CH2-CH2- (but that's not a ring). Alternatively, it's a ring structure with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions. So the substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So each of these positions has a methyl group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. Positions 1 and 3 are double bonds. So the ring would be:

1 (methyl) - double bond - 2 (methyl) - single bond - 3 (methyl) - double bond - 4 (methyl) - single bond - 5.

Wait, but that can't be right because the ring would have to close, and the double bonds are conjugated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with methyl groups on all four carbons (1,2,3,4). So each of these four carbons has a methyl substituent.

When this reacts with the anhydride via Diels-Alder, the dienophile (anhydride) would add to the diene. The endo transition state would have the substituents (methyl groups) on the diene being on the same face as the substituents (the electron-withdrawing groups) on the dienophile.

So the Diels-Alder adduct would have the diene's substituents (methyl groups) adjacent to the oxygen atoms of the anhydride.

Now, in the major product, which is the endo product, the substituents are arranged so that certain protons are close in space, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

The major product's cross-peak connects two sets of resonances. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: 6H singlet at 1 ppm and 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm. The singlet is likely from a methyl group, perhaps attached to something that doesn't have neighboring protons. The doublet at 1.5 ppm could be a CH2 next to a substituent.

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet might be from three methyl groups, but more likely, perhaps two methyl groups each contributing 3H, but wait, 6H would be two methyl groups each with 3H (but that's 6H total). Alternatively, maybe a single group with 6H, but that's unusual. The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be from an OCH2O group, perhaps in an ether structure. But in the product, we're dealing with an ester or anhydride part.

Option C: Both are 6H singlets. So perhaps two different sets of methyl groups.

Option D: 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. The doublet could be from a CH2 next to a CH, and the 2H singlet might be from an OCH2O group.

Now, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) would be attached to the new six-membered ring. The endo transition state would place the methyl groups close to the oxygen atoms of the anhydride (the dienophile).

In the structure, the adduct would have the methyl groups from the diene adjacent to the ester or anhydride oxygen. So perhaps in the product, the methyl groups are near the oxygen-bearing carbons.

If in the major product, the endo form, the methyl groups are positioned in such a way that their protons are near the protons on the oxygen-bearing carbons, that would create a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Looking at the options, which pairs involve protons that would be near each other in space.

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm (maybe methyl groups) and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm (maybe OCH2O). If the methyl groups are near the OCH2O group, that could lead to proximity.

Alternatively, option D: 1H at 1.5 ppm (maybe a CH2 adjacent to a substituent) and 2H at 3.5 ppm (OCH2O). If the CH2 is near the OCH2O group, that could happen.

But wait, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) are on the same face as the substituents from the dienophile. So in the endo product, the methyl groups would be on the same side as the oxygen atoms, perhaps leading to some spatial proximity.

Let me think about the structure. The Diels-Alder adds the diene (electron-rich) to the dienophile (electron-poor, the anhydride). The endo rule says that the substituents (like the methyl groups) on the diene would end up on the same face as the substituents on the dienophile (like the oxygen atoms). So in the adduct, the methyl groups would be adjacent to the oxygen.

So, the product would have the methyl groups near the oxygen atoms. The OCH2O group (from the anhydride) would be part of the six-membered ring. The methyl groups attached to the ring carbons adjacent to the OCH2O would be near the OCH2O group.

So in the adduct, the methyl groups (probably as CH2CH3) might be close to the OCH2O group.

In the NOESY spectrum, if the methyl protons are close to the OCH2O protons, a cross-peak would appear. Looking at the options, option B has 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm (which could be from two methyl groups) and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm (OCH2O).

Wait, but why 6H singlet? Each methyl group has 3H, so two methyl groups would give 6H as a singlet. So that's plausible. The 2H singlet at 3.5 is likely from OCH2O.

So the cross-peak would be between the methyl group protons and the OCH2 protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 is part of an ester or anhydride bridge. So, in the product, the OCH2O would be part of a six-membered ring, and the adjacent methyl groups would be close to the OCH2O.

Therefore, in the NOESY, the methyl protons (from the diene) would be close to the OCH2O protons.

So the cross-peak connects the 6H singlet (methyl) and the 2H singlet (OCH2O).

Looking at the options, option B is 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm.

Wait, but why would the methyl groups be at 1.7 ppm? Methyl groups are typically around 0.9-1.5 ppm. 1.7 is a bit higher, maybe if they're adjacent to an electronegative atom or in a strained environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from another group. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: in the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state would have the substituents (methyl groups) from the diene near the substituents (like the carbonyl groups) of the dienophile. So, the methyl groups might be near the carbonyl groups, causing some deshielding and shifting their proton signals to higher ppm.

Alternatively, maybe the 6H singlet comes from another part of the molecule, like the bridgehead methyl groups. But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from the methyl groups attached to the oxygen. But wait, oxygen usually doesn't have methyl groups directly attached; more likely, it's attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm is from an OCH2O group. The 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm would then be from two methyl groups adjacent to that OCH2O. So, when the ring forms, the methyl groups are next to the OCH2O, leading their protons to be near the OCH2O's protons, hence the cross-peak.

So, in the major product (endo), the methyl groups are positioned such that their protons are near the OCH2O protons. Hence, the cross-peak appears in the NOESY.

Now, looking at the options, option B says 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. So that would be the pair connected by the cross-peak.

Wait, but why is the 6H at 1.7 ppm? Methyl groups are usually lower, like around 1 ppm. Maybe in this case, the methyl groups are adjacent to an oxygen, causing a shift to 1.7 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps the diene's methyl groups are more deshielded.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H is from two methyl groups attached to the same carbon, making a 6H singlet. For example, if two methyl groups are attached to a single carbon, their 6H would be as a singlet. But in the Diels-Alder adduct, each ring carbon would have substituents. It's possible that some carbons have two methyl groups.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, each of the four ring carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. When it reacts via Diels-Alder, each of these substituents would end up in the adduct.

In the adduct, the substituents from the diene would be on the same face as the substituents from the dienophile. So, the methyl groups would be on the same face as the oxygen atoms.

In the adduct, perhaps two of the methyl groups are adjacent to the OCH2O group, leading their protons to be near those of the OCH2O.

So, in the major product (endo), the 6H singlet (two methyl groups) would have their protons near the OCH2O protons, hence the cross-peak.

Looking back at the options, option B is 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H is from the two methyl groups on the same carbon, but that would require a geminal dimethyl, which would have a singlet. But in the Diels-Alder product, each substituent is on a different carbon.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from three methyl groups, but that would require 9H. No, so 6H is two methyl groups (each with 3H), so perhaps from two adjacent carbons each having a methyl group. Then, in the product, these two methyl groups would be near the OCH2O group.

So, the cross-peak would connect these two methyl groups' protons to the OCH2O protons.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a reaction sequence starting with a dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene, which is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products: a major (endo) and a minor (exo). Both products have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The key focus is on identifying which two resonances in the NOESY spectrum of the major product are connected by a cross-peak.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The anhydride is formed by dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Its 1H NMR shows a singlet at 7 ppm, likely from equivalent protons, and its 13C NMR shows peaks at 137 ppm (sp² carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl). This suggests a cyclic anhydride structure with a double bond.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The anhydride acts as a dienophile, reacting with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring. The major product (endo) is favored due to secondary orbital interactions, while the minor product (exo) lacks these interactions.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak in the Major Product**:  
   NOESY detects through-space proximity between protons. In the major product, the endo transition state positions the methyl groups from the diene near the oxygen-bearing carbons of the anhydride. This spatial proximity causes a cross-peak between the protons of the methyl groups and those of the oxygen-bearing carbons.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected proximity of methyl groups to the oxygen-bearing carbons.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet likely corresponds to two methyl groups (3H each), and the 2H singlet corresponds to an OCH₂O group. These groups are spatially close in the major product, making this option plausible.  
   - **Option C**: Two 6H singlets. This does not match the expected splitting pattern for the methyl groups and oxygen-bearing carbons.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. While the 2H singlet matches the OCH₂O group, the 1H doublet does not align with the expected methyl group protons.

### Conclusion:
The major product's NOESY spectrum shows a cross-peak between the 6H singlet (methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (OCH₂O group). This matches **Option B**. 

Answer: B
