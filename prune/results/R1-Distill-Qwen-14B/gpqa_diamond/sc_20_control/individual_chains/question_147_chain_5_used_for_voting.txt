Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Annihilation process, right? Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. Oh wait, wait, the antiproton is slowly moving. And the mass of A times c squared is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, first, let's understand the setup. So protons and antiprotons annihilating into these charged particles A. But the antiproton is moving slowly. That probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy, so maybe non-relativistic? Or perhaps we can make some approximation here.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is 'slowly' moving. So perhaps it's moving at non-relativistic speeds. So maybe I can approximate using non-relativistic mechanics? But then again, when dealing with high-energy particles, sometimes relativistic effects are important, but maybe not here.

Wait, but the antiproton is moving, and the protons are annihilating. Oh wait, actually, protons and antiprotons are annihilating each other. So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So their rest masses are about the same. Wait, the proton has a rest mass energy of about 938 MeV/c². So m_p c² is around 938 MeV each.

But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate its momentum as being non-relativistic.

Wait, but wait, in the annihilation, the initial rest frame is probably the center-of-momentum frame, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial frame is the lab frame where the antiproton is moving and the proton is at rest? Or perhaps the problem is considering the rest frame of the proton-antiproton system?

Wait, wait, the question is about the velocity of particle A, which is one of the products. So I think the key is to apply conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me try to outline the approach. Since this is a high-energy physics problem, I probably need to use conservation of four-momentum. Alternatively, in the center-of-mass frame, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let's think about their rest masses. The proton has mass m_p, and the antiproton also m_p. But wait, the problem says that the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. So maybe we can treat it as if it's at rest? Or perhaps not, because in reality, it's moving.

Wait, but in the process p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−, all the initial mass energy will contribute to the rest mass and kinetic energy of the products.

Wait, but the problem says m_A c² is 300 MeV. So each A has a rest energy of 300 MeV.

Hmm, let me think about the initial and final four-momenta.

The initial system is a proton and an antiproton. Let me denote the proton as moving with some velocity u, and the antiproton as moving with velocity v. But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe its velocity is small compared to c. So perhaps we can consider the proton at rest, and the antiproton moving at a low speed. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, wait, perhaps the setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Then, in that case, the initial four-momentum is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's energy and momentum.

So the initial four-momentum squared would be (E_initial)^2 = (E_p + E_pbar)^2 - (p_pbar c)^2, considering that the proton is at rest, so p_p = 0.

But wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then E_pbar is approximately m_p c² (1 + (p^2)/(2 m_p^2 c²)), using the non-relativistic approximation. So perhaps we can model this.

But let's think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum. So in the initial state, the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c², and the antiproton has energy E = γ m_p c², where γ is about 1 + (v²)/(2 c²) since it's moving slowly. Its momentum is p = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v (since v is small, γ≈1).

The final state consists of four particles: two A+ and two A−. But wait, because the initial charge is zero (proton and antiproton have +e and -e, so total charge zero), the products must also have total charge zero. So each A+ and A− have charge +e and -e, so two each balances out.

But when considering the production of these four particles, perhaps it's better to model it as two pairs, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-body decay, but that's not clear.

Wait, but for the purpose of conservation, perhaps we can model this as a system where the total four-momentum is conserved. So initial four-momentum is (E_initial, p_initial), and final is (E_final, p_final).

But since the initial proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, the initial total momentum is just p_initial = p_pbar = m_p v (since v is small, γ≈1).

In the final state, all four A particles will carry away momentum, but perhaps we can assume that they move in such a way that their momenta add up to p_initial. Hmm, but this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is symmetric, so the two A+ and two A− might be produced in pairs, moving in opposite directions, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the annihilation produces two pairs of A particles, each pair moving in opposite directions. So perhaps each pair has equal and opposite momentum. But even then, the total momentum would be the sum of all four momenta, so perhaps it's more manageable if we can find the velocity of each A.

Wait, but the question is only about the velocity of particle A, which I think refers to the A+ and A−. Or perhaps each A has the same speed, but opposite directions? No, that's not necessarily the case. Since the initial momentum is along, say, the x-axis, maybe the two A+ and two A− have various momenta. But this could get complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is suggesting that the particles are produced with the same velocity, but perhaps that's an oversimplification.

Wait, perhaps I should model this in the center-of-momentum frame. Let me see.

But the initial system's center-of-momentum frame would be moving with some velocity relative to the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving. Hmm, maybe that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps because the antiproton is moving slowly, we can assume that the total energy of the system is approximately 2 m_p c². Because the antiproton's kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass. So E_initial ≈ m_p c² (proton) + m_p c² (antiproton) = 2 m_p c².

Wait, but the antiproton's energy is E = γ m_p c². If it's moving slowly, then γ is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²), but if v is much smaller than c, then γ≈1. So E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But the final system has four particles, each with rest mass m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the total rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. But the initial rest energy is 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV. So there's a lot of energy left for kinetic energy.

But perhaps in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy is sqrt(s), where s is the square of the total four-momentum.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the total energy and momentum in the initial frame and then find the velocity of each A.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is symmetric, so each A is moving with the same speed, but in opposite directions. Or perhaps all four are moving in the same direction, but that might not make sense because of momentum conservation.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the center-of-momentum frame.

In the initial system, the total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c², and the total momentum is p_initial = γ m_p v. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v<<c, so γ≈1 and p_initial ≈ m_p v.

In the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame relative to the lab frame would be such that the momentum of the initial system is balanced.

Wait, the velocity of the center-of-momentum frame (u) can be found using the formula:

u = (p_initial c²) / (E_initial)

So if E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c², and p_initial ≈ m_p v, then:

u ≈ (m_p v c²) / (2 m_p c²) ) = v / 2.

So the center-of-momentum frame is moving at velocity v/2 relative to the lab frame.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so u is small. So perhaps in the center-of-momentum frame, the initial particles are almost at rest, but that might not be the case.

Wait, maybe not the best approach. Let me try another way.

Since the problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV, which is much less than the initial rest masses (each about 938 MeV), the products must be moving relativistically. But the question is about their velocity.

But wait, let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

Assuming that all four particles are produced with the same speed, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps two A+ and two A− move in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. But perhaps each pair (A+ and A−) are moving in opposite directions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the four particles are moving in pairs, each pair having equal and opposite momenta. So the total momentum of the system would then be zero, but that's not possible because the initial system has some momentum.

Wait, but in the initial system, the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, so the total momentum is p_initial = p_pbar = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v.

So the final system's momentum must also equal m_p v.

Wait, but if the four A particles are moving in such a way to conserve momentum, perhaps the easiest assumption is that they all move in the same direction as the initial momentum. But that's probably not the case because then their momenta would add up to something larger than the initial. Alternatively, perhaps some are moving forward and some backward.

Hmm, maybe it's better to consider that each pair (A+ and A−) have opposite momenta, so their individual momenta cancel each other. But then, how does the total momentum add up to m_p v?

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think about the four-momentum.

The initial four-momentum is the sum of the proton's four-momentum and the antiproton's four-momentum.

Proton is at rest, so its four-momentum is (m_p c, 0, 0, 0).

The antiproton has four-momentum (γ m_p c², γ m_p v c, 0, 0).

So the total four-momentum is (m_p c² + γ m_p c², γ m_p v c, 0, 0).

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, γ ≈1, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c², and p_initial ≈ m_p v.

Now, the final four-momentum is the sum of the four-momenta of the four A particles.

Let me denote each A particle as having energy E_A and momentum p_A. Since each A has mass m_A, E_A = sqrt( (p_A c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ).

But this seems complicated with four particles. Maybe there's symmetry in the problem that allows us to simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps the annihilation produces two pairs of A particles, each pair moving in opposite directions. So for each pair, their momenta are equal and opposite, but their energies add. Then, the total momentum of the four particles would be the sum of the two momenta from each pair.

Wait, perhaps each pair (like an A+ and A−) has opposite momenta. For example, two A+ moving in one direction, two A− in the opposite. But that might not balance the momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the two A+ move in opposite directions, and the same for the two A−. But that doesn't directly help with the momentum conservation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, so each A must have equal and opposite momenta. But the initial system has some momentum, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is such that in the lab frame, the four A particles are produced in a way that their total momentum equals the initial momentum of the system, which is m_p v.

Hmm, perhaps to simplify, let's assume that each A has the same speed, but that might not hold. Alternatively, maybe all four A particles have the same speed, but arranged symmetrically. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of energy and momentum conservation in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving.

So initial energy:

E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

Initial momentum:

p_initial = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v (since v is small, γ ≈1).

Final situation: four A particles, each with energy E_A and momentum p_A (vector).

Total energy conservation: E_initial = sum of E_A for each A.

Momentum conservation: p_initial = sum of p_A vectors.

But solving this for four particles is complicated, so perhaps the problem makes some symmetry assumption.

Wait, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum. But that would make their momenta additive, which might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps two A+ and two A− are moving in the same direction, but that's not clear.

Wait, perhaps the problem is symmetric in the way the particles are produced, so the four A particles are produced such that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Wait, another thought: maybe the four particles are moving in such a way that each pair (A+ and A−) have opposite momenta. So for each pair, their momenta cancel each other, leaving a net momentum equal to the initial.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved using the conservation laws in the lab frame, perhaps by assuming that the total momentum of the four A particles equals the initial momentum, and the total energy equals the initial energy.

Wait, but let's make some approximations. The initial momentum is p_initial ≈ m_p v. The initial energy is E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

The four A particles each have rest mass m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the total rest mass is 4*300 = 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial energy of 1876 MeV (since 2 *938 ≈ 1876). So the kinetic energy is about 676 MeV.

Now, if we can assume that the four A particles are moving with the same speed, but in the same direction, their momenta would add up. But that would make the total momentum 4 p_A, which must equal the initial p_initial.

Wait, but let me model that. Let me assume that each A has a momentum p in the same direction as the initial. So total momentum is 4p = m_p v. 

Each A's energy is E_A = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ) 

Total energy from all four A's is 4 E_A = 2 m_p c² + γ m_p c². Wait, but the initial E_initial is E_p + E_pbar. Wait, perhaps the initial E_initial is m_p c² (proton) + γ m_p c² (antiproton) ≈ 2 m_p c² if γ≈1.

So 4 E_A ≈ 2 m_p c².

So 4 * sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_A c²)^2 ) = 2 m_p c².

And we have from momentum: 4 p = m_p v.

Hmm, but I don't know m_p v yet. Wait, but m_p v is the initial momentum, which is p_initial. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v is small, so maybe m_p v is much less than m_p c. So perhaps we can make some non-relativistic approximation.

Wait, but if we proceed with the equations:

Equation 1: 4 p = m_p v.

Equation 2: 4 sqrt( p² c² + m_A² c^4 ) = (m_p c²) (1 + γ) ≈ 2 m_p c².

Wait, but that might not be correct because the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton) + γ m_p c² (antiproton). Since the antiproton is moving slowly, γ≈1, so E_initial≈2 m_p c².

So equation 2 becomes:

4 sqrt( p² c² + (300 MeV)^2 ) = 2 * 938 MeV.

So 4 sqrt(p² c² + (300)^2 ) = 2 *938.

Divide both sides by 4: sqrt( p² c² + 300^2 ) = (2 *938)/4 = 469 MeV.

Squaring both sides: p^2 c^2 + 90000 = 469^2 ≈ 469*469.

Compute 469^2: 469 *469. Let's compute it:

400^2=160000, 69^2=4761, cross terms 2*400*69=55200.

So 160000 +55200 +4761= 220,961 (since 160000+55200=215200; 215200+4761=219,961). Wait, but 469^2 is 469 × 469.

Wait, 469 × 400 = 187,600.

469 × 60 = 28,140 → 187,600 + 28,140 = 215,740.

469 ×9=4,221 → 215,740 +4,221=219,961. So yes, 469²=219,961.

So p^2 c^2 + 90000 = 219,961 → p^2 c^2 = 219,961 -90,000 = 129,961.

So p c = sqrt(129961) ≈ 360.5 MeV/c.

Wait, sqrt(129961) is 360.5?

Let me compute 360^2 = 129600. 360.5^2= (360 +0.5)^2=360² + 2*360*0.5 +0.5²= 129600 +360 +0.25= 129960.25. Oh, which is very close to 129961. So p c ≈360.5 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 360.5 MeV/(c).

Now, from equation 1: 4 p = m_p v.

So m_p v =4 * 360.5 MeV/c.

But m_p c²=938 MeV, so m_p = 938 MeV/(c²).

Thus:

v = [4 * 360.5 MeV/c ] / [ m_p ] 

Wait, m_p is in MeV/(c²), so:

v= [4 *360.5 (MeV/c) ] / [ 938 MeV/(c²) ) ] 

The MeV units cancel, and we have:

v = [ (4 * 360.5) / 938 ] * c.

Compute 4 *360.5 = 1442.

So v = (1442 / 938) c ≈ (1.537) c.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, that's greater than c, which is impossible.

Oh wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere in my assumptions.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction. Because according to this calculation, it's leading to v> c, which is impossible.

Hmm, perhaps that's the problem. So my assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. So I must have made a wrong assumption there.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is flawed. Maybe I should model this using the conservation of four-momentum.

Wait, the initial four-momentum is (E_initial, p_initial) where E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c², and p_initial = γ m_p v. Since v is small, γ≈1, so E_initial≈ 2 m_p c^2, and p_initial≈ m_p v.

The final four-momentum is the sum of the four-momenta of the four A particles. Let's denote each A's four-momentum as (E_A, p_A), but I don't know the direction of p_A. So this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the energy and momentum in the center-of-momentum frame, but it's unclear.

Wait, another thought: since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is small, so the majority of the energy comes from the proton's rest mass. So maybe the products' kinetic energy is small, and they move at velocities much less than c. But that doesn't seem right because their rest mass is 300 MeV, and the available energy is much higher.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the problem in the center-of-mass frame of the initial particles.

In the center-of-mass frame, the initial momentum is zero. So the products' total momentum must also be zero. So each A must have equal and opposite momenta. But then, each pair would have opposite momenta. So for four particles, perhaps two pairs in opposite directions.

Wait, but in that case, each pair would have momenta adding to zero. So each pair's momenta would cancel each other.

But then, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame would be the sum of the four A's rest energies plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, but in the center-of-mass frame, the initial energy is sqrt(s), where s is the square of the total four-momentum.

s = (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

Since E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c², and p_initial = γ m_p v ≈ m_p v.

So s ≈ (2 m_p c^2)^2 - (m_p v c)^2.

Which is approximately (4 m_p^2 c^4) - (m_p^2 v^2 c^2).

But since v is small, v² c² is negligible compared to m_p^2 c^4, so s ≈ 4 m_p^2 c^4.

Thus, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is sqrt(s) = 2 m_p c².

So the total energy available in the center-of-mass frame is 2 m_p c².

Each A has rest mass 300 MeV, so four of them have a total rest mass energy of 1200 MeV, which is much less than 2 * 938 ≈ 1876 MeV. So the products have a lot of kinetic energy.

But how to find the velocity of each A?

Hmm, perhaps in the center-of-mass frame, each A has the same energy, and opposite momenta. So for four particles, perhaps two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite. Or perhaps each A is moving in a direction such that their momenta sum to zero.

Wait, but four particles with momenta that cancel each other would require that the sum of their momentum vectors is zero. So maybe two are moving in the +x direction and two in the -x, each with the same magnitude. So their momenta would cancel.

In that case, each A's momentum would be p, but two are +p and two are -p. So the total momentum is zero, which satisfies the center-of-mass condition.

Then, each A's energy would be E = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m_A^2 c^4 ).

The total energy would be 4 E = 2 m_p c².

So 4 E = 2 m_p c² → E = (m_p c²)/2.

So,

E = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + (300)^2 ) = (938 MeV)/2 = 469 MeV.

So,

sqrt( p^2 c^2 + 90000 ) = 469 → p^2 c^2 = 469^2 - 90000.

Wait, I think I did this calculation earlier. 469^2 is 219,961. So 219,961 - 90,000 = 129,961.

So p c = sqrt(129961) ≈ 360.5 MeV/c.

So p = 360.5 MeV/(c).

So each A has momentum p=360.5 MeV/c.

Now, the velocity can be found using the relativistic momentum formula:

p = γ m_A v.

Wait, no. Momentum is p = γ m_A v, but we can write:

p c = γ m_A c v.

So,

v = (p c) / (γ m_A c )

But γ = E / (m_A c²) = 469 / 300 ≈ 1.5633.

So,

v = (360.5 MeV/c) * c / ( (469/300) * m_A c )

Wait, that seems complicated, but let's compute it.

Wait, m_A c² is 300 MeV, so m_A = 300 MeV/(c²).

So,

v = (360.5 MeV/c * c) / ( (469/300) * 300 MeV/(c²) * c )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 360.5 MeV/c * c = 360.5 MeV.

Denominator: (469/300) * 300 MeV/(c²) * c = 469 MeV/(c).

So,

v = (360.5 MeV) / (469 MeV/(c)) ) * c ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the units wrong. Let's write it more carefully.

p c = 360.5 MeV.

E = 469 MeV.

So,

p c = γ m_A c² v.

Wait, because p = γ m_A v → p c = γ m_A c v.

And since E = γ m_A c²,

p c = (E / c²) * c v → p c = E v / c.

So,

v = (p c^2) / E.

Because,

v = (p c^2) / E.

So,

v = (360.5 MeV * c^2 ) / (469 MeV )

The MeV units cancel, so:

v = (360.5 / 469) c ≈ (0.767) c.

Hmm, 0.767 c would be approximately 0.77c. So looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which is close to 0.767c.

Wait, but wait, in the center-of-mass frame, each A has velocity v = 0.767c. But the lab frame is moving relative to the center-of-mass frame, so the velocity in the lab frame would be different.

Ah, that's a crucial point. Because the lab frame is moving at velocity u relative to the center-of-mass frame, the velocity of each A in the lab frame would have to be adjusted via a Lorentz transformation.

Hmm, this complicates things. So I think I need to adjust for the velocity of the center-of-mass frame relative to the lab frame.

Earlier, I thought the velocity of the center-of-mass frame u is given by u = (p_initial c²) / (E_initial).

In the lab frame, the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v (since γ ≈1), and E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

So,

u = (m_p v c²) / (2 m_p c² ) ) = v/2.

So the center-of-mass frame is moving at velocity u = v/2 relative to the lab frame.

In the center-of-mass frame, each A has velocity v_cm = 0.767c in some direction. But in the lab frame, the velocity of each A would be v_lab = u + v_cm, but that's a non-relativistic addition which isn't correct. Instead, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is:

v_lab = (u + v_cm) / (1 + (u v_cm)/(c²)).

But in this case, each A is moving in the same direction as u, but wait, in the center-of-mass frame, the A's are moving in various directions. Hmm, perhaps the situation is more complicated.

Wait, earlier I assumed that in the center-of-mass frame, each A has the same speed, but that may not hold because the problem's symmetry might require that.

Alternatively, perhaps in the center-of-mass frame, each A is moving in such a way that their momenta add up to zero. So, for example, two A's are moving in +x and two in -x, each with same speed.

Wait, but in any case, the velocity in the lab frame would depend on the direction of motion in the center-of-mass frame.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated, and perhaps the problem expects us to ignore this and just compute the velocity in the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, but the options are all of the order of 0.7c to 0.96c. So my earlier calculation of 0.767c would correspond to option A, 0.77c.

But wait, in the problem statement, it's said that the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the initial system's center-of-mass velocity is small, and the velocity of the A's in the lab frame is close to their velocity in the center-of-mass frame.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me double-check the calculations.

So in the center-of-mass frame, each A has velocity v_cm = 360.5 c^2 / 469 c ≈ 0.767c.

But wait, I think the velocity in the lab frame would be higher because the center-of-mass frame is moving towards the direction of the antiproton's motion.

But perhaps the problem expects us to neglect this and just take the velocity as 0.77c, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in not considering the lab frame correctly.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial problem is considering the annihilation in the rest frame of the proton. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is negligible. Thus, the initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c², and the initial momentum is m_p v.

In this scenario, the four A particles are produced with some velocities and momenta.

But given the time I've spent and the possible options, I think the correct answer is option A) 0.77c.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of each particle \( A \) is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to determine the velocity of particle \( A \).

   - The proton is at rest, so its energy is \( E_p = m_p c^2 \), where \( m_p c^2 \approx 938 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately \( E_{\bar{p}} \approx m_p c^2 \), and its momentum is \( p_{\bar{p}} \approx m_p v \), where \( v \ll c \).

   The total initial energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_p + E_{\bar{p}} \approx 2 m_p c^2 \approx 1876 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
   The total initial momentum is:
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\bar{p}} \approx m_p v.
   \]

2. **Final Energy and Momentum**:
   - The final state consists of four particles \( A \), each with rest energy \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - The total rest energy of the final system is:
     \[
     E_{\text{rest, final}} = 4 m_A c^2 = 1200 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]
   - The remaining energy is available as kinetic energy for the particles \( A \).

3. **Energy Conservation**:
   The total energy in the center-of-momentum (COM) frame is:
   \[
   E_{\text{COM}} = \sqrt{s}, \quad \text{where } s = (E_{\text{initial}})^2 - (p_{\text{initial}} c)^2.
   \]
   Since \( p_{\text{initial}} \ll E_{\text{initial}} \), we approximate:
   \[
   s \approx (2 m_p c^2)^2 = 4 (m_p c^2)^2.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   E_{\text{COM}} = \sqrt{s} = 2 m_p c^2 \approx 1876 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

4. **Momentum Conservation**:
   In the COM frame, the total momentum is zero. The particles \( A \) are produced symmetrically, with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

5. **Energy of Each Particle \( A \)**:
   In the COM frame, the total energy is shared equally among the four particles \( A \):
   \[
   E_A = \frac{E_{\text{COM}}}{4} = \frac{2 m_p c^2}{4} = \frac{938 \, \text{MeV}}{2} \approx 469 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

6. **Relating Energy and Momentum**:
   For each particle \( A \), the energy is related to its momentum \( p_A \) by:
   \[
   E_A = \sqrt{(p_A c)^2 + (m_A c^2)^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \( E_A = 469 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \):
   \[
   469^2 = (p_A c)^2 + 300^2.
   \]
   Solving for \( p_A c \):
   \[
   (p_A c)^2 = 469^2 - 300^2 = 219961 - 90000 = 129961.
   \]
   \[
   p_A c = \sqrt{129961} \approx 360.5 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

7. **Relating Momentum to Velocity**:
   The relativistic momentum is given by:
   \[
   p_A = \gamma m_A v, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{E_A}{m_A c^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{469}{300} \approx 1.5633 \):
   \[
   p_A c = \gamma m_A c v.
   \]
   Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{p_A c}{\gamma m_A c} = \frac{360.5}{1.5633} \approx 0.767c.
   \]

8. **Adjustment for Lab Frame**:
   The COM frame is moving relative to the lab frame. However, since the antiproton is moving slowly, the velocity of \( A \) in the lab frame is close to its velocity in the COM frame.

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.767c \), which corresponds to option **A) 0.77c**.
