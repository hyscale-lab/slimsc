Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions. The question is about the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for six substances when they react with excess bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions, either ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, but wait. Electrophilic substitution usually involves adding an electrophile to the ring. Bromine is a di-electrophile, I think. Oh, right, in excess, it probably adds more than once. But wait, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps each compound is undergoing a mono-bromination, but with excess Br2, maybe it's a substitution where the substituent directs where the Br goes.

Wait, but mono substitution. So each of these compounds is actually a benzene ring with a substituent, and when bromine is added, it's adding a Br in a certain position relative to the substituent.

So the key here is to find for each substituent whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's meta or para directing.

Let me list the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl substituent. Activating groups make the ring more reactive. Methyl is ortho/para directing. So when the ring undergoes substitution, the Br can add to ortho, para, or meta positions relative to the substituent. But wait, activating groups direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions because they are activating and have +I effect, so they make the ring electron-rich in those positions.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's a benzoyloxy group attached to ethyl. Wait, waitâ€”no, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So that's a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl, which is attached to an O and then an ethyl. So that's a benzoyloxyethyl group. Wait, perhaps it's more accurately called a COOEt group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, the structure is benzene attached to (COOEt), so that's a benzoyloxy group. Wait, no, wait: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 is benzyl acetate? No, wait, the structure is: benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (CO), which is connected to an O, which is connected to ethyl (C2H5). So it's benzene ring- COOEt. So that's an ester group, specifically a phenyl acetate? Or perhaps it's like a benzene with an ester substituent.

But regardless, the substituent is an ester group. Esters are deactivating because they are electron-withdrawing. Because the carbonyl is an electron-withdrawing group. But wait, wait. Esters are meta directors because they are deactivating and have a -I effect. So the incoming electrophile will tend to attack the meta position relative to the ester group.

3) C6H5-Cl: That's a chlorobenzene. Chlorine is an interesting substituent. It's a deactivating group because it's more electronegative, so it withdraws electrons through induction (-I), but it also has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, making it ortho/para directing. So chloro is a meta director? Wait no, wait. Chlorine is a strong deactivating group (due to -I) but is ortho/para directing because of resonance. So it's a meta director only if the substituent is strongly deactivating and can't donate electrons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for example, nitro groups are strong deactivating (through -I and -M) and are meta directors. But for Cl, the -I effect is stronger than the +M, so overall it's deactivating. However, because Cl can donate electron through resonance (the lone pairs), it's ortho/para directing. So the incoming electrophile adds to ortho or para positions.

4) C6H5-NO2: That's nitrobenzene. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta directing group. Because the nitro group is highly electron-withdrawing (-I and -M), so the ring is deactivated, and the incoming electrophile adds to the meta position relative to the nitro group.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The substituent is an ethyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para directing group. Since it's an alkyl group, it donates electrons through +I, making the ring more reactive, and directs the electrophile to ortho and para positions.

6) C6H5-COOH: That's benzoic acid. The substituent is a carboxylic acid group. Carboxylic acid is a strongly deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing effect (both -I and -M). It's meta directing. So the electrophile will add to the meta position.

So now, each substituent directs to specific positions. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. Wait, but wait. The weight fraction is the proportion of the para product in the mixture formed. But the problem says that the reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, the reaction is with excess bromine, but each substituent is such that only one product is formed. No, that's not possible because adding bromine in electrophilic substitution typically leads to a mixture, unless the substituent is such that it strongly directs the electrophile to a single position.

Wait, but the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed, meaning that in each case, the substituent directs the bromine to only one possible position. That would be if the substituent is such that the only possible position is para, or only ortho, etc. But which substituents do that?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For example, in a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group, perhaps the substitution occurs only at the meta position. But wait, in reality, even nitro groups (meta directors) can have some ortho and para products, but the meta is dominant. But the question seems to suggest that only one position is possible, so perhaps the substituent is such that the only possible position is para, making the para-isomer 100% of the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in a position where only the para position is available. For example, if the substituent is in a position that makes the para position the only possible position due to steric hindrance or something else.

Wait, perhaps this is about steric hindrance. For example, if the substituent is bulky, then the ortho positions are more hindered, making the para the major product. But that's not about substituent directing effects, but about steric factors.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem states that each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each reaction gives a single product, which must be the para isomer in some cases?

Wait, no. Let me see. The substituent's directing effects determine where the substitution occurs. So for a substituent that is ortho/para directing, the bromine could add to either ortho or para positions, leading to a mixture. But the problem says only one monobromo product is formed. Oh, wait, but that can't be unless the substituent only allows substitution in one position. For example, in a meta director, the substitution occurs only at meta, so only one product. But wait, for a para substituent, perhaps substitution occurs at ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that the para position is the only available. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the substituent's effect on the reactivity and directing.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is such that it has only one possible position for substitution. For example, if the substituent is in a position where the para position is the only possible due to the structure. Like if the substituent is a substituent that is meta to another group, but that would require a di-substituted benzene, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the para position is the only position where substitution is possible. For example, if the substituent is in a position that makes the ortho and meta positions unavailable, perhaps due to steric hindrance.

Wait, but in this problem, all the substituents are mono-substituted benzene rings. So each substituent is on the benzene ring, and the substituent's direction determines where the next substituent (Br) adds.

So, for each substituent, the Br will add in ortho, meta, or para positions relative to the substituent. But the problem says that each gives only one monobromo product. That's confusing because, for example, with a methyl group (ortho/para directing), the bromine could add in ortho or para positions, leading to two possible products. Unless the substituent is such that only one position is possible.

Wait, but the question says that each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. So perhaps in each case, all the substitution occurs at a single position, so the para-isomer is either 0% or 100%, but that's unlikely because substituents like methyl are ortho/para directors, leading to multiple products.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, the Br can add in ortho, meta, or para positions, and the para fraction is the amount of the para product relative to all possible products. But the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed, which can't be the case. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, maybe the substituent's nature determines whether the para product is the major or minor product. So the weight fraction is the relative amount of para isomer in the mixture. The question is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of para-isomer.

So for each substituent, we need to determine what fraction of the products are para. The substituent directs the electrophile to certain positions, so the regioselectivity determines the ratio of ortho, meta, and para products.

So, for example:

Substituent 1: methyl group. It's activating and ortho/para directing. So the Br will add to ortho or para positions. So the para isomer could be, say, 50% if the ratio is equal, but I think in reality, para is more favored than ortho for some substituents. Wait, I'm not certain. I think for methyl, the para isomer is more dominant than ortho, but I might be wrong.

Substituent 2: ester group (COOEt). It's deactivating and meta directing. So the Br adds to meta position. So in this case, the para fraction is zero? Or perhaps a negligible amount, so the para weight fraction is very low.

Substituent 3: Cl. It's ortho/para directing but deactivating. So Br adds to ortho or para. The para fraction would be higher than for methyl, perhaps. Because Cl is deactivating, maybe para is more favored than ortho.

Substituent 4: NO2. It's meta directing. So Br adds to meta. So para fraction is zero.

Substituent 5: ethyl group. Similar to methyl, activating, ortho/para. So Br can go to ortho or para. Para fraction would be significant.

Substituent 6: COOH. It's deactivating, meta directing. So Br adds to meta. So para fraction is zero.

Wait, but in the case of substituent 2 (ester), the Br adds to meta. So para fraction is zero. Similarly for substituent 4 and 6.

Wait, but some substituents may lead to a mix, but some may lead to more para product. Let's think again.

For substituent 1, methyl:

In electrophilic substitution, the methyl group is activating, so the ring is more reactive. The incoming Br will add to ortho, para, and perhaps meta, but more so ortho and para. The para isomer is usually the major product in such cases. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact distribution. I think the para isomer is the major one for methyl, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty here. Let me think about the typical substitution patterns.

For substituents which are activating and ortho/para directors:

- The major product is para, with some ortho and a little meta. So for methyl, the para isomer is the major product.

For substituents which are deactivating and meta directors:

- The Br adds to the meta position, so meta isomer is major, and para is either minor or not formed at all. So for substituents 2,4,6, the para fraction is low.

Wait, substituent 3 is Cl, which is ortho/para directing but deactivating. So Br adds to ortho and para. The para product could be the major one, but I'm not sure.

So now, for each substituent, the para fraction is as follows:

1) CH3: para is major, perhaps 60-70%?

2) COOEt: para is 0% (since meta is the main product)

3) Cl: para is major (say, 50-60%)

4) NO2: para is 0% (all meta)

5) C2H5: same as CH3, para is major (say, 60-70%)

6) COOH: para is 0% (all meta)

Wait, but I'm not confident about substituent 3 (Cl) and 5 (C2H5) giving the same para fraction. Maybe the substituent's electron donating ability affects the para fraction. For example, stronger activating groups (like -NH2) would lead to more para product, while weaker activating groups (like -OCH3) might have more para but perhaps a higher ratio between para and ortho.

But in this problem, the substituents are: 1) CH3 (activating, ortho/para), 5) C2H5 (same as CH3), 3) Cl (deactivating but ortho/para), 2,4,6 (meta directors).

Wait, for substituent 3, Cl is a deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive, but it's ortho/para directing. So the Br would add to ortho and para. But since the group is deactivating, perhaps the para isomer is more favored than the ortho, but not as much as in activating groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but maybe I can think of the order of para fraction from low to high.

Looking at substituents:

- Substituents 2,4,6: para fraction is 0% (since they are meta directors).

Wait, no, no. Wait, substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors. So the Br adds to meta. Therefore, the para product would be minimal or zero, so the para weight fraction is very low. So these substituents have the lowest para fractions.

Substituent 3: Cl is ortho/para director. So the para product would be present, but perhaps not the majority. Or maybe it's the majority.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) leads to more para product than substituents 1 and 5. Because Cl is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive, but being ortho/para directing, the para would be a major product. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The more activating the group, the more the para product dominates. So substituents 1 and 5 (activating, ortho/para) would have higher para fractions compared to substituent 3 (Cl), which is deactivating but ortho/para directing.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because Cl is less activating than methyl groups. So perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a lower para fraction than substituents 1 and 5.

So, putting this together:

Substituent | Para Fraction
1 (CH3) | High (say, 70%)
2 (COOEt) | 0%
3 (Cl) | Moderate (say, 30%)
4 (NO2) | 0%
5 (C2H5) | High (70%)
6 (COOH) | 0%

Wait, but substituent 3 has a moderate para fraction, but substituents 2,4,6 have zero. So the order of increasing para fraction would be:

Substituent 2,4,6 (0%) < substituent 3 (30%) < substituent 1 and 5 (70%).

Wait, but substituent 3 is Cl, which is ortho/para directing but deactivating. So perhaps the para fraction is higher than in methyl and ethyl groups? No, that doesn't make sense because Cl is deactivating. The activating groups would have higher para fractions.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the substituents in terms of their activating/deactivating nature and their directing effects.

Let me list the substituents with their effect:

1) CH3: activating, ortho/para directing. So Br adds to ortho and para. The para will be the major product. Let's say para fraction is high, maybe around 50-70%.

2) COOEt: deactivating, meta directing. So Br adds to meta. So para fraction is 0.

3) Cl: deactivating, ortho/para directing. So Br adds to ortho and para. But since Cl is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but the para product could be significant. However, the para fraction may be lower than in activating groups. Maybe around 30-40%.

4) NO2: deactivating, meta directing. Para fraction is 0.

5) C2H5: same as CH3. Activating, ortho/para. Para fraction high.

6) COOH: deactivating, meta directing. Para fraction 0.

So the para fractions would be:

Substituent 2,4,6: 0%
Substituent 3: 30-40%
Substituent 1 and 5: 70%

So the order of increasing para fraction would be: 2<4<6<3<1<5. Wait, no, because substituents 2,4,6 all have 0% para. So their order among themselves would be the same. Then comes substituent 3, then 1 and 5.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A) 4 < 2 <6 <3 <1 <5
But 4,2,6 all have 0, but in the options, they might have the same para fraction.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5
B)6<2<4<5<1<3
C)4<6<2<1<5<3
D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, but substituents 2,4,6 all have 0% para. So in the order, they come first, followed by substituent 3, then substituents 1 and 5.

But in the options, all of them have substituents 2,4,6 in different orders. Since their para fractions are the same, their order in the list shouldn't matter.

Wait, but perhaps the actual para fraction depends on other factors. For example, substituents with strong activating groups would have higher para fractions.

Wait, perhaps substituent 5 (C2H5) is a stronger activator than substituent 1 (CH3), but I'm not sure. Alkyl groups are all activating, with weaker groups having less effect. But methyl and ethyl are both activating, so their para fractions would be similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's size affects the para fraction. For example, a larger substituent like ethyl (5) might lead to more para substitution due to steric hindrance in the ortho positions. So substituent 5 might have a higher para fraction than substituent 1.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the order between substituent 1 and 5 doesn't matter much. But let me proceed.

So, the order of increasing para fraction would be:

Substituents with 0% (2,4,6) < substituent 3 < substituents 1 and 5.

But in the options, the substituents 2,4,6 are in varying orders.

Option A says 4<2<6<3<1<5. So 4, 2,6 are the first three, then 3, then 1, then 5.

But substituents 2,4,6 all have 0% para, so their order shouldn't affect the overall increasing order. So the actual order would be 2,4,6 < 3 <1,5.

But looking at the options, let's see which one fits this structure.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ 4 is first, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then5.

But substituents 4,2,6 are all 0%, so in the overall order, all three are first. So in terms of increasing, they are all the same. But the question is about the order of increasing weight fraction, so the actual order between 2,4,6 may not matter. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps substituents 2,4,6 might have a minor para fraction due to some other effects. For example, in some cases, even meta directors can have a small para fraction. But I think in the case of strong meta directors, the para fraction is negligible.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating, ortho/para director. So the para product is a major product, but not as much as in activating groups.

So the order of increasing para fraction is:

Substituents 2,4,6 (0%) < substituent 3 (say, 30%) < substituents 1 and 5 (70%).

But looking at the options, let's see which option starts with 2,4,6 in order, but that's not clear.

Option A starts with 4<2<6<3<1<5. So 4 is first. But 4 is a nitro group, which should have 0% para.

Wait, but perhaps substituent 5 (C2H5) is a bigger group than substituent 1 (CH3), so substituent 5 might have a higher para fraction because it's more bulky, leading to more para substitution (due to steric hindrance in ortho positions). So substituent 5 would have a higher para fraction than substituent 1.

Wait, that's possible. So substituent 5 has higher para fraction than substituent 1.

So the order would be substituents 2,4,6 (0%) < substituent 3 (30%) < substituent 1 (50%) < substituent5 (60%).

So the order is 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But the options don't exactly have this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, that can't be right.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 â†’ 4 (0%) <2 (0%) <6 (0%) <3 (30%) <1 (50%) <5 (60%).

So in this order, substituent 5 comes after 1, which aligns with substituent 5 having a higher para fraction.

So the order in option A is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

So the weight fractions go from 0 (4,2,6) â†’ 30 (3) â†’50 (1) â†’60 (5).

Which would arrange the substituents in the order A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

But wait, substituent 6 is COOH, which is a strong deactivating group, so para fraction is 0. So in the order, 4, 2,6 are all same.

But in option A, substituent 4 is first, then 2, then 6, etc.

So the order as per option A would correctly arrange substituent 3 next, then 1, then 5.

So I think option A is the correct one.

Wait, but let me check other options.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 â†’ No, because substituent5 is a high para.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 â†’ No, because substituent3 comes after 5.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 â†’ No, because substituent3 is not last.

So the correct order is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can be activating or deactivating and ortho/para or meta directing, which influences where the bromine atom adds.

### Analysis of Substituents:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)**:  
   - Activating, ortho/para directing.  
   - The para-isomer is the major product due to the activating nature of the methyl group.  

2. **C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (Ester group)**:  
   - Deactivating, meta directing.  
   - The bromine adds primarily to the meta position, resulting in a negligible para-isomer fraction.  

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**:  
   - Deactivating, ortho/para directing.  
   - The para-isomer is present but not dominant due to the deactivating nature of chlorine.  

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)**:  
   - Strongly deactivating, meta directing.  
   - The para-isomer fraction is negligible as the bromine adds primarily to the meta position.  

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)**:  
   - Activating, ortho/para directing.  
   - Similar to the methyl group, the para-isomer is the major product.  

6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)**:  
   - Strongly deactivating, meta directing.  
   - The para-isomer fraction is negligible as the bromine adds primarily to the meta position.  

### Order of Increasing Para-Isomer Fraction:
- Substituents 2, 4, and 6 (ester, nitro, carboxylic acid) have negligible para-isomer fractions (0%).  
- Substituent 3 (chlorine) has a moderate para-isomer fraction (~30%).  
- Substituents 1 and 5 (methyl and ethyl groups) have the highest para-isomer fractions (~70%).  

Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer fraction is:  
**2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Correct Option:
**A) 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

Answer: A
