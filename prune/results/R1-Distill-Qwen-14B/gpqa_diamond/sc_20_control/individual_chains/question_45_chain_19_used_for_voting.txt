Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are A to D, each with different multiples of E. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for each particle's energy is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh wait, wait, the question gives E as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n would be n² times E. That makes it easier.

Now, each particle is spin-1/2, like electrons. So they have spin up or down. But wait, the particles are identical, so are they fermions? Yes, because electrons have spin-1/2 and fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So that means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state, right? So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin.

In a one-dimensional well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Since it's 1D, spin is the only other degree of freedom. So for each n, you can have two possible spins: up and down. So each n can accommodate two particles, one for each spin state.

But wait, the problem states that there are four particles. So let's think about how they fill up the energy levels.

Ground state: The lowest energy state. The lowest n is 1. Since each n can hold two particles, n=1 can hold two. Then n=2 can hold two more. So with four particles, n=1 and n=2 are filled.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Each n can hold two particles because of spin up and down. So, for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2. So in the ground state, all four are filled in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, no, because the ground state is the lowest possible energy. So the first two (with n=1, spin up and down) are filled, then the next two go into n=2. So the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Each particle in n=1 has energy E (since E_n = n² E, so n=1 is E). So two particles at n=1 contribute 2E. Then two particles at n=2 contribute 2*(4E) = 8E. So the total energy for the ground state is 2E +8E = 10E.

Wait, but wait, wait. The question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. Oh, I'm getting confused. Oh wait, the system's total energy. So the ground state is when all four are filled with the lowest possible energies.

But wait, for four particles, with spin 1/2, each n can take two. So the first four particles would fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the system's ground state energy is 2E (from n=1) + 8E (from n=2) = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Then what about the first excited state? The first excited state would be when the next available state is filled. Wait, the ground state is the lowest possible, so the first excited state would have one of the particles promoted to the next available energy level.

Wait, but how do the particles get excited? Let me think. The ground state is the most particles in the lowest energy states. When you excite a particle, you promote it to a higher energy state.

So, for the first excited state, perhaps one particle from n=2 moves up. But wait, n=2 can hold two particles. To reach the first excited state, maybe one of them moves to n=3.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the order. The ground state has n=1 with two particles, n=2 with two particles. The next available state is n=3. So in the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. But since each n can hold two, maybe we can have more than one particle in higher n's.

Wait, but the energy levels are filled in order. So the ground state has all four in the two lowest levels. The next possible state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So that would be the first excited state. Let's see, that would change the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged with three in n=2 and one in n=3. Wait, no, because each n can have two particles, so n=2 is filled with two, n=3 can take two, but we have only four particles. So in the first excited state, perhaps one particle from n=2 is moved to n=3, but wait, n=3 can take two, but we have only four particles. So let me think again.

Let me list the possible arrangements.

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy: 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: The next possible arrangement. Which one? Well, maybe one particle from n=2 moves up to n=3. So now we have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). That would require that two particles are in n=2, but one moves to n=3. But wait, each n can take two, so perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3, leaving n=2 with one, and n=3 with one. So the total number of particles is 2 (n=1) +1 (n=2) +1 (n=3) =4.

The energy would then be 2E (n=1) + (n=2 contributes 4E for 1 particle) + (n=3 contributes 9E for 1 particle). So total is 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

Wait, but wait. How about if two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That would give 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, the first excited state is the lowest energy state higher than the ground state. So the ground state is 10E. The first excited state would have the next higher energy, which is perhaps 15E. Then the second excited state would be the next higher.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the first excited state is when the particles are in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1), which gives 15E as the total. Then the second excited state could be when two particles are in n=3 and zero in n=2. Wait, no, wait, the four particles could be arranged as two in n=1, two in n=2, which is the ground state. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that requires having n=2 at (1), n=3 at (1).

Wait, but another approach: the order of the energy levels is based on the sum of the individual energies. So for four particles, the possible states are:

Ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → sum E = 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E.

First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Sum: 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum: 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E. But wait, none of the options have 20E. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making the sum 15E, and the second excited state is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but wait, that's not possible because we have only two particles in n=2 initially. So after one moves, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1. The next move would have n=3 at 2, n=2 at 0, but that would require that both n=2 particles move up. So the second excited state would then have 2 in n=3: sum is 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 2*9E= 20E. But looking at the options, option C says the second excited state is 15E, which doesn't fit. Or perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the order of the states. Let me think about the possible total energies and their order.

Another possibility is that the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another is promoted from n=1 to n=3. That might not be the case, though, because promoting from lower to higher energy would increase the total energy more.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, leaving n=2 with 1 and n=3 with 1. Then the total energy is 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) = 15E. That's the first excited state.

Then the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So n=2 would have 0, n=3 has 2. So the sum is 2E*1 + 0 + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option B is 4E, 10E, 50E. C is 4E,10E, 15E. D is 10,15,18. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the states wrong. Maybe the ground state isn't 10E. Let me think again.

Wait, each particle's energy is E times n squared. For four spin-1/2 particles, each can occupy a unique state (n, spin). So the first two particles fill n=1 with spin up and down. The next two must go to n=2 with spin up and down. So the ground state has four particles: two in n=1 and two in n=2. The total energy is 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E. So that's the ground state.

Now, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to the next available energy level. The next available n is 3. So which particle is promoted? Let's say one from n=2 moves to n=3. So now we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energies sum to 2*1E +1*4E +1*9E = 2 +4 +9 =15E.

Then the second excited state would be the next possible arrangement. That could be another promotion, say, the second particle in n=2 moves to n=3, leaving n=2 with 0 and n=3 with 2. The sum is 2*1E +0 + 2*(9E) =2 +18=20E.

But wait, the options don't have 20E. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when a particle in n=1 is promoted to n=2. But wait, no, because in the ground state, n=2 is already filled. So that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state isn't about individual particles but about the total system, and the arrangement of the particles' energy levels.

Wait, maybe I should consider the multiparticle states and find the order of their energies. The ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible states. The first excited state is the next lowest energy where one particle is promoted.

Wait, perhaps another way to arrange the particles could result in a lower energy than 15E. For example, if two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That gives 2E +4E +9E =15E. But is that the first excited state? Or is there a state with lower energy?

Wait, maybe I'm missing a possible state. Let me think: The total number of particles is four. So the possible distributions of n's are:

1. 2,2,0,0,... → ground state: sum 10E.

2. 2,1,1,0,.. → sum 2E +4E +9E =15E.

3. 2,0,2,0,... → sum 2E + 2*(9E) =20E.

4. 1,1,1,1 → but each n can have only two particles. So wait, no. Because each n can take two particles due to spin. So n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two, but if all four are in n=1 and n=2, but perhaps another way. Hmm, no, I think the possible states are as I listed.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, and the second excited is 20E.

Looking at the options, option C is 4E,10E,15E. That can't be right because the ground state is 10E, but option C lists the ground state as 4E. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, maybe the particles are spin-1/2, and the well is one-dimensional. But perhaps each particle's state is determined by their quantum numbers, which include n and spin. But when considering the system's energy, it's the sum of individual energies, regardless of spin, because spin doesn't affect the energy in the infinite potential well scenario. So spin only affects the possible occupation of the same n.

Wait, but in the calculation of the system's energy, spin doesn't contribute energy, so each particle contributes based on their n. So the spin just determines how many can be in each n. So four particles would have two in n=1 (each with opposite spin) and two in n=2.

So the ground state energy is 2E +8E =10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, leading to 2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2+4+9=15E.

The second excited state would be when another n=2 particle moves to n=3, so now we have two in n=3. So energy is 2E +0 +2*(9E)=2 + 18=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 20E. So perhaps the order is different.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state isn't 15E. Maybe I'm considering the energy incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state has the configuration 1,1,1,1 for the n's, but that's impossible because each n can have two particles. So n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two, etc. So the particles can't all be in n=1; that's only two.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the first excited state. Let me think again.

After the ground state, what's the next possible arrangement? It's when one particle is promoted to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. The energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 =2+4+9=15E.

Then the next state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, leading to two in n=3 and zero in n=2. The energy is 2*1 +0 +2*9= 2+18=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing another possible state. Wait, maybe the next state after 15E is when a particle from n=1 is promoted to n=3, but that would lead to a higher total energy.

Wait, let me compute that. If we have one particle in n=1 is promoted to n=3, then the configuration would be 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. The energy is 1*1 +2*4 +1*9 =1+8+9=18E. That's higher than 15E, so that would be a higher energy state than 15E. So that would come after 15E.

Wait, so the possible energies in order would be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state:18E.

Because 18E is less than 20E, that would be the next state.

Wait, but why is 18E possible? Let me think again. If one particle from n=1 is promoted to n=3, then the configuration becomes 1 (n=1) + 2 (n=2) + 1 (n=3). So total energy is 1*1 +2*4 +1*9=1+8+9=18E.

So in this scenario, the first excited state would be 15E, the second would be 18E.

Wait, but according to this, the energies in order are 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). Looking at the options, option D is 10E, 15E,18E. So that would fit.

But earlier I thought the second excited state would be 20E, but that's if we promote both n=2 particles to n=3, but perhaps promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives a lower energy (18E) than promoting another n=2 to n=3 (15E to 20E). So 18E comes before 20E.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the possible states and their energies are:

- 2,2: sum 2*1 +2*4=2+8=10E (ground state).

- 2,1,1: sum 2+4+9=15E (first excited).

- 1,2,1: sum 1+8+9=18E (second excited).

- 2,0,2: sum 2 +0 +18=20E (third excited? Or is it higher?).

So if the question is about the ground state, first, and second excited states, the energies would be 10E, 15E, 18E. Which matches option D.

Looking at the options:

D) 10E,15E,18E.

Yes, that's the correct sequence.

So the correct answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Energy Levels in the Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy of a single particle in the well is given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Each quantum level \( n \) can accommodate two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

2. **Ground State**:  
   In the ground state, the lowest energy configuration is achieved by filling the two lowest energy levels. Two particles occupy \( n=1 \) (with energies \( E_1 = E \)) and the other two occupy \( n=2 \) (with energies \( E_2 = 4E \)). The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1E) + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

3. **First Excited State**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle from \( n=2 \) is promoted to \( n=3 \) (with energy \( E_3 = 9E \)). The configuration becomes: two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2(1E) + 1(4E) + 1(9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

4. **Second Excited State**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted. This can occur by promoting the remaining particle in \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), resulting in two particles in \( n=3 \) and none in \( n=2 \). The configuration is: two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
   \]  
   However, an alternative configuration arises when one particle from \( n=1 \) is promoted to \( n=3 \), resulting in one particle in \( n=1 \), two particles in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy for this configuration is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1(1E) + 2(4E) + 1(9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
   \]  
   Since \( 18E < 20E \), the second excited state corresponds to \( 18E \).

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( 30E, 39E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as these values are much higher than the calculated energies.  
   - **Option B**: \( 4E, 10E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as the ground state is \( 10E \), not \( 4E \).  
   - **Option C**: \( 4E, 10E, 15E \) — Incorrect, as the second excited state is \( 18E \), not \( 15E \).  
   - **Option D**: \( 10E, 15E, 18E \) — Correct, as it matches the calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are A to D, each with different multiples of E. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for each particle's energy is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh wait, wait, the question gives E as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n would be n² times E. That makes it easier.

Now, each particle is spin-1/2, like electrons. So they have spin up or down. But wait, the particles are identical, so are they fermions? Yes, because electrons have spin-1/2 and fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So that means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state, right? So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin.

In a one-dimensional well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Since it's 1D, spin is the only other degree of freedom. So for each n, you can have two possible spins: up and down. So each n can accommodate two particles, one for each spin state.

But wait, the problem states that there are four particles. So let's think about how they fill up the energy levels.

Ground state: The lowest energy state. The lowest n is 1. Since each n can hold two particles, n=1 can hold two. Then n=2 can hold two more. So with four particles, n=1 and n=2 are filled.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Each n can hold two particles because of spin up and down. So, for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2. So in the ground state, all four are filled in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, no, because the ground state is the lowest possible energy. So the first two (with n=1, spin up and down) are filled, then the next two go into n=2. So the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Each particle in n=1 has energy E (since E_n = n² E, so n=1 is E). So two particles at n=1 contribute 2E. Then two particles at n=2 contribute 2*(4E) = 8E. So the total energy for the ground state is 2E +8E = 10E.

Wait, but wait, wait. The question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. Oh, I'm getting confused. Oh wait, the system's total energy. So the ground state is when all four are filled with the lowest possible energies.

But wait, for four particles, with spin 1/2, each n can take two. So the first four particles would fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the system's ground state energy is 2E (from n=1) + 8E (from n=2) = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Then what about the first excited state? The first excited state would be when the next available state is filled. Wait, the ground state is the lowest possible, so the first excited state would have one of the particles promoted to the next available energy level.

Wait, but how do the particles get excited? Let me think. The ground state is the most particles in the lowest energy states. When you excite a particle, you promote it to a higher energy state.

So, for the first excited state, perhaps one particle from n=2 moves up. But wait, n=2 can hold two particles. To reach the first excited state, maybe one of them moves to n=3.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the order. The ground state has n=1 with two particles, n=2 with two particles. The next available state is n=3. So in the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. But since each n can hold two, maybe we can have more than one particle in higher n's.

Wait, but the energy levels are filled in order. So the ground state has all four in the two lowest levels. The next possible state would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So that would be the first excited state. Let's see, that would change the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are arranged with three in n=2 and one in n=3. Wait, no, because each n can have two particles, so n=2 is filled with two, n=3 can take two, but we have only four particles. So in the first excited state, perhaps one particle from n=2 is moved to n=3, but wait, n=3 can take two, but we have only four particles. So let me think again.

Let me list the possible arrangements.

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy: 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: The next possible arrangement. Which one? Well, maybe one particle from n=2 moves up to n=3. So now we have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). That would require that two particles are in n=2, but one moves to n=3. But wait, each n can take two, so perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3, leaving n=2 with one, and n=3 with one. So the total number of particles is 2 (n=1) +1 (n=2) +1 (n=3) =4.

The energy would then be 2E (n=1) + (n=2 contributes 4E for 1 particle) + (n=3 contributes 9E for 1 particle). So total is 2E +4E +9E = 15E.

Wait, but wait. How about if two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That would give 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, the first excited state is the lowest energy state higher than the ground state. So the ground state is 10E. The first excited state would have the next higher energy, which is perhaps 15E. Then the second excited state would be the next higher.

Wait, but another possibility: maybe the first excited state is when the particles are in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1), which gives 15E as the total. Then the second excited state could be when two particles are in n=3 and zero in n=2. Wait, no, wait, the four particles could be arranged as two in n=1, two in n=2, which is the ground state. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that requires having n=2 at (1), n=3 at (1).

Wait, but another approach: the order of the energy levels is based on the sum of the individual energies. So for four particles, the possible states are:

Ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2 → sum E = 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E.

First excited state: 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Sum: 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. Sum: 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E. But wait, none of the options have 20E. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, making the sum 15E, and the second excited state is when another particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but wait, that's not possible because we have only two particles in n=2 initially. So after one moves, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1. The next move would have n=3 at 2, n=2 at 0, but that would require that both n=2 particles move up. So the second excited state would then have 2 in n=3: sum is 2E (n=1) + 0 (n=2) + 2*9E= 20E. But looking at the options, option C says the second excited state is 15E, which doesn't fit. Or perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the order of the states. Let me think about the possible total energies and their order.

Another possibility is that the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, and another is promoted from n=1 to n=3. That might not be the case, though, because promoting from lower to higher energy would increase the total energy more.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, leaving n=2 with 1 and n=3 with 1. Then the total energy is 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) = 15E. That's the first excited state.

Then the second excited state could be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So n=2 would have 0, n=3 has 2. So the sum is 2E*1 + 0 + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking at the options, option B is 4E, 10E, 50E. C is 4E,10E, 15E. D is 10,15,18. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the states wrong. Maybe the ground state isn't 10E. Let me think again.

Wait, each particle's energy is E times n squared. For four spin-1/2 particles, each can occupy a unique state (n, spin). So the first two particles fill n=1 with spin up and down. The next two must go to n=2 with spin up and down. So the ground state has four particles: two in n=1 and two in n=2. The total energy is 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E. So that's the ground state.

Now, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to the next available energy level. The next available n is 3. So which particle is promoted? Let's say one from n=2 moves to n=3. So now we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The energies sum to 2*1E +1*4E +1*9E = 2 +4 +9 =15E.

Then the second excited state would be the next possible arrangement. That could be another promotion, say, the second particle in n=2 moves to n=3, leaving n=2 with 0 and n=3 with 2. The sum is 2*1E +0 + 2*(9E) =2 +18=20E.

But wait, the options don't have 20E. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when a particle in n=1 is promoted to n=2. But wait, no, because in the ground state, n=2 is already filled. So that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state isn't about individual particles but about the total system, and the arrangement of the particles' energy levels.

Wait, maybe I should consider the multiparticle states and find the order of their energies. The ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible states. The first excited state is the next lowest energy where one particle is promoted.

Wait, perhaps another way to arrange the particles could result in a lower energy than 15E. For example, if two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That gives 2E +4E +9E =15E. But is that the first excited state? Or is there a state with lower energy?

Wait, maybe I'm missing a possible state. Let me think: The total number of particles is four. So the possible distributions of n's are:

1. 2,2,0,0,... → ground state: sum 10E.

2. 2,1,1,0,.. → sum 2E +4E +9E =15E.

3. 2,0,2,0,... → sum 2E + 2*(9E) =20E.

4. 1,1,1,1 → but each n can have only two particles. So wait, no. Because each n can take two particles due to spin. So n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two, but if all four are in n=1 and n=2, but perhaps another way. Hmm, no, I think the possible states are as I listed.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, and the second excited is 20E.

Looking at the options, option C is 4E,10E,15E. That can't be right because the ground state is 10E, but option C lists the ground state as 4E. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, maybe the particles are spin-1/2, and the well is one-dimensional. But perhaps each particle's state is determined by their quantum numbers, which include n and spin. But when considering the system's energy, it's the sum of individual energies, regardless of spin, because spin doesn't affect the energy in the infinite potential well scenario. So spin only affects the possible occupation of the same n.

Wait, but in the calculation of the system's energy, spin doesn't contribute energy, so each particle contributes based on their n. So the spin just determines how many can be in each n. So four particles would have two in n=1 (each with opposite spin) and two in n=2.

So the ground state energy is 2E +8E =10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, leading to 2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2+4+9=15E.

The second excited state would be when another n=2 particle moves to n=3, so now we have two in n=3. So energy is 2E +0 +2*(9E)=2 + 18=20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 20E. So perhaps the order is different.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state isn't 15E. Maybe I'm considering the energy incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state has the configuration 1,1,1,1 for the n's, but that's impossible because each n can have two particles. So n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two, etc. So the particles can't all be in n=1; that's only two.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the first excited state. Let me think again.

After the ground state, what's the next possible arrangement? It's when one particle is promoted to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. The energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 =2+4+9=15E.

Then the next state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, leading to two in n=3 and zero in n=2. The energy is 2*1 +0 +2*9= 2+18=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing another possible state. Wait, maybe the next state after 15E is when a particle from n=1 is promoted to n=3, but that would lead to a higher total energy.

Wait, let me compute that. If we have one particle in n=1 is promoted to n=3, then the configuration would be 1 in n=1, 2 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. The energy is 1*1 +2*4 +1*9 =1+8+9=18E. That's higher than 15E, so that would be a higher energy state than 15E. So that would come after 15E.

Wait, so the possible energies in order would be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state:18E.

Because 18E is less than 20E, that would be the next state.

Wait, but why is 18E possible? Let me think again. If one particle from n=1 is promoted to n=3, then the configuration becomes 1 (n=1) + 2 (n=2) + 1 (n=3). So total energy is 1*1 +2*4 +1*9=1+8+9=18E.

So in this scenario, the first excited state would be 15E, the second would be 18E.

Wait, but according to this, the energies in order are 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). Looking at the options, option D is 10E, 15E,18E. So that would fit.

But earlier I thought the second excited state would be 20E, but that's if we promote both n=2 particles to n=3, but perhaps promoting a particle from n=1 to n=3 gives a lower energy (18E) than promoting another n=2 to n=3 (15E to 20E). So 18E comes before 20E.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the possible states and their energies are:

- 2,2: sum 2*1 +2*4=2+8=10E (ground state).

- 2,1,1: sum 2+4+9=15E (first excited).

- 1,2,1: sum 1+8+9=18E (second excited).

- 2,0,2: sum 2 +0 +18=20E (third excited? Or is it higher?).

So if the question is about the ground state, first, and second excited states, the energies would be 10E, 15E, 18E. Which matches option D.

Looking at the options:

D) 10E,15E,18E.

Yes, that's the correct sequence.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Energy Levels in the Infinite Potential Well**:  
   The energy of a single particle in the well is given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). Each quantum level \( n \) can accommodate two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (one spin-up and one spin-down).

2. **Ground State**:  
   In the ground state, the lowest energy configuration is achieved by filling the two lowest energy levels. Two particles occupy \( n=1 \) (with energies \( E_1 = E \)) and the other two occupy \( n=2 \) (with energies \( E_2 = 4E \)). The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1E) + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

3. **First Excited State**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle from \( n=2 \) is promoted to \( n=3 \) (with energy \( E_3 = 9E \)). The configuration becomes: two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2(1E) + 1(4E) + 1(9E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

4. **Second Excited State**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted. This can occur by promoting the remaining particle in \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \), resulting in two particles in \( n=3 \) and none in \( n=2 \). The configuration is: two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1E) + 2(9E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
   \]  
   However, an alternative configuration arises when one particle from \( n=1 \) is promoted to \( n=3 \), resulting in one particle in \( n=1 \), two particles in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy for this configuration is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1(1E) + 2(4E) + 1(9E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
   \]  
   Since \( 18E < 20E \), the second excited state corresponds to \( 18E \).

5. **Comparison with Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( 30E, 39E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as these values are much higher than the calculated energies.  
   - **Option B**: \( 4E, 10E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as the ground state is \( 10E \), not \( 4E \).  
   - **Option C**: \( 4E, 10E, 15E \) — Incorrect, as the second excited state is \( 18E \), not \( 15E \).  
   - **Option D**: \( 10E, 15E, 18E \) — Correct, as it matches the calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.
