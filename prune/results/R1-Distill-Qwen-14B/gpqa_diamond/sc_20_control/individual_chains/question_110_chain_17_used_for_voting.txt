Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember from my studies that these spectrographs have different magnitude limits, which determine which stars they can observe.

Let me break down the details. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So that means any star with a V magnitude less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if the limit is brighter than 17, that means the V magnitude must be less than or equal to 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V <=17 mag.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So for HIRES, the V magnitude must be <=16 mag. Because 16 is brighter than 17, so HIRES can't see fainter stars than 16.

So a star that both can detect must have V mag <=16 mag. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So the star must be <=16 for both to detect it.

Now I'll look at each star's details.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5. Distance is 10 pc. So I need to calculate its apparent V magnitude. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs.

So m = 15.5 + 5 log(10/10) = 15.5 + 5*0 = 15.5. So Star1's V is 15.5, which is less than 16. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it, since HIRES can do up to 16, and Star1 is 15.5 which is within both's capabilities.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5. Hmm, so that's 16.5. HIRES can go up to 16, so Star2's magnitude is 16.5 which is fainter than 16. So HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can because 16.5 <=17. So Star2 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5, but wait, no. Wait, Star3's apparent V is 15.5, but wait, noâ€”no, wait a minute. Let's read again. Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, but wait, no, the question says the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but I also need to consider extinction. Because it has E(B-V) = 0.6 mag. So there's interstellar extinction, right? The V band is affected by extinction. The formula is that the observed apparent magnitude m is the intrinsic magnitude plus extinction. Oh wait, the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, no, more accurately, the extinction A_V is calculated from E(B-V). The problem states that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess with a coefficient of 3.1. So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, E(B-V)=0.6, so A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait, but wait, the star's apparent magnitude given is already the observed one, or is it the intrinsic? Hmm, the problem says: Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, but wait, that's the observed (i.e., after extinction) value? Or is it the intrinsic, and we have to add extinction?

Wait, the problem says: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag. But wait, the star's actual apparent magnitude would be higher because of extinction. Wait, no, because extinction makes stars appear fainter, so m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V. Wait, when we have extinction, the observed magnitude is larger (since the star is dimmer). So if the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude is m, then the observed is m + A_V.

But in the question, for Star3, it says apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but that's before or after extinction? Wait, the way it's worded is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". So I think the 15.5 is the observed apparent magnitude. Or wait, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic, and we have to calculate the observed.

Wait, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us." So that's Star2's case. For Star3, it says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag." So perhaps the 15.5 is the observed, but we need to find the intrinsic.

Wait, but no, probably the given apparent magnitude is the observed, so we need to find the intrinsic. Because if there's extinction, the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be lower (brighter) than the observed. Because extinction makes it dimmer. So m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_V.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is:

m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_V.

Because more extinction (A_V) makes the star appear dimmer (higher magnitude).

So for Star3, observed m is 15.5. So m_intrinsic = 15.5 - A_V. A_V is 1.86. So m_intrinsic = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64 mag. But wait, that's the intrinsic apparent magnitude. But wait, does that make sense? Because the star's actual brightness without extinction is brighter than what we observe.

Wait, but in reality, the star's apparent magnitude is the observed one. So if the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m, then the observed m_obs = m + A_V. Because extinction makes it appear fainter.

So to find what the apparent magnitude would be without extinction, m_true = m_observed - A_V.

But in the question, for Star3, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5. So m_true =15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64 mag. So the star's true apparent magnitude is brighter than 13.64. Which is way below the 16 limit for HIRES, so it's detectable by both.

But wait, wait. No, because the question is about what the spectrographs can observe. The ESPRESSO and HIRES would see the observed magnitude, not the intrinsic. Because the problem says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So the limit is based on the apparent magnitude as observed, not the intrinsic.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The problem states:

"with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed."

So the limit is based on the apparent V magnitude as observed, accounting for extinction, right?

Because the apparent magnitude you observe is after extinction. So the spectrographs can detect stars whose apparent V magnitude (as observed, accounting for any extinction) is <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES.

So for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5, but wait, that's after extinction. Because the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5. So that's already the value they're using. So Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is less than 16. So both can detect it.

Wait, but wait, the E(B-V) is given, so shouldn't we calculate the observed m? Or is the given m_obs already the corrected value? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says: Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps I need to correct for extinction. Because the given apparent magnitude is the observed one. So to find the intrinsic (i.e., unreddened) magnitude, we can subtract A_V.

But why would that matter? Because the spectrographs observe the star's apparent magnitude as seen from Earth, which includes extinction. So their detection limits are based on the observed m, not the intrinsic.

Wait, so for the purpose of this question, the apparent magnitude used for the limit is the observed, not the intrinsic. So for Star3, the observed m is 15.5. So both can detect it.

Wait, but wait, in Star4: it says absolute V mag is 15.5, located at 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4. So I'll need to compute its apparent magnitude, including extinction.

So let's compute each star's apparent magnitude as observed (after extinction) and see if it's <=16 for HIRES and <=17 for ESPRESSO.

Let me make a table.

Star1: m_abs =15.5, d=10 pc.

Apparent mag without extinction: m = M +5 log10(d/10) = 15.5 + 5*0=15.5.

Since it's at 10 pc, no distance modulus beyond that. Now, does it have extinction? The question doesn't mention E(B-V) for Star1, so we can assume it's zero. So m_observed =15.5, which is <=16 and <=17. So both can detect Star1.

Star2: m =16.5. E(B-V) not given, so I think no extinction. So m_obs=16.5. ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, so Star2 can be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES, since HIRES can only go up to 16.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So A_V =3.1*0.6=1.86. So original (intrinsic) m would be m =15.5 - A_V =13.64. Wait, but that's the intrinsic. Wait, no, no. The observed m is already 15.5. So Star3's apparent mag is 15.5, which is less than 16. So both can detect it.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, if the star's V magnitude is 15.5, but due to extinction, it's actually dimmer. Or wait, no. The observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, but without extinction it would have been brighter. So the observed m is 15.5. So the question for both spectrographs is whether their limits are higher than 15.5.

For HIRES, the limit is 16. So 15.5 <16, so yes. For ESPRESSO, 15.5 <17, yes. So Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait, do I have to correct for extinction when determining the apparent magnitude? Because the apparent magnitude is observed, so if the given m is after extinction, then no adjustment is needed. But if the given m is the intrinsic, then I have to add A_V to get the observed.

In the case of Star3, the problem says the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So this suggests that the apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (unreddened) value, and we have to add the extinction to get the observed. Or wait, no. Let me think: when you have E(B-V), A_V is the extinction, which makes the star appear dimmer. So if the star's true (intrinsic) V magnitude is m0, then the observed (reddened) m is m0 + A_V.

So in Star3's case, the given apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed, already including extinction. Or is the given m the intrinsic?

I think the question implies that the apparent magnitude given for each star includes any extinction. Because the way they are presented, Star3's apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V) is 0.6. So perhaps the given m is the intrinsic, and we have to calculate the observed.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the given m is the intrinsic, then the observed would be m + A_V.

So for Star3:

Intrinsic m = 15.5.

A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 =1.86.

Observed m =15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Wait, wait, but that would make the observed m 17.36, which is above HIRES's limit (16) but within ESPRESSO's limit (17).

Wait, but that can't be, because that would make Star3 only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

But I'm getting conflicting ideas here. Let me think again about the problem statement.

The problem says, for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

So it's given as apparent V magnitude, which is the observed magnitude, so including extinction. So for Star3, we don't need to do any correction, because the given m is already the observed one.

Wait, but that would mean that Star3's m_obs is 15.5. So both spectrographs can observe it.

Wait, but wait: no, because the given m is the apparent V magnitude, which includes extinction. So for spectrograph detection limits, they are based on the observed magnitude.

So Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both limits.

So let me proceed.

Star4: absolute V mag is 15.5, located at 10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

First, compute intrinsic apparent mag without extinction: m = M +5 log10(10/10) =15.5 +0=15.5.

Now, extinction: A_V=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So observed m =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, no. Because the absolute magnitude is the apparent mag at 10 pc, so the formula is m = M +5 log10(d/10) â†’ which for 10 pc is 15.5.

But then we have extinction, so m_obs = m + A_V =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So for Star4, the observed apparent magnitude is 16.74.

HIRES can observe up to 16, so Star4's m_obs is 16.74, which is above HIRES's limit. So HIRES can't detect it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so Star4 is within ESPRESSO's limit.

Star5: absolute V mag is16.5, located at 5 pc.

Compute apparent mag without extinction: m =16.5 +5 log10(5/10) =16.5 +5 log10(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995, about 15.0.

So without extinction, m is 15.0.

Does it have extinction? The problem says Star5's parameters: absolute V mag 16.5, 5 pc, no E(B-V) given. So no extinction. So observed m is 15.0.

So for both spectrographs, HIRES (up to 16) and ESPRESSO (17), Star5's m=15.0, which is within both. So both can detect Star5.

Wait, no, wait. Star5's absolute mag is 16.5. Wait, no, no: wait, absolute magnitude is the apparent mag at 10 pc. The distance is 5 pc, so m = M +5 log10(d/10) â†’ M=16.5, d=5.

So m =16.5 +5 log(5/10) â†’ log(0.5)= -0.3010 â†’ 5*(-0.3010)=-1.505 â†’ m=16.5 -1.505=14.995, about 15.0.

So yes, Star5's observed m is 15.0. So both can detect it.

Wait, but wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So let me list each star:

Star1: m=15.5, E(B-V)=0 â†’ m_obs=15.5 â†’ both detect.

Star2: m=16.5, E(B-V)=0 â†’ m_obs=16.5 â†’ only ESPRESSO (as 16.5 <17).

Star3: m_obs=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 â†’ wait, no, Star3's m_obs is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So if the given m is the observed, then no correction needed. So m_obs=15.5 â†’ both can detect.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the given m is the apparent (observed) magnitude, including extinction. So in that case, Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps for all stars, their V magnitude as observed (m_obs) is given, and we don't need to adjust for extinction except when it's not given. Wait, no, that's not right. Because some stars have extinction (E(B-V) is given), so their m_obs is m_intrinsic + A_V.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the given m is the intrinsic (without extinction) or the observed (with extinction). Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says:

Star1: absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

So for Star1, m =15.5 (since at 10 pc, distance modulus is zero). No E(B-V) given, so no extinction. So m_obs=15.5.

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. Wait, but distance isn't needed here because the apparent magnitude is already given.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So m_obs is 15.5, but perhaps we have to adjust because of extinction. Wait, no, because the apparent magnitude is already the observed, which includes extinction. So no adjustment needed.

But wait, no. Wait, the apparent magnitude is observed, so if the star has extinction, the observed m is higher (fainter) than the intrinsic. So if the given m is the observed, and the star has E(B-V)=0.6, then the intrinsic (unreddened) m would be m_intrinsic = m_obs - A_V. But for the purpose of the spectrograph limits, which are based on the observed m, we don't need to adjust. Because the spectrographs detect the observed m.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the spectrographs are looking at the star's observed brightness. So even if the star is reddened, the observed V mag could be higher, making it fainter, thus beyond the detection limit.

So for Star3, the observed m is 15.5. So both can detect.

Wait, but if Star3's intrinsic m is lower (brighter), but the observed m is higher, then the observed m may be beyond the detection limits.

Wait, no, no. The problem says:

Star3's apparent V mag is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6.

So the observed m is 15.5. Because the apparent magnitude is the observed value, not the intrinsic.

Wait, but that can't be, because if the star has extinction, then the observed m is higher than the intrinsic. So if the apparent V is given as 15.5, but the star has E(B-V)=0.6, then the intrinsic m would be 15.5 - A_V =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

But for the spectrographs, it's the observed m that matters. So Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is within both limits. So it can be detected by both.

Wait, but perhaps the question is that the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we have to calculate the observed.

In that case, for Star3: given m_intrinsic=15.5, E(B-V)=0.6 â†’ A_V=1.86 â†’ observed m=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Which is above HIRES's limit (16) and within ESPRESSO's (17). So Star3 would only be detected by ESPRESSO.

But that would change things. So which approach is correct?

The problem description is a bit ambiguous. Let me look again at the question.

Question: "apparent V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us."

So for Star2, the apparent mag is given. So for Star3, the apparent mag is given, but with E(B-V). So it's possible that the given m is the apparent (observed), including extinction.

But wait, no. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which gives the reddening. So the observed V magnitude would be m_obs = m_intrinsic + A_V.

If the given m is the apparent (observed), then Star3's m is 15.5, and the E(B-V) is given, but the m_obs is already known. So perhaps the E(B-V) is provided in case the star's intrinsic magnitude is needed for something else.

Wait, but in this question, we only care about the apparent V magnitude for the spectrograph limits. So if Star3's observed m is 15.5, then both can detect it.

But wait, I'm getting myself confused between two cases:

Case 1: The given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without considering extinction). So the observed m is higher. So for Star3, m_intrinsic=15.5, A_V=1.86 â†’ m_obs=17.36 â†’ so only ESPRESSO can detect.

Case 2: The given apparent magnitude is the observed (after extinction), so m_obs=15.5. So both can detect.

Which case is correct?

The problem says:

"For Star3: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

So the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but the star is at 15 pc. Wait, that can't be right. Because the apparent magnitude depends on distance. If the star is at 15 pc, but the problem gives an apparent V magnitude, perhaps that's the observed (after extinction) magnitude.

Wait, no: apparent magnitude is what you observe, regardless of distance. Wait, no, no. The apparent magnitude is computed from the absolute magnitude and the distance. Unless extinction is involved.

Wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the intrinsic (without extinction), and we have to calculate the observed.

But that would complicate things. Let me think again.

The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M +5 log10(d/10) + A_V.

Where A_V is the extinction (due to dust). So if we have M, d, and E(B-V), we can compute m_obs.

So for each star, let's compute m_obs.

Star1: M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0 â†’ A_V=0 â†’ m =15.5 +5 log(1) +0=15.5.

So m_obs=15.5 â†’ within both.

Star2: m=16.5, E(B-V)=0 â†’ m_obs=16.5 â†’ within ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Star3: M=15.5, d=15 pc, E(B-V)=0.6.

Compute m = M +5 log10(15/10) + A_V.

Wait, but wait, the problem says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each star's m_obs.

But for Star3, the problem says the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is after considering extinction. So m_obs=15.5, which is within both.

Wait, but if Star3's M is 15.5, and d is 15 pc, then without extinction, m would be:

m =15.5 + 5 log10(15/10) â†’ log(1.5)=0.176 â†’ 5 *0.176=0.88 â†’ m=15.5 +0.88=16.38.

Then, adding A_V=1.86, m_obs=16.38 +1.86=18.24.

Which is way beyond both limits. But that can't be, because the problem states that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me read the problem again.

The problem states:

"Star3 - RA = 11 h and DEC = 48 deg, apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

So, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which is the observed (after extinction). So for spectrograph detection, that's the m they use.

So Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is within both.

Star4: M=15.5, d=10 pc, E(B-V)=0.4.

Compute m_obs.

m = M +5 log10(d/10) + A_V.

d=10 â†’ log(1)=0 â†’ m=15.5 +0 + (3.1 *0.4)=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So m_obs=16.74.

Which is above HIRES's limit (16), so only ESPRESSO can detect.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m =16.5 +5 log(5/10) + A_V.

log(0.5)= -0.301 â†’ 5*(-0.301)= -1.505 â†’ m=16.5 -1.505=14.995 â†’ 15.0.

E(B-V) not given, so A_V=0 â†’ m_obs=15.0 â†’ within both.

Wait, so let's summarize each star's m_obs and whether they can be detected by both:

Star1: m=15.5 â†’ both detect.

Star2: m=16.5 â†’ ESPRESSO only.

Star3: m=15.5 â†’ both detect.

Star4: m=16.74 â†’ ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m=15.0 â†’ both detect.

So which stars can be detected by both? Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but the options don't include any with three stars. The options are A to D.

Looking back:

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 â†’ Star4's m=16.74, only ESPRESSO. So both can't detect Star4.

B) Star3 and Star5 â†’ both can detect.

C) Star2 and Star3 â†’ Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 â†’ Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So option B is Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait, Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both. Star5's m is 15.0, within both.

So the correct option would be B) Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but earlier I thought Star5's m is 15.0, so it's within both. So both can detect Star3 and Star5.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the detection limits of the spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes up to 17 mag, while HIRES can observe stars up to 16 mag. A star must have an apparent V magnitude â‰¤16 mag to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude, \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.5 \), which is â‰¤16 mag and â‰¤17 mag.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude, \( m = 16.5 \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
   - \( m = 16.5 \), which is â‰¤17 mag (detectable by ESPRESSO) but >16 mag (not detectable by HIRES).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude, \( m = 15.5 \), extinction \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude is already given as \( m = 15.5 \), which includes extinction.  
   - \( m = 15.5 \), which is â‰¤16 mag and â‰¤17 mag.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude, \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \), extinction \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in the V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{obs}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.74 \), which is â‰¤17 mag (detectable by ESPRESSO) but >16 mag (not detectable by HIRES).  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude, \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \), no extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 + 5 \cdot (-0.301) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \), which is â‰¤16 mag and â‰¤17 mag.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

### Conclusion:
Stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** (\( m = 15.5 \)) and **Star5** (\( m = 15.0 \)).
