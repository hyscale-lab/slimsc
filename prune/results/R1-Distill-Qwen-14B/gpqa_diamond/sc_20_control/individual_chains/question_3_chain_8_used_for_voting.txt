Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh, I remember that expectation values are like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

Hmm, I think the approach here is to find the expectation value of each term separately and then combine them. So, the operator is 10σz +5σx, so the expectation value should be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩, right?

Wait, yeah, because the expectation value is linear. So I can split it into two parts: expectation of 10σz, which is 10 times the expectation of σz, and similarly for σx.

Let me first find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, I can use that fact. The expectation value of σz in a state is the coefficient squared times the eigenvalue for each state.

What are the eigenvalues of σz for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩? Oh right, σz|↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz|↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).

Calculating that: (0.25) *1 + (3/4) * (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that part.

Now, the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which I think has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute ⟨σx⟩ directly using the given state.

I remember that the expectation value of σx in a state is given by the probability amplitudes. Alternatively, perhaps I can expand the operator in terms of the basis.

Wait, another approach: since σx can be written in the computational basis as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, if the state is a column vector, I can compute the expectation value as (state)† σx (state).

Wait, the state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's write this as a vector. |↑⟩ is (1,0), |↓⟩ is (0,1). So the state is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx acting on the state would swap the components. So σx * [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

The expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by σx multiplied by the state. Since all coefficients are real here, it's just the transpose.

So ⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let me compute this step by step. First, compute σx * state:

σx * state = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, the dot product with the original state is:

(0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because when I compute the expectation value of σx in an eigenstate of σz, it's zero, but in a superposition, it's not necessarily. Hmm, let me double-check my steps.

Wait, no, σx is a Hermitian operator, and its expectation value in any state can be found. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute it again. The expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩.

Expressed as a vector, |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So σx |ψ⟩ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 +0*(sqrt(3)/2)] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the inner product: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

So 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4, and the second term is also (sqrt(3))/4. Adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

But wait, that's for σx. So 5⟨σx⟩ would be 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Now, adding the two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ is -5, and 5⟨σx⟩ is about 4.33. So total expectation value is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, that's approximately -0.67. Let me check the options again.

The options are A) -1.4, B)1.65, C) -0.7, D)0.85.

Hmm, -0.67 is close to option C, which is -0.7. But let me be precise with the calculation.

Wait, sqrt(3) is exactly 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 is 0.8660254. So 5 times that would be 4.330127.

And 10 times ⟨σz⟩ was -5.

So adding -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873. Rounding to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7, because the next digit is 6 (so 0.669 rounds to 0.7 when considering one decimal).

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I compute ⟨σx⟩ correctly?

Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to note that σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So the expectation value is:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] [ [0,1],[1,0] ] [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ]

Which is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = same as before, sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm, so that part is correct.

Alternatively, another approach: the expectation value of σx in a state |ψ⟩ is given by (|a|^2 - |b|^2), wait no, I think that's for σz. Wait, no, for σz, it's (a^2 - b^2), but for σx, it's 2*(a b^* + a^* b) ?

Wait, wait. Let me think. Another approach: any spin-1/2 state can be parametrized as |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩. But since our state has real coefficients (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2), and no phase, φ is zero.

The expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Alternatively, σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps a more direct approach.

I can remember that for a state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is (|α|^2 - |β|^2) ?

Wait, no, that's for σz. Let's think again. The expectation value of σx is (2 Re(α β^* )) ?

Wait, because σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you compute ⟨σx⟩ for state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩, you have:

⟨σx⟩ = |α|^2 * 0 + α β^* * 1 + β α^* * 1 + |β|^2 * 0.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, the state is |ψ⟩ = α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩. So the vector is [α, β]^T.

Then, σx is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ is [β, α]^T.

Then, the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is α* β + β* α.

Which is 2 Re(α β^* ).

But since in our case, both α and β are real (because the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, no phase), so Re(α β^*) is just α β.

So, ⟨σx⟩ = 2 * (0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2)) ) ?

Wait, wait, no. Let's compute it. α is 0.5, β is sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * ( (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which matches my earlier calculation.

So yes, that's correct. So in this case, the expectation value is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

So the total expectation value is -5 +4.33 ≈-0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Looking back at the options, option C is -0.7. So the correct answer is C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute it as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) of \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2 \cdot (+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
(0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + \frac{3}{4} \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented by the matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]

Expressing \( |\psi\rangle \) as a vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( |\psi\rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = (0.5) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
Using linearity of expectation values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value is approximately \(-0.7\), which corresponds to option **C**.

What are the eigenvalues of σz for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩? Oh right, σz|↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz|↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).

Calculating that: (0.25) *1 + (3/4) * (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that part.

Now, the next part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which I think has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute ⟨σx⟩ directly using the given state.

Wait, the state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let's write this as a vector. |↑⟩ is (1,0), |↓⟩ is (0,1). So the state is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx acting on the state would swap the components. So σx * [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

The expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by σx multiplied by the state. Since all coefficients are real here, it's just the transpose.

So ⟨σx⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let me compute this step by step. First, compute σx * state:

σx * state = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, the dot product with the original state is:

(0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because when I compute the expectation value of σx in an eigenstate of σz, it's zero, but in a superposition, it's not necessarily. Hmm, let me double-check my steps.

Wait, no, σx is a Hermitian operator, and its expectation value in any state can be found. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's compute it again. The expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩.

Expressed as a vector, |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So σx |ψ⟩ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 +0*(sqrt(3)/2)] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the inner product: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

So 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4, and the second term is also (sqrt(3))/4. Adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

But wait, that's for σx. So 5⟨σx⟩ would be 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Now, adding the two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ is -5, and 5⟨σx⟩ is about 4.33. So total expectation value is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, that's approximately -0.67. Let me check the options again.

The options are A) -1.4, B)1.65, C) -0.7, D)0.85.

Hmm, -0.67 is close to option C, which is -0.7. But let me be precise with the calculation.

Wait, sqrt(3) is exactly 1.73205. So sqrt(3)/2 is 0.8660254. So 5 times that would be 4.330127.

And 10 times ⟨σz⟩ was -5.

So adding -5 +4.330127 = -0.669873. Rounding to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7, because the next digit is 6 (so 0.669 rounds to 0.7 when considering one decimal).

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I compute ⟨σx⟩ correctly?

Another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to note that σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So the expectation value is:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] [ [0,1],[1,0] ] [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ]

Which is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = same as before, sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm, so that part is correct.

Alternatively, another approach: the expectation value of σx in a state |ψ⟩ is given by (|a|^2 - |b|^2), wait no, I think that's for σz. Wait, no, for σz, it's (a^2 - b^2), but for σx, it's 2*(a b^* + a^* b) ?

Wait, wait. Let me think. Another approach: any spin-1/2 state can be parametrized as |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|↑⟩ + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|↓⟩. But since our state has real coefficients (0.5 and sqrt(3)/2), and no phase, φ is zero.

The expectation value of σx is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Alternatively, σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps a more direct approach.

I can remember that for a state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is (|α|^2 - |β|^2) ?

Wait, no, that's for σz. Let's think again. The expectation value of σx is (2 Re(α β^* )) ?

Wait, because σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you compute ⟨σx⟩ for state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩, you have:

⟨σx⟩ = |α|^2 * 0 + α β^* * 1 + β α^* * 1 + |β|^2 * 0.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, the state is |ψ⟩ = α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩. So the vector is [α, β]^T.

Then, σx is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ is [β, α]^T.

Then, the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is α* β + β* α.

Which is 2 Re(α β^* ).

But since in our case, both α and β are real (because the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2, no phase), so Re(α β^*) is just α β.

So, ⟨σx⟩ = 2 * (0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2)) ) ?

Wait, wait, no. Let's compute it. α is 0.5, β is sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = 2 * (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 * ( (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which matches my earlier calculation.

So yes, that's correct. So in this case, the expectation value is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

So the total expectation value is -5 +4.33 ≈-0.67, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Looking back at the options, option C is -0.7. So the correct answer is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is linear, so we compute it as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to the eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) of \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2 \cdot (+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
(0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + \frac{3}{4} \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented by the matrix:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]

Expressing \( |\psi\rangle \) as a vector:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying \( \sigma_x \) to \( |\psi\rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) is:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = (0.5) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
Using linearity of expectation values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value is approximately \(-0.7\), which corresponds to option **C**.

Answer: C
