Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find their energy difference so they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D with various eV values.

Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle plays a role in this. The principle states that you can't precisely measure both the energy and lifetime of a particle simultaneously. The formula for the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≥ ħ/Δt, where Δt is the lifetime of the state. 

Oh wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. I think it's approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I also remember that converting this into eV·s might be more useful here since the options are in eV.

So, let's calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2, I think we should consider the smaller uncertainty, because if the uncertainty is larger than the energy difference, we can't distinguish them. Or wait, maybe the other way around. Oh, wait, no. If the uncertainty is smaller than the energy difference, then the two levels can be resolved.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) must be at least ħ/2. But sometimes people use the approximation ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. 

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (1e-9 s). For E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (1e-8 s). 

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So I think the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or maybe just larger than each uncertainty. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty for each state, right?

Wait, no. Because each state has its own uncertainty. So to resolve them, the energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1| must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Or is it that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the shorter lifetime? Because the shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty.

Wait, let's think again. The energy uncertainty is higher for a shorter lifetime. So E1 has a shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) than E2 (1e-8 s). So the uncertainty for E1 is bigger. Because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt.

So let me calculate the uncertainty for each.

First, calculate ħ in eV·s. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 joules. So ħ is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s. To convert to eV·s, we divide by the conversion factor from J to eV.

So ħ = 1.055e-34 J·s / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J·s to eV·s, we multiply by (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J). So 1.055e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = (1.055e-34) / (1.602e-19) ) eV·s.

Let me compute that: 1.055e-34 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (1.055 / 1.602) * 1e-15 ≈ 0.658 * 1e-15 ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s. So yes, ħ ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s.

Now, the uncertainty for E1: ΔE1 = ħ / Δt1 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, wait. Wait that can't be right. 6.58e-16 eV·s divided by 1e-9 s is 6.58e-7 eV. That's 0.658 microvolts? Wait, but that seems high. Because E1 has a very short lifetime, so a large energy uncertainty, which makes sense.

Similarly, for E2, Δt is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, that's 6.58e-8 eV, which is 0.0658 microvolts, much smaller than E1's uncertainty.

So for the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty of each, or more precisely, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, because that's the larger uncertainty.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. If the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of each, then the states can be resolved. Alternatively, if the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, perhaps that's more accurate. Hmm.

Wait, in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the product of the uncertainties is about ħ/2, but for rough estimates, people often just take the product to be about ħ. So if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty for each state, then the two states are resolvable.

In this case, E1 has a larger uncertainty (6.58e-7 eV) and E2 has a smaller (6.58e-8 eV). So the larger of the two uncertainties is 6.58e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this value for the two states to be clearly distinguishable.

Looking at the options, the options are A) 1e-9 eV, B) 1e-11 eV, C)1e-4 eV, D)1e-8 eV.

Wait, none of these options are larger than 6.58e-7 eV. Let me see: 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is bigger than 6.58e-7. Because 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658, and 1e-4 is 0.0001. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is about 150 times larger than 6.58e-7 eV.

So that would be the correct option. Because the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty, so it can be resolved.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the numbers. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, ħ is 6.58e-16 eV·s. For E1, Δt =1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / Δt = 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV. Yes, that's correct.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 has to be greater than 6.58e-7 eV for them to be distinguishable. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV.

Which is larger than 6.58e-7 eV (which is 0.000000658 eV). So 1e-4 is larger. So option C is the only one that is larger than the uncertainty.

Wait, but what about option D? It's 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 6.58e-7. So that's too small. So the only option larger than the uncertainty is C.

So the answer must be option C.

To determine the energy difference required for two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly distinguishable, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) are related by:

\[
\Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately \( 6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). The lifetimes of the two states are \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The uncertainties in energy for each state are calculated as:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be larger than the larger uncertainty, which is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, we compare the given options to \( \Delta E_1 \):

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is also smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition for the energy difference to be distinguishable is **Option C**.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J·s to eV·s, we multiply by (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J). So 1.055e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) = (1.055e-34) / (1.602e-19) ) eV·s.

Let me compute that: 1.055e-34 / 1.602e-19 ≈ (1.055 / 1.602) * 1e-15 ≈ 0.658 * 1e-15 ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s. So yes, ħ ≈ 6.58e-16 eV·s.

Now, the uncertainty for E1: ΔE1 = ħ / Δt1 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) = 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, wait. Wait that can't be right. 6.58e-16 eV·s divided by 1e-9 s is 6.58e-7 eV. That's 0.658 microvolts? Wait, but that seems high. Because E1 has a very short lifetime, so a large energy uncertainty, which makes sense.

Similarly, for E2, Δt is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = (6.58e-16 eV·s) / (1e-8 s) = 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, that's 6.58e-8 eV, which is 0.0658 microvolts, much smaller than E1's uncertainty.

So for the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference between them must be larger than the uncertainty of each, or more precisely, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, because that's the larger uncertainty.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. If the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty of each, then the states can be resolved. Alternatively, if the energy difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties, perhaps that's more accurate. Hmm.

So that would be the correct option. Because the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty, so it can be resolved.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the numbers. Because I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, ħ is 6.58e-16 eV·s. For E1, Δt =1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / Δt = 6.58e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.58e-7 eV. Yes, that's correct.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 has to be greater than 6.58e-7 eV for them to be distinguishable. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV = 0.0001 eV.

Which is larger than 6.58e-7 eV (which is 0.000000658 eV). So 1e-4 is larger. So option C is the only one that is larger than the uncertainty.

Wait, but what about option D? It's 1e-8 eV, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 6.58e-7. So that's too small. So the only option larger than the uncertainty is C.

So the answer must be option C.


To determine the energy difference required for two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly distinguishable, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) are related by:

\[
\Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately \( 6.58 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). The lifetimes of the two states are \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The uncertainties in energy for each state are calculated as:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{6.58 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be larger than the larger uncertainty, which is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, we compare the given options to \( \Delta E_1 \):

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is also smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition for the energy difference to be distinguishable is **Option C**.
