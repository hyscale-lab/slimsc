Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined in one dimension, and their energy levels depend on their quantum numbers. Oh wait, and since they're spin-1/2, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? So each quantum state can have at most two particles because of the spin up and down.

The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy levels of a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is E multiplied by n squared. So E here is like the base unit, E = pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so each energy level is n² times E. So for the first energy level, n=1, it's E, n=2 is 4E, n=3 is 9E, and so on.

Since there are four particles, all spin-1/2, each level can hold two particles. So the ground state would have as many particles as possible in the lowest energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but wait. Are the particles fermions or bosons? Spin-1/2 means they're fermions, so they obey the exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold 2 particles, spin up and down.

So in the ground state, the lowest possible configuration. Let's think about how to fill the energy levels.

Each energy level is E multiplied by n^2, and each can hold two fermions. So for four particles, how are they filled?

The lowest energy state would have the lowest possible n's filled first.

So n=1: can hold two particles.

Then n=2: next level, so can hold two more.

Wait, four particles: two in n=1, two in n=2.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the energies would be 1²E and 2²E. But wait, the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. Since two are in n=1 (each E) and two are in n=2 (each 4E), the total energy is 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E. Wait, but wait, wait. So the ground state is 10E? Or is this the sum? Oh, right, because each particle in n=1 contributes E, two of them make 2E. Each in n=2 gives 4E, two gives 8E. So total 10E for the ground state.

Wait, but I thought the ground state would have the lowest possible configuration. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing with something else. Wait, perhaps for four fermions, the first four states would be n=1, each with spin up and down, then n=2, same. So ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, no. Wait, each n level has two possible states (spin up and down), so each n can hold two fermions. So for four fermions, the first two go into n=1, spin up and down. Then the next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So the ground state energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but the options don't have a ground state of 10E. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 30E,39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, so option B and D have 10E as ground state or first excited.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the ground state. Because perhaps the four particles can't all have the same n? No, because of the Pauli exclusion, no two can have the same quantum state. So each n can have up to two particles. So four particles would fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles) in the ground state.

So that would make the ground state's total energy 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So ground state is 10E, and then the first excited state would be when one of the particles moves to a higher energy level.

Wait, but what defines the first and second excited states? The first excited state would be the next possible lowest energy, which would involve promoting the highest occupied particle to the next available state.

Wait, but perhaps the ordering is different. Let me think about the possible states in terms of their energies.

Each particle has a state (n, s), where s is the spin, ±1/2. So each n can have two states. So the particles fill up the lowest n's first.

Four particles:

First two: n=1, s=+1/2 and s=-1/2.

Next two: n=2, s=+1/2 and s=-1/2.

Total energy: 2E + 8E =10E.

So the ground state is 10E.

But in the options, option B has ground state as 4E, which would be if all four particles were in n=1. But that's not possible because each n can hold only two fermions (due to spin). So four can't all be in n=1. So option B's first option is 4E, which would be if all four were in n=1, which is impossible. So option B's first option is wrong.

Wait, option C's first is 4E. Similarly, that would be impossible.

So the ground state must be 10E. Looking at the options, option B and D have 10E as an energy. But option B has 4E, 10E, 50E for the three states. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, but the question says: calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which states are being referred to as ground, first excited, etc. Maybe the ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible n's, but perhaps with some other arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible energy levels for four particles in terms of their individual n's.

Wait, each particle has a quantum number n, which is a positive integer (1,2,3,...). The particles are fermions, so each state (n, s) can be occupied once.

So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, s= up and down. The next two go into n=2, s=up and down. So the ground state is n's 1,1,2,2. So the energies would be 1² E, 1² E, 2² E, 2² E. So 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 10E, which is the ground state.

Now, the first excited state would be when the highest available n is promoted to the next available state. So perhaps moving one particle from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but there's four particles. So in the ground state, two are in n=1 and two in n=2. So to get the first excited state, perhaps the system's energy is increased by moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3. But wait, since each n can hold two particles, maybe the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3. So how does that work?

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=1 (two), one in n=2 (two), and one in n=3. Wait, but four particles can't all go into n=1 and n=2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the energies are determined by the sum of each individual particle's energy. So the ground state is the lowest possible sum, which is when as many as possible are in the lowest n's.

So, for four particles:

- Two in n=1 (E each) → 2E

- Two in n=2 (4E each) → 8E

Total: 10E → ground state.

Now, to find the first excited state, we need the next lowest possible energy. How can we arrange the four particles to have a total energy just higher than 10E.

Hmm, perhaps moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, that would leave three particles in n=2? No, because each n can have a maximum of two particles (spin up and down). So n=2 can't hold three.

Wait, so perhaps in the first excited state, one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3, but then what happens to the others? Let me think:

In ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles).

First excited state: perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3. So now, n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, and n=3 has 1. So the total energy would be:

2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, is that the first excited state? Because 15E is higher than 10E, but we might have a lower energy state than 15E.

Wait, perhaps another configuration is possible. Maybe in the first excited state, one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but another moves from n=1 to n=2. But that might not result in a lower total energy than 15E.

Wait, let's compute the energies of all possible configurations.

Another possibility is that all four particles are in n=2. But wait, n=2 can hold only two particles, so that's impossible. So that's not an option.

Alternative approach: list possible configurations of four particles and their total energies.

Ground state: as discussed, 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) =10E.

Now, possible next states:

1. Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Total energy: 2*1E + 4E +9E =15E.

2. One particle in n=1, and three in n=2? No, n=2 can only hold two particles, so that's impossible.

Another option: perhaps two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, which gives 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Another possibility: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But n=2 can only hold two, so that's possible. Then, the energy would be 1E + 2*(4E) +9E =1E +8E +9E=18E. But that's higher than 15E, so 15E would be the first excited state.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, but without moving others. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Wait, but the ground state's configuration is two in each n=1 and n=2. So the next possible state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy becomes 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 2 +4 +9=15E. So that's the first excited state.

But wait, another possible configuration: three in n=2 and one in n=1. But that's impossible because n=2 can only hold two particles. So that's not allowed.

So the first excited state is 15E.

Then the second excited state would be the next possible configuration, which could be when another particle moves to a higher n. So perhaps two in n=1, two in n=3. Or other possibilities.

Wait, let's think: the next possible energy after 15E would be when another n=2 particle moves to n=3, but that would require moving two particles from n=2 to n=3, leading to two in n=1 and two in n=3. Let's compute that: 2*(1E) + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E. But wait, is that the next possible energy?

Alternatively, could we have a configuration with one particle in n=4? Let's compute: 2*(1E) +1*(4E) +1*(9E) +1*(16E) → but wait, wait, that's five particles. No, we have four. Oops.

Wait, no, four particles. So another configuration could be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That would give 2*1 +4 +16=22E, which is higher than 20E.

Alternatively, moving one more particle from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. So that's 2*1 + 2*9= 2+18=20E.

But wait, another possible configuration: one particle in n=1, three in n=2. But that's impossible, as n=2 can hold only two. So can't have three in n=2.

Wait, another option: maybe moving one particle from n=1 to n=3, but that would require that n=3 can hold one, but would leave n=1 with one particle. So configuration would be one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. The energy would be 1 + 8 +9 =18E. Hmm, that's higher than the 15E first excited state.

So the possible energies after the ground state are 15E and 18E and 20E.

Wait, so after 10E (ground), the next could be 15E, then 18E, then 20E.

So first excited state is 15E, second excited is 18E.

Wait, but let's think again. Are there any other possible configurations that give lower energies than 15E? For four particles, perhaps the configuration where one is in n=2, one in n=3, and two in n=1. That's the same as earlier, 2+4+9=15E.

Is there a way to arrange four particles to have a lower total energy than 15E but higher than 10E? Let's see: what about two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 → 15E. Alternatively, any other arrangement?

Wait, perhaps all four particles can't be in the same n, so the next possible is when two are in n=1, and two in n=2. Then, the first excited state would be when one particle moves to n=3, but that would require leaving n=2 with one, which is allowed. So the energy would be 2*1 + 1*4 +1*9=15E.

Then, the next excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, so two in n=1 and two in n=3. So energy is 2*1 + 2*9 =2+18=20E. So that's higher than 15E.

Alternatively, could one particle be in n=4, but that would require the others to be in higher n's, which would make the energy even higher.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the rest in lower n's. So the sum is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E.

So the energy levels would be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 20E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, so according to my calculation, the second excited state would be 20E, but perhaps there's another configuration that leads to a lower energy for the second excited state.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2, and others are in higher. Let me think: perhaps the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. So energy would be 2*1 +4 +16=22E. That's higher than 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps moving two particles into n=3, leaving the others in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the energy is 10E + (9E -4E) )= 10E +5E=15E.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So now, two in n=1, two in n=3. The energy would be 2*1 + 2*9=2+18=20E.

But wait, option D's second excited state is 18E. So perhaps I'm missing another configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, and another moves from n=1 to n=2. So the configuration would be one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. That would have energy 1 + 8 +9=18E.

Wait, that's 18E, which is less than 20E. So maybe 18E is a lower energy than 20E, making it the second excited state.

Hmm, so ground state:10E.

First excited state:15E.

Second excited state:18E.

But wait, why is 18E lower than 20E? Because in this configuration, the particles are arranged with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy is 1 +8 +9=18E. Which is higher than 15E but lower than 20E.

So the order would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). So the options are:

Looking at the options, option D is 10E, 15E,18E. So that would match.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me check again. Does the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 have a lower energy than 20E? Because 1 + 8 +9=18E is less than 20E.

So the order of energies would be:

10E (ground state),

15E (first excited state),

18E (second excited state).

So looking at the options:

Option D says:

10E,15E,18E.

That's exactly what I thought. So the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we use the energy levels of a particle in such a well, given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
\]

### Ground State:
The particles are fermions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning each quantum state (defined by \(n\) and spin) can hold at most two particles. To minimize the total energy, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels:

- Two particles occupy \(n=1\) (energies: \(1^2 E = E\)),
- Two particles occupy \(n=2\) (energies: \(2^2 E = 4E\)).

The total energy of the ground state is:

\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
In the first excited state, the system transitions to the next lowest energy configuration. One particle from \(n=2\) moves to \(n=3\), resulting in:

- Two particles at \(n=1\) (energies: \(1^2 E = E\)),
- One particle at \(n=2\) (energy: \(2^2 E = 4E\)),
- One particle at \(n=3\) (energy: \(3^2 E = 9E\)).

The total energy of the first excited state is:

\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted to a higher energy level. The next possible configuration is:

- One particle at \(n=1\) (energy: \(1^2 E = E\)),
- Two particles at \(n=2\) (energies: \(2^2 E = 4E\)),
- One particle at \(n=3\) (energy: \(3^2 E = 9E\)).

The total energy of the second excited state is:

\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = E + 2(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
\]

### Conclusion:
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \(10E\), \(15E\), and \(18E\), respectively. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Option D: \(10E, 15E, 18E\).**

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined in one dimension, and their energy levels depend on their quantum numbers. Oh wait, and since they're spin-1/2, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? So each quantum state can have at most two particles because of the spin up and down.

The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy levels of a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is E multiplied by n squared. So E here is like the base unit, E = pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so each energy level is n² times E. So for the first energy level, n=1, it's E, n=2 is 4E, n=3 is 9E, and so on.

Since there are four particles, all spin-1/2, each level can hold two particles. So the ground state would have as many particles as possible in the lowest energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but wait. Are the particles fermions or bosons? Spin-1/2 means they're fermions, so they obey the exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold 2 particles, spin up and down.

So in the ground state, the lowest possible configuration. Let's think about how to fill the energy levels.

Each energy level is E multiplied by n^2, and each can hold two fermions. So for four particles, how are they filled?

The lowest energy state would have the lowest possible n's filled first.

So n=1: can hold two particles.

Then n=2: next level, so can hold two more.

Wait, four particles: two in n=1, two in n=2.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the energies would be 1²E and 2²E. But wait, the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. Since two are in n=1 (each E) and two are in n=2 (each 4E), the total energy is 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E. Wait, but wait, wait. So the ground state is 10E? Or is this the sum? Oh, right, because each particle in n=1 contributes E, two of them make 2E. Each in n=2 gives 4E, two gives 8E. So total 10E for the ground state.

Wait, but I thought the ground state would have the lowest possible configuration. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing with something else. Wait, perhaps for four fermions, the first four states would be n=1, each with spin up and down, then n=2, same. So ground state would have two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, no. Wait, each n level has two possible states (spin up and down), so each n can hold two fermions. So for four fermions, the first two go into n=1, spin up and down. Then the next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So the ground state energy is 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but the options don't have a ground state of 10E. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 30E,39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Wait, so option B and D have 10E as ground state or first excited.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the ground state. Because perhaps the four particles can't all have the same n? No, because of the Pauli exclusion, no two can have the same quantum state. So each n can have up to two particles. So four particles would fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles) in the ground state.

So that would make the ground state's total energy 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So ground state is 10E, and then the first excited state would be when one of the particles moves to a higher energy level.

Wait, but what defines the first and second excited states? The first excited state would be the next possible lowest energy, which would involve promoting the highest occupied particle to the next available state.

Wait, but perhaps the ordering is different. Let me think about the possible states in terms of their energies.

Each particle has a state (n, s), where s is the spin, ±1/2. So each n can have two states. So the particles fill up the lowest n's first.

Four particles:

First two: n=1, s=+1/2 and s=-1/2.

Next two: n=2, s=+1/2 and s=-1/2.

Total energy: 2E + 8E =10E.

So the ground state is 10E.

But in the options, option B has ground state as 4E, which would be if all four particles were in n=1. But that's not possible because each n can hold only two fermions (due to spin). So four can't all be in n=1. So option B's first option is 4E, which would be if all four were in n=1, which is impossible. So option B's first option is wrong.

Wait, option C's first is 4E. Similarly, that would be impossible.

So the ground state must be 10E. Looking at the options, option B and D have 10E as an energy. But option B has 4E, 10E, 50E for the three states. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, but the question says: calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which states are being referred to as ground, first excited, etc. Maybe the ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible n's, but perhaps with some other arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible energy levels for four particles in terms of their individual n's.

Wait, each particle has a quantum number n, which is a positive integer (1,2,3,...). The particles are fermions, so each state (n, s) can be occupied once.

So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, s= up and down. The next two go into n=2, s=up and down. So the ground state is n's 1,1,2,2. So the energies would be 1² E, 1² E, 2² E, 2² E. So 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 10E, which is the ground state.

Now, the first excited state would be when the highest available n is promoted to the next available state. So perhaps moving one particle from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but there's four particles. So in the ground state, two are in n=1 and two in n=2. So to get the first excited state, perhaps the system's energy is increased by moving one of the n=2 particles to n=3. But wait, since each n can hold two particles, maybe the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3. So how does that work?

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=1 (two), one in n=2 (two), and one in n=3. Wait, but four particles can't all go into n=1 and n=2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the energies are determined by the sum of each individual particle's energy. So the ground state is the lowest possible sum, which is when as many as possible are in the lowest n's.

So, for four particles:

- Two in n=1 (E each) → 2E

- Two in n=2 (4E each) → 8E

Total: 10E → ground state.

Now, to find the first excited state, we need the next lowest possible energy. How can we arrange the four particles to have a total energy just higher than 10E.

Hmm, perhaps moving one particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, that would leave three particles in n=2? No, because each n can have a maximum of two particles (spin up and down). So n=2 can't hold three.

Wait, so perhaps in the first excited state, one of the particles in n=2 moves up to n=3, but then what happens to the others? Let me think:

In ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles).

First excited state: perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3. So now, n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, and n=3 has 1. So the total energy would be:

2*(1E) + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, is that the first excited state? Because 15E is higher than 10E, but we might have a lower energy state than 15E.

Wait, perhaps another configuration is possible. Maybe in the first excited state, one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but another moves from n=1 to n=2. But that might not result in a lower total energy than 15E.

Wait, let's compute the energies of all possible configurations.

Another possibility is that all four particles are in n=2. But wait, n=2 can hold only two particles, so that's impossible. So that's not an option.

Alternative approach: list possible configurations of four particles and their total energies.

Ground state: as discussed, 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) =10E.

Now, possible next states:

1. Two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Total energy: 2*1E + 4E +9E =15E.

2. One particle in n=1, and three in n=2? No, n=2 can only hold two particles, so that's impossible.

Another option: perhaps two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, which gives 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Another possibility: one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. But n=2 can only hold two, so that's possible. Then, the energy would be 1E + 2*(4E) +9E =1E +8E +9E=18E. But that's higher than 15E, so 15E would be the first excited state.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, but without moving others. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Wait, but the ground state's configuration is two in each n=1 and n=2. So the next possible state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, resulting in two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy becomes 2*1 + 1*4 + 1*9 = 2 +4 +9=15E. So that's the first excited state.

But wait, another possible configuration: three in n=2 and one in n=1. But that's impossible because n=2 can only hold two particles. So that's not allowed.

So the first excited state is 15E.

Then the second excited state would be the next possible configuration, which could be when another particle moves to a higher n. So perhaps two in n=1, two in n=3. Or other possibilities.

Wait, let's think: the next possible energy after 15E would be when another n=2 particle moves to n=3, but that would require moving two particles from n=2 to n=3, leading to two in n=1 and two in n=3. Let's compute that: 2*(1E) + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E. But wait, is that the next possible energy?

Alternatively, could we have a configuration with one particle in n=4? Let's compute: 2*(1E) +1*(4E) +1*(9E) +1*(16E) → but wait, wait, that's five particles. No, we have four. Oops.

Wait, no, four particles. So another configuration could be two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That would give 2*1 +4 +16=22E, which is higher than 20E.

Alternatively, moving one more particle from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. So that's 2*1 + 2*9= 2+18=20E.

But wait, another possible configuration: one particle in n=1, three in n=2. But that's impossible, as n=2 can hold only two. So can't have three in n=2.

Wait, another option: maybe moving one particle from n=1 to n=3, but that would require that n=3 can hold one, but would leave n=1 with one particle. So configuration would be one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. The energy would be 1 + 8 +9 =18E. Hmm, that's higher than the 15E first excited state.

So the possible energies after the ground state are 15E and 18E and 20E.

Wait, so after 10E (ground), the next could be 15E, then 18E, then 20E.

So first excited state is 15E, second excited is 18E.

Wait, but let's think again. Are there any other possible configurations that give lower energies than 15E? For four particles, perhaps the configuration where one is in n=2, one in n=3, and two in n=1. That's the same as earlier, 2+4+9=15E.

Is there a way to arrange four particles to have a lower total energy than 15E but higher than 10E? Let's see: what about two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 → 15E. Alternatively, any other arrangement?

Wait, perhaps all four particles can't be in the same n, so the next possible is when two are in n=1, and two in n=2. Then, the first excited state would be when one particle moves to n=3, but that would require leaving n=2 with one, which is allowed. So the energy would be 2*1 + 1*4 +1*9=15E.

Then, the next excited state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, so two in n=1 and two in n=3. So energy is 2*1 + 2*9 =2+18=20E. So that's higher than 15E.

Alternatively, could one particle be in n=4, but that would require the others to be in higher n's, which would make the energy even higher.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and the rest in lower n's. So the sum is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E.

So the energy levels would be:

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E.

Second excited state: 20E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, so according to my calculation, the second excited state would be 20E, but perhaps there's another configuration that leads to a lower energy for the second excited state.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2, and others are in higher. Let me think: perhaps the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. So energy would be 2*1 +4 +16=22E. That's higher than 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps moving two particles into n=3, leaving the others in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the energy is 10E + (9E -4E) )= 10E +5E=15E.

Then, the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So now, two in n=1, two in n=3. The energy would be 2*1 + 2*9=2+18=20E.

But wait, option D's second excited state is 18E. So perhaps I'm missing another configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle moves to n=3, and another moves from n=1 to n=2. So the configuration would be one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. That would have energy 1 + 8 +9=18E.

Wait, that's 18E, which is less than 20E. So maybe 18E is a lower energy than 20E, making it the second excited state.

Hmm, so ground state:10E.

First excited state:15E.

Second excited state:18E.

But wait, why is 18E lower than 20E? Because in this configuration, the particles are arranged with one in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. The energy is 1 +8 +9=18E. Which is higher than 15E but lower than 20E.

So the order would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). So the options are:

Looking at the options, option D is 10E, 15E,18E. So that would match.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me check again. Does the configuration with one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3 have a lower energy than 20E? Because 1 + 8 +9=18E is less than 20E.

So the order of energies would be:

10E (ground state),

15E (first excited state),

18E (second excited state).

So looking at the options:

Option D says:

10E,15E,18E.

That's exactly what I thought. So the answer should be option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we use the energy levels of a particle in such a well, given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
\]

### Ground State:
The particles are fermions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning each quantum state (defined by \(n\) and spin) can hold at most two particles. To minimize the total energy, the particles fill the lowest available energy levels:

- Two particles occupy \(n=1\) (energies: \(1^2 E = E\)),
- Two particles occupy \(n=2\) (energies: \(2^2 E = 4E\)).

The total energy of the ground state is:

\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
In the first excited state, the system transitions to the next lowest energy configuration. One particle from \(n=2\) moves to \(n=3\), resulting in:

- Two particles at \(n=1\) (energies: \(1^2 E = E\)),
- One particle at \(n=2\) (energy: \(2^2 E = 4E\)),
- One particle at \(n=3\) (energy: \(3^2 E = 9E\)).

The total energy of the first excited state is:

\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted to a higher energy level. The next possible configuration is:

- One particle at \(n=1\) (energy: \(1^2 E = E\)),
- Two particles at \(n=2\) (energies: \(2^2 E = 4E\)),
- One particle at \(n=3\) (energy: \(3^2 E = 9E\)).

The total energy of the second excited state is:

\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = E + 2(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
\]

### Conclusion:
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \(10E\), \(15E\), and \(18E\), respectively. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Option D: \(10E, 15E, 18E\).**
