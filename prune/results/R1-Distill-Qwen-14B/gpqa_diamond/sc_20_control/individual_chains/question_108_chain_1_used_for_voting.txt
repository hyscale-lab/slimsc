Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the Hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and is 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. I need to compare the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are about whether ⟨H⟩ is much bigger, much smaller, or comparable to ΔE.

First, I remember that the paramagnetic term is due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

The Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic interaction is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz (the z-axis), this simplifies to H = μ_B g m B. Wait, actually, I think the formula is H = -μ·B, which would be H = -μ_z B. So since μ_z is proportional to m, the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to m B.

But wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be -l, ..., +l. If m is small, like m=0, the term would be zero. But if m is non-zero, like 1, then we have a contribution. But the problem says small m, so perhaps m is much less than the maximum possible l.

But wait, the question is about the order of magnitude, so perhaps it's comparing the typical values of ⟨H⟩ and ΔE.

Now, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two atomic energy levels. For hydrogen, the Balmer series has a wavelength around 0.486 μm, which is the Balmer-alpha line (n=3 to n=2). So the transition energy ΔE can be calculated using the Rydberg formula.

The Rydberg constant R is about 1.097e4 m⁻¹. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = - (μ_e e²)/(8ε₀a₀) (1/n²), where a₀ is the Bohr radius. Alternatively, the energy difference between two levels can be found using ΔE = (hcR)(1/(n₁²) - 1/(n₂²)) )

Wait, the wavelength λ is given as 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm. Let me compute the corresponding frequency or energy.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let me calculate that.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is 3e8 m/s. λ is 486.1e-9 meters.

So E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9)

Let me compute this:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = approximately 4.088e-18 J.

Hmm, but wait, hydrogen's transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two levels, so this would be the photon's energy when that transition happens. So ΔE is about 4e-18 J.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩. Since H = μ_B g m B.

μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. g is about 2. So H = 2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * m * B.

Given that B is 1 T, then H = 2*9.274e-24 * m.

What's the value of m? The problem states that m is small. For hydrogen, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can be up to n-1. For a 1T magnetic field, but m is small. Let's assume m=1, since higher m would make the term larger.

So H would be about 2*9.274e-24 * 1 = ~1.85e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, in reality, when we're considering the expectation value of the perturbation, the energy shift is given by the perturbation theory. So the term is proportional to m. If m is small, like m=0, then the shift is zero. But when m is non-zero, the shift is small compared to the main energy levels.

But wait, in the problem, the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE.

So we have:

⟨H⟩ ≈ 1.85e-23 J (for m=1),

ΔE ≈ 4e-18 J.

So, ⟨H⟩ is about 1e-23 compared to 1e-18. That's four orders of magnitude smaller. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but wait. What if m is larger? The problem says m is small, but maybe m is on the order of l, which could be, say, 1 or 2. Let's take m=2.

Then ⟨H⟩ is 3.7e-23 J, which still is 1e-23 in the same range. So regardless, it's much smaller than ΔE.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE, which would correspond to option C: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Wait, but I need to think about the energy scales. The transition energy is on the order of 1e-18 J, while the paramagnetic term is 1e-23 J. So the paramagnetic term is way smaller.

So the correct option is C.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the two quantities as follows:

1. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩**:  
   The Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic interaction is given by:  
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot \vec{B} = -g \mu_B m B
   \]  
   where \( g \) is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2), \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton (\( \mu_B \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \)), \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \).  
   Substituting these values, we find:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \propto g \mu_B m B
   \]  
   For small \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 1 \)), the expectation value is approximately:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \approx 2 \cdot 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \, \text{T} = 1.85 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Transition Energy ΔE**:  
   The transition energy corresponds to the energy difference between two hydrogen atom energy levels. For the Balmer-alpha transition (\( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \)), the energy of the photon is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
   \]  
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 486.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   Comparing the two quantities:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \approx 1.85 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E \approx 4 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately four orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

**Conclusion**: The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom.
