Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets can't have isolated poles; they always come in pairs. That's why the magnetic field lines form closed loops, right?

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws in electromagnetism. Let me think about each one:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**: The divergence of E equals the charge density over epsilon zero. Mathematically, ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. I think this one relates to electric fields and charge distribution. If there are isolated charges (like in our universe), this holds. But the question is about magnetic poles, so maybe this equation isn't affected.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: The divergence of B is zero. So, ∇·B = 0. Oh wait, this law is what enforces that magnetic field lines are always closed loops, no monopoles. So in a universe with isolated poles, this equation must change. Instead of divergence being zero, it would have a term involving magnetic charge density. Like ∇·B = ρ_m (where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density). So this equation would definitely be different.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: The curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. So ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This relates changing magnetic fields to electric fields. I don't think this equation would change because it's about how changing B fields induce E fields. Unless there are magnetic charges, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's okay.

4. **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition**: The curl of H equals the current density plus the displacement current. So ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. This has to do with how magnetic fields are created by currents and changing electric fields. Again, I'm not sure this would change unless there's a magnetic current, which isn't part of this equation. Wait, in our universe, Ampère's law doesn't have a term for magnetic current because there are no monopoles. So if magnetic monopoles exist, maybe there's a new term involving magnetic current density? Like, a term for ∂M/∂t or something? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, but the question is about which Maxwell's equations are different. So, which equations would change if there are isolated magnetic poles (magnetic monopoles)?

In our universe, the equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, Gauss's Law for magnetism would change from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = ρ_m (where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density). So equation 2 changes.

What about Ampère's Law (equation 4)? In our universe, it's ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). Wait, no, Ampère's law is for H, not B. Let me correct. Ampère's law in terms of B is ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. Wait, but if there are magnetic currents, then perhaps there's an additional term. For example, if you have a magnetic current density K_m, then perhaps Ampère's law would include a term like ∂K_m/∂t or something similar. So equation 4 would change as well.

Wait, so equation 2 (Gauss's Law for B) changes, and equation 4 (Ampère's Law) might also change. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 remains the same, but equation 3 changes. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: in our universe, magnetic monopoles are not observed, so equation 2 has divergence B = 0. If monopoles exist, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where μ_m is some constant. So that equation definitely changes.

What about Faraday's Law? In our case, the curl of E is -dB/dt. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps the equation would change. Wait, Faraday's Law is about how a changing B field induces E fields. So maybe it's unaffected. Because the presence of a magnetic current could affect the time derivative of B, but Faraday's Law would still hold as it's about the induced fields. Or wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps Faraday's Law would acquire a term involving the magnetic current.

Wait, another approach: in a theory with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations would have to be modified in two places. Let me recall. From what I remember, in such a theory, you'd have:

- Gauss's Law for B becomes ∇·B = ρ_m / ε_0 (or something similar, depending on units)
- Ampère's Law would have a term involving the time derivative of E, or perhaps the divergence of E? Or maybe the curl of B would have an additional term involving the current of magnetic charges.

Wait, no. Let me think. In conventional theory, Ampère's Law is:

∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t.

But if there is a magnetic current, perhaps an additional term appears. For instance, sometimes the modified Ampère's Law would include a term like ∂M/∂t, where M is the magnetic current. But I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, perhaps both the divergence of B and the curl of E would change. Wait, no. Let me think about the four Maxwell equations again.

Wait, Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles would have symmetry with electric and magnetic terms. So:

- The divergence of E is ρ/ε0
- The divergence of B is μ0 ρ_m (or something)
- The curl of E is -∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m (if there's a magnetic current)
- The curl of B is μ0 (ε0 ∂E/∂t + J)

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So Ampère's Law would involve the current due to electric charges (J) and perhaps the displacement current (ε0 ∂E/∂t), and also, if there's a magnetic current, then perhaps another term.

Alternatively, another way: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations become symmetric. So each of the four equations would have a similar structure as their electric counterparts. So:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε0
2. ∇·B = ρ_m μ0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m
4. ∇×B = μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t + μ0 J_e

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, in some formulations, the two additional terms are added.

But for the purpose of this question, I think the key is that in a universe with isolated magnetic poles, two of Maxwell's equations change. Which ones?

The original equations (without monopoles) are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε0
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ0 (J + ε0 ∂E/∂t )

So, in the presence of monopoles, equation 2 becomes non-zero, and possibly equation 4 gets another term (like a current of magnetic charges).

Alternatively, maybe equation 3 also changes. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The question is which Maxwell equations are different. The options are:

Option A) The one related to divergence of magnetic field. That would be equation 2. So if that's the only one, but I think there are two.

Option B) The ones related to the circulation of E and divergence of B. So equations 3 and 2.

Wait, equation 3 is the curl of E, which is Faraday's law. So if Faraday's law changes, that's another equation.

Wait, but in our universe, the curl of E is -dB/dt. If there's a magnetic current, would that term change? Suppose there's a magnetic current J_m, then perhaps the equation becomes curl E = - dB/dt - J_m. Or something like that. So equation 3 would change.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Let me think. If a magnetic monopole exists, it would create a magnetic field similar to how an electric charge creates an electric field. So the B field would have sources and sinks, like E fields do.

So, Maxwell's equations would have to be modified so that both E and B fields have sources and sinks. So equation 2 would change (div B = rho_m), and equation 1 would have a term for B as well? No, equation 1 is about E. Wait, maybe equation 1 remains the same.

So, the modified equations would be:

1. ∇·E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. ∇·B = rho_m / epsilon_0  [or some constant]
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m
4. ∇×B = mu_0 (epsilon_0 ∂E/∂t + J_e )

So, equations 2, 3, and 4 would change? Or just 2 and 4?

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations would have symmetry with electric and magnetic terms. So equation 2 and equation 1 would have similar forms, and equations 3 and 4 would have similar forms, but with E and B swapped.

So, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = rho_m, similar to equation 1.

Equation 4 would become ∇×B = mu0 (epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_e ), but maybe an additional term if magnetic current exists. Wait, perhaps equation 3 would have a term involving the magnetic current.

Hmm, perhaps in this scenario, equations 2 and 4 change, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the original Maxwell's equations without monopoles are:

1. ∇·E = rho_e / epsilon0
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = mu0 (epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_e )

If you have magnetic monopoles, then:

1. ∇·E = rho_e / epsilon0
2. ∇·B = rho_m / epsilon0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - mu0 J_m
4. ∇×B = mu0 (epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_e ) + mu0 J_m ??? Not sure.

Alternatively, equation 4 would have an extra term like ∂M/∂t, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach. The question says that in this universe, Maxwell's equations look different. Which ones?

The options are:

A) Only the divergence of magnetic field equation (equation 2) is different.

B) The ones related to the circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2) are different.

C) The ones related to the circulation of B (equation 4) and flux of E (equation 1?), but I'm not sure. Flux of E is Gauss's law for E, which would be equation 1.

D) The ones related to divergence and curl of B, which would be equations 2 and 4.

Wait, D says divergence and curl of B. So equation 2 and 4.

In our universe:

Equation 2 is ∇·B = 0.

Equation 4 is ∇×B = mu0 (epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_e )

If in the new universe, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = rho_m / epsilon0, and equation 4 becomes ∇×B = mu0 (epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_e ) + something involving J_m (magnetic current), then both equations 2 and 4 would change.

But wait, the question is which equations are different. So the answer would be the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought equation 3 (curl E) might change as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of magnetic monopoles, only equations 2 and 4 change.

Wait, let me think about the symmetry. Without monopoles, E and B are treated asymmetrically. With monopoles, the theory becomes symmetric. So both Gauss's laws (E and B) have sources, and both curl equations have terms involving the other field.

So, in that case, all four equations would have similar forms, but perhaps only equations 2 and 4 would change, or perhaps equations 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps equation 3 (curl E) would also have a term involving the magnetic current.

Wait, in the absence of magnetic monopoles, equation 3 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t.

With monopoles, perhaps it's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current density. So equation 3 would change as well.

So that would mean three equations change: 2,3,4.

But looking at the options, none of them suggest three equations. The options are A, B, C, D, each suggesting one, two, or possibly another.

Wait, the question says "which of those equations are different?" So which Maxwell equations get modified.

Wait, the four equations are:

1. Divergence E: Gauss's law
2. Divergence B: Gauss's law for magnetism
3. Curl E: Faraday's Law
4. Curl B: Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition)

So, in a universe with monopoles, equation 2 would change (div B is non-zero), equation 3 would change (curl E has a J_m term), and equation 4 would have a term for J_m as well, perhaps.

But looking at the options, which pairs of equations change?

Option D says the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equations 2 and 4.

Option B says the ones related to the circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2).

So if equations 2 and 3 change, that would be option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought equation 4 would also change. So maybe the answer is D (equations 2 and 4) or B (equations 2 and 3), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let me think about this carefully. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, how do Maxwell's equations change?

In the standard treatment, when magnetic monopoles are introduced, two of Maxwell's equations are modified. Equation 2 (Gauss's law for B) gains a term for the magnetic charge density, and equation 4 (Ampère's Law) gains a term involving the magnetic current density.

Wait, perhaps equation 4 would have a current term, like J_m. So equation 4 would change from:

∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

to something like:

∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t + J_m )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, some sources say that when magnetic monopoles exist, we have to add terms to both Ampère's and Faraday's laws.

Wait, another approach: the four Maxwell equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles would be:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε0
2. ∇·B = ρ_m / ε0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m
4. ∇×B = μ0 (ε0 ∂E/∂t + J_e + J_m )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me look for a source in my mind. I think when magnetic monopoles are present, both Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law have extra terms. So equations 3 and 4 would change, along with equation 2.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe the correct answer is that both equations 2 and 4 change, making option D the correct one. Because in equation 2, the divergence of B isn't zero anymore, and in equation 4, the curl of B now includes a term related to the magnetic current.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 3 (curl E) also changes. So the changed equations would be 2,3,4. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options given are:

A) Only the divergence of B.

B) Circulation of E and divergence of B.

C) Circulation of B and flux of E.

D) Divergence and curl of B.

So option D: equations 2 and 4. Because equation 2 is divergence of B, equation 4 is curl of B.

In a universe with monopoles, equation 2 changes (div B = rho_m), and equation 4 would have an additional term involving the magnetic current. So that's two equations.

So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If equation 4 is the curl of B, which in our universe is ∇×B = μ0 (J + ε0 ∂E/∂t ). With magnetic currents, perhaps we'd have another term like ∂M/∂t, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So equation 3 would have a term similar to equation 4.

Wait, in this scenario, equation 3 would have a term involving the magnetic current. So equation 3 would change as well.

But the options don't include an option where three equations change. So perhaps the correct answer is that equations 2 and 3 change, which would be option B.

Wait, but why would equation 3 change? Because equation 3 is about the curl of E. If there's a magnetic current, perhaps it introduces a term in equation 3.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to find the correct answer.

Upon reflection, the key equations that change when magnetic monopoles exist are:

- Gauss's Law for magnetism: equation 2, ∇·B → rho_m
- Faraday's Law: equation 3, ∇×E → -dB/dt - mu0 J_m

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about Faraday's Law. Alternatively, perhaps Ampère's Law (equation 4) would change instead.

Wait, I think in the presence of monopoles, the Faraday's Law (∇×E) would have an additional term involving the magnetic current, and the Ampère's Law (∇×B) would have an additional term involving the electric current or something else.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of it logically.

In our universe, without monopoles:

- ∇·E = rho_e / eps0
- ∇·B = 0
- ∇×E = - dB/dt
- ∇×B = mu0 eps0 dE/dt + mu0 J_e

With monopoles, the first equation remains same, the second equation becomes ∇·B = rho_m / eps0.

The third equation, ∇×E, might get a term involving J_m, the magnetic current.

The fourth equation, ∇×B, might get a term involving J_e, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the fourth equation remains the same.

Wait, I think that when you have magnetic monopoles, the two equations that change are:

2. ∇·B = rho_m
3. ∇×E = - dB/dt - J_m (if J_m is the magnetic current)

So, equations 2 and 3 would change. That's option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 changes as well.

Wait, if equation 3 changes, that's the curl of E (Faraday's Law). So option B says the ones related to the circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2) are different.

So the answer is B.

But earlier I thought option D was a possibility. I'm torn between B and D.

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

The options:

A) Only divergence of B.

B) Circulation of E and divergence of B.

C) Circulation of B and flux of E.

D) Divergence and curl of B.

Hmm. So option D says both equations related to B: divergence and curl.

In the presence of monopoles, equation 2 (div B) changes. What about equation 4 (curl B)?

In our universe, equation 4 is:

∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

With monopoles, perhaps equation 4 becomes:

∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t ) + something involving J_m.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 remains the same, and instead equation 3 changes.

Wait, another approach: in a theory with magnetic monopoles, there's a term added to Faraday's Law and another to Ampère's Law. So equation 3 and 4 change. But equation 2 also changes.

Wait, but according to my knowledge, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the two Maxwell equations that change are Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. So that would be equations 2 and 3. So option B.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. I've read before that in such a scenario, two equations change: the divergence of B and the curl of E. So I think the correct answer is option B.

But wait, what about Ampère's Law? Would that also change? Or is that only the two?

Hmm, perhaps I'm conflating different versions. Wait, another approach: the two Maxwell equations that change are:

∇·B = rho_m

and

∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m

So, equations 2 and 3 change. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but this would mean that the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and only equation 2 changes, making option A correct. But that doesn't make sense because Ampère's Law would also have to account for magnetic currents.

Wait, no. I think that when you have magnetic monopoles, you have to add terms to both Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. So that would be equations 2 and 3.

But looking at the options:

Option B is the ones related to the circulation of E and divergence of B. So equations 3 and 2.

So the answer would be B.

But earlier I thought option D was correct because equations 2 and 4 change. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different way. Let's think about which equations are about B.

Option D says the ones related to divergence and curl of B.

Equation 2 is divergence B.

Equation 4 is curl B.

So if both equations 2 and 4 change, that would be option D.

But why would equation 4 change? Because with magnetic monopoles, maybe Ampère's Law would have an additional term involving magnetic current. Let me think.

In our universe, the Ampère-Maxwell Law is:

∇×B = μ₀ ( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, there's a term involving the magnetic current. So perhaps equation 4 becomes:

∇×B = μ₀ ( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t ) + (some term involving J_m )

So equation 4 would change, in addition to equation 2.

If that's the case, then option D is the correct answer because both divergence and curl of B are modified.

But I'm not 100% certain.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 3 is modified, not equation 4.

I think the confusion arises because in the presence of magnetic monopoles, two Maxwell's equations are modified: Gauss's Law for B (equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3), leading to option B.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: in the standard formulation, when we add magnetic monopoles, the modified Maxwell's equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = ρ_m / ε₀
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (ε₀ ∂E/∂t + J_e )

Wait, so in this case, equation 2 and 3 change. So this would correspond to option B, where equations related to the circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2) are different.

So the correct answer is B.

But earlier I thought equation 4 might also change, but perhaps not. Alternatively, equation 4 remains the same.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is D) the ones related to the divergence and curl of B.

Wait, no. Because equation 4 is about the curl of B, but in the scenario with magnetic monopoles, equation 4 might not change. Instead, equation 3 would change.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If magnetic monopoles exist, the two Maxwell equations that would change are:

- Gauss's Law for B: equation 2.
- Faraday's Law: equation 3.

So the answer would be B.

But I'm still a bit uncertain. Another way: the original Maxwell's equations without monopoles have equation 2 as ∇·B = 0. With monopoles, this becomes ∇·B = rho_m.

Equation 3 is ∇×E = -dB/dt. With monopoles, perhaps it becomes ∇×E = -dB/dt - J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current. So equation 3 changes, and equation 2 changes.

Thus, the answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


In a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) exist, Maxwell's equations would differ from those in our universe. In our universe, magnetic monopoles are not observed, and the four Maxwell equations are:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}$$  
   This equation relates the divergence of the electric field to the electric charge density and remains unchanged in a universe with magnetic monopoles.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$  
   In our universe, this equation reflects the fact that magnetic field lines are closed loops, and there are no isolated magnetic charges. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would change to:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \frac{\rho_m}{\epsilon_0}$$  
   where $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction**:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$  
   In our universe, this equation describes how a time-varying magnetic field induces an electric field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would acquire an additional term involving the magnetic current density $\mathbf{J}_m$, becoming:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mathbf{J}_m$$  

4. **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition**:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left( \mathbf{J}_e + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right)$$  
   This equation describes how a time-varying electric field and electric currents generate a magnetic field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would also change to include a term involving the magnetic current density $\mathbf{J}_m$, becoming:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left( \mathbf{J}_e + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right) + \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m$$  

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: This suggests only the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2) changes. However, this is incorrect because other equations, such as Faraday's Law (equation 3), would also change in the presence of magnetic monopoles.

- **Option B**: This suggests the circulation of the electric field (equation 3) and the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2) are different. This is correct because both equations would indeed change in a universe with magnetic monopoles: equation 2 would include a magnetic charge density term, and equation 3 would include a magnetic current density term.

- **Option C**: This suggests the circulation of the magnetic field (equation 4) and the flux of the electric field (equation 1) are different. This is incorrect because equation 1 (Gauss's Law for Electricity) remains unchanged, and while equation 4 (Ampère's Law) does change, it is not the primary focus of this modification.

- **Option D**: This suggests the divergence and curl of the magnetic field (equations 2 and 4) are different. While equation 2 does change, equation 4 also changes, but the primary modification is to equation 3 (Faraday's Law), which is not included in this option.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as both the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2) and the circulation of the electric field (equation 3) are modified in a universe with magnetic monopoles.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets can't have isolated poles; they always come in pairs. That's why the magnetic field lines form closed loops, right?

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws in electromagnetism. Let me think about each one:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**: The divergence of E equals the charge density over epsilon zero. Mathematically, ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. I think this one relates to electric fields and charge distribution. If there are isolated charges (like in our universe), this holds. But the question is about magnetic poles, so maybe this equation isn't affected.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**: The divergence of B is zero. So, ∇·B = 0. Oh wait, this law is what enforces that magnetic field lines are always closed loops, no monopoles. So in a universe with isolated poles, this equation must change. Instead of divergence being zero, it would have a term involving magnetic charge density. Like ∇·B = ρ_m (where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density). So this equation would definitely be different.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction**: The curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. So ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This relates changing magnetic fields to electric fields. I don't think this equation would change because it's about how changing B fields induce E fields. Unless there are magnetic charges, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's okay.

4. **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition**: The curl of H equals the current density plus the displacement current. So ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. This has to do with how magnetic fields are created by currents and changing electric fields. Again, I'm not sure this would change unless there's a magnetic current, which isn't part of this equation. Wait, in our universe, Ampère's law doesn't have a term for magnetic current because there are no monopoles. So if magnetic monopoles exist, maybe there's a new term involving magnetic current density? Like, a term for ∂M/∂t or something? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, but the question is about which Maxwell's equations are different. So, which equations would change if there are isolated magnetic poles (magnetic monopoles)?

In our universe, the equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, Gauss's Law for magnetism would change from ∇·B = 0 to ∇·B = ρ_m (where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density). So equation 2 changes.

What about Ampère's Law (equation 4)? In our universe, it's ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). Wait, no, Ampère's law is for H, not B. Let me correct. Ampère's law in terms of B is ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. Wait, but if there are magnetic currents, then perhaps there's an additional term. For example, if you have a magnetic current density K_m, then perhaps Ampère's law would include a term like ∂K_m/∂t or something similar. So equation 4 would change as well.

Wait, so equation 2 (Gauss's Law for B) changes, and equation 4 (Ampère's Law) might also change. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 remains the same, but equation 3 changes. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: in our universe, magnetic monopoles are not observed, so equation 2 has divergence B = 0. If monopoles exist, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where μ_m is some constant. So that equation definitely changes.

What about Faraday's Law? In our case, the curl of E is -dB/dt. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps the equation would change. Wait, Faraday's Law is about how a changing B field induces E fields. So maybe it's unaffected. Because the presence of a magnetic current could affect the time derivative of B, but Faraday's Law would still hold as it's about the induced fields. Or wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps Faraday's Law would acquire a term involving the magnetic current.

Wait, another approach: in a theory with magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations would have to be modified in two places. Let me recall. From what I remember, in such a theory, you'd have:

- Gauss's Law for B becomes ∇·B = ρ_m / ε_0 (or something similar, depending on units)
- Ampère's Law would have a term involving the time derivative of E, or perhaps the divergence of E? Or maybe the curl of B would have an additional term involving the current of magnetic charges.

Wait, no. Let me think. In conventional theory, Ampère's Law is:

∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t.

But if there is a magnetic current, perhaps an additional term appears. For instance, sometimes the modified Ampère's Law would include a term like ∂M/∂t, where M is the magnetic current. But I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, perhaps both the divergence of B and the curl of E would change. Wait, no. Let me think about the four Maxwell equations again.

Wait, Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles would have symmetry with electric and magnetic terms. So:

- The divergence of E is ρ/ε0
- The divergence of B is μ0 ρ_m (or something)
- The curl of E is -∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m (if there's a magnetic current)
- The curl of B is μ0 (ε0 ∂E/∂t + J)

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So Ampère's Law would involve the current due to electric charges (J) and perhaps the displacement current (ε0 ∂E/∂t), and also, if there's a magnetic current, then perhaps another term.

Alternatively, another way: in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations become symmetric. So each of the four equations would have a similar structure as their electric counterparts. So:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε0
2. ∇·B = ρ_m μ0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m
4. ∇×B = μ0 ε0 ∂E/∂t + μ0 J_e

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, in some formulations, the two additional terms are added.

But for the purpose of this question, I think the key is that in a universe with isolated magnetic poles, two of Maxwell's equations change. Which ones?

The original equations (without monopoles) are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε0
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ0 (J + ε0 ∂E/∂t )

So, in the presence of monopoles, equation 2 becomes non-zero, and possibly equation 4 gets another term (like a current of magnetic charges).

Alternatively, maybe equation 3 also changes. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The question is which Maxwell equations are different. The options are:

Option A) The one related to divergence of magnetic field. That would be equation 2. So if that's the only one, but I think there are two.

Option B) The ones related to the circulation of E and divergence of B. So equations 3 and 2.

Wait, equation 3 is the curl of E, which is Faraday's law. So if Faraday's law changes, that's another equation.

Wait, but in our universe, the curl of E is -dB/dt. If there's a magnetic current, would that term change? Suppose there's a magnetic current J_m, then perhaps the equation becomes curl E = - dB/dt - J_m. Or something like that. So equation 3 would change.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Let me think. If a magnetic monopole exists, it would create a magnetic field similar to how an electric charge creates an electric field. So the B field would have sources and sinks, like E fields do.

So, Maxwell's equations would have to be modified so that both E and B fields have sources and sinks. So equation 2 would change (div B = rho_m), and equation 1 would have a term for B as well? No, equation 1 is about E. Wait, maybe equation 1 remains the same.

So, the modified equations would be:

1. ∇·E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. ∇·B = rho_m / epsilon_0  [or some constant]
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m
4. ∇×B = mu_0 (epsilon_0 ∂E/∂t + J_e )

So, equations 2, 3, and 4 would change? Or just 2 and 4?

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the equations would have symmetry with electric and magnetic terms. So equation 2 and equation 1 would have similar forms, and equations 3 and 4 would have similar forms, but with E and B swapped.

So, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = rho_m, similar to equation 1.

Equation 4 would become ∇×B = mu0 (epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_e ), but maybe an additional term if magnetic current exists. Wait, perhaps equation 3 would have a term involving the magnetic current.

Hmm, perhaps in this scenario, equations 2 and 4 change, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the original Maxwell's equations without monopoles are:

1. ∇·E = rho_e / epsilon0
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = mu0 (epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_e )

If you have magnetic monopoles, then:

1. ∇·E = rho_e / epsilon0
2. ∇·B = rho_m / epsilon0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - mu0 J_m
4. ∇×B = mu0 (epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_e ) + mu0 J_m ??? Not sure.

Alternatively, equation 4 would have an extra term like ∂M/∂t, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach. The question says that in this universe, Maxwell's equations look different. Which ones?

The options are:

A) Only the divergence of magnetic field equation (equation 2) is different.

B) The ones related to the circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2) are different.

C) The ones related to the circulation of B (equation 4) and flux of E (equation 1?), but I'm not sure. Flux of E is Gauss's law for E, which would be equation 1.

D) The ones related to divergence and curl of B, which would be equations 2 and 4.

Wait, D says divergence and curl of B. So equation 2 and 4.

In our universe:

Equation 2 is ∇·B = 0.

Equation 4 is ∇×B = mu0 (epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_e )

If in the new universe, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = rho_m / epsilon0, and equation 4 becomes ∇×B = mu0 (epsilon0 ∂E/∂t + J_e ) + something involving J_m (magnetic current), then both equations 2 and 4 would change.

But wait, the question is which equations are different. So the answer would be the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought equation 3 (curl E) might change as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of magnetic monopoles, only equations 2 and 4 change.

Wait, let me think about the symmetry. Without monopoles, E and B are treated asymmetrically. With monopoles, the theory becomes symmetric. So both Gauss's laws (E and B) have sources, and both curl equations have terms involving the other field.

So, in that case, all four equations would have similar forms, but perhaps only equations 2 and 4 would change, or perhaps equations 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps equation 3 (curl E) would also have a term involving the magnetic current.

Wait, in the absence of magnetic monopoles, equation 3 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t.

With monopoles, perhaps it's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current density. So equation 3 would change as well.

So that would mean three equations change: 2,3,4.

But looking at the options, none of them suggest three equations. The options are A, B, C, D, each suggesting one, two, or possibly another.

Wait, the question says "which of those equations are different?" So which Maxwell equations get modified.

Wait, the four equations are:

1. Divergence E: Gauss's law
2. Divergence B: Gauss's law for magnetism
3. Curl E: Faraday's Law
4. Curl B: Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition)

So, in a universe with monopoles, equation 2 would change (div B is non-zero), equation 3 would change (curl E has a J_m term), and equation 4 would have a term for J_m as well, perhaps.

But looking at the options, which pairs of equations change?

Option D says the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equations 2 and 4.

Option B says the ones related to the circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2).

So if equations 2 and 3 change, that would be option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought equation 4 would also change. So maybe the answer is D (equations 2 and 4) or B (equations 2 and 3), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let me think about this carefully. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, how do Maxwell's equations change?

In the standard treatment, when magnetic monopoles are introduced, two of Maxwell's equations are modified. Equation 2 (Gauss's law for B) gains a term for the magnetic charge density, and equation 4 (Ampère's Law) gains a term involving the magnetic current density.

Wait, perhaps equation 4 would have a current term, like J_m. So equation 4 would change from:

∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

to something like:

∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t + J_m )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, some sources say that when magnetic monopoles exist, we have to add terms to both Ampère's and Faraday's laws.

Wait, another approach: the four Maxwell equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles would be:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε0
2. ∇·B = ρ_m / ε0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ0 J_m
4. ∇×B = μ0 (ε0 ∂E/∂t + J_e + J_m )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me look for a source in my mind. I think when magnetic monopoles are present, both Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law have extra terms. So equations 3 and 4 would change, along with equation 2.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe the correct answer is that both equations 2 and 4 change, making option D the correct one. Because in equation 2, the divergence of B isn't zero anymore, and in equation 4, the curl of B now includes a term related to the magnetic current.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 3 (curl E) also changes. So the changed equations would be 2,3,4. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the options given are:

A) Only the divergence of B.

B) Circulation of E and divergence of B.

C) Circulation of B and flux of E.

D) Divergence and curl of B.

So option D: equations 2 and 4. Because equation 2 is divergence of B, equation 4 is curl of B.

In a universe with monopoles, equation 2 changes (div B = rho_m), and equation 4 would have an additional term involving the magnetic current. So that's two equations.

So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If equation 4 is the curl of B, which in our universe is ∇×B = μ0 (J + ε0 ∂E/∂t ). With magnetic currents, perhaps we'd have another term like ∂M/∂t, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations become symmetric. So equation 3 would have a term similar to equation 4.

Wait, in this scenario, equation 3 would have a term involving the magnetic current. So equation 3 would change as well.

But the options don't include an option where three equations change. So perhaps the correct answer is that equations 2 and 3 change, which would be option B.

Wait, but why would equation 3 change? Because equation 3 is about the curl of E. If there's a magnetic current, perhaps it introduces a term in equation 3.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to find the correct answer.

Upon reflection, the key equations that change when magnetic monopoles exist are:

- Gauss's Law for magnetism: equation 2, ∇·B → rho_m
- Faraday's Law: equation 3, ∇×E → -dB/dt - mu0 J_m

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about Faraday's Law. Alternatively, perhaps Ampère's Law (equation 4) would change instead.

Wait, I think in the presence of monopoles, the Faraday's Law (∇×E) would have an additional term involving the magnetic current, and the Ampère's Law (∇×B) would have an additional term involving the electric current or something else.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of it logically.

In our universe, without monopoles:

- ∇·E = rho_e / eps0
- ∇·B = 0
- ∇×E = - dB/dt
- ∇×B = mu0 eps0 dE/dt + mu0 J_e

With monopoles, the first equation remains same, the second equation becomes ∇·B = rho_m / eps0.

The third equation, ∇×E, might get a term involving J_m, the magnetic current.

The fourth equation, ∇×B, might get a term involving J_e, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the fourth equation remains the same.

Wait, I think that when you have magnetic monopoles, the two equations that change are:

2. ∇·B = rho_m
3. ∇×E = - dB/dt - J_m (if J_m is the magnetic current)

So, equations 2 and 3 would change. That's option B.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 changes as well.

Wait, if equation 3 changes, that's the curl of E (Faraday's Law). So option B says the ones related to the circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2) are different.

So the answer is B.

But earlier I thought option D was a possibility. I'm torn between B and D.

Hmm. Let me think about the options again.

The options:

A) Only divergence of B.

B) Circulation of E and divergence of B.

C) Circulation of B and flux of E.

D) Divergence and curl of B.

Hmm. So option D says both equations related to B: divergence and curl.

In the presence of monopoles, equation 2 (div B) changes. What about equation 4 (curl B)?

In our universe, equation 4 is:

∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

With monopoles, perhaps equation 4 becomes:

∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t ) + something involving J_m.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 remains the same, and instead equation 3 changes.

Wait, another approach: in a theory with magnetic monopoles, there's a term added to Faraday's Law and another to Ampère's Law. So equation 3 and 4 change. But equation 2 also changes.

Wait, but according to my knowledge, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the two Maxwell equations that change are Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. So that would be equations 2 and 3. So option B.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. I've read before that in such a scenario, two equations change: the divergence of B and the curl of E. So I think the correct answer is option B.

But wait, what about Ampère's Law? Would that also change? Or is that only the two?

Hmm, perhaps I'm conflating different versions. Wait, another approach: the two Maxwell equations that change are:

∇·B = rho_m

and

∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m

So, equations 2 and 3 change. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but this would mean that the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and only equation 2 changes, making option A correct. But that doesn't make sense because Ampère's Law would also have to account for magnetic currents.

Wait, no. I think that when you have magnetic monopoles, you have to add terms to both Gauss's Law for B and Faraday's Law. So that would be equations 2 and 3.

But looking at the options:

Option B is the ones related to the circulation of E and divergence of B. So equations 3 and 2.

So the answer would be B.

But earlier I thought option D was correct because equations 2 and 4 change. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different way. Let's think about which equations are about B.

Option D says the ones related to divergence and curl of B.

Equation 2 is divergence B.

Equation 4 is curl B.

So if both equations 2 and 4 change, that would be option D.

But why would equation 4 change? Because with magnetic monopoles, maybe Ampère's Law would have an additional term involving magnetic current. Let me think.

In our universe, the Ampère-Maxwell Law is:

∇×B = μ₀ ( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

In a universe with magnetic monopoles, there's a term involving the magnetic current. So perhaps equation 4 becomes:

∇×B = μ₀ ( J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t ) + (some term involving J_m )

So equation 4 would change, in addition to equation 2.

If that's the case, then option D is the correct answer because both divergence and curl of B are modified.

But I'm not 100% certain.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 3 is modified, not equation 4.

I think the confusion arises because in the presence of magnetic monopoles, two Maxwell's equations are modified: Gauss's Law for B (equation 2) and Faraday's Law (equation 3), leading to option B.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: in the standard formulation, when we add magnetic monopoles, the modified Maxwell's equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀
2. ∇·B = ρ_m / ε₀
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - μ₀ J_m
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (ε₀ ∂E/∂t + J_e )

Wait, so in this case, equation 2 and 3 change. So this would correspond to option B, where equations related to the circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2) are different.

So the correct answer is B.

But earlier I thought equation 4 might also change, but perhaps not. Alternatively, equation 4 remains the same.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is D) the ones related to the divergence and curl of B.

Wait, no. Because equation 4 is about the curl of B, but in the scenario with magnetic monopoles, equation 4 might not change. Instead, equation 3 would change.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

If magnetic monopoles exist, the two Maxwell equations that would change are:

- Gauss's Law for B: equation 2.
- Faraday's Law: equation 3.

So the answer would be B.

But I'm still a bit uncertain. Another way: the original Maxwell's equations without monopoles have equation 2 as ∇·B = 0. With monopoles, this becomes ∇·B = rho_m.

Equation 3 is ∇×E = -dB/dt. With monopoles, perhaps it becomes ∇×E = -dB/dt - J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current. So equation 3 changes, and equation 2 changes.

Thus, the answer is B.


In a parallel universe where magnetic monopoles (isolated North or South poles) exist, Maxwell's equations would differ from those in our universe. In our universe, magnetic monopoles are not observed, and the four Maxwell equations are:

1. **Gauss's Law for Electricity**:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}$$  
   This equation relates the divergence of the electric field to the electric charge density and remains unchanged in a universe with magnetic monopoles.

2. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism**:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0$$  
   In our universe, this equation reflects the fact that magnetic field lines are closed loops, and there are no isolated magnetic charges. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would change to:  
   $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \frac{\rho_m}{\epsilon_0}$$  
   where $\rho_m$ is the magnetic charge density.

3. **Faraday's Law of Induction**:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$$  
   In our universe, this equation describes how a time-varying magnetic field induces an electric field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would acquire an additional term involving the magnetic current density $\mathbf{J}_m$, becoming:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} - \mathbf{J}_m$$  

4. **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition**:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left( \mathbf{J}_e + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right)$$  
   This equation describes how a time-varying electric field and electric currents generate a magnetic field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would also change to include a term involving the magnetic current density $\mathbf{J}_m$, becoming:  
   $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left( \mathbf{J}_e + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right) + \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m$$  

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: This suggests only the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2) changes. However, this is incorrect because other equations, such as Faraday's Law (equation 3), would also change in the presence of magnetic monopoles.

- **Option B**: This suggests the circulation of the electric field (equation 3) and the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2) are different. This is correct because both equations would indeed change in a universe with magnetic monopoles: equation 2 would include a magnetic charge density term, and equation 3 would include a magnetic current density term.

- **Option C**: This suggests the circulation of the magnetic field (equation 4) and the flux of the electric field (equation 1) are different. This is incorrect because equation 1 (Gauss's Law for Electricity) remains unchanged, and while equation 4 (Ampère's Law) does change, it is not the primary focus of this modification.

- **Option D**: This suggests the divergence and curl of the magnetic field (equations 2 and 4) are different. While equation 2 does change, equation 4 also changes, but the primary modification is to equation 3 (Faraday's Law), which is not included in this option.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as both the divergence of the magnetic field (equation 2) and the circulation of the electric field (equation 3) are modified in a universe with magnetic monopoles.

Answer: B
