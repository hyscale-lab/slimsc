Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are 1.5 times larger.

The astronomers did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures must be the same too. Because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, but the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Does that affect the observed wavelengths? Oh right! Because of the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, the light gets blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. But in this case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its light isn't shifted. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So does that mean that the intrinsic peak wavelengths are the same, but considering any Doppler shifts?

Hmm, maybe I need to think about this. The observed wavelength would be different if the star is moving. But the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So is this the observed wavelength, or the intrinsic (rest frame) wavelength?

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So I think that refers to the observed wavelengths. So that would imply that the Doppler shifts make their observed λ_max the same.

But wait, that complicates things. Because if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, and Star_1 is stationary, then the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be different from its intrinsic λ_max unless the Doppler shift brings it to the same observed λ_max as Star_1's intrinsic λ_max.

Wait, but the problem states that the observed λ_max are the same. So the Doppler effect for Star_2 must shift its peak wavelength to match that of Star_1's.

Wait, but Star_1's observed λ_max is the same as its intrinsic λ_max because its radial velocity is zero. So Star_2's intrinsic λ_max must be shifted to match that same observed λ_max.

Alternatively, the peak wavelengths they measure are the same, but perhaps the rest wavelengths are different. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that both stars have the same intrinsic temperature. Because the observed λ_max would be affected by their velocities, but the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the same observed λ_max implies that the Doppler shifts have made their intrinsic λ_max adjusted to the same observed value.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me think: 

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ). But wait, the exact formula depends on whether it's moving towards or away. But Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let me assume it's moving away, so v_r is positive. So the observed wavelength would be longer than the rest.

But the problem says that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So for Star_1, λ_max_observed = λ_1_rest. Since Star_1's velocity is zero. For Star_2, λ_max_observed = λ_2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) ) ?

Wait, that can't be right because Star_2's observed λ would be different. So for their observed λ_max to be the same, their rest λ_max must be such that after applying the Doppler shift, they are the same.

So let me set up the equation.

Let T1 be the temperature of Star_1. So λ1_rest = b / T1.

Star_2 has a temperature T2. So λ2_rest = b / T2.

Star_2 has a radial velocity v = 700 km/s. So the observed λ2 is λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), assuming v is positive (moving away).

Wait, but if the observed λ_max for both is same, then:

λ1_rest = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

But λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

So,

b/(T1) = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) )

Hmm, but wait, this would imply that T2 is higher or lower than T1 depending on the direction of motion.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away (v positive), then (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) > 1. So sqrt of that is greater than 1. So 1/T2 = (1/T1) * something greater than 1. That would mean T2 is less than T1. Because 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1, so T2 is smaller.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, which implies that its rest wavelength is shorter (since redshift makes it longer). So if λ2_obs = λ2_rest * (something >1), then λ2_rest must be shorter than λ2_obs.

But λ1_rest equals λ2_obs. So λ2_rest = λ1_rest / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, because λ is inversely proportional to T. So T is proportional to 1/λ.

So if λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ), then T2 = T1 / sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) )

Which is T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So T2 is greater than T1 because v is positive (assuming v is moving away, which would make the denominator smaller, so the ratio greater than 1).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's take actual numbers. Let me compute the Doppler factor.

v = 700 km/s. c is about 3e5 km/s, so v/c is 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333.

So (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.002333, (1 - v/c) ≈ 0.9976667.

So (1.002333)/(0.9976667) ≈ 1.00468.

Taking sqrt of that gives about 1.00234.

So T2 = T1 * 1.00234.

So T2 is slightly higher than T1.

But wait, is this correct? If Star_2 is moving away, its emitted light is redshifted. So the observed λ_max is longer than the rest λ_max. But since both stars have the same observed λ_max, that would mean that Star_2's rest λ_max is shorter than Star_1's.

Wait, because if Star_2 is moving away, its own λ_max is at a shorter wavelength than the observed. So let me think:

Star_2 emits a peak at λ2_rest.

But when moving away, the observed λ2_obs is longer than λ2_rest.

Star_1's observed λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since it's not moving).

So for λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_rest = λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So λ2_rest = λ1_rest / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is λ2_rest = λ1_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Since v is small, this ratio is close to 1. So λ2_rest is slightly smaller than λ1_rest, meaning T2 is slightly higher than T1.

Because T is inversely proportional to λ.

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is approximately 1.00234 * T1.

So that's a small difference in temperature. But I don't know if this affects the luminosity calculation significantly. Let me see.

But the main point is that the temperatures are not the same. Wait, but earlier I thought that the stars have the same temperature because their observed λ_max is same. But that's considering Doppler shift.

Wait, but according to the problem, the observed λ_max are the same. So considering their velocities, their intrinsic temperatures are different. So T1 = T_rest of Star_1, T2 = T_rest of Star_2.

So now, moving on to luminosity.

The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴.

But wait, the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies, so this should be applicable.

So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴.

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

We need to find L1 / L2.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) )

= ( (1.5 R2 )² / R2² ) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴ )

= (2.25) * (T1/T2)^4.

But, from earlier, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, earlier I found T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, the Doppler shift equation:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But since λ_max is inversely proportional to T,

λ_rest = b / T.

So,

λ_obs = (b / T) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But for Star_1, λ_obs = λ_rest, because v=0. So,

λ_obs for Star_1 = λ1_rest = b / T1.

For Star_2, λ2_rest = b / T2.

But λ_obs for Star_2 = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) = λ_obs for Star_1.

So,

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ1_rest is b / T1, and λ2_rest is b / T2.

So,

b/(T1) = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

(T1 / T2) = 1 / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ]²

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ]²

Now, let's compute this.

We have v =700 km/s, c =3e5 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333333.

So,

(1 - v/c) ≈ 0.9976667,

(1 + v/c) ≈ 1.0023333.

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ approximately 0.99534.

Squaring that gives (0.99534)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

But let's compute it more accurately.

Let me calculate (1 - v/c) = 0.9976666667,

(1 + v/c) =1.0023333333.

Divide them: 0.9976666667 / 1.0023333333.

0.9976666667 / 1.0023333333.

Let me compute that:

0.9976666667 ÷ 1.0023333333 ≈ approximately 0.995342.

So, (0.995342)^2 is 0.990701.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990701 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Wait, but wait, no. Because (1-v/c)/(1+v/c) is 0.995342, so when we square it, it's (0.995342)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.227.

Hmm, so approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me check again. Did I miss any steps?

Wait, another approach: compute the ratio (1-v/c)/(1+v/c) and then square it.

v/c =700000 m/s /3e8 m/s = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

Wait, no, earlier I had 700 km/s =7e5 m/s, but 3e5 km/s is 3e8 m/s. So 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, 3e5 km/s is 3e8 m/s.

So 700 / 3e5 = 0.00233333333.

Yes, same as before.

So,

(1 - 0.0023333)/(1 +0.0023333) = (0.9976667)/(1.0023333) ≈ 0.995342.

(0.995342)^2 = (approx) 0.9907.

So,

2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228. So about 2.23.

So the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but is there any other factor that I might have missed? For example, if the Doppler shift affects the observed flux or luminosity in another way? Hmm, the problem states that the luminosities are computed assuming they radiate as black bodies. So I think the approach is correct.

So the answer should be D) ~2.23.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Given Information
- Radius of Star_1 is \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
- Both stars have the same observed wavelength of maximum brightness (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)).
- Radial velocity of Star_1 is \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), and radial velocity of Star_2 is \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

### Step 2: Temperature Relationship
Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \)) and the Doppler shift formula for wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For Star_1 ( stationary, \( v_1 = 0 \)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, rest, 1}}
\]

For Star_2 (moving with \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}} = \lambda_{\text{max, rest, 2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, obs, 2}} \), we equate:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, rest, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, rest, 2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

Using \( \lambda_{\text{max, rest}} \propto 1/T \), we find:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substitute \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \) into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5 R_2)^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

From \( T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \), we find:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}\right)^2
\]

Substitute into the luminosity ratio:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \left(\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}\right)^2
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Calculation
Given \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):

\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Compute:

\[
\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c} = \frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333} \approx 0.995342
\]

\[
\left(\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}\right)^2 \approx (0.995342)^2 \approx 0.9907
\]

Finally:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.227
\]

### Step 5: Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**.
