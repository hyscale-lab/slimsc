Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. It's about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², right? And the question is about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels for a harmonic oscillator are quantized. The formula for energy levels is something like E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is the total quantum number. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh right, in three dimensions, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number, so the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction. Each direction's energy is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for each direction.

So the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, if we write n = n_x + n_y + n_z, then E = (n + 3/2) ħω. Wait, but I think n is the principal quantum number in three dimensions. Or wait, maybe each dimension has its own n, and the total is the sum. So the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...), and the energy depends on their sum.

The question is about the third excited state. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, so that's the first state. The first excited state is the next, and so on. So the third excited state would be the fourth state in terms of energy levels.

Wait, maybe I should figure out the quantum numbers. Let me think: in the three-dimensional isotropic oscillator, the energy levels are equally spaced and are determined by the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. The ground state is when n_x, n_y, n_z are all 0, so n=0. The first excited state is when one of them is 1, others 0: n=1. The second excited state would be when two are 1 and one 0 (n=2), or one is 2 and others 0 (n=2 as well). Wait, no, no. The energy levels are based on the sum n. So for each n, the energy is E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, so the energy levels order is E_0 (ground state), E_1 (first excited), E_2 (second excited), E_3 (third excited), etc. Because n starts at 0. So the third excited state would be n=3.

Wait, but wait, is the ground state considered the zeroth excited state? Sometimes people count the ground state as the first state, but excited states as the higher ones. So the first excited state is n=1, second excited n=2, third excited n=3. So the third excited state is n=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That's one part.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same energy eigenvalue (i.e., for the same n=3). This is about the degeneracy of the energy level. The degeneracy comes from the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z.

So for n=3, how many triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) are there such that n_x + n_y + n_z = 3. Each of n_x, n_y, n_z is ≥0 and integer.

Let me think: the number of solutions is the same as the number of ways to distribute 3 indistinguishable quanta among three dimensions. That's a stars and bars problem. The formula is (n + 3 - 1) choose (3 - 1) ) where n is the sum. So (3 + 2) choose 2 = 5 choose 2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10. So there are 10 eigenfunctions with the same energy.

Looking back at the options:

Option A says (9/2) ħω, 10. That matches our calculation.

Option C says (9/2) ħω, 3. So the number of eigenfunctions would be 3, which doesn't match.

Wait another thing: sometimes in quantum mechanics, especially for angular momentum or other systems, the degeneracy can be calculated differently, but in this case, it's straightforward: it's the number of ways to partition n into three non-negative integers, which is indeed 10 for n=3.

So the correct option should be A.

In a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \), the energy levels are quantized and given by \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number, and \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. The energy levels are equally spaced, and the degeneracy of each level corresponds to the number of ways to distribute the total quantum number \( n \) among the three dimensions.

The third excited state corresponds to \( n = 3 \), as the ground state is \( n = 0 \), the first excited state is \( n = 1 \), the second excited state is \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state is \( n = 3 \). The energy of this state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy of the \( n = 3 \) level is determined by the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( n_x + n_y + n_z = 3 \). This is a combinatorial problem solved using the stars-and-bars method, which gives:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

From the given options:
- Option A correctly states the energy as \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) and the degeneracy as 10.
- Option C incorrectly states the degeneracy as 3, which does not match the calculation.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
