Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their motion can tell us about their masses. Let me try to break this down step by step.

So, the question says there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period here is the time between two primary eclipses. I think the orbital period of the binary system would be the same as the eclipse period because eclipses happen when the stars align in their orbit. So the orbital period P₁ is 2 years for system_1, and P₂ is 1 year for system_2.

Next, the spectroscopic observations give the radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. I think these are the velocities of each star relative to us. Similarly, system_2 has amplitudes of 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Oh wait, right, in a binary system, the more massive star moves slower because it's closer to the center of mass. So the larger velocity amplitude means a smaller mass. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

I remember that the velocity of a star in a binary system is inversely proportional to its mass. So a more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's orbiting a smaller circle. So in system_1, the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5 km/s. So the first star has a larger amplitude, so it's the less massive one. The second has a smaller velocity, so it's more massive.

Wait, but when we talk about the radial velocity semi-amplitude, K, the formula I recall is K = (v) for each star. The mass function relates the velocities and the period to the masses. The mass function is (M2³ sin³i)/( (M1 + M2)² ) ) = ( (4π²/G) ) * (K1³ P) / (1 + M2/M1)² ) ... Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the masses and velocities.

Alternatively, I remember that in a binary system, M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. Because the center of mass requires M1 r1 = M2 r2, and velocities are proportional to r. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, yes, that's right. Because in a binary, the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So M1 / M2 = K2 / K1.

So for system_1, K1 is 10 km/s, K2 is 5 km/s. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. M1 * K1 = M2 * K2 → M1/M2 = K2/K1. Yes, right.

So in system_1: M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5 M2. Wait, but that would mean M2 is twice as massive as M1. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2. Hmm.

In system_2, K1 is 15 km/s, K2 is 10 km/s. So M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So M1 = (2/3) M2, where M2 is the mass of the second star in system_2.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, which star is which? Let me clarify. Let me define for each system: M1 and M2 are the two stars. So in system_2, the first star has K1=15, second K2=10.

So for system_2, M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M1 = (2/3) M2. So the total mass for system_2 is M1 + M2 = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

But wait, I'm getting confused because M2 here refers to each system's own components. So I should treat each system separately. Let me try to express the total mass for each system.

For system_1:
K1 = 10, K2 =5.
M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5 M2_1, where the subscript 1 denotes system_1's components.

So M_total_1 = M1 + M2_1 = 0.5 M2_1 + M2_1 = 1.5 M2_1.

But how does this relate to the period? Oh, right, Kepler's third law. The period of the binary system relates to the total mass.

The formula is P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ * (a1 + a2)³ (M1 + M2) → but I think in terms of the reduced mass and the period, or maybe using the velocity amplitudes.

Alternatively, the formula that relates the period, the velocity amplitudes, and the masses. Let me think about the formula for the total mass.

Another approach: using the formula for the mass function, which is:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P ) / (2π G) ) ) * ( (1 + M1/M2 )^2 )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think about the formula that relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses and the period.

I think the formula for each K is K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_total^(-1/3)) * (P^(-1/3)) * (M_secondary^(-2/3)) / (1 + M_primary/M_secondary)^(something). Hmm, perhaps it's better to use the following relation:

K1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can use the fact that for each system, the ratio of the velocities gives the inverse ratio of the masses, and then find the total mass.

Let me think: for a binary system, the mass function is f(M) = (M2³ sin³i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (K1³ P) / (2π G) )

But since we don't know the inclination i, and it's the same for both systems (but the problem doesn't say that), perhaps we can ignore it because it's a factor common to both.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that the periods are calculated as the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. So I think that implies that the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So perhaps we can take sin i ≈1. So the mass function becomes f(M) = (M2³) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (K1³ P) / (2 π G) )

But perhaps more straightforwardly, using the fact that for each system, the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So for system_1: M1 = (K2/K1) * M2 → M1 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2. So M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system_2: M1 = (10/15) M2 → M1 = (2/3) M2. So M_total_2 = M1 + M2 = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but that would mean M_total_1 is 1.5 M2 and M_total_2 is (5/3) M2. Wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting confused with the variables. Let me clarify.

In system_1, the two stars have velocities K1=10 and K2=5. So M1 = (K2/K1) * M2 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2. So M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

In system_2, K1=15, K2=10 → M1 = (10/15) M2 = (2/3) M2. So M_total_2 = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if M2 is the mass of the second star in system_2, then M_total_2 would be (5/3) M2, but how does that relate to the period?

Wait, maybe I should express the total mass in terms of the period and the velocity amplitudes. Because the period is given for each system.

I remember that the formula for the total mass of a binary system is given by Kepler's third law in terms of the orbital period and the velocities. Let me try to recall the formula.

The formula should relate the period P, the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2, and the total mass M = M1 + M2.

Wait, another approach: the centripetal force is provided by gravity. So for each star, M1 * (4 π² a1) / P² = G (M1 M2) / (a1 + a2)^2 ), where a1 and a2 are the orbital radii. Since a1 + a2 = a (the separation), and a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a, a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a.

Alternatively, combining the equations, perhaps we can find a relation between the velocities and the masses.

The velocity of each star is v1 = 2 π a1 / P, v2 = 2 π a2 / P.

But since a1 + a2 = a, and a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a.

So v1 = 2 π (M2 a) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

v2 = 2 π (M1 a) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

But from Kepler's third law, a³ / P² = G (M1 + M2) / (4 π² )

So a³ = G (M1 + M2) P² / (4 π² )

Plugging this into v1:

v1 = 2 π (M2 a ) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

But a = [ G (M1+M2) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting a into v1:

v1 = 2 π M2 / ( (M1 + M2) P ) * [ G (M1+M2) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me simplify this expression:

Let me compute each part.

The numerator inside the cube root is G (M1+M2) P².

So [ ... ]^(1/3) = [ G (M1+M2) P² / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

So v1 = 2 π M2 / [ (M1 + M2) P ] * [ G (M1+M2) P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Let me factor this out:

= 2 π M2 [ G (M1+M2) P² ]^(1/3) / [ (M1 + M2) P (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify the denominator:

(M1 + M2) P * (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Let me express this as:

= [2 π M2 ] / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] * [ G (M1+M2) P² ]^(1/3) / [ (M1 + M2) P ]

Hmm, maybe it's better to express in terms of K (velocity amplitude).

Wait, perhaps a better approach: express the velocity amplitude K in terms of the total mass and period.

I found a formula online once that K1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M2) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M1) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So K1 = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) / P^(1/3) ) * ( M2 ) / ( M_total^(2/3) )

Which can be written as K1 = ( (2 π G ) / P )^(1/3) * ( M2 ) / M_total^(2/3 )

Similarly for K2.

But since K2 = ( M1 / M_total )^(1) * ( K1 * M_total / M2 )

Wait, perhaps I can write the ratio of K1 and K2.

From the velocity ratio: K1 / K2 = M2 / M1.

Which we already established earlier.

But perhaps I can find the mass of each system in terms of K and P.

Wait, let's see. Let me try to express M_total in terms of K and P.

From the formula for K1:

K1 = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M2 ) / ( M_total^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

Let me cube both sides:

K1³ = [ (2 π G )^(1) ] * ( M2³ ) / ( M_total² ) ) * ( 1 / P )

Rearranging:

M_total² = ( (2 π G ) M2³ ) / ( K1³ P )

But M_total = M1 + M2 = M2 (1 + M1/M2 )

Hmm, perhaps this is getting complicated. Maybe I can find the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

Let me denote:

For system_1:

P1 = 2 years.

K1_1 =10, K2_1=5. So K1_1/K2_1 = 2 → M1_1/M2_1 = 0.5.

So M1_1 = 0.5 M2_1.

M_total1 = 0.5 M2_1 + M2_1 = 1.5 M2_1.

For system_2:

P2=1 year.

K1_2=15, K2_2=10. So K1_2/K2_2=1.5 → M1_2/M2_2=2/3.

So M1_2 = (2/3) M2_2.

M_total2 = (2/3 M2_2) + M2_2 = (5/3) M2_2.

Now, I need to find the relation between M_total1 and M_total2.

But how does the period factor in?

Looking back, perhaps the mass function can help. For each system, the mass function is:

f(M) = (K1^3 * P) / (2 π G) ) = ( M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Assuming i=90 degrees (eclipsing binaries are likely edge-on), sin i=1.

So for system_1:

f1 = (10^3 * 2) / (2 π G) ) = ( (M2_1)^3 ) / ( (M_total1)^2 )

Similarly, for system_2:

f2 = (15^3 * 1) / (2 π G) ) = ( (M2_2)^3 ) / ( (M_total2)^2 )

Divide f1 by f2:

f1/f2 = [ (10^3 * 2) ] / [15^3 * 1) ] = [ (1000 * 2) ] / [3375 * 1) ] = 2000 / 3375 = 400/675 = 80/135 = 16/27 ≈ 0.5926.

But f1/f2 = [ (M2_1^3 / M_total1^2) ) ] / [ (M2_2^3 / M_total2^2) ) ]

= (M2_1^3 M_total2^2) ) / (M2_2^3 M_total1^2 )

Hmm, but I don't know M2_1 or M2_2. But I can express M_total1 and M_total2 in terms of M2_1 and M2_2.

From earlier:

M_total1 = 1.5 M2_1 → M2_1 = M_total1 / 1.5.

M_total2 = (5/3) M2_2 → M2_2 = (3/5) M_total2.

Plugging into the ratio:

(M2_1^3 * M_total2^2) / ( M2_2^3 * M_total1^2 )

= [ ( (M_total1 / 1.5 )^3 ) * ( M_total2^2 ) ] / [ ( (3/5 M_total2 )^3 ) * ( M_total1^2 ) ) ]

Let me compute each part:

Numerator: (M_total1^3 / (1.5)^3 ) * M_total2^2.

Denominator: ( (3/5)^3 M_total2^3 ) * M_total1^2.

So the ratio becomes:

[ (M_total1^3 * M_total2^2) / (3.375) ) ] / [ ( (27/125) M_total2^3 * M_total1^2 ) ) ]

= [ (M_total1^3 M_total2^2) / 3.375 ] * [ 125 / (27 M_total2^3 M_total1^2) ) ]

Simplify:

= (125 / (3.375 * 27 )) ) * ( M_total1^(3-2) ) * ( M_total2^(2-3) )

= (125 / (91.125 )) ) * ( M_total1 ) * ( 1 / M_total2 )

So f1/f2 = (125 /91.125 ) * ( M_total1 / M_total2 )

But earlier, we found that f1/f2 ≈ 0.5926.

So,

0.5926 ≈ (125 /91.125 ) * ( M_total1 / M_total2 )

Compute 125 /91.125 ≈1.3717.

So,

0.5926 ≈ 1.3717 * ( M_total1 / M_total2 )

→ M_total1 / M_total2 ≈ 0.5926 / 1.3717 ≈ 0.432.

Wait, so the total mass of system_1 is about 0.432 times the mass of system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2. But the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, that would be 0.432, meaning system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_2 is more massive.

Wait, but the options given are about system_1 being more massive than system_2. But according to this calculation, system_1 is less massive.

Wait, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

Wait, but according to this, system_1 is about 0.43 times the mass of system_2. So system_1 is less massive. The question says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if system_1 is less massive, then the factor would be less than 1. So the answer would be approximately 0.4 times, which is option A.

But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, wait. Did I make a mistake in the ratio of f1/f2? Let me recalculate.

f1/f2 = (16/27) ≈ 0.5926.

And in the equation,

f1/f2 = (125/( 3.375 * 27 )) ) * (M_total1 / M_total2 )

Wait, wait. Let me re-express the ratio.

Wait, the denominator in the numerator part is 3.375 (which is 1.5^3 = 3.375), correct.

Denominator in that part is (3/5)^3 = 27/125 = 0.216.

But in the denominator of the overall expression, it's (3/5)^3 * M_total2^3 * M_total1^2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me redo it.

We have:

f1/f2 = [ (M2_1^3 / M_total1^2 ) ] / [ (M2_2^3 / M_total2^2 ) ]

Express M2_1 as (M_total1)/1.5, since M_total1 =1.5 M2_1 → M2_1 = M_total1 / 1.5.

Similarly, M2_2 = (3/5) M_total2.

So,

[ ( (M_total1/1.5)^3 ) / (M_total1^2) ) ] / [ ( ( (3/5 M_total2 )^3 ) / ( M_total2^2 ) ) ]

Simplify numerator part: (M_total1^3 / (1.5^3 )) ) / (M_total1^2 ) = M_total1 / (3.375 )

Denominator part: ( (27 M_total2^3 )/(125) ) / ( M_total2^2 ) ) = (27 M_total2 ) / 125.

So the entire ratio becomes [ (M_total1 /3.375 ) ] / [ (27 M_total2 ) / 125 ) ] = (M_total1 /3.375 ) * (125 / (27 M_total2 )) )

Which is (125 / (3.375 *27 )) ) * (M_total1 / M_total2 )

Compute 3.375 *27: 3.375 * 27 = 91.125.

So 125 / 91.125 ≈ 1.3717.

So,

f1/f2 = 1.3717 * ( M_total1 / M_total2 )

But earlier, f1/f2 = 16/27 ≈ 0.5926.

So,

M_total1 / M_total2 = (0.5926) / 1.3717 ≈ 0.432.

So M_total1 ≈ 0.432 * M_total2.

So system_1's total mass is about 0.43 times that of system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43.

But the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Since 0.43 is less than 1, system_1 is less massive. But the options don't have a negative, only options like 0.4, 0.6, etc.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in which system is which. Let me think again.

The question says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system 2."

If system_1 is 0.43 times the mass of system_2, then system_1 is less massive. So the factor would be 0.43. But the options have A) ~0.4, which is close.

Wait, but wait another point. Let me think about the mass functions again. Because the mass function f(M) depends on sin³i, but in our case, since both systems are eclipsing, their inclinations are close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈1. So the assumption holds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relation between the velocities and the masses more directly, and then use Kepler's third law to relate the periods and masses.

Wait, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M2 ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

So for each system, we can write K1 and K2 in terms of their masses and periods.

But for each system, we have two equations (for K1 and K2), which relate to the same M1 and M2 for that system.

But perhaps I can write the ratio for each system and then find the total mass ratio.

For system_1:

K1_1 =10, K2_1=5.

From earlier, M1_1 =0.5 M2_1, M_total1=1.5 M2_1.

So K1_1 = (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2_1 / ( (1.5 M2_1 )^(2/3) ) * (1 / (2)^(1/3) )

Simplify:

= (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2_1 / ( (1.5^(2/3) ) * M2_1^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / 2^(1/3) )

= (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2_1^(1 - 2/3) / ( 1.5^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) )

= (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2_1^(1/3) / ( (1.5^2 * 2 )^(1/3) )

= ( (2 π G ) * M2_1 ) / ( ( (1.5^2)*2 ) )^(1/3) * (1/3) )

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to compute the ratio for each system and then compare.

Compute K1^3 * P for each system and relate it to the mass.

For system_1:

K1^3 * P = (10)^3 * 2 = 1000 * 2 =2000.

For system_2:

K1^3 * P = (15)^3 * 1 = 3375.

Now, using the mass function equation:

f(M) = (K1^3 * P ) / (2 π G ) = ( M2^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

For system_1, f1 = 2000/(2 π G )

f1 = (M2_1^3) / ( (M_total1)^2 )

Similarly, system_2: f2 = 3375/(2 π G )

f2 = (M2_2^3 ) / ( (M_total2 )^2 )

Now, take the ratio f1/f2:

(2000 / (2 π G )) / (3375 / (2 π G )) ) = (2000/3375) = 16/27 ≈0.5926.

Which is the same as before.

So,

f1/f2 = ( M2_1^3 / M_total1^2 ) / ( M2_2^3 / M_total2^2 )

We can express M_total1 = 1.5 M2_1 → M2_1 = M_total1 / 1.5.

Similarly, M_total2 = (5/3) M2_2 → M2_2 = (3/5) M_total2.

Substituting:

f1/f2 = [ ( (M_total1/1.5 )^3 ) / ( M_total1^2 ) ) ] / [ ( ( 3 M_total2/(5) )^3 ) / ( M_total2^2 ) ) ]

Simplify numerator:

( M_total1^3 / (1.5^3) ) / M_total1^2 = M_total1 / (3.375 )

Denominator:

( (27 M_total2^3 ) / (125) ) / M_total2^2 = (27 M_total2 ) / 125.

So,

f1/f2 = [ M_total1/(3.375) ) ] / [ (27 M_total2 )/(125) ) ] = [ M_total1 * 125 ) ] / [3.375 *27 M_total2 ].

Compute denominator: 3.375 *27 = 91.125.

So,

f1/f2 = (125 M_total1 ) / (91.125 M_total2 ) ) = (125/91.125) * (M_total1/M_total2 )

Which is:

≈ (1.3717 ) * ( M_total1 / M_total2 )

We know f1/f2 ≈0.5926.

So,

1.3717 * ( M_total1 / M_total2 ) =0.5926 → M_total1/M_total2 ≈ 0.5926 /1.3717 ≈0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

But the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? So the factor is 0.43, which is approximately 0.4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes, masses, and orbital periods in binary systems.

### Key Observations:
1. **System Properties**:
   - **System_1**: Orbital period \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \), radial velocity amplitudes \( K_{1,1} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \), \( K_{2,1} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \).
   - **System_2**: Orbital period \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \), radial velocity amplitudes \( K_{1,2} = 15 \, \text{km/s} \), \( K_{2,2} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \).

2. **Mass Ratio**:
   In a binary system, the mass ratio \( M_1/M_2 \) is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitudes:  
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{K_2}{K_1}.
   \]
   - For **System_1**:  
     \[
     \frac{M_{1,1}}{M_{2,1}} = \frac{K_{2,1}}{K_{1,1}} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5.
     \]
     Thus, \( M_{1,1} = 0.5 \, M_{2,1} \), and the total mass of system_1 is:  
     \[
     M_{\text{total,1}} = M_{1,1} + M_{2,1} = 0.5 \, M_{2,1} + M_{2,1} = 1.5 \, M_{2,1}.
     \]

   - For **System_2**:  
     \[
     \frac{M_{1,2}}{M_{2,2}} = \frac{K_{2,2}}{K_{1,2}} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}.
     \]
     Thus, \( M_{1,2} = \frac{2}{3} \, M_{2,2} \), and the total mass of system_2 is:  
     \[
     M_{\text{total,2}} = M_{1,2} + M_{2,2} = \frac{2}{3} \, M_{2,2} + M_{2,2} = \frac{5}{3} \, M_{2,2}.
     \]

3. **Mass Function**:
   The mass function relates the radial velocity amplitudes and orbital period to the total mass of the system:
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{(K_1^3 P)}{2 \pi G} = \frac{M_2^3}{(M_1 + M_2)^2}.
   \]
   For both systems, assuming edge-on orbits (\( \sin i \approx 1 \)), the ratio of the mass functions is:
   \[
   \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{K_{1,1}^3 P_1}{K_{1,2}^3 P_2}.
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{(10)^3 \cdot 2}{(15)^3 \cdot 1} = \frac{2000}{3375} = \frac{16}{27} \approx 0.5926.
   \]

4. **Total Mass Ratio**:
   Using the relationship between the mass functions and total masses:
   \[
   \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{M_{2,1}^3 / M_{\text{total,1}}^2}{M_{2,2}^3 / M_{\text{total,2}}^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \( M_{\text{total,1}} = 1.5 \, M_{2,1} \) and \( M_{\text{total,2}} = \frac{5}{3} \, M_{2,2} \), the ratio simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{(M_{2,1}^3 / (1.5^2 \, M_{2,1}^2))}{(M_{2,2}^3 / (\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 \, M_{2,2}^2))}.
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{M_{2,1} / 3.375}{M_{2,2} / 4.1667}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \frac{f_1}{f_2} \approx 0.5926 \), solving for \( M_{\text{total,1}} / M_{\text{total,2}} \):
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{0.5926}{1.3717} \approx 0.432.
   \]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately **0.43 times** as massive as system_2. Thus, system_1 is **less massive** than system_2 by a factor of ~0.4.
