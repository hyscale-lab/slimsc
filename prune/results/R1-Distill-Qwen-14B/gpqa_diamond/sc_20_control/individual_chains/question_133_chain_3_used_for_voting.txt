Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of equilibrium problems. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, I think. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Each is 1.00 grams in a 200.00 cm³ solution. The temperature is 25°C, which I guess is room temperature.

First, I need to recall what these salts dissociate into. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, I believe it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its dissociation would give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, right?

Wait, but phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. Since we're dealing with a solution that contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, this must be related to the buffer solution. The phosphate buffer system, maybe?

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The given Ka values are Ka1 (7.5e-3), Ka2 (6.2e-8), and Ka3 (1.8e-12). So, the first dissociation is H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-; the second is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-; the third is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

But in this problem, we're interested in the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but sometimes people refer to PO4^3- as orthophosphate. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Let me think: orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. Its conjugate bases are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. So, PO4^3- is the most deprotonated form.

But in a solution containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which form is predominant? It depends on the pH of the solution. Since we're using a buffer here, the pH is determined by the pKa values.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate usually refers to PO4^3-, the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. So we're looking for [PO4^3-] in solution.

But how do I find that? Well, since the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- salts, respectively, this is a buffer solution. So, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and then find the concentration of PO4^3- from there.

Wait, but wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch is for when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Here, H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. The relevant pKa would be the second one, since that's the one governing the H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- equilibrium. The second Ka is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) which is about log(1.6129e7) → around 7.208.

Wait, pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8))? No, wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]), where A- is HPO4^2- and HA is H2PO4^-.

But wait, no. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So, [base] is HPO4^2- and [acid] is H2PO4^-.

Now, the solution has 1.00 g of each salt. So I need to find the moles of each.

First, calculate moles of KH2PO4. Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00735 moles.

Same for Na2HPO4·2H2O. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005606 moles.

Wait, but wait. Na2HPO4·2H2O: each mole of this gives one mole of HPO4^2-, right? Because Na2HPO4 is Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4, and the concentration of HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4·2H2O.

So, moles H2PO4^- = 0.00735 mol.

Moles HPO4^2- = 0.005606 mol.

Wait, volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 liters.

So concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005606 / 0.2 = 0.02803 M.

So, plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pH = 7.208 + log(0.02803 / 0.03675)

Calculating the ratio: 0.02803 / 0.03675 ≈ 0.763.

log(0.763) is about -0.117.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.117 = 7.091.

Now, to find [PO4^3-], which is the concentration of the third deprotonated form. That comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-:

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this reaction is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. So, the equilibrium expression is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But wait, [H+] can be found using the pH we calculated earlier. pH is 7.091, so [H+] = 10^-7.091 ≈ 8.28e-8 M.

So, plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02803 M.

[H+] is 8.28e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / (8.28e-8) 

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 ≈ 5.0454e-14.

Denominator: 8.28e-8.

So, 5.0454e-14 / 8.28e-8 = approximately 6.09e-7 M.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait 1.8 * 0.02803 is 0.050454, so 5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.28e-8:

5.0454e-14 / 8.28e-8 = (5.0454 / 8.28) * 1e-6.

5.0454 / 8.28 ≈ 0.609.

So 0.609e-6 = 6.09e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option D is 3.97e-7. So my calculation is giving me approximately 6.09e-7, which is close to 6.24e-7 (option A). But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait let me check the [H+] calculation again.

pH =7.091. So [H+] = 10^(-7.091). Let me compute 10^-7.091.

7.091 is the same as 7 + 0.091. So 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.091).

10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.091) ≈ 0.828 (since log(0.828)= -0.082, close enough). So [H+] ≈ 8.28e-8, which matches my earlier calculation.

Then, the [PO4^3-] calculation is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial concentrations from the salts: when you dissolve Na2HPO4·2H2O, you get 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and 2 H2O. Does the water of crystallization affect the amount of HPO4^2-? No, because the moles of HPO4^2- are based on the formula. So 1 mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 1 mole HPO4^2- and 2 moles Na+.

So the moles I calculated are correct.

Hmm, but wait another thing. The solution volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. So the concentrations from each are correct.

Wait, but what about the initial dissociation of H2PO4^-? Because H2PO4^- can also deprotonate to form HPO4^2- or even PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps the initial buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the presence of H2PO4^- can further dissociate, affecting the [PO4^3-]. Oh wait, but this is a polyprotic system, so I might need to consider all the equilibria. But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So I think the approach I took is correct: using the third dissociation step, because HPO4^2- is the source of PO4^3-.

So, another way to think: the phosphate species in solution will be a mixture of H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- depending on pH.

But when the pH is around 7, which is the case here (pH ~7.09), the major species should be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. PO4^3- would be minimal, but present.

So, using the Ka3, which is 1.8e-12, and the HPO4^2- concentration, and [H+], I can find the [PO4^3-].

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- into PO4^3- and H+.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is more complex because H2PO4^- can also contribute to the formation of PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps the total phosphate species can be considered using all three dissociation steps. But that might complicate things a lot. Let's think.

The total phosphate concentration is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But in this solution, H3PO4 is negligible because it's a weak acid and the pH is around 7. So the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the solution, we have 0.03675 M H2PO4^- and 0.02803 M HPO4^2-.

So the total phosphate from these two would be approximately 0.06478 M, but considering the possibility of some of the H2PO4^- dissociating further into HPO4^2- and some HPO4^2- dissociating into PO4^3-.

Hmm, but our initial approach with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gave pH ≈7.09, which is in the range where H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the major species.

So, to find [PO4^3-], which is from the third dissociation step.

Wait, but how much of HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-? It's a very small amount because Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2.

So, perhaps the contribution from HPO4^2- to PO4^3- is minimal, but in the problem, it's what we need to find.

So, let's proceed with the calculation as I did earlier.

So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02803 M

[H+] = 8.28e-8

So,

(1.8e-12 * 0.02803 ) / (8.28e-8) = ?

1.8 * 0.02803 = 0.050454 → 5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.28e-8 → 5.0454e-14 / 8.28e-8 = approx 6.093e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is close to 6.09e-7. But perhaps I made a rounding error.

Let me compute more accurately.

First, calculate [HPO4^2-] * Ka3:

0.02803 * 1.8e-12 = ?

0.02803 * 1.8 = 0.050454 → 5.0454e-14.

Then, [H+] is 10^(-7.091) → let's compute that precisely.

pH =7.091 → [H+] = 1.0 × 10^-7.091.

Log(8.28) is about 0.9175, so 10^-0.091 is about 0.828 (as before).

So [H+] =8.28e-8.

So,

5.0454e-14 / 8.28e-8 = (5.0454 / 8.28) * 1e-6.

5.0454 / 8.28 ≈ 0.6089.

So 0.6089e-6 = 6.089e-7 M.

Hmm, option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher. Did I perhaps miscalculate the pH?

Wait, let's recheck the pH calculation. Earlier steps.

Moles of H2PO4^-: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.007353 mol.

Moles of HPO4^2-: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005606 mol.

Concentration in 0.2 L:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007353 / 0.2 = 0.03676 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005606 / 0.2 = 0.02803 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) → let's compute that precisely.

6.2e-8 → log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so pKa2 is 7.2076.

Now, the ratio is 0.02803 / 0.03676 = 0.763.

log(0.763) → let's compute that more accurately.

Log(0.763) = log(7.63e-1) = log(7.63) -1.

Log(7.63) is approx 0.8835.

So, 0.8835 - 1 = -0.1165.

So, pH = 7.2076 - 0.1165 = 7.0911.

Which is the same as before. So [H+] is 8.28e-8.

So the previous calculation is correct. So [PO4^3-] is approximately 6.09e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

So my answer would be near 6.09e-7, but the closest option is A) 6.24e-7. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem arises from the initial assumption that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02803 M. But wait, when you add both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the solution might contain some additional H+ from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, perhaps the initial buffer calculation (Henderson-Hasselbalch) is correct, but when considering the third dissociation, I should also account for the fact that some H2PO4^- could dissociate further, contributing to [HPO4^2-] and [H+]. But given that Ka2 is 6.2e-8 and Ka3 is 1.8e-12, the contribution from H2PO4^- to PO4^3- would be negligible. So perhaps the initial approach is sufficient.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the third dissociation equilibrium.

So, the reaction is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Which is what I did earlier. So I think I didn't make a mistake there.

So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 6.09e-7, but the option is A) 6.24e-7. Hmm, but maybe I miscalculated something else.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] more accurately.

Wait, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 → approx 0.007353 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = 1 /177.99 → approx 0.005606 mol.

But wait, wait a minute. The salt Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, provides one mole of HPO4^2- per mole of the salt. So the moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005606 mol.

But when you add these two, the total solution volume is 0.2 L, so their concentrations are 0.03676 M and 0.02803 M respectively.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact ratio in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02803 / 0.03676.

0.02803 / 0.03676 = 0.763.

So log(0.763) = -0.116.

So pH =7.2076 -0.116 =7.0916.

Which gives [H+] = 1e-7.0916 ≈ 7.76e-8? Wait, earlier I thought it was 8.28e-8. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the [H+] calculation.

Wait, wait, 10^-7.0916 is 10^(-7 -0.0916) )= 1e-7 * 10^(-0.0916).

What's 10^(-0.0916)? Let's calculate that more accurately.

Log(0.828) is around -0.083, so 10^(-0.0916) is approximately 0.813 (since log(0.813)= approx -0.090).

Wait, let me compute 10^(-0.0916):

We know that ln(10) ≈2.3026.

So, 0.0916 * ln(10) ≈0.0916 *2.3026 ≈0.211.

So, e^-0.211 ≈ 0.810.

But wait, 10^x = e^(x * ln(10)).

So 10^(-0.0916) = e^(-0.0916 * ln(10)).

ln(10)=2.302585.

So, 0.0916 *2.302585≈0.211.

So e^-0.211 ≈ 0.809.

Wait, 10^(-0.0916)= e^(-0.211) ≈ 0.809.

So [H+] = 1e-7 *0.809 ≈8.09e-8.

Wait, earlier I estimated [H+] as 8.28e-8 but perhaps it's about 8.09e-8. So that's a minor difference.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02803) / (8.09e-8) = ?

So 1.8e-12 * 0.02803 = 5.0454e-14.

Divide by 8.09e-8:

5.0454e-14 / 8.09e-8 = (5.0454 /8.09) * 1e-6.

5.0454/8.09 ≈0.624.

So 0.624e-6 = 6.24e-7 M.

Ah! So that's option A, 6.24e-7 M.

Wait, so I think I initially made a mistake in the [H+] calculation, but upon more precise calculation, it comes out to 6.24e-7, which matches option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the given buffer system. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol) in a 200.00 cm³ solution. The dissociation of these salts provides H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻ ions, respectively, forming a buffer system governed by the second dissociation constant of phosphoric acid, \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \), with \( \text{pKa}_2 = 7.208 \).

### Step 1: Calculate moles and concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00735 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005606 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Concentrations in 0.2 L:  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.00735}{0.2} \approx 0.03675 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005606}{0.2} \approx 0.02803 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 2: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the buffer system is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right).
\]
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log \left( \frac{0.02803}{0.03675} \right).
\]
The ratio \( \frac{0.02803}{0.03675} \approx 0.763 \), and \( \log(0.763) \approx -0.116 \). Thus:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.116 = 7.092.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation equilibrium
The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]
The equilibrium expression is:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]
From \( \text{pH} = 7.092 \), \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.09 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \). Substituting the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02803)}{8.09 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
1.8 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 0.02803 \approx 5.0454 \times 10^{-14}.
\]
Then divide by \( 8.09 \times 10^{-8} \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0454 \times 10^{-14}}{8.09 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).
