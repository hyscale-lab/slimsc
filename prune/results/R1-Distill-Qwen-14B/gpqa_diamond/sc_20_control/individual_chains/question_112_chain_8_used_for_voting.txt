Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So the question is about an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I'm told that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix elements Aij are given. Specifically, Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state of a system can be expressed in terms of basis states. Here, the basis is |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of S_z, the z-component of spin. So |alpha> is a linear combination of these states.

But wait, the state is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I think I should normalize this state because the coefficients might not be normalized yet. To find the probabilities, I need the state to be a unit vector.

So the state is |alpha> = a(1+i)|up> + a(2-i)|down>, where a is a normalization constant. I'll compute the normalization factor a by making sure that the inner product of |alpha> with itself is 1.

The inner product would be |a|^2 times [(1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i)], because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. Let me compute that.

First, (1+i)(1-i) is 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Second, (2 - i)(2 + i) is 4 + 2i -2i -i^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.

So the total is 2 + 5 =7. So |a|^2 *7 =1 → |a|=1/sqrt(7). So a = 1/sqrt(7), but since a is a scalar, it could be positive or negative, but since it's a proportionality constant, the actual phase doesn't matter. So the state becomes |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the next part is about another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, but that's for a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, right? So the matrix has zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 everywhere else.

Wait, so the matrix A would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ].

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the operator's matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So yes, that's the matrix I wrote.

But wait, what's the significance of this operator? Oh, wait, perhaps this operator is the spin-x operator scaled by some factor. Because I remember that the Pauli matrices have certain structures. Let me think: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if our operator A is hbar/2 times X, then A would be [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]. So that's exactly the matrix we have here. So operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of operator A would be the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. They are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the question is, when we measure operator A (which is proportional to sigma_x), what is the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, and what's the expectation value of A?

Wait, but wait. The possible outcomes of measuring operator A are the eigenvalues of A. Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), i.e., hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the problem as follows: The probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues of A correspond to the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. So if I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A, then the coefficients squared give the probabilities.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of operator A. Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are given by:

|+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2),
|-x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I think |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or is it the other way around? Let me confirm. The sigma_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so its eigenvalues are +1 and -1. The eigenvectors for +1 would satisfy sigma_x |+x> = |+x>. Let me compute that.

If |+x> is (a, b), then sigma_x |+x> = (b, a). For this to equal |+x>, we have a = b. So a non-normalized vector is (1,1), so |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for the eigenvalue -1, sigma_x |-x> = (-1)|-x>. So for |-x>, we have sigma_x |-x> = (b, a) = - (a, b). So (b, a) = (-a, -b). Therefore, a = -b. So the vector is (1, -1), so |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So now, the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, and I need to express it in terms of |+x> and |-x>, because the possible outcomes when measuring A are the eigenvalues corresponding to these states.

So let me write |alpha> as a sum of |+x> and |-x>. Let's denote |alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>, then the probabilities will be |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Wait, but I can also compute c1 and c2 by taking the inner product of |alpha> with each of the eigenstates.

So |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So let me compute c1 = < +x | alpha >.

Wait, no, wait: the coefficients c1 and c2 would be the inner products of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>, respectively.

So c1 = < +x | alpha >.

Expressed as (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by the components of |alpha>.

Given that |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>, the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ].

Let me compute that:

c1 = (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) * [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] 

Simplify the numerator: 1 + i + 2 - i = 3. So c1 = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, wait, 1+2 is 3, and i -i is zero. So the numerator is 3. So c1 = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c2 is < -x | alpha >, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ].

So let's compute that:

c2 = (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14)) ) [ 1 + i - 2 + i ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (-1) + 2i ]

So now, the probabilities are |c1|^2 and |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857.

Compute |c2|^2: [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ] squared.

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357143.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36).

But wait, let me check the calculation for c2 again. Did I compute that correctly?

c2 is < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ 1 + i -2 + i ]

= (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (-1) + 2i ]

So yes, the numerator is (-1 + 2i), so the magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) =1+4=5. So 5/14.

Wait, so the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Now, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36.

So the first two probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha>.

Alternatively, the expectation value can be calculated as (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x.

But another approach is to compute <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

So, A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> can be written as a column vector:

[ (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

So |alpha> is a vector [a; b], where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2−i)/sqrt(7).

Then, A|alpha> is:

[ 0*a + (hbar/2)*b,
  (hbar/2)*a + 0*b ]

So the vector is [ (hbar/2) b, (hbar/2) a ].

Then, the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is a* [ (hbar/2) b ] + b* [ (hbar/2) a ].

Which is (hbar/2) ( a b* + b a* )

But a and b are the components of |alpha>, which is normalized.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute <sigma_x> and multiply by hbar/2.

Because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so <sigma_x> is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Compute this.

So, <sigma_x> = [ [0 1]; [1 0] ] matrix.

So, sigma_x acting on |alpha> would transpose the components. So, |alpha> is [a; b], so sigma_x |alpha> is [b; a].

Then, <sigma_x> = [a* b + b* a ].

Which is a* b + b* a.

Which is 2 Re(a* b).

Compute a* b.

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7), so a* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

a* b = (1 - i)(2 - i) / (7).

Multiply out numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i +i².

i squared is -1, so 2 -3i -1 → (1) -3i.

So a* b = (1 - 3i)/7.

So Re(a* b) is (1)/7.

So 2 Re(a* b) is 2*(1/7) )= 2/7.

Thus, <sigma_x> = 2/7.

So the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation of <sigma_x>.

Wait, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the expectation value is:

<sigma_x> = (1/sqrt(7)) (1 - i) )*( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )*( (1 + i)/sqrt(7) ) )

Wait, no. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the expectation value of sigma_x is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Wait, |alpha> is [a; b], so sigma_x |alpha> is [b; a], so <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is [a* b* ] [b; a ]? Wait, no, no, no.

Wait, <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> is a* (sigma_x |alpha>_1) + b* (sigma_x |alpha>_2).

sigma_x |alpha> is [b; a], so:

= a* * b + b* * a.

Which is a* b + b* a = 2 Re(a* b).

Which we computed as 2/7.

Wait, but earlier I found a* b = (1 - 3i)/7.

So Re(a* b) is 1/7. So 2 * 1/7 = 2/7. So <sigma_x> = 2/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7 )= hbar/7.

So the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

So option A fits.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which correspond to 9/14 and5/14, which is correct.

Average is hbar/7.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but another way to approach the average is to compute <A> = Tr( A rho ), where rho is the density matrix.

But perhaps it's easier to just compute <A> directly using the expectation value.

So, yeah, the expectation value is hbar/7.

Wait, but another thought: what if the operator A is diagonal in some other basis, and I can find its eigenvalues directly from the state |alpha>?

But I think the method I took is correct. I found the expectation value correctly.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is '0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7', which matches.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes, that's what I found.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization constant \( a \) is determined by ensuring \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = 1 \). The coefficients squared give \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so \( |a| = 1/\sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we analyze the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) are \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of \( A \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). The coefficients \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are computed as:

\[
c_1 = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_2 = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the magnitudes squared of these coefficients:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is computed as \( \langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle \). Using \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), we find \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{2}{7} \), so:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
