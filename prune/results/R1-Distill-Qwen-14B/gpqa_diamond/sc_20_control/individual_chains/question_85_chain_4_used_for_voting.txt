Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about two planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. I remember that equilibrium temperature has to do with how much energy a planet absorbs and emits. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. But wait, I might be mixing up some parts.

So the question gives a lot of data. Let me parse it:

The star has 1.5 solar masses, 1.2 solar radius, and Teff of 6300 K. Wait, but the star's Teff is given, which is probably useful for calculating the flux at the planets' orbits. Oh wait, but maybe the star's radius and mass impact the planets' equilibrium temperatures through their distance.

Planet1: 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth. Planet2: 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth. Both have the same albedo. Oh, so the albedo (which is the reflectivity) is same for both, so that cancels out when taking the ratio.

The question is about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, T1 over T2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... The formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux from the star at a distance 'a' is F = L / (4πa²), and the planet's equilibrium temperature is based on that. But since both planets are around the same star, maybe I can compare their temperatures based on their orbital distances.

But wait, how do I get their orbital distances? Because the question doesn't directly give them. Oh, but the problem mentions the radial velocity (RV) method and the transit method. Radial velocity gives the mass of the planet (since it's based on the Doppler shift), and the transit method gives the radius (since it's based on the dip in brightness). But how does that help with the orbital distance?

Wait, but in the question, the transit method gives the radius of the planet, and the RV method gives the mass. But for each planet, I can find the semi-major axis using Kepler's third law. But wait, Kepler's law relates the period, the mass of the star, and the semi-major axis. But in this case, the periods aren't given. So I must be missing something.

Wait, the question gives information about the Doppler shifts. From the RV method, the shift is related to the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis. Oh, right! The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 AU) ) ) )^(1/3) * something. Maybe I should dig into that.

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_planet ) / ( (M_star + M_planet )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3) ) / (c * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1-e²)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0. And the inclination i is 90 degrees, since they transit, so sin i=1. So for each planet, K is proportional to M_planet / M_star^(2/3) ) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ). But maybe that's getting too involved.

Wait, the problem gives the shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shift is given as a wavelength change. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, 0.04 Å. Oh, wait, that's the RV semi-amplitude in terms of wavelength shift. So the Doppler shift is given by delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So the velocity v from RV is v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda). So for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by delta_lambda divided by the star's line wavelength times the speed of light.

Wait, the star's line is at 6300 Å, so lambda is 6300 Å. So for Planet1, K1 is 0.03 / 6300 * c, and Planet2 is 0.04 / 6300 * c. Let me compute that. But maybe I can set up the ratio because the c and lambda will cancel in the ratio.

Wait, but let's think about the formula for K. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (4 * c^3 * T_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to use the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period and distance.

Alternatively, I remember that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * ( (2 pi) / P )^(1/3) )

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since both planets are orbiting the same star, perhaps I can relate their semi-major axes using their RV semi-amplitudes. Because the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a of the planet. Wait, no, K is proportional to (M_planet / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3)) )) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ). But without knowing the period, perhaps we can find a relation between a1 and a2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the velocities can be related to the ratio of the masses and semi-major axes.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is also given by K = (v) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But without knowing the period, I'm stuck. But perhaps the ratio of the velocities (K1/K2) can be used with the ratio of the masses to find the ratio of periods, or something else.

Wait, maybe I can relate the semi-major axes using Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_planet)/(4 pi^2). But since M_planet is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So, for each planet, a^3 is proportional to P^2 * M_star.

But without the periods, I can't directly find P. Hmm.

Wait, but from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet ) / ( (M_star) )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / (c * (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(something) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute K for each planet, then relate it to their semi-major axes.

Wait, I think I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes. Let me think.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi )^(1/3) / (c * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I recall that for a star of mass M*, and a planet of mass M_p, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( c * P^(1/3) ) ) )

But I'm getting stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, another approach: the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. The star's velocity is related to the orbital motion, which is determined by the planet's mass and the distance. So for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3) )) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)} ), but since e=0, it's just (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3} a^(1/3} )) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3} )

But again, without knowing P, I'm stuck. But maybe I can relate K1 and K2, since they're both around the same star.

Let me denote:

K1 = (v1) = ( (G * M_p1 ) / ( (M_* + M_p1) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P1 )^(1/3) ) / c

Similarly,

K2 = ( (G * M_p2 ) / ( (M_* + M_p2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P2 )^(1/3) ) / c

Taking the ratio K1/K2:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (M_* + M_p1) / (M_* + M_p2) )^(-1/3) ) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) ]

Hmm, but I don't know P1 and P2. So perhaps I need another relation between P1 and P2.

Wait, but from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/ ( G (M_* + M_p) ). Assuming M_p << M_*, then P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G M_* )

So, P1^2 = (4 pi^2 a1^3 )/(G M_* )

Similarly, P2^2 = (4 pi^2 a2^3 )/(G M_* )

Taking the ratio (P2/P1)^2 = (a2^3)/(a1^3 )

So, (P2/P1) = (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )

Putting this back into the K ratio expression:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (M_* + M_p1)/(M_* + M_p2) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) )^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify the exponents:

The (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) to the 1/3 is (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (M_* + M_p2)/(M_* + M_p1) )^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange this to solve for (a1/a2 ) or something.

Alternatively, perhaps we can rearrange the equation to find a1/a2.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed numerically.

Given:

M_* = 1.5 M_sun

M_p1 =7 M_earth

M_p2=5 M_earth

We can compute M_* in Earth masses for easier calculation, since M_p is given in Earth masses.

Wait, 1 M_sun is about 333,000 Earth masses. So M_* = 1.5 * 333,000 ≈ 499,500 Earth masses. So M_p1 is 7, M_p2=5.

So M_p1 << M_*, same for M_p2. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_* for both.

So the terms (M_* + M_p1) and (M_* + M_p2) can be approximated as M_*, so they cancel out in the ratio. So the ratio simplifies to:

K1/K2 ≈ ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

K1/K2 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But I need to find a1 and a2. Wait, but I can write a2 = a1 * (K1/K2 )^2 * (M_p2 / M_p1 )^2.

Wait, rearranging the equation:

sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = (K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

Square both sides:

a2 / a1 = (K1^2 / K2^2 ) * ( M_p2^2 / M_p1^2 )

So,

a2 = a1 * (K1^2 / K2^2 ) * ( M_p2^2 / M_p1^2 )

But I don't know a1 or a2 yet. Maybe I can find a1 and a2 in terms of K1 and K2.

But wait, let me think in terms of K and a. Since K is inversely proportional to a^(1/3). Hmmm.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p )) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / c

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )

So,

P = ( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 )

Substituting into the K equation:

K ≈ ( G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) / c * ( ( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )) )^(-1/6 )

Simplify exponents:

= ( G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) / c * (4 pi^2 a^3 )^(-1/6 ) * ( G M_* )^(1/6 )

Let me compute the exponents step by step.

Breaking it down:

(G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) → (G^(1) M_p^(1) M_*^(-1) )^(1/3) → G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3)

(2 pi )^(1/3) → 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3)

c is in denominator: 1/c.

(4 pi^2 a^3 )^(-1/6 ) → 4^(-1/6) pi^(-2/6) a^(-3/6) → 4^(-1/6) pi^(-1/3) a^(-1/2)

( G M_* )^(1/6 ) → G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6 )

Putting all together:

K ≈ [ G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3) ] * [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ] / c * [4^(-1/6) pi^(-1/3) a^(-1/2) ] * [ G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6) ]

Combine like terms:

G terms: (G^(1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) ) = G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) = G^(1/2 )

M_p terms: M_p^(1/3 )

M_* terms: ( M_*^(-1/3 ) ) * ( M_*^(1/6) ) = M_*^(-1/3 + 1/6 ) = M_*^(-1/6 )

pi terms: pi^(1/3) * pi^(-1/3) = pi^0 = 1.

2 terms: 2^(1/3) * 4^(-1/6 )

4 is 2^2, so 4^(-1/6 ) = 2^(-2/6 )= 2^(-1/3 )

So 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3 ) = 1.

a terms: a^(-1/2 )

So putting it all together:

K ≈ [ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/6) ] / ( c a^(1/2) )

So,

K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_*^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) )

We can rearrange this to solve for a:

a^(1/2) = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_*^(1/6) K )

Squaring both sides:

a = [ ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_*^(1/6) K ) ]^2

Simplify:

a = G M_p^(2/3) / ( c² M_*^(1/3) K² )

Hmm, but this seems a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio a1/a2.

Taking the ratio a1/a2:

a1/a2 = [ ( M_p1^(2/3) ) / ( K1^2 ) ) ] / [ ( M_p2^(2/3) ) / ( K2^2 ) ) ] * ( M_*^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) )

Wait, because star is same, M_* cancels out. So,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1^(2/3) / K1^2 ) * ( K2^2 / M_p2^(2/3) )

Simplify:

a1/a2 = ( M_p1^(2/3) M_p2^(-2/3) ) * ( K2^2 / K1^2 )

= [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(2/3) ) ] * ( ( K2 / K1 )^2 )

So,

a1/a2 = ( (7/5)^(2/3) ) * ( (K2/K1 )^2 )

But K1 is 0.03 Å shift, K2 is 0.04 Å. So K2/K1 = 0.04 / 0.03 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

So,

a1/a2 = ( (7/5)^(2/3) ) * ( (4/3 )^2 )

Compute each part:

7/5 = 1.4 → (1.4)^(2/3) ≈ (cube root of 1.4^2 ). 1.4^2 = 1.96. Cube root of 1.96 is approx 1.25.

Alternatively, compute 1.4^(1/3) is about 1.12, so squared is about 1.25.

(4/3 )^2 = 16/9 ≈ 1.7778.

So,

a1/a2 ≈ (1.25) * (1.7778) ≈ 2.222.

So a1 is about 2.222 times a2. So a1 = 2.222 a2.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 7/5 is 1.4. (7/5)^(2/3) is e^( (2/3) ln(1.4) ). Let's compute ln(1.4) ≈ 0.3365. So (2/3)*0.3365 ≈ 0.2243. e^0.2243 ≈ 1.25. So that part is correct.

(4/3 )^2 is 16/9 ≈ 1.777.

So 1.25 *1.777 ≈ 2.222.

So a1 ≈ 2.222 a2.

But since the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, T1/T2.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.

Since both have the same albedo, that term cancels out. So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) )

Simplify:

= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because the R_star and 2 cancel out.

So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( ( a2 ) / ( a1 ) )

We found a1 = 2.222 a2, so a2/a1 = 1/2.222 ≈ 0.4499.

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt(0.4499 ) ≈ 0.67.

Wait, but the options don't include anything around 0.67. The closest is option C (~0.53) or option A (~0.98). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the a1/a2 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up a1 and a2.

Wait, when K increases, the semi-amplitude is larger, which implies that the star is moving more, which would mean the planet is closer (since closer planets have higher velocity for the same mass? Or is it the other way around?)

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by v = K. From the formula, K is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a^(1/2), because from the a expression we had earlier:

K is proportional to (1/(a^(1/2)) ), so higher K implies smaller a.

Wait, but wait, no. Let's go back.

The formula I derived earlier was K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_*^(1/6) a^(1/2) )

So, K is inversely proportional to a^(1/2 ). So, if K increases, a must decrease.

So, for Planet1, K is 0.03 Å, for Planet2, K is 0.04 Å. So, Planet2 has a larger K than Planet1, meaning Planet2 is closer to the star (smaller a).

So, a2 < a1. So a1 is larger than a2.

Which aligns with our previous calculation that a1 ≈2.22 a2.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(1/2.222 ) ≈ sqrt(0.4499) ≈ 0.67.

But none of the answer options are close to 0.67. The options are A) 0.98, B)1.30, C)0.53, D)1.05.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the ratio somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I switched a1 and a2 in the ratio. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, when I took the ratio a1/a2, perhaps I should have taken a2/a1.

Wait, let me go back to the ratio a1/a2.

Earlier, I have:

a1/a2 = [ ( M_p1^(2/3) / K1^2 ) ] / [ ( M_p2^(2/3) / K2^2 ) ]

= ( M_p1^(2/3) M_p2^(-2/3) ) * ( K2^2 / K1^2 )

Which is ( (M_p1/M_p2 )^(2/3) ) * ( (K2/K1 )^2 )

So, M_p1 is 7, M_p2 is5. So (7/5)^(2/3) ≈ 1.4^(0.6667) ≈ 1.36.

K2 is 0.04, K1 is 0.03. So (0.04/0.03 )^2 = (4/3)^2 ≈ 1.777.

So,

a1/a2 = 1.36 * 1.777 ≈ 2.416.

So a1 = 2.416 a2.

Then,

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1/2.416 ) ≈ sqrt(0.414) ≈ 0.643.

Still about 0.64, which is not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the K formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think about the equilibrium temperature formula again.

The equilibrium temperature T_p is given by:

T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5

Since both have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term cancels.

So,

T_p ∝ sqrt( R_* / (2 a ) )

Which can be written as T_p ∝ 1 / sqrt(a )

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1 ), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2 ), so ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 )

So, if a1 = 2.416 a2, then:

T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2 ) / (2.416 a2) ) = sqrt(1/2.416 ) ≈ 0.643.

So about 0.64.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the relation between K and a.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the ratio using the formula K ∝ (M_p) / (a^(1/2) )

Because from the formula K = (const) * M_p / a^(1/2 )

So, K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2^(1/2) / a1^(1/2) )

So,

K1/K2 = (7/5 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We have K1 =0.03 Å, K2=0.04 Å. So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

7/5 is 1.4.

So,

0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.4:

0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Square both sides:

(0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287 ≈ a2/a1.

So,

a2/a1 ≈ 0.287 → a1/a2 ≈ 3.48.

So, a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Now, compute T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt( 1/3.48 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287 ) ≈ 0.536.

Ah! Now that's around 0.536, which matches option C (~0.53).

So the correct ratio is approximately 0.53, option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_p = T_* \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} \left(1 - A\right)^{0.5}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the \((1 - A)^{0.5}\) term cancels out. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Here, \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\), which is related to the orbital distance \(a\) by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Rearranging, we get:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Given:
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\),
- \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\),
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\),
- \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\),

we calculate:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{7}{5} = 1.4\):

\[
0.75 = 1.4 \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Divide through by 1.4:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75}{1.4} \approx 0.5357
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This corresponds to approximately 0.53, which matches option C.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about two planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. I remember that equilibrium temperature has to do with how much energy a planet absorbs and emits. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. But wait, I might be mixing up some parts.

So the question gives a lot of data. Let me parse it:

The star has 1.5 solar masses, 1.2 solar radius, and Teff of 6300 K. Wait, but the star's Teff is given, which is probably useful for calculating the flux at the planets' orbits. Oh wait, but maybe the star's radius and mass impact the planets' equilibrium temperatures through their distance.

Planet1: 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth. Planet2: 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth. Both have the same albedo. Oh, so the albedo (which is the reflectivity) is same for both, so that cancels out when taking the ratio.

The question is about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, T1 over T2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... The formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux from the star at a distance 'a' is F = L / (4πa²), and the planet's equilibrium temperature is based on that. But since both planets are around the same star, maybe I can compare their temperatures based on their orbital distances.

But wait, how do I get their orbital distances? Because the question doesn't directly give them. Oh, but the problem mentions the radial velocity (RV) method and the transit method. Radial velocity gives the mass of the planet (since it's based on the Doppler shift), and the transit method gives the radius (since it's based on the dip in brightness). But how does that help with the orbital distance?

Wait, but in the question, the transit method gives the radius of the planet, and the RV method gives the mass. But for each planet, I can find the semi-major axis using Kepler's third law. But wait, Kepler's law relates the period, the mass of the star, and the semi-major axis. But in this case, the periods aren't given. So I must be missing something.

Wait, the question gives information about the Doppler shifts. From the RV method, the shift is related to the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis. Oh, right! The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 AU) ) ) )^(1/3) * something. Maybe I should dig into that.

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_planet ) / ( (M_star + M_planet )^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3) ) / (c * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1-e²)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0. And the inclination i is 90 degrees, since they transit, so sin i=1. So for each planet, K is proportional to M_planet / M_star^(2/3) ) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ). But maybe that's getting too involved.

Wait, the problem gives the shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shift is given as a wavelength change. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, 0.04 Å. Oh, wait, that's the RV semi-amplitude in terms of wavelength shift. So the Doppler shift is given by delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So the velocity v from RV is v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda). So for each planet, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by delta_lambda divided by the star's line wavelength times the speed of light.

Wait, the star's line is at 6300 Å, so lambda is 6300 Å. So for Planet1, K1 is 0.03 / 6300 * c, and Planet2 is 0.04 / 6300 * c. Let me compute that. But maybe I can set up the ratio because the c and lambda will cancel in the ratio.

Wait, but let's think about the formula for K. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (4 * c^3 * T_star) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to use the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period and distance.

Alternatively, I remember that for a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )) ) * ( (2 pi) / P )^(1/3) )

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since both planets are orbiting the same star, perhaps I can relate their semi-major axes using their RV semi-amplitudes. Because the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a of the planet. Wait, no, K is proportional to (M_planet / (M_star^(2/3) a^(1/3)) )) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ). But without knowing the period, perhaps we can find a relation between a1 and a2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the velocities can be related to the ratio of the masses and semi-major axes.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude is also given by K = (v) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But without knowing the period, I'm stuck. But perhaps the ratio of the velocities (K1/K2) can be used with the ratio of the masses to find the ratio of periods, or something else.

Wait, maybe I can relate the semi-major axes using Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_planet)/(4 pi^2). But since M_planet is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So, for each planet, a^3 is proportional to P^2 * M_star.

But without the periods, I can't directly find P. Hmm.

Wait, but from the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet ) / ( (M_star) )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / (c * (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(something) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute K for each planet, then relate it to their semi-major axes.

Wait, I think I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes. Let me think.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi )^(1/3) / (c * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I recall that for a star of mass M*, and a planet of mass M_p, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2 pi )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( c * P^(1/3) ) ) )

But I'm getting stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, another approach: the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. The star's velocity is related to the orbital motion, which is determined by the planet's mass and the distance. So for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) a^(1/3) )) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)} ), but since e=0, it's just (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3} a^(1/3} )) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3} )

But again, without knowing P, I'm stuck. But maybe I can relate K1 and K2, since they're both around the same star.

Let me denote:

K1 = (v1) = ( (G * M_p1 ) / ( (M_* + M_p1) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P1 )^(1/3) ) / c

Similarly,

K2 = ( (G * M_p2 ) / ( (M_* + M_p2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P2 )^(1/3) ) / c

Taking the ratio K1/K2:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (M_* + M_p1) / (M_* + M_p2) )^(-1/3) ) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) ]

Hmm, but I don't know P1 and P2. So perhaps I need another relation between P1 and P2.

Wait, but from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/ ( G (M_* + M_p) ). Assuming M_p << M_*, then P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 a^3)/(G M_* )

So, P1^2 = (4 pi^2 a1^3 )/(G M_* )

Similarly, P2^2 = (4 pi^2 a2^3 )/(G M_* )

Taking the ratio (P2/P1)^2 = (a2^3)/(a1^3 )

So, (P2/P1) = (a2/a1 )^(3/2 )

Putting this back into the K ratio expression:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (M_* + M_p1)/(M_* + M_p2) )^(-1/3) ) * ( (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) )^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify the exponents:

The (a2/a1 )^(3/2 ) to the 1/3 is (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (M_* + M_p2)/(M_* + M_p1) )^(1/3) ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange this to solve for (a1/a2 ) or something.

Alternatively, perhaps we can rearrange the equation to find a1/a2.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed numerically.

Given:

M_* = 1.5 M_sun

M_p1 =7 M_earth

M_p2=5 M_earth

We can compute M_* in Earth masses for easier calculation, since M_p is given in Earth masses.

Wait, 1 M_sun is about 333,000 Earth masses. So M_* = 1.5 * 333,000 ≈ 499,500 Earth masses. So M_p1 is 7, M_p2=5.

So M_p1 << M_*, same for M_p2. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_* for both.

So the terms (M_* + M_p1) and (M_* + M_p2) can be approximated as M_*, so they cancel out in the ratio. So the ratio simplifies to:

K1/K2 ≈ ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

K1/K2 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But I need to find a1 and a2. Wait, but I can write a2 = a1 * (K1/K2 )^2 * (M_p2 / M_p1 )^2.

Wait, rearranging the equation:

sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = (K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

Square both sides:

a2 / a1 = (K1^2 / K2^2 ) * ( M_p2^2 / M_p1^2 )

So,

a2 = a1 * (K1^2 / K2^2 ) * ( M_p2^2 / M_p1^2 )

But I don't know a1 or a2 yet. Maybe I can find a1 and a2 in terms of K1 and K2.

But wait, let me think in terms of K and a. Since K is inversely proportional to a^(1/3). Hmmm.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p )) )^(1/3) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3) ) / c

But since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) ) / ( c P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )

So,

P = ( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* ) )^(1/2 )

Substituting into the K equation:

K ≈ ( G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) / c * ( ( (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_* )) )^(-1/6 )

Simplify exponents:

= ( G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) * (2 pi )^(1/3) / c * (4 pi^2 a^3 )^(-1/6 ) * ( G M_* )^(1/6 )

Let me compute the exponents step by step.

Breaking it down:

(G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) → (G^(1) M_p^(1) M_*^(-1) )^(1/3) → G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3)

(2 pi )^(1/3) → 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3)

c is in denominator: 1/c.

(4 pi^2 a^3 )^(-1/6 ) → 4^(-1/6) pi^(-2/6) a^(-3/6) → 4^(-1/6) pi^(-1/3) a^(-1/2)

( G M_* )^(1/6 ) → G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6 )

Putting all together:

K ≈ [ G^(1/3) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/3) ] * [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ] / c * [4^(-1/6) pi^(-1/3) a^(-1/2) ] * [ G^(1/6) M_*^(1/6) ]

Combine like terms:

G terms: (G^(1/3) ) * ( G^(1/6) ) = G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) = G^(1/2 )

M_p terms: M_p^(1/3 )

M_* terms: ( M_*^(-1/3 ) ) * ( M_*^(1/6) ) = M_*^(-1/3 + 1/6 ) = M_*^(-1/6 )

pi terms: pi^(1/3) * pi^(-1/3) = pi^0 = 1.

2 terms: 2^(1/3) * 4^(-1/6 )

4 is 2^2, so 4^(-1/6 ) = 2^(-2/6 )= 2^(-1/3 )

So 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3 ) = 1.

a terms: a^(-1/2 )

So putting it all together:

K ≈ [ G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) M_*^(-1/6) ] / ( c a^(1/2) )

So,

K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_*^(1/6) a^(1/2) ) )

We can rearrange this to solve for a:

a^(1/2) = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_*^(1/6) K )

Squaring both sides:

a = [ ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_*^(1/6) K ) ]^2

Simplify:

a = G M_p^(2/3) / ( c² M_*^(1/3) K² )

Hmm, but this seems a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio a1/a2.

Taking the ratio a1/a2:

a1/a2 = [ ( M_p1^(2/3) ) / ( K1^2 ) ) ] / [ ( M_p2^(2/3) ) / ( K2^2 ) ) ] * ( M_*^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(1/3) ) )

Wait, because star is same, M_* cancels out. So,

a1/a2 = ( M_p1^(2/3) / K1^2 ) * ( K2^2 / M_p2^(2/3) )

Simplify:

a1/a2 = ( M_p1^(2/3) M_p2^(-2/3) ) * ( K2^2 / K1^2 )

= [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 )^(2/3) ) ] * ( ( K2 / K1 )^2 )

So,

a1/a2 = ( (7/5)^(2/3) ) * ( (K2/K1 )^2 )

But K1 is 0.03 Å shift, K2 is 0.04 Å. So K2/K1 = 0.04 / 0.03 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

So,

a1/a2 = ( (7/5)^(2/3) ) * ( (4/3 )^2 )

Compute each part:

7/5 = 1.4 → (1.4)^(2/3) ≈ (cube root of 1.4^2 ). 1.4^2 = 1.96. Cube root of 1.96 is approx 1.25.

Alternatively, compute 1.4^(1/3) is about 1.12, so squared is about 1.25.

(4/3 )^2 = 16/9 ≈ 1.7778.

So,

a1/a2 ≈ (1.25) * (1.7778) ≈ 2.222.

So a1 is about 2.222 times a2. So a1 = 2.222 a2.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 7/5 is 1.4. (7/5)^(2/3) is e^( (2/3) ln(1.4) ). Let's compute ln(1.4) ≈ 0.3365. So (2/3)*0.3365 ≈ 0.2243. e^0.2243 ≈ 1.25. So that part is correct.

(4/3 )^2 is 16/9 ≈ 1.777.

So 1.25 *1.777 ≈ 2.222.

So a1 ≈ 2.222 a2.

But since the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, T1/T2.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5.

Since both have the same albedo, that term cancels out. So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) )

Simplify:

= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because the R_star and 2 cancel out.

So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is sqrt( ( a2 ) / ( a1 ) )

We found a1 = 2.222 a2, so a2/a1 = 1/2.222 ≈ 0.4499.

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt(0.4499 ) ≈ 0.67.

Wait, but the options don't include anything around 0.67. The closest is option C (~0.53) or option A (~0.98). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the a1/a2 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up a1 and a2.

Wait, when K increases, the semi-amplitude is larger, which implies that the star is moving more, which would mean the planet is closer (since closer planets have higher velocity for the same mass? Or is it the other way around?)

Wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by v = K. From the formula, K is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis a^(1/2), because from the a expression we had earlier:

K is proportional to (1/(a^(1/2)) ), so higher K implies smaller a.

Wait, but wait, no. Let's go back.

The formula I derived earlier was K = ( G^(1/2) M_p^(1/3) ) / ( c M_*^(1/6) a^(1/2) )

So, K is inversely proportional to a^(1/2 ). So, if K increases, a must decrease.

So, for Planet1, K is 0.03 Å, for Planet2, K is 0.04 Å. So, Planet2 has a larger K than Planet1, meaning Planet2 is closer to the star (smaller a).

So, a2 < a1. So a1 is larger than a2.

Which aligns with our previous calculation that a1 ≈2.22 a2.

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(1/2.222 ) ≈ sqrt(0.4499) ≈ 0.67.

But none of the answer options are close to 0.67. The options are A) 0.98, B)1.30, C)0.53, D)1.05.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the ratio somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I switched a1 and a2 in the ratio. Let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, when I took the ratio a1/a2, perhaps I should have taken a2/a1.

Wait, let me go back to the ratio a1/a2.

Earlier, I have:

a1/a2 = [ ( M_p1^(2/3) / K1^2 ) ] / [ ( M_p2^(2/3) / K2^2 ) ]

= ( M_p1^(2/3) M_p2^(-2/3) ) * ( K2^2 / K1^2 )

Which is ( (M_p1/M_p2 )^(2/3) ) * ( (K2/K1 )^2 )

So, M_p1 is 7, M_p2 is5. So (7/5)^(2/3) ≈ 1.4^(0.6667) ≈ 1.36.

K2 is 0.04, K1 is 0.03. So (0.04/0.03 )^2 = (4/3)^2 ≈ 1.777.

So,

a1/a2 = 1.36 * 1.777 ≈ 2.416.

So a1 = 2.416 a2.

Then,

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( 1/2.416 ) ≈ sqrt(0.414) ≈ 0.643.

Still about 0.64, which is not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the K formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think about the equilibrium temperature formula again.

The equilibrium temperature T_p is given by:

T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.5

Since both have the same albedo, the (1 - A) term cancels.

So,

T_p ∝ sqrt( R_* / (2 a ) )

Which can be written as T_p ∝ 1 / sqrt(a )

So, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a1 ), T2 to 1/sqrt(a2 ), so ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 )

So, if a1 = 2.416 a2, then:

T1/T2 = sqrt( (a2 ) / (2.416 a2) ) = sqrt(1/2.416 ) ≈ 0.643.

So about 0.64.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the K relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the relation between K and a.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the ratio using the formula K ∝ (M_p) / (a^(1/2) )

Because from the formula K = (const) * M_p / a^(1/2 )

So, K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2^(1/2) / a1^(1/2) )

So,

K1/K2 = (7/5 ) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

We have K1 =0.03 Å, K2=0.04 Å. So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So,

0.75 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

7/5 is 1.4.

So,

0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2/a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.4:

0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Square both sides:

(0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287 ≈ a2/a1.

So,

a2/a1 ≈ 0.287 → a1/a2 ≈ 3.48.

So, a1 is about 3.48 times a2.

Now, compute T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt( 1/3.48 ) ≈ sqrt(0.287 ) ≈ 0.536.

Ah! Now that's around 0.536, which matches option C (~0.53).

So the correct ratio is approximately 0.53, option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_p = T_* \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} \left(1 - A\right)^{0.5}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the \((1 - A)^{0.5}\) term cancels out. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Here, \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2, respectively. To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\), which is related to the orbital distance \(a\) by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Rearranging, we get:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Given:
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\),
- \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\),
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\),
- \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\),

we calculate:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Substituting into the equation:

\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{7}{5} = 1.4\):

\[
0.75 = 1.4 \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Divide through by 1.4:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75}{1.4} \approx 0.5357
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx (0.5357)^2 \approx 0.287
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This corresponds to approximately 0.53, which matches option C.

**Answer: C**
