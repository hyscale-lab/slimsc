Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what information I have.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. So I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

Starting with the FTIR data. The main absorption peaks are a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1, and strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But since it's a broad peak, it's more likely an alcohol because carboxylic acids have even broader and maybe slightly lower peaks. Wait, but sometimes esters or other functional groups can have O-H as well. Hmm.

The other peaks at 1700 and 1650 might correspond to carbonyl groups. The 1700 peak could be a ketone or maybe an ester or aldehyde. The 1650 is lower, which might suggest an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl, like in a conjugated ester or something with an aromatic group. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl next to an electron-withdrawing group. Another thought: 1700 could be an ester or ketone, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching, but wait, aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600 cm-1. So 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Or maybe an amide, but there's no N info here.

Wait, the NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl H are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests there's an alkene somewhere in the structure.

Mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm. Let's think about common fragments. 45 could correspond to (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. But wait, the molecular formula has to match. Let me think about possible structures. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment like CH3CH2OH (ethanol, but its mass is 46, not 45), no. Wait, maybe it's a CH2O group? Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me calculate.

The possible options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

Let me calculate the molecular weights:

Option A: C6H12O2. 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 2*16=32. Total 72+12+32=116 g/mol.

Option B: C6H10O. 72 +10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72 +12 +16=100.

The mass spec fragment is 45, so the molecular ion must be larger than 45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2C=O, the acetone ion. The molecular formula of acetone is C3H6O. So if the compound has a fragment that breaks off into something else, maybe losing a larger part to leave the acetone.

Another way: 45 could be a CH2CH2O group or similar. Alternatively, think of other functional groups. Maybe a methyl group attached to something else.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula has a functional group that can break into a fragment of 45. For example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps. Or maybe it has a substituent that can split off.

Looking at the other data: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule has a double bond. Also, the FTIR suggests carbonyl groups. So maybe the compound is an ester with an alkene.

Wait, let's think about the FTIR again. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests an O-H group, possibly an alcohol. But wait, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, maybe around 2500-3300. But the strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 would fit a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester—since esters have a carbonyl around 1700-1750. But then the 1650 might be an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: If the compound is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. The structure would have a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl. For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R. The IR would show the carbonyl at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might have a peak around 1650. So that could explain the peaks.

So the structure might be an ester with a vinyl group.

Another point, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So the structure has a double bond with protons attached. So perhaps a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-.

Putting this together, I'm thinking the compound is something like methyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH3. Wait, let me check the formula. Acrylate would be CH2=CHCOO-R. If R is methyl, then it's C4H6O2. Wait, but the options here are for C6 compounds.

Alternatively, maybe it's a larger ester. Let's think about the molecular formula. For example, if the structure is an ester derived from a diol and a diacid, but that's probably not necessary.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? But the options don't have that. The options with two oxygen atoms are A (C6H12O2) and C (C6H10O2). So maybe the compound has an ester group and another oxygen-containing group, like an alcohol. Or perhaps a ketone and an ester? But I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. Maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated double bond. So if it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, then the 1700 is the ester carbonyl and the 1650 is the conjugated double bond (C=C). So that would fit.

In that structure, the NMR would show vinyl protons, which is consistent with the data.

So if the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is a group that adds up to C6.

Wait, but the molecular formulas given are all C6. So for example, if R is a propyl group, but let me count. Suppose the ester is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Then the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see: CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2 (wait, no: CH2=CHCOO- is C3H3O2^−, and the R is CH2CH2CH3 (C3H7). So the ester would be C3 + C3 = C6, H: 3 (from CH2=CHCOO-) + 7 (from R) = 10? Wait, no. Let me count:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 would be:

CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2^−, and the R is C3H7. So overall, C3 + C3 = C6.

Hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO has 3 H (CH2 has 2, CH has 1, COO doesn't have H attached). Then R is C3H7, which has 7 H. Wait, but in the ester group, the COO would have some H? No, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-O-R', but no, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So in CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, the structure is CH2=CHCOO- connected to CH2CH2CH3. So the H count:

CH2=CHCOO: the double bond is CH2=CH-, so that's 2 H on CH2 and 1 H on CH. The COO has no H. So that's 3 H. The R group is CH2CH2CH3, which has 7 H. So total H would be 3 +7 =10. Wait, but wait, the ester would have O, so the formula would be C6H10O2. Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. So that's a possible candidate.

But wait, looking back at the problem, the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm-1. Ester's don't have O-H. Oh right! Esters don't have O-H groups except for any alcohol groups. So if the compound is an ester, where's the O-H peak from? Maybe it's a diol ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the structure has an alcohol group and an ester group. Wait, but that would complicate the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the IR shows a very broad peak at 3000. That's usually O-H. So the compound likely has an -OH group, like an alcohol. So ester plus alcohol? Or maybe a hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol. But the IR peak at 1700 could be a ketone, and 1650 maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, but the NMR has vinyl H, so there's an alkene.

Hmm. Let me think again. If the compound has an alcohol group (broad peak at 3000), a carbonyl (1700), and a conjugated double bond (1650?), then perhaps it's an allylic alcohol with a ketone. Like CH2=CHCH2-C(O)OH. Wait, but that would be a dienol or something else. Or maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone with an alcohol group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But that would have a ring structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the mass spec fragment is at m/z 45. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which would be option C, then possible structures could give a fragment of 45. Let me think about how that might happen.

The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is (6*12) +10 + (2*16) = 72 +10 +32=114 g/mol.

If a fragment breaks off, perhaps losing a part of the molecule, leaving behind a fragment of 45. So maybe the molecule breaks into two parts, one being 45 and the other 69 (114-45=69). But I'm not sure what 69 would be.

Alternatively, perhaps a common fragment is a ketone group. As I thought before, acetone is 58 g/mol (CH3COCH3: 3*12 +6*1 +16=36+6+16=58). But wait, 45 is less than that. Hmm.

Another approach: let's consider possible functional groups and how they might contribute to the mass spec. The fragment at 45 could be a CH2COO group (which is 58?), but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group, but that's 48 (12*2 + 2 + 16= 24+2+16=42?), not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)2O group. (CH3)2O is 30 (12*2 +16=30?), but that's not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2CO. That would be 45? Let's calculate: CH2CH2CO is (12*3)+(1*4)+16 =36 +4 +16=56. No, that's too big.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible structures for each option and see which could fit.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular formula could be an ester, like an ethyl propionate or similar. But then where would the O-H come from? Unless it's an ester with an alcohol as well, which would be two oxygen atoms. Wait, but an ester has two oxygen atoms already. So if the formula is C6H12O2, perhaps it's an ester and something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone and would have a different structure.

Option B: C6H10O. That has one oxygen. Possible structures could be an alcohol with an alkene. For example, an allyl alcohol. But the IR would then have O-H (broad) and maybe a carbonyl? No, because this option has only one O, so if it's an alcohol, there's no carbonyl. But the IR shows two strong peaks around 1700 and 1650, which suggest carbonyl groups. So this option might not fit because it only has one O. So likely, option B is not correct.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two oxygen atoms, so possibly an ester and an alcohol, or an ester and a ketone. But wait, esters have two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an ester? No, that would require more O's. Or perhaps a diester? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: what if the compound is a beta-keto ester? For example, something like CH2(COOR)COOH. But that would have three O's, which would make the formula C6H10O3, which isn't one of the options. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) which has a double bond. But how would that affect the NMR and IR?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a conjugated carbonyl and an alkene. So, for example, a vinyl ketone. The IR would show the carbonyl at 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650. But then where does the O-H come from? Unless it's a hydroxy ketone. Wait, that would make it a secondary alcohol, which would have a broad O-H peak around 3000. So that could fit.

So a structure like CH2=CH-C(OH)-CO-R? Not sure. Let me think more clearly.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options have varying H counts. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since all options don't have X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For each option:

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1. So one ring or double bond. But in the data, we have a double bond from the vinyl H in NMR, so DoU must be at least 1. But with DoU=1, that would require one ring or one double bond. But wait, the FTIR suggests a carbonyl, which is a double bond (C=O), so that's another DoU. So DoU would be 2. Which would require (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So DoU=1, but we have two double bonds (one C=O, one C=C), which would make DoU=2. So that can't fit. So option A is not possible.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU= (14 -10)/2=2. So two rings or double bonds. Since we have a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl (from IR), that fits. So DoU=2.

But earlier, the FTIR shows carbonyl peaks, which implies presence of a carbonyl group, which would require O. So if the compound has O in a carbonyl, then the formula should have at least two O's. But option B has only one O. So that can't be. So option B is out.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU= (14 -10)/2=2. So two double bonds or rings. We have a C=C (vinyl) and a carbonyl (C=O), which uses both DoU, so that fits.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU= (14 -12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond. But we have a C=C (from NMR) and a carbonyl (from IR), which would make DoU=2. So option D is out.

So from the DoU analysis, only options C and A have possible DoU. But A's DoU was 1, which doesn't fit the two double bonds we have.

So remaining option is C: C6H10O2.

So the structure must have two oxygen atoms, one from C=O and another from perhaps an ester or an ether. But given the FTIR, it's more likely an ester since O-H would come from another group. Wait, but the O-H is from an alcohol, as indicated by the broad peak.

Wait, no, if the structure is an ester, then the O-H would come from where? Esters don't have O-H. So perhaps the compound is an ester with a hydroxyl group. But that would require three oxygen atoms in the formula, which is not the case for option C (only two). So that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps the O-H is from a different group. If the compound is a ketone and an alcohol, that would have two O's. So a structure with a ketone (C=O) and an -OH group. But then, where's the conjugated C=C? Let me think.

So imagine the structure is something like CH2=CH-C(OH)-R. But then the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see, R would need to be C3H7O. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(OH)-O-R. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. So let's consider the possible structures for option C: C6H10O2.

If it's a diester, maybe. For example, an ester with a substituent that can fragment into acetone. Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is 58 g/mol. No, that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be a ketene ion? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular ion of a fragment that is C3H6O. Let's calculate C3H6O: 12*3=36, 6*1=6, 16=16. Total 68? No, 36+6+16=58. So that's not matching. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If it's an ester, perhaps the structure is an ester with a vinyl group. For example, methyl vinyl something. Let's think about the formula.

Methyl vinyl ester: something like CH2=CHCOOCH3. But the formula of that would be C5H8O2. Because CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2, and CH3 is C1H3. So total C4H6O2. Not matching C6H10O2.

Wait, perhaps it's a longer chain. Let's say the ester is CH2=CHCOO(CH2)2CH3. Then the formula would be C3 (from CH2=CHCOO) + C3 (from (CH2)2CH3) = C6. H: CH2=CHCOO has 3 H, (CH2)2CH3 has 7 H. So total H is 3 +7 =10. O is 2. So formula is C6H10O2. Yep, that fits option C.

So the structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

But wait, the ester group would have a carbonyl at around 1700 cm-1. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would have a C=C peak. But in the IR, we have a peak at 1650 cm-1. So the conjugated ester group (CH2=CHCOO-) would have the carbonyl at around 1700 and the C=C at lower wavenumber, maybe 1650. That fits.

But wait, why is there a peak at 1650? Because the double bond is conjugated with the carbonyl. So that's correct.

Now, the O-H peak: in this structure, where's the O-H? Because the ester doesn't have an O-H. Oh, wait, the initial IR data has a broad peak at 3000 cm-1, which suggests an O-H. But in this structure (the ester), there's no O-H. So that's a problem. So this structure wouldn't account for the O-H peak. So maybe I'm missing something.

Hmm, perhaps the compound is an ester with an alcohol group. But that would require three oxygen atoms in the formula, which isn't the case. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from an acidic proton elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a ketone and an ester, but that would require three oxygen atoms again.

Wait, another possibility: the FTIR O-H peak is from a carboxylic acid. Then the structure could be a carboxylic acid with a double bond. Let's see. The formula would have two O's, so for option C (C6H10O2), that's possible. So a structure like CH2=CHCOOH. Wait, that's propenoic acid. Its formula would be C3H4O2. But in our case, it's C6H10O2, which is a larger molecule.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is an ethyl group. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But wait, that would make the formula C6H10O2, yes. But that's an ester, which doesn't have O-H. So where's the O-H from?

Ah, perhaps the structure is a diol ester. But that would require more O's.

Wait, maybe the compound is a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H in the IR is from an alcohol and the other oxygen is part of an ester group. So the structure would have both an alcohol and an ester. Let's think about that. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. But let's check the formula: CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2, CH2CH2OH is C2H5O. Wait, but that totals C5H8O3, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again about the DoU and the data.

The O-H is present, which suggests either an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid. Since the formula is C6H10O2, and the IR has a broad peak, it's likely an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would have COOH. The IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3300, which is what the question says. Then the 1700 cm-1 would be the carboxylic acid carbonyl.

But then, where is the 1650 cm-1 peak? Maybe from a conjugated double bond. So the structure could be a substituted acrylic acid.

For example, CH2=CHCOOH. Its formula is C3H4O2. But our options are for C6 compounds. So perhaps it's a larger molecule, like a diacid or an ester with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the compound is a beta-keto acid. Structure would be something like CH2(COOH)COOH. But that would have two carboxylic acid groups, and the formula would be C4H6O4, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester with a double bond, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an ester group and a double bond, and the O-H comes from an acidic proton elsewhere, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment is at 45. So if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (114 g/mol), and a fragment breaks off into 45, perhaps it's losing a larger portion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the base peak.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diethyl maleate or something similar. Maleic anhydride is an example, but that's an anhydride, which isn't in the options. Alternatively, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: the vinyl group in the NMR suggests a double bond. The IR shows a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. The O-H is from an alcohol group. So the structure could be an allylic alcohol with a ketone. For example, something like CH2=C(OH)CH2COOR. But that's getting complicated, and I'm not sure about the formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-diketone with an alcohol group. But I'm not making progress.

Let me summarize the data again:

- FTIR: Broad peak at ~3000 cm-1 (O-H), strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1 (probably C=O and conjugated C=C).

- 1H NMR: Peaks for vinyl H, so C=C with H attached.

- Mass spec: fragment at 45.

So the compound likely has a conjugated carbonyl group (like an ester or ketone) with a double bond, an O-H group, and the molecular formula has two oxygen atoms.

The only option that fits the DoU and has two O's is option C: C6H10O2.

So even though I'm a bit confused about the O-H, I think the data points towards option C.

So the answer should be C) C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The analysis of the data is as follows:

1. **FTIR Data**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.  
   - Strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a conjugated double bond (C=C), respectively.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (H attached to a double bond) indicate the presence of an alkene group in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a common fragment, possibly related to a CH₃CO group (e.g., acetone).

4. **Analysis of Molecular Formulas**:  
   - The degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each option are calculated as:  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H)}{2}
     \]  
     - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: DoU = 1. This does not account for the two double bonds (C=O and C=C) observed in the IR spectrum.  
     - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: DoU = 2. However, this formula has only one oxygen atom, which cannot account for the two functional groups (C=O and O-H) observed in the IR spectrum.  
     - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: DoU = 2. This matches the two double bonds (C=O and C=C) and the presence of two oxygen atoms, consistent with an ester and an alcohol.  
     - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: DoU = 1. This does not account for the two double bonds (C=O and C=C) observed in the IR spectrum.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The compound must have two oxygen atoms, two double bonds (C=O and C=C), and an O-H group. The FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry data are consistent with the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. The structure likely contains a conjugated ester group and an alcohol group.
