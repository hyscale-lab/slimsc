Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about the allowed decay channels for a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that might be a typo or maybe I'm misreading it. Let me parse that again. Oh, right, in the standard notation, the interaction Lagrangian for a scalar boson coupling to fermions usually looks like something involving the Yukawa coupling. Maybe it's L = -λ f ψ^† ψ X or similar, but perhaps more accurately, it would involve the fermion fields and the boson X.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, that doesn't quite look right. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps it should be something like L = -λ X ψ† ψ, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is more like L = -λ X f ψ f-bar ψ, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think more about what the Lagrangian signifies.

But maybe the Lagrangian isn't the key here. The main point is the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and we need to find which fermion pairs it can decay into.

Okay, so when a boson decays into fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion involved because each fermion would carry away some energy, but the minimal case is when the fermions are at rest in the center-of-mass frame, so the boson's mass must be >= 2 * m_fermion.

So for X to decay into a pair of fermions f, the condition is m_X >= 2 m_f.

What fermions are available? Let me list the known fermions. The charged leptons are electrons (e), muons (μ), taus (τ). The quarks come in up-type (u, c, t), down-type (d, s, b), and the strange quark is s. The top quark is very heavy, about 173 GeV, so that's way beyond 6 GeV.

So the possible fermions to decay into are the charged leptons and the light quarks. Let's compute 2*m for each possible fermion.

Electron mass: m_e ≈ 0.511 MeV, so 2 m_e is negligible, about 1 MeV. So X can decay into e+ e-.

Same with muon: m_mu ≈ 105.7 MeV, so 2 m_mu ≈ 211 MeV. Again, way below 6 GeV.

Tau mass: m_tau ≈ 1.78 GeV. So 2 m_tau is about 3.56 GeV. Since 6 GeV is more than that, decay into tau+ tau- is allowed.

Now quarks: The light quarks are u, d, s, c. Let's think about their masses.

Wait, but wait, quark masses are a bit tricky. Current quark masses are often given as:

u: around 2 MeV
d: around 4-5 MeV
s: around 100 MeV
c: around 1.5 GeV
t: 173 GeV (too heavy)
b: around 4.7 GeV (but wait, 4.7 GeV is more than half of 6 GeV, so if X is 6 GeV, can it decay into b quarks? Let's calculate 2 m_b: 2 * 4.7 is 9.4 GeV. Oh, wait, so 9.4 GeV is way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks because 6 < 9.4. So b quarks are out.

Wait, but some sources give the bottom quark mass as around 4.7 GeV. So 2*m_b would be 9.4 GeV, which is higher than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar. Therefore, the possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

What about the charm quark? m_c is about 1.5 GeV, so 2 m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar.

So the possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau-
u u-bar
d d-bar
s s-bar
c c-bar

Wait, but wait. Are the s quarks allowed? m_s is about 100 MeV, so 2 m_s is 200 MeV, which is way below 6 GeV. So yes, s s-bar is allowed.

But wait, what about the strange quark? Yes, same as u and d, but m_s is higher than u and d but still lower than m_c.

So possible decay products are:

b b-bar: Not allowed, 9.4 GeV >6 GeV.
c c-bar: Allowed.
s s-bar: Allowed.
u u-bar: Allowed.
d d-bar: Allowed.

So for leptons: e, mu, tau are allowed.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but the options don't include all of these, so I need to look at the given options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.
But we just concluded that b b-bar is not allowed, so A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
That's all the allowed ones except for c, but wait, in our calculation, c c-bar is allowed. So B includes c c-bar, which is correct. So B seems to include all the allowed decay channels except for b, which is not allowed.

Wait, but wait, the option B in the question lists "c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-." So that's all the allowed fermions except for b. So option B would be correct.

Option C includes t t-bar, which is impossible because m_t is about 173 GeV, so 2 m_t is 346 GeV, way bigger than 6 GeV. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.
Again, this includes b b-bar, which isn't allowed, so D is incorrect.

So the correct option must be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the mass of the tau again. 1.78 GeV, so 2*m_tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau is allowed.

Wait, but what about the charm quark? 1.5 GeV, so 3 GeV <6 GeV, so c c-bar is allowed. So option B includes c c-bar, which we allow.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed fermion pairs.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \), the mass of the boson must satisfy \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of each fermion in the pair. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but the key focus is on the mass constraints for the fermion pairs.

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Charged Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_e \approx 1 \, \text{MeV} \). Decay into \( e^+ e^- \) is allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_\mu \approx 211 \, \text{MeV} \). Decay into \( \mu^+ \mu^- \) is allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \). Decay into \( \tau^+ \tau^- \) is allowed.

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_u \approx 4 \, \text{MeV} \). Decay into \( u \bar{u} \) is allowed.
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4-5 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_d \approx 8-10 \, \text{MeV} \). Decay into \( d \bar{d} \) is allowed.
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( 2m_s \approx 200 \, \text{MeV} \). Decay into \( s \bar{s} \) is allowed.
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Decay into \( c \bar{c} \) is allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \). Decay into \( b \bar{b} \) is **not allowed** because \( 9.4 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \). Decay into \( t \bar{t} \) is **not allowed**.

### Allowed Decay Channels:
From the above analysis, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are:
\[
X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^-.
\]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists all allowed decays: \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.
