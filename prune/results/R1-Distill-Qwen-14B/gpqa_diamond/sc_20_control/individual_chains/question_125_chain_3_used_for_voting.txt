Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me take a deep breath and try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = ½ m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the Hamiltonian for the particle separates into radial and angular parts because of the spherical symmetry. 

Wait, right, the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator can be considered as three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators along each axis (x, y, z). But when we're in spherical coordinates, it's more about the radial and angular components. Oh, right, the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers associated with each direction, but in three dimensions, it's more efficient to think in terms of the principal quantum number n, but wait, no, perhaps using the quantum numbers for each direction.

In the 3D case, the energy levels are given by the sum of the energies in each direction. So each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is a non-negative integer. So the total energy E would be (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, since in spherical coordinates, it's sometimes expressed in terms of the quantum numbers l and m, but wait, maybe not exactly. Oh wait, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are actually quantized based on the sum of the three quantum numbers. So the energy depends on n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Another approach is that in the isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. So each nx, ny, nz is a non-negative integer (they can be 0,1,2,...). But another way to think about it is when you have the same energy, the quantum numbers can be arranged in different ways, but the sum (nx + ny + nz) is the same. So for a given energy level, the value of (nx + ny + nz) is fixed, let's say it's equal to some integer N. Then the energy would be E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

So the problem is asking about the third excited state. Wait, wait, I need to clarify what the ground state is. The ground state would be when nx = ny = nz = 0, so N=0. The first excited state would be when N=1 (since 0 is the ground state, then 1 is the first excited). Then the second excited would be N=2, and the third excited would be N=3.

Wait no, wait. Let me think about this more carefully. The ground state is the lowest energy state, which is N=0. The first excited state is the next possible energy level, which is N=1, then the second is N=2, and the third excited state would be N=3. So for the third excited state, N=3.

So the energy E for N=3 would be (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. That's the first part of the question, the energy value.

Now the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue. That is, how many distinct ways can the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz be arranged such that their sum is N=3.

Each of nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers. So the number of ways to write 3 as the sum of three non-negative integers, considering permutations as distinct. Because each permutation would correspond to a different eigenfunction.

So, how many triplets (nx, ny, nz) are there where nx + ny + nz = 3?

This is a combinatorial problem. The number of solutions is given by the combination with repetition formula. The formula is (n + k -1) choose (k -1), where n is the number to reach (3) and k is the number of variables (3 variables here: nx, ny, nz). So (3 +3 -1) choose (3-1) → (5 choose 2) = 10.

Wait, but let me think about it another way to make sure. For each possible value of nx, ny can vary such that the sum is 3.

If nx=0: then ny + nz =3. The number of non-negative integer solutions is 4: (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0).

If nx=1: ny + nz =2 → 3 solutions: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).

If nx=2: ny + nz =1 → 2 solutions: (0,1), (1,0).

If nx=3: ny + nz =0 → 1 solution: (0,0).

So total is 4+3+2+1=10. So 10 different eigenfunctions.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking at the options, option A says (9/2) ħω, 10 eigenfunctions, which matches.

Let me just check the options again. Option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. Option C is the same energy but 3 eigenfunctions, which must be wrong because the number is 10, not 3.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels of the system are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \), which are non-negative integers. The total energy is expressed as:

\[
E = \left( n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2} \right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the sum of the quantum numbers. The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \left( 3 + \frac{3}{2} \right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The second part of the question asks for the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to write \( n = 3 \) as the sum of three non-negative integers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is a combinatorial problem, and the number of solutions is given by the formula for combinations with repetition:

\[
\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1},
\]

where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \) (the three quantum numbers). Substituting, we get:

\[
\binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Energy: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), Number of eigenfunctions: 10.**
