Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about a supernova ejecta and the distance it travels from the galaxy's frame of reference. Oh right, I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially moving at high speeds, I might need to use special relativity principles. But wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So no acceleration, just relative motion.

The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's pretty fast! Like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me calculate what fraction that is. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 1/5th of that. So 0.2c. Hmm, that's a substantial speed, so relativistic effects might be important here.

The question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to find the distance from the galaxy's perspective. But time is measured differently in different frames. Oh right, time dilation and length contraction come into play here.

Wait, let me think about what each frame observes. In the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in that frame, the galaxy is moving, and the ejecta is stationary. But from the galaxy's frame of reference, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.

But wait, the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame. So, if the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy, how far does it go in 50 seconds (but wait, 50 seconds in which frame? Oh, the problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.)

So, the key here is that time is different in each frame. So, the time experienced in the galaxy's frame would be longer due to time dilation. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slower.

Wait, the formula for time dilation is t = gamma * t_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, and t_0 is the proper time (the time measured in the moving frame). So, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate gamma for v=60,000 km/s.

Wait, v is 6e4 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s. So, v/c is 0.2.

So, gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96). Hmm, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98 because (0.98)^2 is 0.9604. So gamma is about 1 / 0.98, which is roughly 1.0204. Wait, but wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5. Sqrt(24) is about 4.89898, so 4.89898 /5 is approximately 0.9798. So sqrt(0.96)=0.9798. So gamma is 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.02057.

So, gamma is approximately 1.02057.

Now, the proper time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So, in the galaxy's frame, the time elapsed is t = gamma * t_0 = 1.02057 *50 ≈ 51.0285 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The time in the galaxy's frame is longer. So, the distance traveled would be speed multiplied by the time in the galaxy's frame. Because from the galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v=6e4 km/s, and the time is 51.0285 seconds.

Wait no, wait. Wait, I think I might have gotten this wrong. Let me think again. Let's clarify the frames:

Frame E (ejecta): The galaxy's center is moving towards E at 60,000 km/s. So from E's perspective, the galaxy is approaching at v=6e4 km/s.

Frame G (galaxy): The ejecta is approaching at v=6e4 km/s.

So, from G's perspective, how much time passes when E's clock shows 50 seconds? Because in E's frame, 50 seconds pass, but in G's frame, due to time dilation, more time has passed.

So, in G's frame, the time elapsed is t = gamma * t_0. So, t = gamma *50.

So, G's frame time is about 51.0285 seconds.

So, the distance the ejecta travels from G's frame is v * t.

v is 6e4 km/s. t is approximately 51.0285 s.

So distance s = 6e4 *51.0285 = ?

Calculate 6e4 is 60,000 km/s.

Multiply by 51.0285 s: 60,000 *51.0285 = ?

60,000 *50 is 3,000,000. 60,000 *1.0285 is 61,710. So 3,000,000 +61,710 =3,061,710 km. So approximately 3,061,710 km.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

Hmm, 3,061,710 is close to option D, which is 3,060,000 km.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma precisely.

v = 6e4 km/s, so v = 0.2c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

Compute sqrt(0.96):

Let me compute 0.96^(0.5). Let's see, 0.96 is 96/100. Let's compute sqrt(96)=9.798, so sqrt(96/100)=9.798/10=0.9798.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.02057.

So t = 50 *1.02057≈51.0285 s.

So s =6e4 *51.0285= 60,000 *51.0285.

Let me compute 60,000 *51 =3,060,000. Then 60,000 *0.0285= 1,710. So 3,060,000 +1,710=3,061,710 km.

But the options don't have this exact number. The closest is D)3,060,000 km.

But wait, perhaps the question is considering length contraction? Or could I have mixed up which frame is which?

Wait, another approach. Maybe from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 0.2c, and the ejecta is stationary. So, the event is that the galaxy's center moves a certain distance in the ejecta's frame. But the question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of velocity addition. But wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy.

So, the distance in the galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time measured in the galaxy's frame.

But what is the time t in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame? That's the time dilation part.

So, t = gamma * t_0, where t_0 is 50 s.

So, t=50 * gamma.

So, the distance is v * t = v * gamma * t_0.

Which is 6e4 km/s * (50 s) * gamma.

Wait, 6e4 *50 is 3e6 km. Multiply by gamma (approx 1.02057) gives 3e6 *1.02057= approx 3,061,710 km.

So, that's about 3,061,710, which is close to option D (3,060,000), but not exactly the same. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.

Compute 0.96 = 1 - 0.04.

sqrt(0.96) = 0.9798 ?

Wait, let's compute it using more precise methods. Let's compute sqrt(0.96) using a calculator approach.

I know that 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So, 0.98^2 = 0.9604. So, sqrt(0.96)= approx 0.98 - (0.9604-0.96)/(2*0.98). Using linear approximation.

The difference is 0.9604 -0.96=0.0004.

So, using the formula: sqrt(x) ≈ sqrt(a) - (x -a)/(2 sqrt(a)), where a=0.9604.

So, x=0.96.

So, sqrt(x) ≈ 0.98 - (0.96 -0.9604)/(2*0.98) )= 0.98 - (-0.0004)/(1.96 )= 0.98 + (0.0004/1.96) ≈0.98 + 0.000204=0.980204.

So, sqrt(0.96)≈0.980204. So gamma=1/0.980204≈1.019998, approximately 1.02.

So, t=50 *1.02=51 s. So, 51 seconds in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, that's an approximation. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute 1/0.980204:

1/0.980204 ≈ 1.019998.

Wait, 0.980204 *1.02 is 0.980204 *1.02 = let's compute:

0.980204 *1 = 0.980204.

0.980204 *0.02=0.01960408.

Sum: 0.980204 + 0.01960408=1.0 (approx). So 1.02 *0.980204≈1.0.

So, gamma is approximately 1.02.

So, t=50 *1.02=51 s.

So, distance is 60,000 km/s *51 s =3,060,000 km. Which is exactly option D.

So, the correct answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c \) is the speed of light). The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame of reference. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Time Dilation**: Due to special relativity, time intervals measured in different frames differ. The relationship between the proper time (\( t_0 \)) in the ejecta's frame and the dilated time (\( t \)) in the Galaxy's frame is given by:
   \[
   t = \gamma t_0
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.02057
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   t = \gamma t_0 = 1.02057 \times 50 \approx 51.0285 \, \text{seconds}.
   \]

2. **Distance Calculation**: In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta travels at a constant speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) for the dilated time \( t \). The distance traveled is:
   \[
   s = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.0285 \, \text{seconds} \):
   \[
   s = 60,000 \times 51.0285 \approx 3,061,710 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**: The calculated distance (\( 3,061,710 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**. Minor discrepancies arise from rounding \( \gamma \), but the approximation aligns with this option.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**.
