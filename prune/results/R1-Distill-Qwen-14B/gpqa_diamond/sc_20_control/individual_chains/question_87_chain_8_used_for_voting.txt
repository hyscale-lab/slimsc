Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm. Let's break it down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more, making 8 in total. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the compound has 8 carbons in total, so benzene (6) plus two substituents. Each substituent is probably a single group, so let me think about possible structures.

The FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O), which means one of the substituents is likely a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something else with a carbonyl. But wait, it's also showing an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.), and the other has a carbonyl.

Wait, but wait a second. The molecule is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. One is a halogen, and the other is a carbonyl-containing group. So the substituents are -X and -CO-something.

So possible structures could be something like benzaldehyde with a halogen, but wait, that's only one substituent. No, wait, di-substituted. So two substituents on the benzene ring: one is -X (like Cl), and the other is a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something else.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the total carbons. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. The substituents add up to 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons.

Wait, for example: if one substituent is a Cl (no additional carbons), and the other substituent is a carbonyl group attached to some other carbons. Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be like Cl and a group like COCH3. Because COCH3 has two carbons (the CO is from the ring, but wait, noâ€”COCH3 would add a methyl group to the ring via the carbonyl. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, the substituents are attached to the ring. So for example, one substituent is a Cl, and the other is a carbonyl attached to a methyl group, like -COCH3. So that's a ketone group. So the structure would be something like 4-chloroacetophenone. Because the benzene ring has two substituents: Cl and COCH3. That's a possible structure.

Alternatively, other substituents could be a carbonyl attached to something else, like maybe an ethyl group, but that would add more carbons. Wait, the total carbons in the compound are 8. So benzene (6) plus substituents: 2. Let me calculate. If one substituent is Cl (no carbons), and the other is COCH3 (which has 2 carbons: the CO is attached to the CH3), but wait, the CO is part of the substituent. So COCH3 is two carbons (the C from CO and the CH3). So 6 + 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 8. Wait, that would make 8. So that works.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 substituents. Now, where are they attached? Di-substituted, so they are in positions 1,2; 1,3; etc. Wait, but the NMR would depend on the substitution pattern.

Wait, but in this problem, the substituents are both on the ring, so the positions might be para, meta, or ortho. Let me think about the possible NMR signals.

In an aromatic ring with two substituents, the number and pattern of the aromatic protons depend on the substitution. For example, in para substitution, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. If substituents are meta, maybe different patterns.

Wait, but in our case, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. Let me think about their directing effects. Cl is a meta director, and COCH3 is a para/ortho director. But that might not matter here since the substitution is already done.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents are in positions that make the ring have certain symmetry. Let me think about the structure.

If the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets. For example, in para-substituted rings, like p-xylene, the two sets of protons are each a pair, each as a doublet.

Wait, but in our case, substituents are Cl and COCH3. Let's say they're para. So the benzene ring has Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 4. Then the remaining positions (2,3,5,6) would each have H? Or wait, no. Wait, in the benzene ring, if substituents are para, then the ring's Hs are in two sets of two Hs each, each as doublets. So in the NMR, we'd see two doublets, each integrating for two Hs. Like 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That matches one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)
Option C: 7.8 (2H, d),7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)

Wait, option C has two doublets for the aromatic protons. The 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H, which could be the CH3 attached to the CO. Because COCH3 would have a CH3 that's deshielded but as a singlet. So in option C, the aromatic regions are 7.8 and 7.6, each as 2H doublets, which would fit a para-substituted ring with two substituents.

But wait, what about the singlet in option C? 2.3 ppm for a singlet of 3H would be a methyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like CO. So that makes sense.

But let's make sure. Let me think about the substituents. If the substituents are Cl and COCH3, and they're para, then the ring has Cl in one position and COCH3 in the opposite. The aromatic Hs adjacent to Cl and COCH3 would be different. So each pair would be a doublet.

So the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic region. The COCH3 group would give a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the methyl group (since it's attached to a carbonyl, which is electron-withdrawing, the CH3 would be deshielded, maybe around 2.3 or so).

So looking at the options, option C has 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That fits.

But wait, what about the possibility of substituents being in meta positions? Let me think. If the substituents are in meta, the ring's Hs would be more complex. But in a para substitution, it's symmetric, leading to two doublets. So option C would be correct.

Wait, but let's check other options. Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm. That's a high ppm, which could be an aldehyde proton. But the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. An aldehyde has a strong peak around 2820 and 2720 for the C-H stretch, but the carbonyl is around 1700. Alternatively, a ketone's carbonyl is around 1700. So if the substituent is a ketone (like COCH3), then the IR would have a peak around 1700 cm^-1. So that's possible.

But, the NMR in option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is high. That's more like an aldehyde proton (RCHO), which is a triplet around 9-10 ppm. Wait, no, aldehyde proton is usually a triplet due to coupling with two adjacent protons, but in some cases, like when the aldehyde is adjacent to a substituent, but in this case, I'm not sure. Alternatively, an aromatic proton as a singlet could be a proton between two substituents, but that's less common.

Wait, but if the substituents are on the benzene ring, perhaps in a meta position, and the ring has a remaining proton that's a singlet. Wait, but for a benzene ring with two substituents, the number of protons left depends on substitution. If it's di-substituted, for example, in para, there are two pairs of protons. If in meta, perhaps a single proton is left, but that's only possible if substituents are on adjacent carbons, but that's not di-substituted.

Wait, no. Wait, if substituents are in the 1 and 3 positions (meta), then the ring would have four Hs left. Each substituent would be in positions 1 and 3, so their adjacent positions would have substituent effects. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is not a para substitution but another arrangement.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group attached to an oxygen, like a methoxy group. But no, because the IR shows aromatic-halogen, which is an X attached to the ring. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

So, going back, option C seems to fit. Let's think about the other options.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). Those are more like protons on an ether or something, maybe a CH2O group. But I don't see how that would fit with a carbonyl and a halogen.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). Again, the peaks around 4.8 and 4.6 suggest something like an ethylene group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Not sure how that would fit with the substituents.

So back to the substitution. If the substituents are para, then the NMR would have two doublets for aromatic protons, each integrating to 2H. And the COCH3 group would be a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

So option C's aromatic peaks fit that scenario. The singlet at 2.3 ppm would be the COCH3.

Wait, but wait, in option C, the aromatic peaks are at 7.8 and 7.6, each 2H, d. So that's two doublets, which would happen if the substituents are para. Because in para substitution, the ring's Hs are in two sets of two each, each as a doublet.

So that makes sense. So option C would be the correct NMR.

Wait, but another possibility: the substituents could be in such a way that the ring has more than two substituents, but no, the compound is di-substituted.

Wait, another thought: what if the substituents are a Cl and a carbonyl group that's part of a larger substituent, like a ketone but with more carbons. But in the compound, the total carbons are eight. So benzene (6) plus two substituents, each being one carbon? No, that's not possible because Cl doesn't add any carbons. Wait, the substituents: one is Cl (0 carbons), the other is a carbonyl group attached to a methyl group (COCH3, which contributes two carbons: the C from CO and the CH3). So 6 + 0 + 2 = 8. That fits.

So the structure would be a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3 as substituents.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two pairs of doublets, and the COCH3 would be a singlet at around 2.3 ppm.

So option C's NMR data fits.

But wait, what about option A? It has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which I thought might be an aldehyde. But if the substituent is a ketone (COCH3), then there's no aldehyde. So option A's singlet at 9.9 could be an aromatic proton? But in that case, it's a singlet, which would imply that the H is not next to any others, which might happen if the substituents are in a way that only one H is left. But in a di-substituted benzene, it's more likely to have two substituents leading to either two doublets (para) or a more complex splitting (meta). 

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho position. For example, Cl and COCH3 on adjacent carbons. Then the ring would have two substituents, and the remaining four Hs would be split into two sets of doublets, perhaps. But in that case, the NMR would have more complex splitting, like multiple doublets. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in a way that creates a single aromatic proton. Wait, that's not possible for a di-substituted benzene. It's either two substituents leading to either two pairs of protons (para), or more complex (ortho or meta).

Wait, I think for di-substituted benzene, the number of distinct sets of aromatic protons depends on the substitution. For para, it's two doublets. For meta, it's a triplet and a doublet or something like that. For ortho, perhaps a more complex splitting.

But in our case, option C has two doublets, which suggests para substitution.

So putting it all together, the correct NMR data should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons beyond the benzene ring. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a halogen (likely Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as a methyl ketone (-COCHâ‚ƒ).

The total carbon count matches if one substituent is Cl (0 carbons) and the other is -COCHâ‚ƒ (2 carbons: the carbonyl carbon and the methyl group). This gives a structure consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring, where the substituents (Cl and -COCHâ‚ƒ) are opposite each other. In such a structure, the aromatic protons are split into two sets of doublets due to the symmetry of the para substitution pattern. Additionally, the methyl group of the -COCHâ‚ƒ substituent appears as a singlet in the NMR spectrum at a chemical shift around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is characteristic of an aldehyde proton. However, the substituents are Cl and -COCHâ‚ƒ, not an aldehyde, making this option incorrect.
- **Option B**: Contains peaks characteristic of protons on an ether or similar group, which do not match the expected substituents.
- **Option C**: Shows two doublets for aromatic protons (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for the methyl group of -COCHâ‚ƒ. This matches the expected NMR data for a para-substituted benzene with Cl and -COCHâ‚ƒ.
- **Option D**: Includes peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm, which are inconsistent with the expected substituents.

Thus, the correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, as it aligns with the structure of a para-substituted benzene ring with Cl and -COCHâ‚ƒ substituents.
