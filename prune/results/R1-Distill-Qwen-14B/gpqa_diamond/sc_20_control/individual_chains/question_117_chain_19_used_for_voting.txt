Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That usually happens due to chirality, which requires a chiral center. Alternatively, it could be due to other factors like axial chirality or something else.

Looking at the question, there are four compounds listed, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options give different combinations, so I have to check each compound one by one.

Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have axial chirality. So if the substituents on the two phenyl rings are arranged in a way that their positions create a chiral axis. Wait, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], which means the rings are connected in a way that allows rotation. But if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, it could have optical isomers. Let me think. The substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, and 6,6' have nitro groups. So, on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, in a biphenyl system, if the substituents are in positions that are not symmetrical, could that lead to steric hindrance, making the molecule chiral? Also, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then no. For example, if substituents on both rings are opposite each other, maybe no chirality. But in this case, the substituents at 2 and 2'—could they lead to a situation where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral? Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion or a mirror plane. I'm a bit unsure here, but I think that if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it could exhibit optical isomerism. Since both rings have similar substituents, perhaps they do. So I'll tentatively say yes for compound 1.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw this structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2(COOCH3)OH? No, wait, wait. Propanoate would be CH3CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. Oh wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is glycolic acid. So the ester would be methyl glycolate. Structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, wait. No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO^- but as an ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but the structure would have the OH on the same carbon as the ester group? Or wait, let me think again. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO^-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the CH2 group. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon (the second carbon) has four different groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let's see:

The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon (carbon 2) has what attached? The groups are: -OH, -CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, actually, the structure is more like:

The carbon chain is: COOCH3 is on carbon 3 (since it's propanoate, it's CH2CH2COO-). The 2nd carbon has the hydroxyl group. So the carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so the structure is CH2-CH2-COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2, making it CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon (CH2) has OH, two CH2 groups, and a COOCH3 group? No, wait. The second carbon is a CH2, but if it's 2-hydroxy, it's actually a CH(OH). Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH2COOCH3? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. The formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is: CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH2) with the OH is attached to two CH2 groups, one on each side. Wait, no, the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to the OH, a CH2COOCH3, and two other CH2 groups? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, but with an OH, another CH2, and the COOCH3. So the groups on the central carbon are: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? No, wait, perhaps it's:

The structure is:
CH2(OH) – CH2 – COOCH3.

So the central carbon is CH2, but that can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two identical CH2 groups. Wait, no. Wait, in HOCH2CH2COOCH3, the central carbon (second CH2) is connected to two CH2 groups. Oh, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The second carbon is CH2 with an OH and connected to another CH2 and the COOCH3. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, attached to:

- One OH group,
- One CH2COOCH3 group,
- Two CH2 groups (from either side)?

Wait, no, that can't be because CH2 can only have four bonds. Wait, maybe the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOCH3

So, Carbon 2 is connected to Carbon 1 (CH2(OH)), Carbon 3 (COOCH3), and two H's? Or wait, perhaps that's not correct. Maybe the structure is more like:

O
||
COOCH3 is on Carbon 3. Carbon 2 is CH(OH), connected to Carbon 1 (CH3) and Carbon 3 (CH2COOCH3). Wait no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the molecule as HOCH2CH2COOCH3. In this case, each carbon in the chain is:

Carbon 1: HOCH2-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is CH2, which is connected to HOCH2 on one side and CH2COOCH3 on the other. So the groups on Carbon 2 would be two CH2 groups, which are the same, so it can't be a chiral center. So this molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Are there any other possibilities for chirality in this molecule? Maybe the ester group or something else? Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical in a way that doesn't allow for optical isomerism. So I think compound 2 does not show optical isomerism. Wait, but wait. Another approach: the structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH3CH2COOCH3, but with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Now, looking at the central carbon (the one with OH). The groups attached are:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another CH group (maybe the central carbon is CH with two CH groups attached? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong again.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the middle one) is a CH2. Wait, but that would be connected to two identical CH2 groups, so it can't have four different groups. Oh wait, wait a second. The central carbon is actually CH2 in this case. So each CH2 has two H's. So in that case, that carbon can't be a chiral center because it's attached to two identical groups. So the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Therefore, compound 2 does not show optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is a CH with an OH, making it a chiral center. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it as CH2(OH)—is it attached to another CH2?

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2CH2-OH

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups (one on each side), an OH, and a COOCH3. Wait, but that would mean it's attached to two CH2 groups, so two identical substituents. So, that carbon can't be a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the structure might actually have a chiral center. Let me think again. If the central carbon is CH(OH), then it's connected to:

- CH3 (from one end),
- COOCH3 (from the other end),
- OH,
- and another H.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Propanoate is CH3CH2COOCH3 as the ester. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and another H.

Wait, but that would make four different groups. Oh, wait! Let me count. The middle carbon has:

1. CH3 group (left),
2. COOCH3 group (right),
3. OH group,
4. And a hydrogen (since it's CH(OH)).

So all four substituents are different: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. That makes it a chiral center! Oh, I see. So that carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center, so it can exhibit optical isomerism. So I was wrong earlier. So compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

Wait, that's a big mistake. So I need to correct my earlier thought. So, yes, compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Moving on to compound 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)COPh. It's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is:

Ph-CO-Ph.

The carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygens (from the carbonyl group). Wait, no, the carbonyl is O=C-O. Wait, no, benzophenone is Ph-C-O-Ph? No, wait, no. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O. So it's not a carbon with four substituents but a carbonyl group. So the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded, so it's trigonal, not tetrahedral. Therefore, it can't be a chiral center. Additionally, there are no other chiral centers in benzophenone. So compound 3 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is an acid with two double bonds in a dien structure. Specifically, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. Its structure is CH2CH(COO-)2 in the trans configuration. Or more accurately, the structure is (Z)- or (E)-? Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H, but in the trans configuration. So the structure is O=C(OH)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OH. Wait, no, perhaps it's O=C(OH)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OH? No, wait, I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in trans configuration. Wait, no, wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. Yes, that's right. So, the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond in the trans configuration.

So dimethyl fumarate would be where the -OH groups are replaced by OMe (OCH3). So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Alternatively, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, no, wait. Fumarate is the diethyl ester of (E)-butenedioic acid. So, fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be methyl ester of each of the two carboxylic acid groups.

So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(COOCH3)2. Or maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 and another COOCH3. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the structure being (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. No, wait, wait. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, I think I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. So, the double bond is in the E configuration. So, the groups on each side of the double bond are arranged in a way that gives rise to stereoisomerism, specifically cis or trans.

Wait, but in fumarate, the substituents on the double bond are two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. So, dimethyl fumarate has the structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Since it's a trans (E) isomer, does that mean it has a plane of symmetry? Wait, in fumarate, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The correct structure of fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So, the dimethyl ester would be (CH3O)2C-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. Wait, no, perhaps it's OMe groups on each end.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as having two ester groups on the same side or opposite sides of the double bond. For fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides (trans), so the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but wait, because the double bond is in the trans configuration, does that create a situation where the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. Alternatively, if it lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral.

Wait, for example, if you have a double bond with two different groups on each carbon, and the configuration is such that it doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it can exhibit optical isomerism. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so its structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but no, that's maleic acid. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So, the double bond is between the two CH groups, and each is attached to a COOH group. So, the dimethyl ester would replace the OHs with OMe groups: CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, perhaps I should imagine the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

No, that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3, but that's for the cis isomer (that's maleate), but fumarate is the trans isomer. Therefore, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3, with the double bond in the trans configuration. So the substituents on the double bond are on opposite sides.

Wait, if the two ester groups (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. Because each ester group is opposite the other. So, looking at the molecule, it would be symmetric. So, the molecule would not have any chirality, as it's superimposable on its mirror image. However, wait, is that the case? Let me visualize this. Imagine the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides: so if the double bond is in the middle, each COOCH3 is on opposite sides. So, for example, the left COOCH3 is above the double bond, and the right COOCH3 is below. Would that create a plane of symmetry? Because you could mirror the left and right, and the molecule would look the same. Therefore, the molecule would not be chiral and wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, that doesn't make sense because I've heard that fumarate can have stereoisomers. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between fumarate and maleate.

Wait, maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans. Maleate would have both COOCH3 groups on the same side of the double bond, leading to a possibility of a chiral center or some form of axial chirality. But fumarate, being trans, has them on opposite sides, which would make it achiral, perhaps.

Wait, but fumarate has two ester groups on each end of the double bond. So, in the trans configuration, each COOCH3 is across from each other. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond. So the molecule is not chiral, thus no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, I might be wrong. Another possibility is that the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, then why is dimethyl fumarate often cited as having optical isomerism? Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the structures. Let me think again. No, wait, perhaps in reality, fumarate is the trans isomer, but the molecule itself is not chiral because it's symmetrical. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another thought: in some cases, even if the molecule is symmetrical, if there's an element of asymmetry, it can be chiral. Alternatively, maybe I've made a mistake in assessing the structure. Another possibility is that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the molecule is actually chiral because the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but the rest of the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have optical isomerism. Let me think about another approach: looking for the possibility of cis and trans isomers in the molecule. Wait, no, wait, fumarate itself is the trans isomer, so the dimethyl ester would be the trans ester. But perhaps, in the case of the ester, the substituents on the double bond are such that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents are different on each carbon of the double bond, then the molecule can have stereoisomerism.

Wait, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)OCH3. Wait, no, that's the structure of dimethyl succinate, I think. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up again. Wait, let's get this right.

Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3, but I'm not sure of the exact structure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2-COOCH3, but that's not correct either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about fumarate as (E)-butenedioate. So the structure would have the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So, if the molecule has two identical groups on each end but oriented oppositely, it would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Another approach: let's think about maleic acid, which is the cis isomer. Its dimethyl ester is dimethyl maleate, which is known to have optical isomerism. Wait no, wait: no, wait, dimethyl maleate is a meso compound. Wait, no, wait, dimethyl maleate is a meso compound, meaning it has an internal plane of symmetry and is achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong. Let me try to think again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so its structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When you make the dimethyl ester, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-C(=O)OCH3. So, the molecule now has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. How does this affect symmetry?

Imagine looking at the molecule along the double bond. Each end has a COOCH3 group, and they are on opposite sides. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but this contradicts some of my prior knowledge. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. If it can, then it's achiral. So, in this case, the structure would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting ideas here. Let me try to think of another example. For example, if the substituents on the double bond are different, then the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, both substituents are COOCH3, which are the same. So, perhaps even if they're on opposite sides, the molecule remains achiral due to symmetry.

So, to recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. This compound has two phenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are at positions 2,2' and 6,6'. Let me visualize this. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, the substituents are at positions that are para to each other on each ring. So, each ring has two substituents at positions 2 and 6. Wait, does that create a situation where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry? Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of the substituents creates chirality through axial chirality. Biphenyl compounds can show axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' and 6 and 6'. So, looking at each ring, if the substituents are at 2 and 6 (which are para), then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to the absence of a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, that's symmetric. So, each ring has two substituents para to each other. So, the biphenyl structure might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, the nitro groups are at 6,6' on each ring. So, the substituents are at 6 and 6', which are para, so the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. But wait, if the substituents are at 2 and 2' and 6 and 6', perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents create a lack of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule cannot be mirrored, it would be chiral. But I'm not certain about this. Maybe I should look for another way. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry and thus is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a chiral axis. So, the biphenyl axis could be a chiral axis, leading to axial chirality. In that case, the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. But from what I remember, biphenyl structures with substituents that are not symmetrical can exhibit axial chirality. So, in this case, if the substituents at 2 and 2' are different from those at 6 and 6', the molecule could have axial chirality. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at 2,2' (both are COOCH3) and 6,6' (both are NO2). So, the substituents on each ring are symmetrical. So perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' positions. So, each ring has substituents in the same positions. So, looking from above, the substituents might mirror each other across the central axis. So, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Another thought: Some biphenyl compounds with substituents in certain positions can have axial chirality. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent the molecule from having a mirror plane, the axis could be chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' (which are meta to each other on the same ring?), wait no. Wait, on each ring, substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are para positions on the same ring. So, each ring has two substituents at para positions, and the same for the other ring. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Therefore, I think compound 1 does not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, reviewing the four compounds:

1. No optical isomerism.

2. Yes, because it has a chiral center.

3. No, because no chiral centers or other forms of chirality.

4. No, because it has a plane of symmetry (trans configuration, making it achiral).

Wait, but earlier I thought that compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism, but I'm a bit confused because I thought dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, which is achiral. So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C) 2,3

D)1,2

If only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: maybe compound 4 does show optical isomerism. Let's go back to that.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2, then the substituents on the double bond are two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. So, each substituent is the same. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

But wait, what if the substituents are different? Wait, in fumarate, the substituents on each end are the same, so it's symmetric. So, no chirality.

Therefore, among the four compounds, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1,2,4; option D is 1,2. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1.

Wait, let's think again about compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. So, each ring has two substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Are these positions symmetric?

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So, each ring has a substituent at 2 and another at 6 (para), making each ring symmetrical. Therefore, the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, I think compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of them include only 2. The options are:

A) 1, 2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing fumarate and maleate. Let me think again. Maleate is the cis isomer, right? So, dimethyl maleate would have the two COOCH3 groups on the same side of the double bond. In that case, the molecule would be a meso compound, which is achiral, so no optical isomerism. Fumarate is the trans isomer. So, if the substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but what if the substituents were different? For example, if one end of the double bond has a COOCH3 and the other has a different group, then the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, both ends are COOCH3, so the substituents are the same, leading to a plane of symmetry.

So, in that case, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2.

But according to the options, the only option that includes 2 is A, D, and C. Wait, no. Let's check:

Option A: 1,2,4

Option D: 1,2

Option A includes 2, but also 1 and 4, which I don't think show optical isomerism.

But perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1.

Let me think again. Compound 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, the structure is biphenyl with substituents at 2,2' and 6,6'.

Each phenyl ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are para. The biphenyl is connected via the 1 and 1' positions. So, the substituents are arranged in a way that each ring is symmetrical. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, right? So, it's achiral, no optical isomerism.

Therefore, the only compound showing optical isomerism is 2.

But none of the options include only 2.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B)3 and 4

C)2 and 3

D)1 and 2

So, none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of the compounds.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is such that the substituents are different, then it could be chiral. Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (COOCH3). So, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents are attached in a way that doesn't mirror each other. For example, if the substituents are on the same side (cis), then it's the dimethyl maleate, which is a meso compound and achiral. But if it's the trans isomer, it's fumarate, which I thought is also achiral.

Wait, so perhaps neither maleate nor fumarate exhibit optical isomerism because they're both achiral.

So, back to the problem: which compounds exhibit optical isomerism?

Only compound 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. Therefore, the correct answer would be an option that includes only compound 2. But looking at the options, none do. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing another compound.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate compound 1. Could it exhibit axial chirality? Biphenyl compounds can have axial chirality. In compound 1, the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' positions. Let me imagine the two phenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para. So, the substituents are directly across from each other on each ring. So, the arrangement would be symmetrical. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in compound 4. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer. Could it have stereogenic centers elsewhere? Or perhaps the molecule has a chiral axis.

Wait, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry because the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis. For example, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides, but the rest of the molecule isn't symmetrical, then the molecule could be chiral. But in this case, the substituents are the same on both ends, so the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it this way: if a molecule has identical groups on either side, it's likely to be achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral.

So, in conclusion, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options include only 2. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Let me think again. If the molecule is in the trans configuration, is it possible that it's chiral?

Wait, consider the structure of dimethyl fumarate as (E)-CH2-C(COOCH3)=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not the correct structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2. No, I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the correct structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. No, that's not possible as the structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply three substituents on the double bond, which isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-Ph-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, no, I'm getting stuck.

An alternative approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer and exhibits optical isomerism because it's a trans isomer. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another angle. The question is about which compounds exhibit optical isomerism.

From the earlier analysis, compound 2 definitely does. Compounds 1,3,4 do not. But according to the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1. Maybe it does exhibit axial chirality. Let me think again. If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged such that the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image, it would be chiral.

In compound 1, the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' on each ring. So, each ring has substituents at para positions. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule cannot be mirrored, then it would be chiral.

Imagine the biphenyl structure with substituents at 2,2' and 6,6'. Each substituent is directly opposite on each ring. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the central axis (the line connecting the two benzene rings). Therefore, the molecule is achiral.

So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm back to the same conclusion. So, none of the options seem to match, which implies I must have made a mistake. Perhaps I should think that compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has two enantiomers. If that's the case, then I must have been wrong earlier. So, perhaps it does exhibit optical isomerism.

But why? Because I thought it's symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the double bond are different. Wait, no, in this case, they're both COOCH3.

Hmm. Another approach: look for information about dimethyl fumarate. Wait, I can't actually access external information, so I have to rely on reasoning.

If the substituents on the double bond are the same, the molecule is symmetrical and thus achiral. So, dimethyl fumarate is achiral.

Therefore, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2.

But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit axial chirality. Let's consider the structure: each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So, each ring is symmetrical, but when connected via the 1 and 1' positions, the substituents on each ring could create a chiral axis.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement of the substituents creates a chiral axis. Biphenyl compounds can have axial chirality when the substituents are not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't allow for a plane of symmetry, the molecule can be chiral.

In compound 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 (para). So, each ring is symmetrical, but the way they're connected might create a lack of symmetry in the overall molecule. Wait, no. Because the substituents are on both rings at the same positions (2,2' and 6,6'), the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that does is compound 2.

Looking back at the options, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

So, none of the options include only 2. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a chiral molecule. Let me think about the structure again. If the substituents on the double bond are different, the molecule could be chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are the same on each end, leading to a plane of symmetry. So, no chirality.

Hmm. I'm stuck. But according to my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer and exhibits geometric isomerism, but not optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps it's the meso compound and is achiral. So, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Therefore, the answer must be that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, rechecking the analysis of compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Its structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and a hydrogen.

So, four different substituents, which makes it a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 definitely exhibits optical isomerism.

So, from the four compounds, only 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options include only 2. So, perhaps I need to re-examine the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 4. Alternatively, perhaps compound 4 also exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. No, because in order for a molecule to be a meso compound, it must have at least two chiral centers and a plane of symmetry. But dimethyl fumarate doesn't have chiral centers; it has a double bond with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate has a stereogenic center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think: if the substituents on the double bond are different, the molecule could exhibit E/Z isomerism. But in this case, the substituents are the same, so E and Z would be the same in terms of symmetry.

Therefore, I think I must proceed with the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes compound 2 and 4. But I thought 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center that I overlooked. Let me think about the structure again. Dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Each COOCH3 is attached to the double bond. So, each carbon of the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, because each carbon of the double bond can only have two substituents (apart from the double bond). So, the structure would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Each carbon in the double bond has a CH2 and two COOCH3 groups? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2-C(COOCH3)=C(COOCH3)-CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)COOCH3. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-CH2CH(COOCH3)2. No, I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should give up on this and proceed with what I know. The only compound that definitely has optical isomerism is compound 2. But none of the options have only 2. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 does exhibit axial chirality. Let me think again: the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' on each ring. Each substituent is directly opposite on each ring. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, the conclusion is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2 and 4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the substituents in compound 1 create a chiral axis. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the biphenyl axis is a chiral axis, the molecule would exhibit axial chirality. But if the substituents are symmetrical (like 2,2' and 6,6'), the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, I think I'll have to conclude that the correct option is A) 1,2,4. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should select option D) 1 and 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1. Maybe it does exhibit optical isomerism.

Let me think: if the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' on the biphenyl, which is connected at 1,1', then the molecule could have a chiral axis. Because the substituents are on opposite sides of each ring, perhaps the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, if each substituent is at a position that's not symmetrical with the others, the molecule could have axial chirality. So, perhaps in compound 1, the arrangement of substituents leads to a chiral axis, making the molecule exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, now, I think compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism. Therefore, option D would be the answer.

But earlier I thought that compound 1 doesn't. So, perhaps I should go with this.

So, the final answer would be that compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, making option D the correct one.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which can arise from chiral centers, axial chirality, or other forms of asymmetry.

---

### **Compound 1: Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at the 2,2' and 6,6' positions. Each phenyl ring has a carboxylate group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. The substituents are symmetrically arranged on each ring, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the biphenyl axis. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Compound 2: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exist as non-superimposable mirror images. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### **Compound 3: Benzophenone**

Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule lacks any other sources of chirality, such as axial chirality or stereogenic centers. Thus, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Compound 4: Dimethyl Fumarate**

Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)-CH₂-COOCH₃. The two ester groups (COOCH₃) are on opposite sides of the double bond, creating a plane of symmetry in the molecule. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Compound 1**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (achiral due to symmetry).  
- **Compound 2**: Exhibits optical isomerism (chiral center).  
- **Compound 3**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (no chiral elements).  
- **Compound 4**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism (achiral due to symmetry).

From the given options, the correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**, as compound 1 is now considered to exhibit axial chirality due to the substituents' arrangement, and compound 2 has a chiral center.

**Answer: D**
