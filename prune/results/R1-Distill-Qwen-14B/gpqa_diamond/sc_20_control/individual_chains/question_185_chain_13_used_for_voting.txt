Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. So H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, right? And n is an arbitrary unit vector. Epsilon is an energy constant.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, which are 2x2 matrices. The dot product σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. But when we take the dot product with σ, it's a matrix.

Wait, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are known. For example, each Pauli matrix (like σ_x) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you have a linear combination like (n · σ), would the eigenvalues change based on the coefficients?

Oh, right! For any unit vector n, the operator (σ · n) is a Hermitian matrix, since each Pauli matrix is Hermitian and n is real. The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real. What are the possible eigenvalues here?

Wait, I think I remember that for any unit vector n, the matrix σ · n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because each Pauli matrix has trace zero and determinant -1, so their eigenvalues are ±1. But when you make a linear combination with coefficients that are a unit vector, does that change the eigenvalues?

Wait, no. Let me think. Let me consider a general case. Let me take σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Since the σ's are orthonormal in some sense. If I have σ · n, and I compute its square: (σ · n)^2.

Expanding that, (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. The cross terms would involve products like σ_x σ_y. Oh, but I know that σ_i σ_j = δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k. So, when I square (σ · n), the cross terms will involve terms with σ_i σ_j for i≠j, which are anti-commuting or something.

Wait, but for (σ · n)^2, I can compute that:

(σ · n)^2 = (n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2) + (n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + ... and similar terms for other pairs).

Each σ_i squared is the identity matrix I, because σ_x^2 = I, same for σ_y and σ_z. So the first part is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So that part is I.

The cross terms are 2(n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z). Hmm, but each σ_i σ_j for i≠j is i times the epsilon tensor times σ_k. Wait, so σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k when i≠j, right? So, for example, σ_x σ_y = i σ_z.

So let's compute the cross terms. Let's take n_x n_y σ_x σ_y. That becomes i n_x n_y σ_z. Similarly, other terms: n_x n_z σ_x σ_z would be i n_x n_z (-σ_y) because σ_x σ_z = i σ_y but with a negative because of the permutation. Wait, maybe I should just think about each term:

σ_x σ_y = i σ_z
σ_y σ_z = i σ_x
σ_z σ_x = i σ_y
And the reverse products (like σ_y σ_x) would be -i σ_z, etc.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute (σ · n)^2. Let me think: 

(σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2
= n_x^2 σ_x² + n_y^2 σ_y² + n_z^2 σ_z² + 2(n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z)
= (n_x² + n_y² + n_z^2) I + 2i (n_x n_y σ_z + n_x n_z (-σ_y) + n_y n_z σ_x)
Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, since σ · n is a vector in the space of 2x2 matrices, its square is (σ · n)^2 = I, because for any unit vector n, (σ · n)^2 = I. Because when you square the spin matrices in any direction, you get identity. Let me test this with a specific example. Let's take n along z-axis, so n = (0,0,1). Then σ · n = σ_z. σ_z^2 is I. So yes, in that case, (σ · n)^2 = I.

Similarly, if n is along x-axis, (σ · n)^2 = σ_x^2 = I again. So in general, (σ · n)^2 must be I. So that means that the eigenvalues of (σ · n) must satisfy λ^2 = 1, so λ = ±1. So the eigenvalues of (σ · n) are +1 and -1.

So then, the Hamiltonian H is ε times (σ · n). Therefore, the eigenvalues of H would be ε times the eigenvalues of (σ · n). So that would be ε * 1 and ε * (-1) → eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. So the eigenvalues are ±ε.

Looking at the options:

Option B is +ε and -ε. So the correct answer should be option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To determine the eigenvalues of \(H\), we first analyze the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\).

The operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices:  
\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z,
\]  
where \(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\) since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector. Each Pauli matrix (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) is Hermitian and has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). For any unit vector \(\vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are also \(\pm 1\), as this operator is Hermitian and its square satisfies \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix.

The Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})\) is therefore proportional to \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). The eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\varepsilon\) times the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), which are \(\pm 1\). Thus, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:  
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) — Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).  
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) — Correct, matches the derived eigenvalues.  
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) — Incorrect, introduces an unnecessary factor of \(\hbar/2\).  
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) — Incorrect, does not involve \(\varepsilon\).  

The correct answer is **Option B**.
