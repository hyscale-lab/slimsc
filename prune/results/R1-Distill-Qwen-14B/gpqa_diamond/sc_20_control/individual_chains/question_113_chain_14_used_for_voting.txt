Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one it is based on the given spectra.

First, let's break down the information from each technique.

Starting with the FTIR. The very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests O-H stretching. Because broad peaks in that region are typically due to alcohol or carboxylic acid groups. But the presence of other peaks might help distinguish between them. There are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak usually points to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might indicate something like conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide, but since we don't have nitrogen in the options, maybe it's an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone? Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a substituent. Wait, but 1650 could also be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an enone system or something like that.

Now, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, so that suggests there's an alkene group in the molecule. So the compound has a double bond somewhere.

Looking at the mass spec data: a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what's 45? Let me think. The molecular ion for the compound would be based on its formula. Let me recall the molecular weights of the options:

- C6H12O2: 6*12 +12*1 + 2*16 = 72 +12 +32=116.
- C6H10O: 72+10 +16=98.
- C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.
- C6H12O:72+12 +16=100.

Wait, but the mass spec gives a fragment of 45. So what fragments give m/z 45? Let's think about possible fragments.

45 is the molecular weight for C3H7O (like acetone is 58, but wait, wait, 45 is actually the molecular weight of something else). Wait, 45: Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So 12a + b +16c =45. Let's see: possible combinations. Let's think: 3 carbons would be 36, plus 9 for H and O. Hmm, maybe it's C3H7O? Or perhaps it's a fragment like acetic acid (CH3COOH) is 60, which is too high. Wait, maybe it's a ketone. Like (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is 58. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think, 45 could be a fragment with a carbonyl group. Wait, 45 could be CH3COOCH3? No, that's more. Wait, maybe it's a smaller fragment.

Wait, 45 could be the CH2=CH-O- group, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CO fragment. Wait, 45 could be a methyl group attached to something else. Or perhaps a CH2CH2 group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the molecular ion of a smaller compound within the molecule. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, maybe the fragment is from the ester's decomposition. Alternatively, if it's a beta-keto ester, maybe the fragment is from the keto part.

Wait, another approach: looking at the possible options and their structures.

The options' formulas are:

A) C6H12O2: degrees of unsaturation? Let's calculate. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogens. So for option A: C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU=(2*6+2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so that suggests a double bond. So if DoU=1, and we have a double bond, that's it. So maybe the molecule is a cyclic ether with an ester group or something else?

Wait, let's compute DoU for all options.

Option A: C6H12O2: DoU= (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or ring.

Option B: C6H10O: (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees, which could be two double bonds, or a double bond and a ring, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2: (14-10)/2=2 DoU.

Option D: C6H12O: (14-12)/2=1 DoU.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule must have a double bond, which is one DoU. So options B and C have two DoU each. So perhaps they have either two double bonds or a double bond and a ring.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a strong peak at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl, so that's another DoU. So that would require the molecule to have a carbonyl group (DoU) plus the double bond (so two DoU). So the only option that has two DoU would be B and C.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is probably O-H. So we have either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the presence of a carbonyl group (1700 cm^-1) could suggest an ester, ketone, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but the carbonyl would be around 1700. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually a bit lower, like around 1700, but maybe that's variable. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1730-1750, but sometimes esters can be lower if conjugated.

Wait, but the 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Another possibility is that the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugation. Or maybe the 1650 is part of a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So if the molecule has a carbonyl and a double bond (so two DoU), then the formula must have two degrees. So that would be options B and C.

Looking at the mass spec: fragment at 45. Let's think about which of the options would fragment to 45.

Let's take each option:

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98. So if the molecular ion is at 98, but the fragment is at 45. 45 is exactly half of 90, but 98 is even. Let's see, 98 minus 45 is 53. That doesn't ring a bell. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a fragment that's a ketone or an ester.

Wait, another approach: the mass spec peak at m/z 45 could be the molecular ion of a fragment. Let's think about possible fragments.

45 corresponds to CH3COO- (which would be 45?), but that's 45? Wait, CH3COO- is (CH3)COO^-, so molecular weight is 12+3 +12 +16 +16= 12+3=15 (CH3), 12+16=28 (CO), 16 for O^-? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment that's a ketone like (CH3)2CO. Let me calculate: (CH3)2CO is acetone. Its molecular weight is (2*12)+(6*1)+12 +16= 24 +6 +12 +16=58? Wait, no, that's 2*12 (from two CH3) is 24, plus the ketone group (CO is 28 including O?), wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO. So molecular formula is C3H6O. So molecular weight is 3*12 +6*1 +16 =36 +6 +16=58. So the fragment at 45 is less than that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is CH2=CH-O-something. Or maybe a smaller fragment like an ethyl group attached to something. Alternatively, could it be a carbonyl group with a methyl attached?

Wait, another thought: if the compound has an ester group, like R-O-CO-R', then in the mass spec, possible fragment ions could be the ester's carbonyl group. Or, perhaps the ester breaks into an acylium ion or something.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group with some oxygen. CH3-O- would be 32, but that's not 45. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketone, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let's think about the options:

Option B: C6H10O. The molecular formula would be something like an aromatic compound with a substituent, but if it's C6H10O, that's a degree of unsaturation of 2. So perhaps a benzene ring (which contributes 4 DoU, but wait, benzene has 3 DoU (from the ring). Wait, no, benzene has three double bonds (4n+2, n=2, so 6 pi electrons), so benzene has three DoU. But the options have only two DoU, so that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Or a ketone with a double bond.

Wait, so for the fragment at 45, perhaps the compound has a fragment that's a ketone, like CH3CO- (which is 45? Let me check: 12 + (3*1) +12 +16 = 12+3=15, CO is 28, 15+28=43. No, that's 43. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's CH3COO- (the acetate ion), which would be 45? CH3COO- has a molecular weight of (12+3) + (12+16 +16) = 15 + (44) = 59? No, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's a group like CH2=CH-O-. Let's see: (12*2)+(4*1)+16=24 +4 +16=44. Close but not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is CH2CO, which is 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to an oxygen and another group. I'm not getting it.

Wait, maybe it's the methyl group from an ester. Or perhaps the molecule is something like methyl acrylate, which has the formula C4H6O2. But that's a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from an oxidation of a double bond. Let me think, if the molecule has a double bond, during mass spec, it might undergo some cleavage. For example, in a conjugated diene, sometimes the molecule breaks at the double bond, producing a carbonyl fragment.

Wait, for a molecule like CH2=CHCOOR, which is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The mass spec might break between the double bond and the carbonyl, producing a fragment that's CH2=CHCOO+ (which is 76, I think) or maybe a smaller fragment.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about each possible formula and what their mass spectra might look like.

Option A: C6H12O2. The molecular weight is 116. So, the molecular ion is at 116. If it's an ester (like methyl cyclopentane carboxylate or something), the possible fragments might include the ester's carbonyl group. But what would give 45? Maybe a fragment like (CH3O)COO- but that's 59. Hmm.

Option C: C6H10O2. Its molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +2*16=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion is at 114. The fragment at 45 could be a part of this. 114-45=69. Hmm, doesn't immediately ring a bell. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an ester group, which could fragment into the R-O- group and the COO- group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of the possible structures. Let's think about each option.

Option B: C6H10O. If it's an alcohol with a double bond, like cyclohexene methanol, or something like that. But the IR has a carbonyl peak, which wouldn't be in an alcohol. So that can't be right. Because the IR shows a peak at 1700, which suggests a carbonyl group. So option B is probably not the right one because C6H10O doesn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The IR shows a peak at 1700 and 1650, which suggests a carbonyl. So the compound must have a carbonyl group, which rules out option B (C6H10O) because that formula doesn't include a carbonyl (O is only one). So options A and C and D: wait, option D is C6H12O, which has one O. If it's an alcohol (with the O-H) and a carbonyl (like a ketone), but that would require two O's. Wait, unless it's an aldehyde. Because aldehyde has O in the carbonyl and another O in the -OH? Wait, no. Wait, aldehyde has O in the RCHO group, but if it's an aldehyde and an alcohol, that would require two O's. So for option D, which is C6H12O, that's only one O. So it can't have both a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and an -OH group, because that would require two O's. Therefore, option D is probably out.

So options are A, C.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is 1. So one ring or double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So that would be one DoU (from the double bond). So if the molecule has a double bond and a carbonyl group, that would require two DoU. So that would mean the formula should have two DoU. So option A has one DoU, which can't account for both the double bond and the carbonyl group. So that suggests option A is not correct. Because the DoU calculation for option A is 1 (from (14-12)/2 =1), but the molecule has two functional groups (O-H and carbonyl) which require two DoU. So option A can't be it.

Wait, but wait. DoU refers to the number of rings plus double bonds. So if a molecule has a carbonyl (counts as a double bond) and a double bond (like vinyl group), that's two DoU. But option A only has one DoU, so that's not possible. Therefore, option A's formula can't have both a carbonyl and a double bond. So that leaves option C.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. So that means the molecule has two rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. Since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that's one double bond. The carbonyl is another double bond. So that fits. So option C is a possible candidate.

So the structure would have a carbonyl group and a double bond, plus an O-H (from the IR broad peak). So perhaps it's a beta-keto acid, or an ester with a double bond, or a dienol ester.

Now, considering the mass spec. The fragment at 45. Let's think about option C's possible structures. For example, if the molecule is an ester with a conjugated double bond, perhaps it could fragment into a smaller piece.

Let's imagine the structure: maybe it's something like CH2=CHCOO-R, but let's count the carbons. If the formula is C6H10O2, then let's see. For example, maybe it's methyl acrylate. Acrylic acid is CH2=CHCOOH. The ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. So the formula would be C4H6O2. But we have C6H10O2, which is two more carbons. So maybe it's something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would be C6H10O2. Because:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: the formula is C6H10O2. Let's count it: CH2=CHCOO is three carbons (CH2-CH-COO), then OCH2CH2CH3 is three more carbons. So six in total. Hydrogens: CH2=CHCOO has 3 double bonds (the CH2=CH, then the COO). Wait, but the formula would be C6H10O2. Yes.

In the mass spec, the molecular ion is at 114. If it breaks, perhaps it loses the ethyl group (C2H5) which is 43 (2*12 +5*1=24+5=29; wait, but that's not 45). Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the ester group. Maybe the ester breaks into the acyl part and the alkyl part. The acyl part would be CH2=CHCOO- (which is 72 g/mol: C3H4O2: 3*12=36, 4*1=4, 2*16=32. 36+4+32=72). But 72 is not 45. Alternatively, perhaps a different fragment.

Wait, another possibility: the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which is 6 carbons. If it's a beta-keto ester, like something with structure RCOCOR', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester, but that might not give a fragment at 45.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible fragments that could sum up to 45.

If the molecule is something like CH3CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's four carbons in the ester, but I'm not sure). Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a methyl group attached to the carbonyl. Let's think about acetate esters.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be the result of the loss of the ester group. For example, if the molecule is RCOOR', the loss of R' would give RCOO- which has a molecular weight of (R being, say, propyl: 45? Let me think. If R is CH2CH2COO-? No, maybe R is CH3COO-. Wait, CH3COO- is 45? No, CH3COO- is 60 (CH3:15, COO:45? Wait, CH3 is 15, COO is 44, so total 59). Hmm, not exactly 45.

Alternatively, the fragment could be the (CH2)2COO- group, but that's 58. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a ketene fragment. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3, the molecular weight is 6 carbons (CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons, OCH2CH3 is 2 more, so total 5. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment at 45 comes from a different part of the molecule. For example, if it's a furan ring or something else. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C6H10O2. Because it's the only one that has two DoU, which is needed for the double bond and the carbonyl. So the IR and NMR data support this.

Now, the mass spec. Let's think: if the molecular ion is 114, and the fragment is at 45, perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts. 114-45=69. So the other part is 69. What's 69? Maybe C3H7O2? Or C4H9O? Not sure. Alternatively, it's a small fragment.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. Wait, acetone is 58. Hmm, no. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of something else. Let me compute 45: 45=12*a +1*b +16*c. Let's see: possible combinations.

For a=3, 3*12=36. Then 45-36=9. 9=1*b +16*c. Let's see: possible c=0: 9=1*b → b=9. So that's 3 carbons, 9 hydrogens, no O. Formula is C3H9. But that's not possible because for 3 carbons, the maximum H is 8 for C3H8 (like propane). So c=1: 9-16= -7, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, a=2: 24. 45-24=21. 21=1*b +16*c. Possible c=1: 21-16=5 → b=5. So formula C2H5O. So 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 O. That's possible. So a fragment like CH2CH2O? Or maybe a ketone like (CH3)CO. Wait, (CH3)CO is C2H5O? No, (CH3)CO is actually C2H5O. Wait, that would be a ketone, but that's 58. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another possibility: a=1. 45-12=33. 33=1*b +16*c.

c=1: 33-16=17 → b=17. But that's impossible because for one carbon, maximum H is 3 (CH3). So no. c=2: 33-32=1 → b=1. So formula C1H1O2. Not likely.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I should think of the fragment as something else. Wait, 45 could be a tropylium ion, but that's more around 91. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. Like if the molecule is an ester, R-O-CO-R', the ester could break into R-O-CO+ and R'-. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible functional groups. The compound has a carbonyl, an O-H group, and a double bond.

So it could be a beta-keto acid, which has both a carbonyl and a carboxylic acid group. But beta-keto acids are usually more reactive.

Alternatively, it could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So structure like CH2=CHCOO-R.

In such a structure, during mass spectrometry, the molecule could break at the double bond, leading to a fragment that includes the carbonyl group. For example, the fragment could be CH2=CHCOO+.

What's the molecular weight of CH2=CHCOO+ (which is 72 g/mol: 3 carbons, 4 hydrogens, 2 oxygens? Let me compute: (3*12) + (4*1) + (2*16) =36 +4 +32=72). So 72. But the peak is at 45, so that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment is from the O-CO-O group breaking off. Not sure.

Wait, another idea: maybe the O-H group is part of a cyclic structure, like a cyclic ester (lactone), but that might not give the 45 fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like cyclohexene carboxylic acid. Structure: cyclohexene ring (with a double bond) and a carboxylic acid group. The formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see: cyclohexene is C6H10, plus a carboxylic acid (COOH adds one O and two H's, but wait: cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding COOH would make it C6H10O2. Yes, that fits option C.

In such a structure, the IR would show O-H (broad peak), and the carbonyl (around 1700). The NMR would show vinyl hydrogens (the double bond in cyclohexene). The mass spec: what would that look like? The molecular ion is 114. If it undergoes some cleavage, perhaps losing part of the ring. But the fragment at 45 is still a mystery.

Wait, cyclohexene carboxylic acid: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114. If the molecule breaks between the ring and the carboxylic acid, perhaps we get cyclohexene (C6H10) which is molecular weight 78, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid breaks into COOH (45?), but wait, COOH is 45? Let me compute: COOH is C=O-OH. So formula is COOH: 12 +16 +16 +1= 45? 12 (C) + 3*16 (O) + 1 (H) = 12 +48 +1=61. No, that's not right.

Wait, COOH is (COOH) has molecular formula COOH: actually, it's HOOCC... Wait, no, COOH is -COOH, which has the formula C=O-OH. So the molecular weight of COOH is 12 + 2*(16) + 1 = 45. Because 12 (C) + 32 (O2) + 1 (H) = 45?

Wait, that's correct! Because O is 16. So COOH is C, 2 O in the carbonyl and one O in the hydroxyl. So the formula is C=O-OH: C has 12, O has 16 each. Wait, but COOH is actually OOH-C=O? No, it's O=C-O-OH. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-O-H. So the molecular formula is CHO2H. So, the formula is CHO2H. So molecular weight is 12 + 16*2 + 1= 12+32+1=45. So the COOH group has a molecular weight of 45.

Ah! So in the mass spec, if the molecule breaks off the COOH group, that would give a fragment at m/z 45. So the parent ion (114) loses the cyclohexene part (which would be C6H10- but that's 78), but wait, 114-78=36. But the fragment is 45. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks in such a way that the COOH group is a fragment. So if the molecular ion (114) breaks into COOH (45) and the rest (69). So 114=45+69.

So the fragment at 45 is the COOH group.

That makes sense! So the structure is cyclohexene carboxylic acid (C6H10O2), which explains all the data:

- FTIR: O-H (broad, 3000), carbonyl (1700), and maybe the conjugated double bond (1650). Or the 1650 could be the cyclohexene's C=C.

- 1H NMR: vinyl protons (the double bond in cyclohexene).

- Mass spec: fragment at 45 corresponds to the COOH group.

So the correct formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol. Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond or aromatic system. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, confirming the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is consistent with the molecular weight of a carboxylic acid group (COOH).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **C₆H₁₂O₂ (Option A):**  
   Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This formula accounts for either one ring or one double bond. However, the compound must have both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens), requiring two DoU. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

2. **C₆H₁₀O (Option B):**  
   Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This formula could account for two double bonds or a double bond and a ring. However, the compound must also have a carbonyl group (C=O), which requires oxygen. Since this formula only contains one oxygen atom, it cannot have both an O-H group and a carbonyl group. Therefore, this option is ruled out.

3. **C₆H₁₀O₂ (Option C):**  
   Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This formula accounts for two double bonds or a double bond and a ring. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens) aligns with this DoU. Additionally, the mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 corresponds to the COOH group, which has a molecular weight of 45. This option is consistent with all the data.

4. **C₆H₁₂O (Option D):**  
   Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. Similar to Option A, this formula can only account for one double bond or one ring. Since the compound must have both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond, this option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two degrees of unsaturation to accommodate both a carbonyl group and a double bond. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with the COOH group. Therefore, the correct formula is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

Answer: C
