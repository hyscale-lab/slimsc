Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics question about energy levels and their distinguishability. Hmm, the question says two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play here, especially the energy-time uncertainty principle. Oh right, the principle states that the uncertainty in energy (delta E) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (delta t) is approximately equal to Planck's constant over 2π. So, delta E * delta t ≈ h/(2π). 

But wait, Planck's constant is h = 6.626e-34 J·s. So, delta E is roughly h/(delta t * 2π). But sometimes people approximate it as delta E ≈ h/(4π delta t), but maybe that's for natural units. I should check the formula.

Wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle is often written as delta E * delta t ≈ ħ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ħ = h/(2π). So ħ is about 1.055e-34 J·s. So delta E ≈ ħ / delta t.

But wait, I think the lifetime of the state is related to the uncertainty in time. If a state has a lifetime tau, then the uncertainty in energy would be approximately ħ / tau. So, the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than this uncertainty for them to be distinguishable.

So, the energy difference Delta E should be greater than or approximately equal to h/(2π tau), where tau is the uncertainty in time, which would be the lifetime itself for each state? Hmm, but wait, the question is about the two states having different lifetimes. So which lifetime do I use?

Wait, the problem is about two energy levels, each with their own lifetimes. So, the idea is that the energy difference between them needs to be such that the natural linewidths (broadening) of each state are small enough that their separation is detectable.

Alternatively, maybe the minimum detectable energy difference is determined by the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime. Because the shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty. So, the energy resolution is limited by the state with the shorter lifetime, right? Because if one state is very short-lived, its energy is spread out more, so the separation needs to be larger than the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime.

So, the shorter the lifetime (tau), the larger the uncertainty (delta E = ħ / tau). So, in this case, E1 has a lifetime of 1e-9 seconds, which is shorter than E2's 1e-8. So the uncertainty from E1 would be higher. So, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this uncertainty to be distinguishable.

Wait, no. Oh wait, no, because the energy difference is what we're trying to find. Let me think again. The energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state? Or perhaps greater than the uncertainty of the shorter lifetime.

Wait, the energy resolution is roughly delta E = ħ / tau. So, to resolve two states, their energy separation must be larger than this. But which tau to use? Since we have two states, each with their own lifetimes, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter of the two. Because the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty. So, if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty from E1, then it should be resolvable regardless of E2's uncertainty.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think through an example.

If E1 has tau1 = 1e-9 s, its uncertainty is delta E1 = ħ / tau1. E2 has tau2 = 1e-8 s, uncertainty delta E2 = ħ / tau2. Since tau2 is larger, delta E2 is smaller. So, the dominant uncertainty comes from E1.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 (which is |E2 - E1|) must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or just greater than the larger uncertainty? Wait, I'm not sure. I think in spectroscopy, the resolving power depends on the instrument's resolution, but in this question, the two states themselves have different linewidths. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the natural linewidth of each state, which is proportional to 1/tau. So, to resolve two states, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their natural linewidths. Because if the lines are too close, their broadening (from their lifetimes) would overlap.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me recall. The natural linewidth is delta E = ħ / tau. So for E1, delta E1 = ħ / 1e-9. For E2, delta E2 = ħ / 1e-8. Therefore, delta E2 is ten times smaller than delta E1.

So, for the two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties: Delta E > delta E1 + delta E2.

Wait, but Delta E is the actual energy difference between E2 and E1. So let me calculate that.

Compute delta E1: ħ is approx 1e-34 J·s. So delta E1 = 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25 J. Convert J to eV: 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So delta E1 = 1e-25 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.25e-7 eV. So about 6e-7 eV.

Delta E2 = 1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26 J → 1e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.25e-8 eV.

So sum would be about 6.25e-7 + 6.25e-8 ≈ 6.875e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than ~7e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, the choices are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, and 1e-8 eV.

Wait, none of the options are near 1e-7 eV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger energy uncertainty, so the energy difference must be larger than this. Because if the energy difference is larger than delta E1, then E2 will be resolved from E1.

Wait, but let me think again. If E1 has a delta E1 of 6e-7 eV, then the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than that to be distinguishable.

So, the energy difference Delta E must be > delta E1, which is about 6e-7 eV.

But looking at the options, none of them are above 1e-4 eV except option C. Wait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6e-7 eV (which is 0.0000006 eV), so that would suffice. But the other options are smaller.

Wait, but the problem says we want to clearly distinguish the two levels. So, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty, right? So for example, if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 6e-7 eV (since 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 6e-7), then the two levels are resolvable.

So then, the possible options that are larger than 6e-7 eV would be C) 1e-4 eV and perhaps A) 1e-9 is 0.001e-6, which is smaller than 6e-7, so it wouldn't be sufficient.

Wait, no, wait: 6e-7 is 6 x 1e-7 = 0.0000006 eV. 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger. So option C would work.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the question is phrased as "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So any of the options that are larger than the required delta E would be correct.

But looking at the options, the only one that is larger than 6e-7 eV is option C (1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8 eV, but wait, 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 1e-8. Wait, 6e-7 is 6e-7 = 0.6e-6, 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4. So 1e-4 is much larger than 6e-7.

So, the correct answer should be C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps the correct formula uses the time of the measurement system. Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the lifetimes and the energy differences in terms of the Fourier transform. The energy difference is the inverse of the correlation time, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime. So, delta E = ħ / tau1, where tau1 is the shorter lifetime, 1e-9 s.

Wait, let me recalculate delta E with tau1.

delta E1 = ħ / tau1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J. Converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approx 6.56e-7 eV ≈ 6.6e-7 eV.

So delta E is about 6.6e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than this, so looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 6.6e-7 eV. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.6e-7 eV (0.00000066 eV).

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference that allows the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly resolved, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The principle states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar,
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

The two states have lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting these to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E > 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, compare this with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is also much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is much larger than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is slightly smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the only option that satisfies the condition for the energy difference to be clearly resolved is **Option C**.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics question about energy levels and their distinguishability. Hmm, the question says two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty principle comes into play here, especially the energy-time uncertainty principle. Oh right, the principle states that the uncertainty in energy (delta E) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (delta t) is approximately equal to Planck's constant over 2π. So, delta E * delta t ≈ h/(2π). 

But wait, Planck's constant is h = 6.626e-34 J·s. So, delta E is roughly h/(delta t * 2π). But sometimes people approximate it as delta E ≈ h/(4π delta t), but maybe that's for natural units. I should check the formula.

But wait, I think the lifetime of the state is related to the uncertainty in time. If a state has a lifetime tau, then the uncertainty in energy would be approximately ħ / tau. So, the energy difference between the two states needs to be larger than this uncertainty for them to be distinguishable.

So, the energy difference Delta E should be greater than or approximately equal to h/(2π tau), where tau is the uncertainty in time, which would be the lifetime itself for each state? Hmm, but wait, the question is about the two states having different lifetimes. So which lifetime do I use?

Wait, the problem is about two energy levels, each with their own lifetimes. So, the idea is that the energy difference between them needs to be such that the natural linewidths (broadening) of each state are small enough that their separation is detectable.

Alternatively, maybe the minimum detectable energy difference is determined by the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime. Because the shorter the lifetime, the larger the uncertainty. So, the energy resolution is limited by the state with the shorter lifetime, right? Because if one state is very short-lived, its energy is spread out more, so the separation needs to be larger than the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime.

So, the shorter the lifetime (tau), the larger the uncertainty (delta E = ħ / tau). So, in this case, E1 has a lifetime of 1e-9 seconds, which is shorter than E2's 1e-8. So the uncertainty from E1 would be higher. So, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this uncertainty to be distinguishable.

Wait, no. Oh wait, no, because the energy difference is what we're trying to find. Let me think again. The energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state? Or perhaps greater than the uncertainty of the shorter lifetime.

Wait, the energy resolution is roughly delta E = ħ / tau. So, to resolve two states, their energy separation must be larger than this. But which tau to use? Since we have two states, each with their own lifetimes, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter of the two. Because the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty. So, if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty from E1, then it should be resolvable regardless of E2's uncertainty.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think through an example.

If E1 has tau1 = 1e-9 s, its uncertainty is delta E1 = ħ / tau1. E2 has tau2 = 1e-8 s, uncertainty delta E2 = ħ / tau2. Since tau2 is larger, delta E2 is smaller. So, the dominant uncertainty comes from E1.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 (which is |E2 - E1|) must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or just greater than the larger uncertainty? Wait, I'm not sure. I think in spectroscopy, the resolving power depends on the instrument's resolution, but in this question, the two states themselves have different linewidths. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the natural linewidth of each state, which is proportional to 1/tau.

Because if the lines are too close, their broadening (from their lifetimes) would overlap.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me recall. The natural linewidth is delta E = ħ / tau. So for E1, delta E1 = ħ / 1e-9. For E2, delta E2 = ħ / 1e-8. Therefore, delta E2 is ten times smaller than delta E1.

So, for the two energy levels to be distinguishable, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties: Delta E > delta E1 + delta E2.

Wait, but Delta E is the actual energy difference between E2 and E1. So let me calculate that.

Compute delta E1: ħ is approx 1e-34 J·s. So delta E1 = 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25 J. Convert J to eV: 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So delta E1 = 1e-25 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.25e-7 eV. So about 6e-7 eV.

Delta E2 = 1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26 J → 1e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.25e-8 eV.

So sum would be about 6.25e-7 + 6.25e-8 ≈ 6.875e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than ~7e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, the choices are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, and 1e-8 eV.

Wait, none of the options are near 1e-7 eV. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger energy uncertainty, so the energy difference must be larger than this. Because if the energy difference is larger than delta E1, then E2 will be resolved from E1.

Wait, but let me think again. If E1 has a delta E1 of 6e-7 eV, then the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than that to be distinguishable.

So, the energy difference Delta E must be > delta E1, which is about 6e-7 eV.

But looking at the options, none of them are above 1e-4 eV except option C. Wait, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6e-7 eV (which is 0.0000006 eV), so that would suffice. But the other options are smaller.

Wait, but the problem says we want to clearly distinguish the two levels. So, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty, right? So for example, if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 6e-7 eV (since 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 6e-7), then the two levels are resolvable.

So then, the possible options that are larger than 6e-7 eV would be C) 1e-4 eV and perhaps A) 1e-9 is 0.001e-6, which is smaller than 6e-7, so it wouldn't be sufficient.

Wait, no, wait: 6e-7 is 6 x 1e-7 = 0.0000006 eV. 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger. So option C would work.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the question is phrased as "could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So any of the options that are larger than the required delta E would be correct.

But looking at the options, the only one that is larger than 6e-7 eV is option C (1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8 eV, but wait, 1e-4 is 1e4 times larger than 1e-8. Wait, 6e-7 is 6e-7 = 0.6e-6, 1e-4 is 1e-4 = 1e-4. So 1e-4 is much larger than 6e-7.

So, the correct answer should be C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps the correct formula uses the time of the measurement system. Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the lifetimes and the energy differences in terms of the Fourier transform. The energy difference is the inverse of the correlation time, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty from the shorter lifetime. So, delta E = ħ / tau1, where tau1 is the shorter lifetime, 1e-9 s.

Wait, let me recalculate delta E with tau1.

delta E1 = ħ / tau1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J. Converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approx 6.56e-7 eV ≈ 6.6e-7 eV.

So delta E is about 6.6e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be larger than this, so looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 6.6e-7 eV. Because 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.6e-7 eV (0.00000066 eV).

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference that allows the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly resolved, we use the energy-time uncertainty principle. The principle states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar,
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). For a quantum state with lifetime \( \tau \), the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau}.
\]

The two states have lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting these to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E > 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, compare this with the given options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is also much smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is much larger than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is slightly smaller than \( 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the only option that satisfies the condition for the energy difference to be clearly resolved is **Option C**.

Answer: C
