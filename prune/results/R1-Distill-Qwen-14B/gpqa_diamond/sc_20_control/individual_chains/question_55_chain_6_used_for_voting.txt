Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. I remember that NMR is all about the protons and how they split each other's signals based on their neighboring protons. 

The unknown compound is one of four possible esters: Cis or Trans for propenyl or butenyl acetate. Hmm, wait, propenyl is like CH2=CHCH2- and butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or similar. But wait, I think propenyl is allyl, like CH2=CH2CH- maybe, but not sure. Anyway, the options are acetates, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, acetate is OAc, so it's R-O-COCH3. So the R group is either propenyl or butenyl, and whether it's cis or trans refers to the double bond configuration.

Wait, no, wait. The ester would be the acetyloxy group attached to the propenyl or butenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. But wait, no, that's not right. Propenyl acetate would have the ester group as OAc attached to the propenyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3? Or is it CH2=CH-O-COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, acetate is OAc, so the structure for propenyl acetate is propenyl-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. The acetate ester is the acetyl group attached to the oxygen. So the structure is R-O-COCH3, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me correct that. The acetate ester is formed by replacing the -OH in acetic acid with an -OR group, where R is the alkyl or alkenyl group. So the structure is R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. When you esterify it, you replace the -OH with an -OR group. So the ester would be CH3CO-O-R, right? So R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So for propenyl acetate, R would be CH2CH2CH2- but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Wait, but maybe the double bond is in a different position. Or maybe the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3? Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O, so it's CH3CO-O-R. So R is the propenyl group, which could be CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I should draw this out in my mind. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3 for propenyl acetate. Or perhaps it's CH2=CH-O-COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Because propenyl is the three-carbon group. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the ester oxygen is attached to the propenyl group. 

But the question is about the NMR. So let's look at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

So, the protons in the acetate group (the methyl) would be a singlet. The 2.1 ppm is a singlet of 3H, which is probably the OCH3 (OAc) group. Because the acetate group is CH3CO-O-R, the methyl is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet. So that's correct.

Then, the next signal is 5.5 ppm, a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, that's tricky. And 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of 16 Hz. Wait, 16 Hz is a large coupling; that suggests a trans coupling in a double bond. Because coupling across a double bond is usually trans and can be around 10-18 Hz, maybe.

So let me think about the possible structures. For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But wait, that's not possible because the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. Or wait, maybe it's (Z) or (E) isomer for the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, but the question is about butenyl or propenyl. So let me think about the NMR signals.

The 7.0 ppm peak is one proton, doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests a vinyl proton, perhaps in a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets, which is a bit more complex. A doublet of quadruplets implies that the proton is coupled to two sets of neighboring protons, perhaps. Wait, a doublet of quadruplets would mean it's split into a doublet (from one coupling) and each of those is split again into a quartet (from another coupling), but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, the 5.5 ppm could be a proton that's adjacent to two different sets of protons. For instance, perhaps a CH that's next to two different groups.

Wait, perhaps it's an allylic position. Let's think: the structure could have a double bond, and the protons adjacent to it would have certain coupling.

Let me consider the possible structures.

First, let's think about propenyl acetate. Its structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Wait, no, that's not correct because the propenyl group would have the double bond. So the correct structure for propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group.

In that structure, the propenyl group would have two sets of protons: those on the CH2 groups and the CH group.

But let's think about the possible coupling in the double bond. In propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would be a four-carbon chain, but propenyl is three carbons. Oh, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. No, wait, that's four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Acetate is CH3CO-O-R, where R is the propenyl group.

Propenyl group is -CH2-CH=CH2. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's five carbons in the ester. No, no, wait. The propenyl group is three carbons: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, making the ester CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Hmm, maybe it's more accurate to write it as CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. 

In that case, the propenyl group has a double bond between C1 and C2. The protons on C2 would be adjacent to the oxygen. Let me think about the protons on the CH2 and the CH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, so the oxygen is attached to the CH2 group, which is next to the double bond.

In that case, the CH2 group (the one attached to oxygen) would have two protons, but wait, the NMR shows a peak at 5.5 ppm, which is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, maybe that's the proton adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an allyl group attached to the oxygen. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. Let's see the protons on the CH2 groups.

The protons on the CH2 next to the oxygen (OCH2CH=CH2) would be split based on neighboring protons. The CH2 next to the oxygen would have two protons, but in the NMR, I don't see a peak for 2H. Hmm. Wait, but the 5.5 ppm is a single proton. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the protons on the CH2 groups are as follows: the CH2 attached to oxygen (OCH2CH=CH2), the CH=CH2 part. So the CH2 after the oxygen would be O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the protons on the CH2 adjacent to oxygen are two protons, which would be a quartet or something else. But in the given NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is a single proton, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the double bond is between the two middle carbons, like CH2CH2CH2 but with the double bond elsewhere? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-O-COCH2CH2CH3. No, that's for butenyl, but the question includes propenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (Z) or (E) propenyl acetate.

Now, let's consider the NMR signals.

Looking at the 7.0 ppm peak: 1H, d, J=16 Hz. That suggests a proton that's adjacent to another proton across a double bond, with a trans configuration. Because coupling across a double bond is trans, so a large J (~16 Hz) would be typical.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) is a bit confusing. Dq stands for doublet of quadruplets, which implies that this proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Let me think: perhaps this is a vinyl proton adjacent to another proton and maybe some allylic coupling.

Wait, in the structure CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, the CH2 next to the oxygen would have two protons, but the CH=CH would have two protons. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. In that case, the CH2 attached to the oxygen (OCH2) has two protons which would be split by the adjacent CH=CH group. But in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a single proton, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond, so that can't be right. No, wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl. So butenyl would have a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structures for the options.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

But I'm a bit confused about the structures. Let's clarify:

Butenyl is a four-carbon group. So butenyl acetate would have the structure CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, but butenyl would have the double bond in the chain. For example, but-1-enyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-COCH3, but but-2-enyl would be CH2CH=CHCH2-O-COCH3. Hmm, but let's think about the possible structures.

Alternatively, butenyl groups can be either but-1-enyl or but-2-enyl. Similarly for propenyl.

In any case, let's think about the NMR.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz.

In a double bond, the two protons on each end would couple with each other. For a trans configuration, the coupling (J) would be higher. So in the case of a trans double bond (E), each proton would be a doublet with J around 14-18 Hz.

So the 7.0 ppm peak is likely a proton on a trans double bond. But wait, why only one proton? Hmm, perhaps that's because the other proton is equivalent, so it's split into a doublet.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. Then the CH2 next to the oxygen has two protons, and the CH=CH has two protons. But the NMR shows only one proton at 7.0 ppm. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3, but that's butenyl. Wait, no, butenyl would have four carbons, but that would be a four-carbon group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH=CH-O-COCH3, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the number of protons in each signal.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with 1H. So that's one proton. So perhaps that's a vinyl proton, and the adjacent proton is another one, but maybe it's a triplet or something else. Alternatively, maybe the other proton is equivalent, so in a trans situation, each proton would be a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an allyl group where one proton is split into a doublet by a neighboring proton, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of the possible structures. For propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 of the propenyl group. The protons on C3 (CH2) would be CH2, but in this structure, the CH2 is on C3, attached to CH=CH2.

Wait, in that case, the protons on the CH2 group would be next to the double bond. The CH2 would have two protons, perhaps as a triplet or something else. But in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a single proton. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-O-COCH2CH2CH3. No, that's for butenyl. Wait, but the options include both propenyl and butenyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to analyze the splitting patterns.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. So this proton is coupled to one other proton, which is probably across the double bond. So that suggests the structure has a double bond where each end has one proton. Like CH2=CH-, but wait, that would have two protons on each carbon. Hmm, no, wait, no. Wait, CH2=CH- would have two protons on each carbon, but if one end is CH3, like CH2=CHCH3, then each end would have two protons except the CH3 end which has three. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a proton on each end of the double bond. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-O-COCH3, but that's not possible because that would be a two-carbon chain, which is ethyl, but the propenyl is three carbons. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group, and the oxygen is attached to C3 (CH2-O-COCH3).

In that case, the CH2 next to the oxygen (CH2-O) would have two protons. The CH=CH would have two protons on each end. Wait, no, in CH2=CHCH2-O..., the middle is CH=CH, so the protons on the CH are each CH2 and CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the protons on the CH2 next to the oxygen are two, and the CH=CH has two on each end.

Wait, but the NMR shows only one proton at 7.0 ppm. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a single proton on each end of the double bond. But that's not possible unless it's a CH=CH group, but that would require substituents on each end.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with CH2 on C3. So the CH2 on C3 would have two protons. The CH on C2 would have one proton, but wait, no, that's not possible because CH would require a single bond. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. So the propenyl group is CH2CH=CH2. Then, the CH2 next to the oxygen has two protons. The CH=CH2 end has two protons on the CH2.

Wait, but the 7.0 ppm is a doublet for 1H. So perhaps that's the proton on the CH2 next to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. The CH2 on C3 (next to oxygen) has two protons. The CH on C1 would have one proton, but wait, that's impossible because that would be a CH2 group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the coupling. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests coupling to one other proton, likely across a double bond. So perhaps the structure has a proton on each end of the double bond, and each is coupled with the other. But each would be a doublet. But why is the 7.0 ppm only one proton?

Ah, wait, maybe it's a trans coupling, but perhaps in a di-substituted double bond, each end has one proton. For example, if the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2, but the CH would have one proton. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. In this case, the CH2 next to the oxygen (OCH2CH=CH2) has two protons, and the CH=CH2 end has two protons. But the 7.0 ppm is a doublet for one proton, so maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere else, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. The CH2 next to oxygen (C3) has two protons, and the CH=CH2 (C2 and C3) has two protons on C2 and one on C3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3. But that would make it a butenyl group, I think. So that would be butenyl acetate. Hmm, but that's four carbons.

Wait, but the options include both propenyl and butenyl. So let's think about the number of signals.

The NMR has four signals:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16)

5.5 ppm (1H, dq)

2.1 (3H, s)

1.6 (3H, d)

The 2.1 ppm is a singlet, which is likely the OAc methyl group.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet with 3H. Hmm, that's a triplet of some sort? Wait, no, it's a doublet. So 3H as a doublet. Maybe a methyl group attached to a CH2 group. For example, CH2CH(CH3) or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-O-COCH3. But that would be a four-carbon group, making it butenyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which could be a CH2CH3 group where the CH2 is adjacent to another CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3 (propenyl acetate). Then, the CH2 next to oxygen would have two protons, but the CH2 on the other end (CH2CH=CH2) would have two protons as well. But the NMR shows only 3H as a doublet at 1.6 ppm, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. But that's butenyl acetate. In that case, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end. But that would mean each of those protons would be a doublet with J ~16 Hz. But in the NMR, we have a single proton at 7.0 ppm.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the signals.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) suggests a vinyl proton with a trans coupling. So perhaps the structure has a double bond with a trans configuration, leading to a large J.

The 5.5 ppm (dq) is a bit tricky. A doublet of quadruplets implies that the proton is split by two different sets of couplings. Let's think about what that could mean. Maybe this proton is next to two different types of protons, each with a different coupling constant.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a triplet of some sort. Wait, no, it's a doublet. So maybe it's a CH2CH3 group where the CH2 is adjacent to another CH group. For example, if the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)-O-COCH3, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a CH group. So it's -CH2-CH(CH3). So the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have one. Then, the CH2 would split into a triplet because of coupling with the CH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3, but that's five carbons, which is not propenyl or butenyl. I'm getting a bit lost.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3 (propenyl acetate). In this case:

- The CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2CH=CH2) has two protons. These protons would be next to the CH=CH2 group.

- The CH=CH2 group has two protons on the CH2 end and one on the CH end? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling between the protons. The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) could be a proton that's coupled to another proton across the double bond. So perhaps it's a trans coupling in a di-substituted double bond.

The 5.5 ppm (dq) could be a proton next to two different protons, leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is next to another CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3, but that's butenyl, with a double bond between C2 and C3. In that case, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end. But then the 7.0 ppm would be a doublet for each proton on the CH=CH, but in the NMR, it's only one proton. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, but that's an alkyne, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible options and their structures.

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate.

Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2.

In the structure, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons. The CH=CH2 has two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3.

In this structure:

- The CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons, which are split by the adjacent CH=CH2.

- The CH=CH2 has two protons on each CH group.

Wait, but the NMR only shows one proton at 7.0 ppm. So perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2, but that's not a propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (but that's butenyl acetate, but the options include that as option A and D).

In that case, the double bond would be between C2 and C3, making it but-2-enyl.

In this structure, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end, but perhaps the symmetry would make them equivalent, leading to a singlet, but that's not the case in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)- or (Z)-butenyl acetate.

Wait, maybe I should look for the splitting of the protons.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. So, that's a trans coupling across the double bond.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. Perhaps this is a proton that's next to two different types of protons, maybe one on the double bond and another on an adjacent CH2.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet of 3H. So perhaps that's a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a CH group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH2CH3. But that's a longer chain, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2, which is propenyl acetate.

In this case, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) would have two protons. The CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH. But that doesn't fit with the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (but that's butenyl acetate). Then, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the CH=CH has two protons on each end.

In that structure, the protons on the CH=CH would be trans if it's E (trans) or cis if Z (cis).

If it's trans (E), each proton on the CH=CH would be a doublet with J ~16 Hz, and since they are equivalent due to symmetry, perhaps they would appear as a singlet. But in the NMR, we have a doublet at 7.0 ppm, which suggests it's not equivalent. So perhaps the structure is not symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3, but that's longer than the options provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (propenyl acetate).

In this case, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) would have two protons. The CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm. That could be a CH2CH3 group, perhaps as an allylic group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CHCH2CH3, but that's butenyl, and the options include butenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (butenyl acetate). Then, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end, but perhaps in a trans configuration.

In that case, the protons on each end (CH3-C=CH-CH3) would be trans, leading to a large J (~16 Hz). So each would be a doublet, but if they are equivalent due to symmetry, they would appear as a singlet. But in the NMR, we have a doublet, so perhaps they are not equivalent, which would suggest a cis configuration.

Wait, but cis would have a smaller J, perhaps. Alternatively, the coupling could be between adjacent protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (propenyl acetate). Then, the CH2 next to the oxygen (OCH2) has two protons, and the CH=CH2 has two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

But the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm, which doesn't match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CHCH2CH3. So the CH2CH3 is at the end. Then, the CH2 next to the oxygen would have two protons. The CH=CH would have two on each end. The CH2CH3 would have two protons on the CH2 and three on the CH3.

Wait, but how does that fit the NMR?

The 7.0 ppm would be the protons on the CH=CH, each as a doublet with J=16 Hz. But if they're equivalent, they would be a singlet. But the NMR shows one proton, so perhaps they are not equivalent.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the options and their possible NMR signals.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Let me think about each option:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2, with the double bond in the cis configuration. So the hydrogens on the CH2 and CH would be on the same side.

In this structure, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) would have two protons. The CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 1H doublet at 7.0, which suggests a single proton. So perhaps the structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, with the double bond between C1 and C2.

In cis configuration, the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have two.

Wait, but again, the NMR shows a single proton at 7.0, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that would be butenyl, making it option A or D.

In that case, the CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Perhaps I should consider the number of signals. The NMR has four signals, but the structures might have more or fewer.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is next to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3, but that's longer than the options.

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a CH2CH3 group. So maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.

In that case, the CH2CH3 group would have a triplet or a doublet, but the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Then, the CH2 groups would have their own signals.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the possible coupling for the 5.5 ppm as a doublet of quadruplets.

A doublet of quadruplets would arise if the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons with different J values.

Perhaps the proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, one set with J1 and another with J2, leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

In the structure, perhaps the CH group is adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3 group. So the CH would couple with the CH2 (giving a doublet) and the CH3 (giving a triplet?), leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH group is adjacent to a CH2 and another CH group. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, then the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons, and the CH=CH2 has two protons on CH2 and one on CH.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm, which would be more consistent with a CH2CH3 group attached to a CH2.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the 1.6 ppm is a CH2CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH.

So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2. Then, the CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. Then, the CH2 at the end (CH2CH3) would have two protons, and the CH2 next to oxygen would have two as well. The CH=CH would have two on each end.

But the NMR shows a 3H doublet, which would fit a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.

In that case:

- The CH2CH3 group (1.6 ppm, d) would have two protons on CH2, but the NMR shows 3H as a doublet. Wait, that doesn't fit because CH2CH3 has two protons, but the NMR shows 3H. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3). In that case, the CH(CH3) would have one proton, and the CH2 next to oxygen would have two. The CH=CH would have two protons on each end.

But the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6, which would fit a CH(CH3) group, but that's only one proton. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3 (propenyl acetate). In this case:

- The CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) would have two protons, which would split into a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH=CH2.

- The CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that would result in the given NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a CH=CH group. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3, but again, I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps I should try to match the options with the possible NMR.

Let's consider each option's structure:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2, with the double bond in cis configuration.

In this structure:

- The CH2 attached to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons. These would be next to the CH=CH2 group.

- The CH=CH2 group has two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

But I'm not seeing how that would produce the NMR signals given.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Same structure as option C, but trans configuration.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH2CH3, with the double bond in cis configuration. But wait, that's a five-carbon chain, which isn't correct. But perhaps it's CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (butenyl acetate, four carbons).

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3.

In this structure, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end, but if it's cis, the protons on each end would be on the same side, leading to coupling with J around 16 Hz.

So the protons on each CH would be a doublet, but if they're equivalent, they would appear as a singlet. But the NMR shows a single proton as a doublet, so maybe they're not equivalent, which would suggest a trans configuration.

Hmm, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH2CH3. But that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (butenyl acetate, four carbons).

In this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The CH=CH would have two protons on each end. If it's cis, the protons would be on the same side. So each CH would have a proton that's coupled with the adjacent CH's proton with J around 16 Hz.

In the NMR, each proton would be a doublet. But due to symmetry, perhaps they would appear as a singlet, but the NMR shows a doublet, which suggests they're not equivalent. So perhaps the structure isn't symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (propenyl acetate).

In this case, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons. The CH=CH2 has two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

But I'm not seeing how that would produce the NMR signals given.

Another approach: look at the splitting for the 5.5 ppm (dq).

A doublet of quadruplets (dq) implies that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with their own J values. So perhaps the proton is adjacent to two different types of protons.

In the structure, perhaps the proton is on a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. Then, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end. The CH2CH3 at the end would have two protons on the CH2 and three on the CH3, but the NMR shows a 3H doublet, which would fit the CH2CH3 group.

But I'm not getting closer to the answer.

Perhaps I should think about the number of signals. The NMR has four signals, so perhaps the structure has four unique proton environments.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2.

The environments would be:

1. OAc methyl (singlet at ~2.1 ppm).

2. OCH2: two protons, possibly as a triplet due to coupling with adjacent CH.

3. CH=CH2: two protons on CH2 (could be a triplet) and one on CH (could be a doublet).

But the NMR shows four signals, so perhaps this structure has more environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 protons are split into a triplet, the CH=CH2 protons are a doublet, and the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH2CH3, but that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (butenyl).

In that case:

- OAc methyl: 2.1 ppm (s).

- OCH2: two protons, perhaps as a triplet.

- CH=CH: four protons? No, each CH would have one proton if it's CH=CH.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (propenyl). Then:

- OAc methyl: singlet.

- OCH2: two protons, perhaps as a triplet.

- CH=CH2: two protons on CH2 and one on CH.

But this would produce more signals than the NMR shows.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3, but that's longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (butenyl).

In this case:

- OAc methyl: s at 2.1.

- OCH2: two protons, perhaps as a triplet.

- CH=CH: two protons on each end, but if it's trans, each would be a doublet with J=16.

- CH3 at the end: three protons, perhaps as a triplet.

But in the NMR, we have a 3H doublet at 1.6, which doesn't fit a CH3 at the end.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, but that's an alkyne, which isn't the case.

At this point, perhaps I should look for the answer based on the key features.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz) suggests a trans coupling across a double bond, likely in a di-substituted double bond.

The 5.5 ppm (dq) could be a proton adjacent to two different sets of protons, perhaps a CH group next to a CH2 and a CH3.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. But that's butenyl.

Wait, but the options include both propenyl and butenyl. So if the structure is butenyl, then options A and D are butenyl.

If the structure is butenyl, then the 1.6 ppm would be the CH2CH3 group at the end.

In that case, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.

But I'm not sure how that fits the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3), but that's not matching the options.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) could be a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a CH group. So it's -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

In that case, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2. Then, the CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

But again, I'm not matching the NMR.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but why?

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which is trans coupling. So perhaps the structure has a trans double bond. So the correct option would be Trans-propenyl acetate (option B) or Trans-butenyl acetate (option D).

But looking back, the options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

If the 7.0 ppm is a trans coupling, then the structure must have a trans double bond, which would be either option B or D.

But then, the 5.5 ppm (dq) would be a proton adjacent to two different protons, perhaps.

In Trans-propenyl acetate (option B), the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2 with the double bond trans.

In that case, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons, which would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH=CH2.

The CH=CH2 would have two protons on CH2, which would be a doublet due to coupling with the CH on the other end (J=16 Hz).

But I'm not sure how that would produce the NMR signals given.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Trans-butenyl acetate (option D), which would have a longer chain but a trans double bond.

In that case, the protons on the CH=CH would each be a doublet with J=16 Hz, but whether they appear as a singlet or two separate doublets depends on symmetry.

But the NMR shows only one proton at 7.0, which suggests they're not equivalent. So perhaps the structure isn't symmetric, which would happen in a trans configuration for butenyl acetate.

But I'm not confident.

Another approach: the 5.5 ppm (dq) is a doublet of quadruplets. So it's a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons, each with their own J.

Perhaps this is the CH group in the structure, which is adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3.

For example, if the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.

In this case, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end. The CH2 next to oxygen would have two protons, and the CH2CH3 would have two.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the information I have, I think the correct answer is option C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, no, wait. Because the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which is trans coupling. So that suggests a trans configuration. So the correct option would be either B or D.

If the structure is Trans-propenyl acetate (option B), then the protons on the double bond would be trans, giving a J of 16 Hz.

In that structure, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end, but perhaps they're not equivalent, leading to a doublet.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) Trans-butenyl acetate.

But I'm not confident. I think I'll go with option C) Cis-propenyl acetate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is as follows:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This signal indicates a proton coupled to another proton across a double bond with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), characteristic of a trans configuration in a double bond.
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: A doublet of quadruplets suggests a proton coupled to two different sets of protons, likely in a more complex splitting pattern due to adjacent groups.
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A singlet for 3H, consistent with the methyl group of the acetate (OAc) functionality.
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: A doublet for 3H, likely corresponding to a methyl group attached to a CH2 group.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Cis-butenyl acetate (Option A)**:  
   This structure has a four-carbon chain with a double bond in the cis configuration. The protons on the double bond would be on the same side, leading to smaller coupling constants (J < 10 Hz). However, the NMR data shows a large J = 16 Hz, which is inconsistent with a cis configuration. This option is unlikely.

2. **Trans-propenyl acetate (Option B)**:  
   This structure has a three-carbon chain with a double bond in the trans configuration. The protons on the double bond would be on opposite sides, leading to a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), consistent with the 7.0 ppm signal. The splitting pattern at 5.5 ppm (dq) could arise from a proton adjacent to both the double bond and another group, such as a CH2 or CH3. This option aligns well with the NMR data.

3. **Cis-propenyl acetate (Option C)**:  
   This structure is similar to Trans-propenyl acetate but with a cis configuration. The coupling constant for the double bond protons in a cis configuration would be smaller (J < 10 Hz), which contradicts the observed J = 16 Hz. This option is inconsistent with the NMR data.

4. **Trans-butenyl acetate (Option D)**:  
   This structure has a four-carbon chain with a double bond in the trans configuration. The protons on the double bond would be on opposite sides, leading to a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), consistent with the 7.0 ppm signal. However, the splitting pattern at 5.5 ppm (dq) and the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggest a simpler structure, such as a three-carbon chain, making this option less likely than Trans-propenyl acetate.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data, particularly the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) at 7.0 ppm and the splitting pattern at 5.5 ppm, strongly support the presence of a trans double bond in a three-carbon chain. This matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate (Option B).

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. I remember that NMR is all about the protons and how they split each other's signals based on their neighboring protons. 

The unknown compound is one of four possible esters: Cis or Trans for propenyl or butenyl acetate. Hmm, wait, propenyl is like CH2=CHCH2- and butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or similar. But wait, I think propenyl is allyl, like CH2=CH2CH- maybe, but not sure. Anyway, the options are acetates, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, acetate is OAc, so it's R-O-COCH3. So the R group is either propenyl or butenyl, and whether it's cis or trans refers to the double bond configuration.

Wait, no, wait. The ester would be the acetyloxy group attached to the propenyl or butenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. But wait, no, that's not right. Propenyl acetate would have the ester group as OAc attached to the propenyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3? Or is it CH2=CH-O-COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, acetate is OAc, so the structure for propenyl acetate is propenyl-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. The acetate ester is the acetyl group attached to the oxygen. So the structure is R-O-COCH3, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me correct that. The acetate ester is formed by replacing the -OH in acetic acid with an -OR group, where R is the alkyl or alkenyl group. So the structure is R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. When you esterify it, you replace the -OH with an -OR group. So the ester would be CH3CO-O-R, right? So R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So for propenyl acetate, R would be CH2CH2CH2- but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Wait, but maybe the double bond is in a different position. Or maybe the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3? Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O, so it's CH3CO-O-R. So R is the propenyl group, which could be CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I should draw this out in my mind. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3 for propenyl acetate. Or perhaps it's CH2=CH-O-COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Because propenyl is the three-carbon group. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the ester oxygen is attached to the propenyl group. 

But the question is about the NMR. So let's look at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

So, the protons in the acetate group (the methyl) would be a singlet. The 2.1 ppm is a singlet of 3H, which is probably the OCH3 (OAc) group. Because the acetate group is CH3CO-O-R, the methyl is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet. So that's correct.

Then, the next signal is 5.5 ppm, a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, that's tricky. And 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of 16 Hz. Wait, 16 Hz is a large coupling; that suggests a trans coupling in a double bond. Because coupling across a double bond is usually trans and can be around 10-18 Hz, maybe.

So let me think about the possible structures. For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. But wait, that's not possible because the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. Or wait, maybe it's (Z) or (E) isomer for the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, but the question is about butenyl or propenyl. So let me think about the NMR signals.

The 7.0 ppm peak is one proton, doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests a vinyl proton, perhaps in a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets, which is a bit more complex. A doublet of quadruplets implies that the proton is coupled to two sets of neighboring protons, perhaps. Wait, a doublet of quadruplets would mean it's split into a doublet (from one coupling) and each of those is split again into a quartet (from another coupling), but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, the 5.5 ppm could be a proton that's adjacent to two different sets of protons. For instance, perhaps a CH that's next to two different groups.

Wait, perhaps it's an allylic position. Let's think: the structure could have a double bond, and the protons adjacent to it would have certain coupling.

Let me consider the possible structures.

First, let's think about propenyl acetate. Its structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Wait, no, that's not correct because the propenyl group would have the double bond. So the correct structure for propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group.

In that structure, the propenyl group would have two sets of protons: those on the CH2 groups and the CH group.

But let's think about the possible coupling in the double bond. In propenyl acetate, the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would be a four-carbon chain, but propenyl is three carbons. Oh, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. No, wait, that's four carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Acetate is CH3CO-O-R, where R is the propenyl group.

Propenyl group is -CH2-CH=CH2. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's five carbons in the ester. No, no, wait. The propenyl group is three carbons: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, making the ester CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. Hmm, maybe it's more accurate to write it as CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. 

In that case, the propenyl group has a double bond between C1 and C2. The protons on C2 would be adjacent to the oxygen. Let me think about the protons on the CH2 and the CH groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, so the oxygen is attached to the CH2 group, which is next to the double bond.

In that case, the CH2 group (the one attached to oxygen) would have two protons, but wait, the NMR shows a peak at 5.5 ppm, which is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, maybe that's the proton adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an allyl group attached to the oxygen. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. Let's see the protons on the CH2 groups.

The protons on the CH2 next to the oxygen (OCH2CH=CH2) would be split based on neighboring protons. The CH2 next to the oxygen would have two protons, but in the NMR, I don't see a peak for 2H. Hmm. Wait, but the 5.5 ppm is a single proton. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the protons on the CH2 groups are as follows: the CH2 attached to oxygen (OCH2CH=CH2), the CH=CH2 part. So the CH2 after the oxygen would be O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the protons on the CH2 adjacent to oxygen are two protons, which would be a quartet or something else. But in the given NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is a single proton, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the double bond is between the two middle carbons, like CH2CH2CH2 but with the double bond elsewhere? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-O-COCH2CH2CH3. No, that's for butenyl, but the question includes propenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (Z) or (E) propenyl acetate.

Now, let's consider the NMR signals.

Looking at the 7.0 ppm peak: 1H, d, J=16 Hz. That suggests a proton that's adjacent to another proton across a double bond, with a trans configuration. Because coupling across a double bond is trans, so a large J (~16 Hz) would be typical.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) is a bit confusing. Dq stands for doublet of quadruplets, which implies that this proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Let me think: perhaps this is a vinyl proton adjacent to another proton and maybe some allylic coupling.

Wait, in the structure CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, the CH2 next to the oxygen would have two protons, but the CH=CH would have two protons. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. In that case, the CH2 attached to the oxygen (OCH2) has two protons which would be split by the adjacent CH=CH group. But in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a single proton, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond, so that can't be right. No, wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl. So butenyl would have a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structures for the options.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

But I'm a bit confused about the structures. Let's clarify:

Butenyl is a four-carbon group. So butenyl acetate would have the structure CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, but butenyl would have the double bond in the chain. For example, but-1-enyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-COCH3, but but-2-enyl would be CH2CH=CHCH2-O-COCH3. Hmm, but let's think about the possible structures.

Alternatively, butenyl groups can be either but-1-enyl or but-2-enyl. Similarly for propenyl.

In any case, let's think about the NMR.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz.

In a double bond, the two protons on each end would couple with each other. For a trans configuration, the coupling (J) would be higher. So in the case of a trans double bond (E), each proton would be a doublet with J around 14-18 Hz.

So the 7.0 ppm peak is likely a proton on a trans double bond. But wait, why only one proton? Hmm, perhaps that's because the other proton is equivalent, so it's split into a doublet.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. Then the CH2 next to the oxygen has two protons, and the CH=CH has two protons. But the NMR shows only one proton at 7.0 ppm. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3, but that's butenyl. Wait, no, butenyl would have four carbons, but that would be a four-carbon group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH=CH-O-COCH3, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the number of protons in each signal.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with 1H. So that's one proton. So perhaps that's a vinyl proton, and the adjacent proton is another one, but maybe it's a triplet or something else. Alternatively, maybe the other proton is equivalent, so in a trans situation, each proton would be a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an allyl group where one proton is split into a doublet by a neighboring proton, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of the possible structures. For propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 of the propenyl group. The protons on C3 (CH2) would be CH2, but in this structure, the CH2 is on C3, attached to CH=CH2.

Wait, in that case, the protons on the CH2 group would be next to the double bond. The CH2 would have two protons, perhaps as a triplet or something else. But in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a single proton. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-O-COCH2CH2CH3. No, that's for butenyl. Wait, but the options include both propenyl and butenyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to analyze the splitting patterns.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. So this proton is coupled to one other proton, which is probably across the double bond. So that suggests the structure has a double bond where each end has one proton. Like CH2=CH-, but wait, that would have two protons on each carbon. Hmm, no, wait, no. Wait, CH2=CH- would have two protons on each carbon, but if one end is CH3, like CH2=CHCH3, then each end would have two protons except the CH3 end which has three. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a proton on each end of the double bond. For example, if the structure is CH2=CH-O-COCH3, but that's not possible because that would be a two-carbon chain, which is ethyl, but the propenyl is three carbons. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group, and the oxygen is attached to C3 (CH2-O-COCH3).

In that case, the CH2 next to the oxygen (CH2-O) would have two protons. The CH=CH would have two protons on each end. Wait, no, in CH2=CHCH2-O..., the middle is CH=CH, so the protons on the CH are each CH2 and CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. So the protons on the CH2 next to the oxygen are two, and the CH=CH has two on each end.

Wait, but the NMR shows only one proton at 7.0 ppm. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a single proton on each end of the double bond. But that's not possible unless it's a CH=CH group, but that would require substituents on each end.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with CH2 on C3. So the CH2 on C3 would have two protons. The CH on C2 would have one proton, but wait, no, that's not possible because CH would require a single bond. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2. So the propenyl group is CH2CH=CH2. Then, the CH2 next to the oxygen has two protons. The CH=CH2 end has two protons on the CH2.

Wait, but the 7.0 ppm is a doublet for 1H. So perhaps that's the proton on the CH2 next to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. The CH2 on C3 (next to oxygen) has two protons. The CH on C1 would have one proton, but wait, that's impossible because that would be a CH2 group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the coupling. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests coupling to one other proton, likely across a double bond. So perhaps the structure has a proton on each end of the double bond, and each is coupled with the other. But each would be a doublet. But why is the 7.0 ppm only one proton?

Ah, wait, maybe it's a trans coupling, but perhaps in a di-substituted double bond, each end has one proton. For example, if the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2, but the CH would have one proton. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. In this case, the CH2 next to the oxygen (OCH2CH=CH2) has two protons, and the CH=CH2 end has two protons. But the 7.0 ppm is a doublet for one proton, so maybe I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere else, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. The CH2 next to oxygen (C3) has two protons, and the CH=CH2 (C2 and C3) has two protons on C2 and one on C3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3. But that would make it a butenyl group, I think. So that would be butenyl acetate. Hmm, but that's four carbons.

Wait, but the options include both propenyl and butenyl. So let's think about the number of signals.

The NMR has four signals:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16)

5.5 ppm (1H, dq)

2.1 (3H, s)

1.6 (3H, d)

The 2.1 ppm is a singlet, which is likely the OAc methyl group.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet with 3H. Hmm, that's a triplet of some sort? Wait, no, it's a doublet. So 3H as a doublet. Maybe a methyl group attached to a CH2 group. For example, CH2CH(CH3) or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-O-COCH3. But that would be a four-carbon group, making it butenyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which could be a CH2CH3 group where the CH2 is adjacent to another CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3 (propenyl acetate). Then, the CH2 next to oxygen would have two protons, but the CH2 on the other end (CH2CH=CH2) would have two protons as well. But the NMR shows only 3H as a doublet at 1.6 ppm, so maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3. But that's butenyl acetate. In that case, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end. But that would mean each of those protons would be a doublet with J ~16 Hz. But in the NMR, we have a single proton at 7.0 ppm.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the signals.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) suggests a vinyl proton with a trans coupling. So perhaps the structure has a double bond with a trans configuration, leading to a large J.

The 5.5 ppm (dq) is a bit tricky. A doublet of quadruplets implies that the proton is split by two different sets of couplings. Let's think about what that could mean. Maybe this proton is next to two different types of protons, each with a different coupling constant.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a triplet of some sort. Wait, no, it's a doublet. So maybe it's a CH2CH3 group where the CH2 is adjacent to another CH group. For example, if the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)-O-COCH3, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a CH group. So it's -CH2-CH(CH3). So the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have one. Then, the CH2 would split into a triplet because of coupling with the CH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3, but that's five carbons, which is not propenyl or butenyl. I'm getting a bit lost.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3 (propenyl acetate). In this case:

- The CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2CH=CH2) has two protons. These protons would be next to the CH=CH2 group.

- The CH=CH2 group has two protons on the CH2 end and one on the CH end? No, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling between the protons. The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) could be a proton that's coupled to another proton across the double bond. So perhaps it's a trans coupling in a di-substituted double bond.

The 5.5 ppm (dq) could be a proton next to two different protons, leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is next to another CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3, but that's butenyl, with a double bond between C2 and C3. In that case, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end. But then the 7.0 ppm would be a doublet for each proton on the CH=CH, but in the NMR, it's only one proton. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, but that's an alkyne, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible options and their structures.

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate.

Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2.

In the structure, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons. The CH=CH2 has two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3.

In this structure:

- The CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons, which are split by the adjacent CH=CH2.

- The CH=CH2 has two protons on each CH group.

Wait, but the NMR only shows one proton at 7.0 ppm. So perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2CH2, but that's not a propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (but that's butenyl acetate, but the options include that as option A and D).

In that case, the double bond would be between C2 and C3, making it but-2-enyl.

In this structure, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end, but perhaps the symmetry would make them equivalent, leading to a singlet, but that's not the case in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)- or (Z)-butenyl acetate.

Wait, maybe I should look for the splitting of the protons.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. So, that's a trans coupling across the double bond.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. Perhaps this is a proton that's next to two different types of protons, maybe one on the double bond and another on an adjacent CH2.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet of 3H. So perhaps that's a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a CH group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH2CH3. But that's a longer chain, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2, which is propenyl acetate.

In this case, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) would have two protons. The CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH. But that doesn't fit with the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (but that's butenyl acetate). Then, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the CH=CH has two protons on each end.

In that structure, the protons on the CH=CH would be trans if it's E (trans) or cis if Z (cis).

If it's trans (E), each proton on the CH=CH would be a doublet with J ~16 Hz, and since they are equivalent due to symmetry, perhaps they would appear as a singlet. But in the NMR, we have a doublet at 7.0 ppm, which suggests it's not equivalent. So perhaps the structure is not symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3, but that's longer than the options provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (propenyl acetate).

In this case, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) would have two protons. The CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm. That could be a CH2CH3 group, perhaps as an allylic group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CHCH2CH3, but that's butenyl, and the options include butenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (butenyl acetate). Then, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end, but perhaps in a trans configuration.

In that case, the protons on each end (CH3-C=CH-CH3) would be trans, leading to a large J (~16 Hz). So each would be a doublet, but if they are equivalent due to symmetry, they would appear as a singlet. But in the NMR, we have a doublet, so perhaps they are not equivalent, which would suggest a cis configuration.

Wait, but cis would have a smaller J, perhaps. Alternatively, the coupling could be between adjacent protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (propenyl acetate). Then, the CH2 next to the oxygen (OCH2) has two protons, and the CH=CH2 has two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

But the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm, which doesn't match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CHCH2CH3. So the CH2CH3 is at the end. Then, the CH2 next to the oxygen would have two protons. The CH=CH would have two on each end. The CH2CH3 would have two protons on the CH2 and three on the CH3.

Wait, but how does that fit the NMR?

The 7.0 ppm would be the protons on the CH=CH, each as a doublet with J=16 Hz. But if they're equivalent, they would be a singlet. But the NMR shows one proton, so perhaps they are not equivalent.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the options and their possible NMR signals.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Let me think about each option:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2, with the double bond in the cis configuration. So the hydrogens on the CH2 and CH would be on the same side.

In this structure, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) would have two protons. The CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 1H doublet at 7.0, which suggests a single proton. So perhaps the structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, with the double bond between C1 and C2.

In cis configuration, the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have two.

Wait, but again, the NMR shows a single proton at 7.0, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that would be butenyl, making it option A or D.

In that case, the CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Perhaps I should consider the number of signals. The NMR has four signals, but the structures might have more or fewer.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is next to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3, but that's longer than the options.

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a CH2CH3 group. So maybe the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.

In that case, the CH2CH3 group would have a triplet or a doublet, but the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Then, the CH2 groups would have their own signals.

But I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the possible coupling for the 5.5 ppm as a doublet of quadruplets.

A doublet of quadruplets would arise if the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons with different J values.

Perhaps the proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons. For example, one set with J1 and another with J2, leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

In the structure, perhaps the CH group is adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3 group. So the CH would couple with the CH2 (giving a doublet) and the CH3 (giving a triplet?), leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH group is adjacent to a CH2 and another CH group. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3, then the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons, and the CH=CH2 has two protons on CH2 and one on CH.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm, which would be more consistent with a CH2CH3 group attached to a CH2.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the 1.6 ppm is a CH2CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH.

So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2. Then, the CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. Then, the CH2 at the end (CH2CH3) would have two protons, and the CH2 next to oxygen would have two as well. The CH=CH would have two on each end.

But the NMR shows a 3H doublet, which would fit a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.

In that case:

- The CH2CH3 group (1.6 ppm, d) would have two protons on CH2, but the NMR shows 3H as a doublet. Wait, that doesn't fit because CH2CH3 has two protons, but the NMR shows 3H. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3). In that case, the CH(CH3) would have one proton, and the CH2 next to oxygen would have two. The CH=CH would have two protons on each end.

But the NMR shows a 3H doublet at 1.6, which would fit a CH(CH3) group, but that's only one proton. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3 (propenyl acetate). In this case:

- The CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) would have two protons, which would split into a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH=CH2.

- The CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

Wait, but I'm not seeing how that would result in the given NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a CH=CH group. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3, but again, I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps I should try to match the options with the possible NMR.

Let's consider each option's structure:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2, with the double bond in cis configuration.

In this structure:

- The CH2 attached to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons. These would be next to the CH=CH2 group.

- The CH=CH2 group has two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

But I'm not seeing how that would produce the NMR signals given.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Same structure as option C, but trans configuration.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH2CH3, with the double bond in cis configuration. But wait, that's a five-carbon chain, which isn't correct. But perhaps it's CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (butenyl acetate, four carbons).

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3.

In this structure, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end, but if it's cis, the protons on each end would be on the same side, leading to coupling with J around 16 Hz.

So the protons on each CH would be a doublet, but if they're equivalent, they would appear as a singlet. But the NMR shows a single proton as a doublet, so maybe they're not equivalent, which would suggest a trans configuration.

Hmm, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH2CH3. But that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (butenyl acetate, four carbons).

In this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The CH=CH would have two protons on each end. If it's cis, the protons would be on the same side. So each CH would have a proton that's coupled with the adjacent CH's proton with J around 16 Hz.

In the NMR, each proton would be a doublet. But due to symmetry, perhaps they would appear as a singlet, but the NMR shows a doublet, which suggests they're not equivalent. So perhaps the structure isn't symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (propenyl acetate).

In this case, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons. The CH=CH2 has two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

But I'm not seeing how that would produce the NMR signals given.

Another approach: look at the splitting for the 5.5 ppm (dq).

A doublet of quadruplets (dq) implies that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with their own J values. So perhaps the proton is adjacent to two different types of protons.

In the structure, perhaps the proton is on a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. Then, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end. The CH2CH3 at the end would have two protons on the CH2 and three on the CH3, but the NMR shows a 3H doublet, which would fit the CH2CH3 group.

But I'm not getting closer to the answer.

Perhaps I should think about the number of signals. The NMR has four signals, so perhaps the structure has four unique proton environments.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2.

The environments would be:

1. OAc methyl (singlet at ~2.1 ppm).

2. OCH2: two protons, possibly as a triplet due to coupling with adjacent CH.

3. CH=CH2: two protons on CH2 (could be a triplet) and one on CH (could be a doublet).

But the NMR shows four signals, so perhaps this structure has more environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the OCH2 protons are split into a triplet, the CH=CH2 protons are a doublet, and the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH2CH3, but that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CHCH3 (butenyl).

In that case:

- OAc methyl: 2.1 ppm (s).

- OCH2: two protons, perhaps as a triplet.

- CH=CH: four protons? No, each CH would have one proton if it's CH=CH.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (propenyl). Then:

- OAc methyl: singlet.

- OCH2: two protons, perhaps as a triplet.

- CH=CH2: two protons on CH2 and one on CH.

But this would produce more signals than the NMR shows.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3, but that's longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (butenyl).

In this case:

- OAc methyl: s at 2.1.

- OCH2: two protons, perhaps as a triplet.

- CH=CH: two protons on each end, but if it's trans, each would be a doublet with J=16.

- CH3 at the end: three protons, perhaps as a triplet.

But in the NMR, we have a 3H doublet at 1.6, which doesn't fit a CH3 at the end.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-C≡C-CH2CH3, but that's an alkyne, which isn't the case.

At this point, perhaps I should look for the answer based on the key features.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz) suggests a trans coupling across a double bond, likely in a di-substituted double bond.

The 5.5 ppm (dq) could be a proton adjacent to two different sets of protons, perhaps a CH group next to a CH2 and a CH3.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3. But that's butenyl.

Wait, but the options include both propenyl and butenyl. So if the structure is butenyl, then options A and D are butenyl.

If the structure is butenyl, then the 1.6 ppm would be the CH2CH3 group at the end.

In that case, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.

But I'm not sure how that fits the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH(CH3), but that's not matching the options.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) could be a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a CH group. So it's -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

In that case, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)-CH=CH2. Then, the CH=CH2 would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH.

But again, I'm not matching the NMR.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but why?

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which is trans coupling. So perhaps the structure has a trans double bond. So the correct option would be Trans-propenyl acetate (option B) or Trans-butenyl acetate (option D).

But looking back, the options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

If the 7.0 ppm is a trans coupling, then the structure must have a trans double bond, which would be either option B or D.

But then, the 5.5 ppm (dq) would be a proton adjacent to two different protons, perhaps.

In Trans-propenyl acetate (option B), the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH=CH2 with the double bond trans.

In that case, the CH2 next to oxygen (OCH2) has two protons, which would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH=CH2.

The CH=CH2 would have two protons on CH2, which would be a doublet due to coupling with the CH on the other end (J=16 Hz).

But I'm not sure how that would produce the NMR signals given.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Trans-butenyl acetate (option D), which would have a longer chain but a trans double bond.

In that case, the protons on the CH=CH would each be a doublet with J=16 Hz, but whether they appear as a singlet or two separate doublets depends on symmetry.

But the NMR shows only one proton at 7.0, which suggests they're not equivalent. So perhaps the structure isn't symmetric, which would happen in a trans configuration for butenyl acetate.

But I'm not confident.

Another approach: the 5.5 ppm (dq) is a doublet of quadruplets. So it's a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons, each with their own J.

Perhaps this is the CH group in the structure, which is adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3.

For example, if the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2CH3.

In this case, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end. The CH2 next to oxygen would have two protons, and the CH2CH3 would have two.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the information I have, I think the correct answer is option C) Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, no, wait. Because the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which is trans coupling. So that suggests a trans configuration. So the correct option would be either B or D.

If the structure is Trans-propenyl acetate (option B), then the protons on the double bond would be trans, giving a J of 16 Hz.

In that structure, the CH=CH would have two protons on each end, but perhaps they're not equivalent, leading to a doublet.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) Trans-butenyl acetate.

But I'm not confident. I think I'll go with option C) Cis-propenyl acetate.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is as follows:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This signal indicates a proton coupled to another proton across a double bond with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), characteristic of a trans configuration in a double bond.
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: A doublet of quadruplets suggests a proton coupled to two different sets of protons, likely in a more complex splitting pattern due to adjacent groups.
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: A singlet for 3H, consistent with the methyl group of the acetate (OAc) functionality.
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: A doublet for 3H, likely corresponding to a methyl group attached to a CH2 group.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Cis-butenyl acetate (Option A)**:  
   This structure has a four-carbon chain with a double bond in the cis configuration. The protons on the double bond would be on the same side, leading to smaller coupling constants (J < 10 Hz). However, the NMR data shows a large J = 16 Hz, which is inconsistent with a cis configuration. This option is unlikely.

2. **Trans-propenyl acetate (Option B)**:  
   This structure has a three-carbon chain with a double bond in the trans configuration. The protons on the double bond would be on opposite sides, leading to a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), consistent with the 7.0 ppm signal. The splitting pattern at 5.5 ppm (dq) could arise from a proton adjacent to both the double bond and another group, such as a CH2 or CH3. This option aligns well with the NMR data.

3. **Cis-propenyl acetate (Option C)**:  
   This structure is similar to Trans-propenyl acetate but with a cis configuration. The coupling constant for the double bond protons in a cis configuration would be smaller (J < 10 Hz), which contradicts the observed J = 16 Hz. This option is inconsistent with the NMR data.

4. **Trans-butenyl acetate (Option D)**:  
   This structure has a four-carbon chain with a double bond in the trans configuration. The protons on the double bond would be on opposite sides, leading to a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), consistent with the 7.0 ppm signal. However, the splitting pattern at 5.5 ppm (dq) and the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggest a simpler structure, such as a three-carbon chain, making this option less likely than Trans-propenyl acetate.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data, particularly the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) at 7.0 ppm and the splitting pattern at 5.5 ppm, strongly support the presence of a trans double bond in a three-carbon chain. This matches the structure of Trans-propenyl acetate (Option B).

**Answer: B**
