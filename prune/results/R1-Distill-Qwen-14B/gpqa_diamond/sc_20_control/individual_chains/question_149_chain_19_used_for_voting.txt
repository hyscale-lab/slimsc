Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like what's expected. But there are two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts, and their integrals together add up to 1H. So, the integral suggests that it's just one proton, but split into two. Wait, but the question says the integrals are roughly equal, so together they make up 1H. Hmm, that makes sense.

The question also says that based on the coupling pattern, spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So, that's not the cause of the two peaks. Spin-spin coupling usually leads to splitting, like a doublet or triplet, so if the peaks are separate but same shift, maybe it's another issue.

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature: two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So, same molecular weight, but different something. But in LC-MS, the same mass would imply same molecular formula, right? So, the two peaks must be isomers or something because they have the same mass but different structures.

The options given are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a lower molecular weight, I think, because it's the starting material before a reaction. For a peptide, the precursor would be the previous part before the last addition. So, the mass would be lower, not same. So if the LC-MS has same mass, this might not fit. Unless the question is about another kind of precursor, but I think in this case, A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and same physical properties except for their interaction with chiral environments. In LC-MS, if the column is achiral, enantiomers would elute together, but if it's a chiral column, they would separate. But the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks. So, maybe they used a chiral column? Or perhaps the mobile phase or conditions caused some sort of separation. But wait, for NMR, if you have enantiomers, the NMR would show the same pattern because the environments are mirror images. But in the NMR, the alpha-proton is showing two peaks. Wait, but enantiomers are chiral, so maybe the environment would split the peaks if the compound is chiral. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling—wait, what is that? I think in peptide synthesis, sometimes when forming an amide bond, if the reaction isn’t complete or if there's some side reaction, you might get some double coupling. Like, maybe the amide is formed with two different groups, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's about a coupling agent forming a bond that leads to another structure, but I'm not recalling this term exactly. Or maybe it refers to some sort of dimerization or something else. Not too sure about this option yet.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including different NMR shifts. So, for the NMR, if there's a mixture of diastereomers, the same proton in different diastereomers would split into multiple peaks. Since the two peaks have similar shifts and integrals, that seems possible. Also, in LC-MS, diastereomers would have different retention times because their structures are different, so they would show up as separate peaks. But wait, the mass would be same, right? Because same molecular formula. So LC-MS would show two same-mass peaks, which fits.

Wait, but the NMR: if you have diastereomers, the same proton in each would have slightly different environments, so their chemical shifts would be different. So in the NMR, for a diastereomeric mixture, the same proton in each would appear as separate peaks. The integrals would add up (since each contributes a proton), but each peak would have a similar area. So, the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton but split, which matches the question.

In the question, the two NMR peaks have similar shifts. So, the diastereomers would have similar but not identical shifts, as their structures are similar but differ in configuration. So, the shifts are close, which is why they're similar.

Now, the question also says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Spin-spin splitting usually leads to more complex splitting patterns, like doublets, triplets, etc. But if the peaks are from two different molecules (like diastereomers), then each would have their own coupling, but perhaps in the case of diastereomers, the coupling might not be the same, but the question says the peaks are similar, so maybe the coupling is not the cause. Alternatively, the splitting is due to the diastereomers, not spin-spin.

Alternatively, let's think about option B: enantiomers. In that case, the NMR would show the same shifts, because the environment for each proton is the same in the two enantiomers. So, the two peaks would have the same chemical shift and same integral, but same coupling. But wait, the question says that the two peaks have similar shifts, but not exactly the same. So, if it were enantiomers, wouldn't they have exactly the same shift? So, their peaks would overlap, wouldn't you see a single peak instead of two? Hmm, perhaps not. If the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show one peak because the environments are identical. So, that might not explain the two peaks.

Wait, but if the compound is a diastereomeric mixture, then the two diastereomers would have different environments, leading to different shifts. So, for a given proton, each diastereomer would have a different shift, leading to two separate peaks in the NMR. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So, if the diastereomers are close in structure, their shifts would be similar. So, that fits.

In the case of enantiomers, the shifts would be identical, so you wouldn't see two peaks but just one. So, the NMR observation suggests it's not enantiomers but something that causes a shift difference, like diastereomers.

Now, looking at the LC-MS part: two peaks with same mass. Diastereomers have same molecular weight, so that fits. Enantiomers also have same mass, but as I thought earlier, in NMR they would give same shift, so it's more likely diastereomers.

So, the options are B and D. But the NMR shows two peaks with similar shifts, so probably diastereomers. So option D.

But wait, the question also says that the integral of the two peaks adds up to 1H. So, each peak is about half the integral. So, in diastereomers, each would have the same number of protons. So, if the mixture is 50:50, each would contribute 0.5H, adding up to 1H. That makes sense.

What about option C? 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation: I'm not exactly sure what that refers to. Could it be like some sort of dimerization? Or perhaps a situation where the same proton is coupled to two different protons in different environments, leading to two peaks? Or maybe it's an artifact in the reaction.

Alternatively, if the amide bond formation leads to some kind of isomerism, like different stereoisomers. Wait, but that would be diastereomers, which is option D.

Wait, the question says that the 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So, maybe the alpha-proton is in a chiral environment, and the molecule can exist as two different diastereomers, each with a slightly different shift for that proton.

So, putting it all together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because of diastereomers. The LC-MS shows two peaks because they're different compounds (diastereomers) with same mass. So, the correct answer is D.

Wait, but option B is enantiomers. For enantiomers, the integral would be split if there's a chiral column, but in NMR, you wouldn't see two peaks. So given that the NMR shows two peaks with similar shifts, it's more likely that the compound has diastereomers.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause. Additionally, LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule.

### Key Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would typically have a lower molecular weight than the final product. Since the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass, this explanation is unlikely.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers have identical molecular weights and physical properties, including NMR shifts. If the compound were a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for the alpha-proton, not two peaks. Therefore, this option does not fit the observations.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   While "double coupling" could theoretically lead to two peaks in the NMR, the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Additionally, this term is not commonly associated with peptide synthesis, making this option less plausible.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, including NMR shifts, due to their differing spatial arrangements. This explains the two peaks in the NMR spectrum with similar but distinct chemical shifts. The LC-MS analysis showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass is consistent with diastereoisomers, which have the same molecular formula but different structures. The integral of the NMR peaks adding up to 1H also supports this explanation, as each diastereomer contributes equally to the signal.

### Conclusion:
The observations in the NMR and LC-MS analyses are best explained by the crude compound existing as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
