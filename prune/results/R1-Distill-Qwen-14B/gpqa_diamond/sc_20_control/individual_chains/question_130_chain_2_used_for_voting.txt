Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength of about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A to D, with numbers like 3, 1.2, 2.4, and 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission is a specific wavelength in hydrogen. But wait, the question says it's absorption. So the background quasars emit light, and these hydrogen clouds absorb the light at 1216 Angstroms, which is the Lyman alpha wavelength. So when we observe the quasar's spectrum, we'd see a dark line at that wavelength where the hydrogen has absorbed the light.

Now, the key point is about redshift. Redshift tells us how much the universe has expanded since the light was emitted. The formula for redshift (z) relates the observed wavelength (lambda_observed) to the emitted wavelength (lambda_emitted). The formula is z = (lambda_observed / lambda_emitted) - 1.

But wait, in this case, the hydrogen is absorbing the quasar's light. So the quasar's light is being absorbed at 1216 Angstroms. So for us to detect this absorption line, the wavelength we observe (lambda_obs) must be in the optical range because we're using optical telescopes. If the quasar is at a high redshift, the absorbed wavelength could shift into the infrared, which ground-based optical telescopes can't see as easily, or maybe not at all.

Wait, no, actually, ground-based optical telescopes can't detect wavelengths beyond about 1 micrometer (like near-infrared), but most of them are designed for visible light. So if the absorbed wavelength shifts beyond the visible range, we wouldn't see it in optical observations. So the quasar's light must have the absorption line still in the optical range so that ground-based telescopes can capture it.

So the quasar's light, when absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, must have the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms (which is in the ultraviolet range) shifted into the optical. Because the quasar's light is coming through the hydrogen cloud, the absorption line in our observed frame depends on the redshift of the cloud relative to us.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The quasar emits light, which travels through the hydrogen cloud. The hydrogen absorbs at 1216 Angstroms (rest frame of hydrogen). So from our perspective, if the quasar is at a high redshift, the absorption line would be shifted into the visible range.

Wait, no. The quasar's light is redshifted. The hydrogen cloud is between us and the quasar, so the cloud is at some redshift z. The quasar is at a higher redshift. The absorption occurs when the quasar's emitted light, which includes the Lyman alpha emission, is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame. But when the light travels through the hydrogen cloud (which is at a lower redshift than the quasar), the cloud absorbs at its own rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line is 1216*(1 + z_cloud).

Wait, no, maybe I should think it through again. Let me try to model it.

The quasar emits light which passes through the neutral hydrogen cloud. The cloud absorbs light at 1216 Angstroms (its rest frame). So, relative to the quasar, the cloud is moving in the same direction as the quasar's recession (assuming they're both moving with the Hubble flow). Wait, but the quasar is behind the cloud. Hmm.

Wait, no, the cloud is in the line of sight to the quasar, which is at a higher redshift. So the cloud is at redshift z_cloud, and the quasar is at a higher z_quasar. The quasar emits light which is then absorbed by the cloud at 1216 Angstroms (the cloud's rest frame). Therefore, the observed wavelength of this absorption line is lambda_obs = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z_cloud). Because the cloud's frame is moving away from us with redshift z_cloud.

But wait, the quasar's emission is also redshifted. The quasar emits light at some wavelength, but the absorption occurs when that emission's wavelength, as seen by the cloud, is at 1216 Angstroms. So the quasar's emission's wavelength in the cloud's frame is 1216 Ang. So the quasar's emitted wavelength (in the quasar's frame) is lambda_quasar_emit, and when observed by the cloud, it's redshifted by the quasar's redshift z_quasar relative to the cloud.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the fact that the cloud is at a redshift z_cloud, and the quasar is at a higher redshift z_quasar. The quasar's light, as seen by the cloud, is at a wavelength of lambda_quasar_cloud = lambda_quasar_emit * (1 + z_cloud). The cloud then absorbs at 1216 Ang, so for the quasar's emission to be absorbed, lambda_quasar_cloud must be equal to 1216 Ang. So lambda_quasar_emit * (1 + z_cloud) = 1216.

But the quasar's emission, as observed by us, is at lambda_quasar_obs = lambda_quasar_emit * (1 + z_quasar).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Maybe another way: the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Ang in its own rest frame. But when we observe it through the hydrogen cloud, the cloud's absorption at 1216 Ang (its rest frame) will create an absorption line at a wavelength observed by us as lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z_cloud). Because the cloud is at z_cloud, so the absorption wavelength is stretched by (1 + z_cloud) from the cloud's rest frame.

Wait, but the cloud is not emitting, but absorbing. So the quasar's emission (e.g., at Lyman alpha, 1216 Ang) is redshifted by the quasar's redshift. But the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. So the cloud intercepts the quasar's light, which as the cloud sees it, is at a certain wavelength. If the cloud absorbs at 1216 Ang, then the quasar's emitted wavelength (in quasar's frame) must match that when observed by the cloud.

Wait, let me model this. The quasar emits light at wavelength lambda_emit (1216 Ang in its frame). The cloud is at redshift z_cloud, so the quasar's light is observed by the cloud as lambda_cloud = lambda_emit * (1 + z_cloud). The cloud absorbs at 1216 Ang in its own frame, so lambda_cloud must equal 1216 Ang. So lambda_emit * (1 + z_cloud) = 1216. Hence, lambda_emit = 1216 / (1 + z_cloud).

But the quasar's emission is observed by us as lambda_obs_quasar = lambda_emit * (1 + z_quasar). So substituting lambda_emit from earlier, lambda_obs_quasar = [1216 / (1 + z_cloud)] * (1 + z_quasar).

Wait, but why are we considering the quasar's emission? Maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lyman-alpha absorption line is observed in the quasar's spectrum. So the quasar's spectrum shows an absorption line at a wavelength longer than 1216 Ang, because it's been redshifted by the cloud's redshift.

Wait, no. The absorption occurs in the quasar's light, so the cloud is at a certain redshift. So when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the cloud's own Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 Ang) is the absorption feature. So the observed wavelength of this absorption line is 1216 * (1 + z_cloud).

But for us to see this absorption line in optical wavelengths, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be less than about 9000 Angstroms (since optical is roughly 4000-7000 Ang, but some telescopes can go a bit beyond). Wait, no, I think the optical range is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be less than ~7000 Angstroms.

Wait, let me compute 1216 * (1 + z_cloud) < 7000. So 1 + z_cloud < 7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.758. So z_cloud < ~4.758. Wait, but that can't be right because that would give a lower limit, but I'm not sure if that's the approach.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The absorption line is observed at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_cloud). For this to be in the optical range (so that ground-based telescopes can detect it), the observed wavelength must be less than about 700 nm (7000 Ang) because beyond that, it's infrared. So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) ≤ 7000 Ang. Solving for z_cloud: (1 + z_cloud) ≤ 7000/1216 ≈ 5.758 → z_cloud ≤ 4.758. But that would be the upper limit, not the lower limit.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the lower limit would be when the absorption line is just entering the optical range. Hmm, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Ang. If the hydrogen cloud is at a redshift where 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is in the optical, then we can see the absorption line. If the cloud is at a lower redshift, the absorption line would be at a shorter wavelength (still UV, perhaps), which ground-based optical telescopes can't detect.

So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, the observed wavelength must be above some minimum. Wait, no. Let me see: if the cloud is at a redshift z_cloud, then the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Ang. For this to be in the optical (say, ≥ 4000 Ang), 1216*(1+z_cloud) ≥ 4000. So 1 + z_cloud ≥ 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29. So z_cloud ≥ 2.29.

So the lower limit on z_cloud is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 2.4 or D) 1.9.

Wait, but let me redo the calculation. 4000 / 1216 = let's compute that.

1216 × 3 = 3648. 4000 - 3648 = 352. So 3 + (352/1216) ≈ 3.288. So 1 + z ≥ 3.288 → z ≥ 2.288. So the lower limit is around 2.29.

Looking at the options, C is 2.4, which is just above that. So that's the lower limit.

Wait, but maybe the optical range is considered to start at 390 nm (3900 Angstroms) or something higher. Let me check: Visible light is roughly 400–700 nm (4000–7000 Ang). So the lower end is 4000 Ang, so the absorption line must be ≥4000 Ang to be in the optical.

So 1216*(1+z) ≥4000 → 1+z ≥ 4000/1216 ≈ 3.288 → z ≥ 2.288.

So the minimal z is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is the first option above 2.29.

Wait, but is there another consideration? Such as the quasar's own redshift? Because the quasar must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. So perhaps the cloud's redshift can't be too high relative to the quasar's.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit of the redshift of the cloud (or the object) such that the absorption can be detected. So if the cloud's z is too low, then 1216*(1 + z) would be below 4000 Ang, say at 3500 Ang, which is UV and not visible with optical telescopes. So it's necessary that the cloud's z is high enough so that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical.

So the minimal z would be when 1216*(1+z) is just equal to 4000 Ang. So z is ~2.288. So the lower limit is approximately 2.3. The options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So 2.4 is option C.

But wait, another thought. Do quasars themselves have emission lines that are redshifted into the optical? For the absorption line to be observable, it's not just the cloud's redshift but also the quasar's redshift. Because the quasar is behind the cloud, and the quasar's emission is at a higher redshift.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the lower limit of the redshift of the object (the cloud) such that the absorption line is in the optical. So the cloud's redshift z must satisfy 1216*(1 + z) ≥ 4000 Ang (for optical detection). So z ≥ (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 3.288-1=2.288.

So among the options, the smallest value higher than 2.288 is 2.4 (option C). So the answer would be C.

Wait, but another angle: the quasar's own emission lines must be in the optical. Let's say the quasar's Lyman alpha is at 1216 Ang, and it's observed in the quasar's frame. Wait, no, the quasar's emission is at 1216 Ang in its own frame, but when observed by us, it's redshifted by z_quasar.

But for the absorption line (from the cloud) to be in the optical, the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is in the optical. So the same calculation applies.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's. Because the cloud is in the foreground. So z_quasar > z_cloud.

But the problem is about the redshift of "these objects," which are the hydrogen clouds. So what's the minimal z_cloud such that 1216*(1+z_cloud) is in the optical.

So the calculation remains the same. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29, so option C is 2.4.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that the Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) is detectable with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshift relationship. The observed wavelength of the absorption line is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\) is the rest-frame wavelength of the Lyman alpha line, and \(z\) is the redshift of the cloud. For the absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) must lie between approximately 4000 Å (the start of the optical range) and 7000 Å (the end of the optical range).

### Step 1: Determine the lower limit for \(z\)
To ensure the absorption line is in the optical range, we require:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å}
\]

Substituting \(\lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + z)\), we solve for \(z\):

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 4000
\]

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

\[
z \geq 3.29 - 1 \approx 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift \(z\) is approximately \(2.29\).

### Step 2: Compare with the options
The options provided are:
- **A)** 3
- **B)** 1.2
- **C)** 2.4
- **D)** 1.9

From the calculation, the lower limit is \(z \approx 2.29\). Among the options, the smallest value greater than \(2.29\) is **2.4** (option C).

### Conclusion
The lower limit on the redshift of the hydrogen clouds, such that the Lyman alpha absorption line is detectable with optical ground-based telescopes, is approximately \(2.29\). The closest option is **2.4**.
