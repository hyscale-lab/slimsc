Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the problem says I have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy when they're all mixed together. The options are given in both kcal and kJ, so I'll have to pay attention to the units.

First, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. The enthalpy change for such reactions is typically measured in kJ per mole. But wait, the options here have some in kcal and others in kJ. I think 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, right? So maybe the answer expects either unit, but I should probably stick to one and see.

So, I think I need to figure out how much acid and base I have, determine the limiting reagent, and then calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions reacting. Because in neutralization, H+ from the acid reacts with OH- from the base.

Let me break down each solution:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole gives one H+ ion. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. So, 0.1 moles H+.

2. H2SO4: Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, and it's diprotic, meaning each molecule can donate two H+ ions. The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, and concentration 0.3 M. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each gives two H+, that's 0.18 moles H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: Barium hydroxide is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each mole gives two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L, concentration 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So, 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but wait a second. When mixing acid and base, H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio. So I need to find the total moles of H+ and OH-, then see which is in excess.

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles H+.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

So, when they react, each H+ needs an OH-.

Which will be the limiting reagent here? Let's see: H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is less, so it's the limiting reagent.

So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

But for the neutralization enthalpy calculation, I think only the moles that actually react contribute to the heat. Because the excess H+ won't have OH- to neutralize.

So the moles that react are 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

But wait, wait! Hold on. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in aqueous solution, it fully dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. So yeah, the H+ calculation is correct.

Now, the neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- is:

H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change for this is known, usually around -57.3 kJ per mole (that's the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases). So each mole of H+ reacting with OH- releases about 57.3 kJ.

Wait, but wait again. Some sources say that the enthalpy of neutralization is for one mole of H+ and one mole of OH- combining into water. So yeah, 57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would produce 0.2 * 57.3 kJ of heat. Let me calculate that.

0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ. But wait, the reaction is exothermic, so the enthalpy change is negative. So the enthalpy change (ΔH) would be -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → about -11.55 kJ (since 2.72 kcal *4.184 ≈ 11.45, so 2.72 *4.184 ≈ 11.45, but wait, 2.72 kcal is 11.45 kJ, but the ΔH is negative, so A is -11.45 kJ approx.

Wait, but my calculation here is 11.46 kJ, so the option is -11.42 or -11.46? Let me see the options again.

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait no, option B is -11.42 kcal? No, looking back:

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option B is in kcal too, which is about 47.9 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184≈47.76). Hmm, but our calculation is 11.46 kJ. So none of the options have that directly except option D, which is -16 kJ, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when...are mixed". Wait, but enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction. Or wait, perhaps I should compute the total heat released and then see what the options are.

Wait, the options are either in kcal or kJ. So perhaps the correct answer is around 11.4 kJ, which would be -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than my calculation. Alternatively, B is -11.42 kcal. Let me convert that to kJ.

11.42 kcal *4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ 47.72 kJ. So that's way higher than my calculation of about 11.46 kJ. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait a second, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the neutralization reaction, each mole can contribute two H+ ions, but when reacting with OH-, each H+ needs one OH-.

Wait, but I think that's already accounted for. Because I calculated the moles of H+ correctly as 0.28 (0.1 from HCl and 0.18 from H2SO4), and the OH- is 0.2.

So the reaction uses 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. So 0.2 *57.3 =11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have that. So wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the neutralization per mL or something else. Or perhaps the enthalpy is per mole of acid-base reaction, but sometimes it's calculated per mole of acid or base.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not accounting for the fact that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole contributes two H+, but perhaps the neutralization is per mole of H2SO4? Hmm, no, because the neutralization is per H+.

Wait, another approach: maybe the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid or per mole of base. Hmm, but no, the standard is per mole of H+.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the calculation in terms of the total H+ and OH- ions, but perhaps I should think about the possible neutralization reaction when all three are mixed.

Wait, but wait. When you mix HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2, the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from the base.

Ah, but the problem is that HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, so when mixed with a base, the H+ from both will neutralize the OH-.

So I think my initial approach is correct. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react, releasing 0.2 *57.3=11.46 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, but that's higher. Hmm, so none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kcal.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.74). So -2.74 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. That's very close.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation. Let me double-check.

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L, 0.2 M. Moles = 0.5 *0.2=0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL=0.3 L, 0.3 M. Moles H2SO4=0.3 *0.3=0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL=0.2 L, 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2=0.2 *0.5=0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ total: 0.1 +0.18=0.28. OH-: 0.2.

So all OH- reacts, H+ excess is 0.08.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, 0.2 mol.

So 0.2 *57.3 =11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ. Which is approximately -11.5 kJ, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, if I calculate in kcal:

11.46 kJ is 11.46 /4.184 ≈2.735 kcal. So about -2.74 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. That's very close. So perhaps I should go with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to use the enthalpy per mole of H+ as 55.8 kcal/mol, and then the total is 0.2 moles →11.16 kcal → but that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, no, I think the standard enthalpy is 57.3 kJ/mol (or about 13.66 kcal/mol, since 57.3/4.184≈13.66). So 0.2 moles *13.66 kcal/mol =2.732 kcal, which is about -2.73 kcal, which matches option A, which is -2.72 kcal.

Ah, so perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait. The problem is mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. But does the neutralization only occur between the H+ and OH-, regardless of their sources?

Yes, I think so. So the total H+ and OH- will combine.

So, the enthalpy is -0.2 *57.3 kJ =-11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.5 kJ. But that's not one of the options except option D is -16 kJ, which is too high.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem is considering the stoichiometric amounts differently.

Wait another thought: perhaps the neutralization isn't just H+ and OH- but the actual acid-base reaction. For instance, when a strong acid like H2SO4 reacts with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, the reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate.

Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider. Because H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would react to form BaSO4 and water. So perhaps the neutralization in this case is not just the H+ and OH- but the actual acid-base reaction.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let me think about this.

H2SO4 (diprotic) + Ba(OH)2 (strong base) → BaSO4(s) + H2O.

The reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

Wait, but let's balance it.

The balanced equation is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of H2SO4, 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 is needed, producing 1 mole of BaSO4 and 2 moles H2O.

The moles in solution:

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M =0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M =0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is 0.09, Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here because 0.09 <0.1.

So when they react, 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

But wait, how much H+ and OH- is involved here?

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-.

So for each mole of H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2:

2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

Wait, but in the reaction, we have one mole H2SO4 (2 H+) and one mole Ba(OH)2 (2 OH-), so 2 H+ + 2 OH- → 2 H2O.

So in the neutralization part of this reaction, 2 moles H+ and 2 moles OH- react to form 2 H2O, releasing 2 *57.3 =114.6 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Because each mole of H+ and OH- contributes 57.3 kJ.

But in this case, 2 H+ and 2 OH- would react, so that's 2 *57.3 =114.6 kJ.

But wait, in our case, 0.09 mol H2SO4 and 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 would react, but Ba(OH)2 has 2 OH- per mole, so 0.09 *2 =0.18 mol OH-.

H2SO4 has 2 H+ per mole, so 0.09 *2=0.18 H+.

So in this reaction, 0.18 H+ and 0.18 OH- would react, producing 0.18 mol H2O. The enthalpy change would be 0.18 *57.3 =10.314 kJ.

But wait, that's only part of the story because the rest of the H+ comes from HCl.

Wait, so in the initial approach, I considered all H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) and all OH- (from Ba(OH)2), but if part of Ba(OH)2 is reacting with H2SO4, then the remaining OH- would be less.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline all the steps.

1. Some of the Ba(OH)2 will react with H2SO4 to form BaSO4 and water. The amount that reacts is determined by the limiting reagent.

2. The remaining H+ (from HCl and unreacted H2SO4) will react with the remaining OH- (from unreacted Ba(OH)2) to form water.

So step 1: reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Moles H2SO4:0.09, Ba(OH)2:0.1.

The reaction is 1:1, so H2SO4 is limiting.

So moles reacting: 0.09 each.

H2SO4: produces 0.09 *2 =0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: produces 0.09 *2=0.18 OH-.

So in this reaction, 0.18 H+ and 0.18 OH- will neutralize, producing 0.18 H2O, releasing 0.18 *57.3 =10.314 kJ.

So that's part of the enthalpy change.

Now, after this reaction, what's left?

From H2SO4: all 0.09 mol has reacted, so no H+ left from H2SO4.

From Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.09 =0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 remains. Which dissociates into 0.01 *2=0.02 OH-.

From HCl: 0.1 mol HCl →0.1 mol H+.

So total H+ now: 0.1 (from HCl) + any remaining from H2SO4? No, because H2SO4 is all reacted.

Total H+ =0.1.

Total OH- remaining: 0.02.

So these 0.02 OH- will react with 0.02 H+ to form water.

The enthalpy change for this is 0.02 *57.3=1.146 kJ.

So total enthalpy change is 10.314 +1.146=11.46 kJ. Which is the same as before.

So regardless of whether I approach it as a two-step reaction or just calculate the total H+ and OH-, I get the same amount of 11.46 kJ released.

But wait, in the second approach, the calculation is the same as the initial approach, because the total H+ is 0.1 (HCl) +0.18 (H2SO4) =0.28, and total OH- is 0.2 (Ba(OH)2) → 0.28 -0.2=0.08 H+ excess. But in the two-step approach, the H+ from H2SO4 and some OH- from Ba(OH)2 are consumed in the formation of BaSO4.

But the total heat from both steps sums to the same as the initial approach. So regardless, the enthalpy change is the same as the initial approach.

So back to the options, the enthalpy change is approximately -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.5 kJ. But the options don't have that value.

Looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal → 2.72 *4.184≈11.45 kJ → -11.45 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → ≈-47.75 kJ.

C) -3.80 kcal → -15.9 kJ.

D) -16.0 kJ.

So option A is approximately -11.45 kJ, which is very close to our calculation of -11.46 kJ.

So the answer should be A.

But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the neutralization of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 produces two moles of water per mole of H2SO4. So each mole of H2SO4 would produce 2 moles of H2O, and the enthalpy for that is 2 *57.3 =114.6 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

But wait, that might be the approach, but then we have to calculate the total enthalpy.

Wait, but let me think: when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 would require one mole of Ba(OH)2, and each mole would produce 2 moles of H2O, releasing 2 *57.3 = 114.6 kJ.

But in our case, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, so the enthalpy change is 0.09 *114.6 =10.314 kJ.

Then, the remaining HCl (0.1 moles H+) reacts with the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.01 moles, which gives 0.02 OH-). So 0.02 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.02 *57.3=1.146 kJ.

Total enthalpy change is 10.314 +1.146=11.46 kJ. So same result.

But the options don't have 11.46 kJ, but option A is 2.72 kcal, which is about 11.45 kJ.

So that's the correct answer.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. So that's about -47.75 kJ, which is much higher than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different enthalpy value, like 13.66 kcal/mol (which is 57.3 kJ/mol). Let me see.

0.2 moles H+ reacting → 0.2 *13.66 =2.732 kcal → aprox -2.73 kcal, which is option A (-2.72 kcal).

So the correct answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of \( \text{H}^+ \), so total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \), so total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Identify the limiting reagent
The total \( \text{H}^+ \) available is \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and the total \( \text{OH}^- \) available is \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
Since \( \text{OH}^- \) is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) will react with \( \text{OH}^- \), leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) unreacted.

### Step 3: Calculate the enthalpy change
The enthalpy of neutralization for \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \) is \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) reacting:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert to kcal (if necessary)
Since \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \):  
\[
\Delta H = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 \, \text{kcal/kJ} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
- **Option A:** \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) is very close to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
- **Option B:** \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect as it corresponds to a much larger enthalpy change.  
- **Option C:** \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect.  
- **Option D:** \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is incorrect as it is larger than the calculated value.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
