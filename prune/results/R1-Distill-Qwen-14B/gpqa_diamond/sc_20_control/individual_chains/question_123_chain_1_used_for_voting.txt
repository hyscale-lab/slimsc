Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which means they're not accelerating, just moving at constant velocities. So, the problem is probably involving relative motion and maybe some special relativity concepts, but I'm not sure yet.

The problem says that from the ejecta's frame of reference, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's really fast! Like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% of that. So that's a pretty high speed. So relativistic effects might come into play here.

But the question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm. So time in the ejecta's frame is different from the Galaxy's frame because of time dilation in special relativity. Oh wait, but wait, let me think.

Wait, no, wait. Because the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the Galaxy. So, if the ejecta's frame is moving at v relative to the Galaxy, then from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v, and from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving at v towards it.

So, I think I need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. Then, once I have that time, I can calculate the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame as velocity multiplied by that time.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the distance would be calculated using the proper time or something else. Let me think about the relationship between time in the two frames.

So, in special relativity, the time experienced in one frame is related to the other frame by the Lorentz factor gamma. The Lorentz factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the relative velocity between the frames.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy (i.e., towards the center) at the same speed, 60,000 km/s. Because in special relativity, the speed is symmetric between frames. So the relative speed is the same when observed from either frame. So, v is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but let me get that right. If in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at v. So yes, both agree on the relative speed.

So, the problem is, in the ejecta's frame, some time passes (50 seconds), and we need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during that time. Or wait, no, the question says the ejecta travels a certain distance in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So, perhaps we need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame corresponding to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, then multiply by velocity to get the distance.

Wait, but wait. It's the other way around. The time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. How much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame during that period?

Hmm. So, if the ejecta's frame is moving at speed v relative to the Galaxy, then the proper time in the ejecta's frame (tau) is related to the time in the Galaxy's frame (t) by the equation:

tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So, to find t, we rearrange: t = tau / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)

So, tau is 50 seconds. So we can compute t by plugging in the numbers.

Wait, but wait. The problem is that the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. So, which frame is the proper frame for the process? Actually, the proper time is the time measured in the moving object's frame. So, when the ejecta is moving, the proper time for events happening on the ejecta would be the tau. But I'm not sure if that's the case here, because the question is about the time in the ejecta's frame, so tau is 50 s.

So, the steps would be:

1. Compute the Lorentz factor gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)
2. Compute t = tau * gamma
3. Then, compute the distance as v * t

But wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at speed v, so the distance it travels in time t would be v * t.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm getting the direction right. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, so the distance is how much it has moved towards the center in the Galaxy's frame.

So, let's compute the numbers.

First, v is 60,000 km/s.

Convert that to m/s? Wait, no, because the units can be handled in km and seconds since the speed is in km/s.

c is 3e5 km/s. So let's compute v as 6e4 km/s.

Compute v²/c² = (6e4)^2 / (3e5)^2 = (3.6e9) / (9e10) = 4e-2. So 0.04.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. Let's compute sqrt(0.96):

Wait, sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.979795897.

So gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.020655.

So gamma is approximately 1.020655.

So then, the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = tau * gamma = 50 s * 1.020655 ≈ 51.03275 seconds.

Wait, but wait. Because tau is the proper time, so in this case, the proper time is in the ejecta's frame, so the time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer. So, yes, that makes sense.

So, the ejecta's movement in the Galaxy's frame is v * t.

v is 6e4 km/s, t is about 51.03275 s.

So, 6e4 km/s * 51.03275 s = 6e4 *51.03275 km.

Compute that: 6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 * 51.03275 = ?

Compute 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.03275 = 60,000 *1 = 60,000, plus 60,000 * 0.03275 = 1,965.

So total is 60,000 + 1,965 = 61,965.

So 3,000,000 + 61,965 = 3,061,965 km.

Wait, but wait. So that would be approximately 3,061,965 km. But looking at the options, the closest would be option D, which is 3,060,000 km.

Wait, but wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check it again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute v²/c² more precisely.

v = 60,000 km/s.

v^2 = (6e4)^2 = 3.6e9 (km^2/s^2).

c^2 = (3e5)^2 = 9e10 (km^2/s^2).

v^2 / c^2 = 3.6e9 / 9e10 = 0.04.

So, sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9797959.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9797959 ≈ 1.0206553.

So tau is 50 s, so t = 50 * 1.0206553 = 50 * approximately 1.0206553 = 51.032765 seconds.

Then, distance is v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.032765 s.

Let me compute 51.032765 * 6e4.

6e4 is 60,000. So 60,000 * 51.032765 = ?

Compute 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.

Now, the decimal part is 0.032765.

60,000 * 0.032765 = 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800; 60,000 * 0.002765 = 165.9.

So 1,800 + 165.9 = 1,965.9.

So total distance is 3,060,000 + 1,965.9 = 3,061,965.9 km.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 3,060,000 km.

So that's very close. Our calculation gives approximately 3,061,966 km, which is about 3,060,000 km if rounded to the nearest 10,000 km, but perhaps more accurately, the options might have more precise calculations.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) with more precision.

What's sqrt(0.96)?

Let me calculate it step by step.

We know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is a bit higher than 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.9797959^2: Let me see.

0.979795897^2 = (approx) 0.96.

So, gamma is 1.020655.

But perhaps using more precise gamma.

t = 50 * 1.0206553 = 51.032765 s.

So, 60,000 km/s * 51.032765 s = 60,000 * 51.032765.

60,000 × 51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 × 0.032765 = 1,965.9.

Total: 3,061,965.9 km.

But none of the options match that. The closest is option D: 3,060,000 km.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, no, perhaps I should be using the velocity and time correctly. Because in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds. So, to find how much the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame, perhaps I should compute using the velocity in the Galaxy's frame multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but another way to think about it: from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the center. So, the time it takes for 50 seconds to pass in the ejecta's frame is more than 50 seconds in the Galaxy's frame. So, the distance would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to find the distance using the velocity in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, because the distance is in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the frames.

Wait, another approach: the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t_galaxy, where t_galaxy is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds, which is the proper time (tau). So, tau = t_galaxy * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so t_galaxy = tau / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = tau * gamma.

Which is what I did before.

So, t_galaxy = 50 * 1.0206553 ≈ 51.032765 s.

So, distance = v * t_galaxy = 6e4 km/s * 51.032765 s ≈ 3,061,965.9 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km.

But why isn't the exact value matching any option? Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me calculate sqrt(0.96) precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using more precise mathematics.

Compute sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)):

v = 6e4 km/s.

v/c = 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2.

So, v/c = 0.2.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96.

So, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.979795897.

So gamma is 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.0206553.

So, t_galaxy = 50 * 1.0206553 ≈ 51.032765 s.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach. Because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is high enough that relativistic effects are noticeable, but maybe the question expects us to ignore them and use classical mechanics.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the time in the Galaxy's frame would be the same as the ejecta's frame, so 50 seconds. Then, the distance would be v * t = 6e4 * 50 = 3e6 km, which is option B.

But that's a big difference. So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the question is intended to be non-relativistic, given that the answer options include 3,000,000 km, which would be the case if time dilation is ignored. But then again, the question might be expecting a relativistic approach.

Wait, let me re-read the question.

The question says that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, so we can apply special relativity. So, we can't ignore time dilation.

Thus, the correct approach is to account for the time dilation.

So, with that, the distance would be approximately 3,061,965 km, which isn't exactly any of the options. But option D is 3,060,000 km, which is close. So perhaps due to rounding, that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma.

Wait, 0.04 is (0.2)^2. So gamma is 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020655.

Yes, that's correct.

So 50 * 1.020655 = 51.03275 s.

v * t = 6e4 * 51.03275 = 3,061,965 km.

Hmm. The options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach is non-relativistic, and the correct answer would be option B: 3,000,000 km.

But wait, from the problem statement, both are inertial frames, which implies that relativity should be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the distance as observed from the ejecta's frame, but that would be different.

Wait, no, because the question says, "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame."

So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v. The time for 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame is longer in the Galaxy's frame, so the distance is greater than 6e4 *50 = 3e6 km.

So, the correct distance is ~3,062,000 km, which is about 3,060,000 km. So option D.

But why is it not exactly matching? Oh wait, perhaps the exact gamma is higher. Let me compute the exact value of gamma.

Compute gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.04)).

sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.979795897.

So, 1/0.979795897 ≈ 1.020655.

So, t = 50 * 1.020655 = 51.03275 s.

So, 6e4 km/s * 51.03275 s = 6e4 *51.03275.

6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 * 0.03275 = 1,965.

So, 3,060,000 + 1,965 = 3,061,965 km.

But the options don't have that. The closest is D) 3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to not consider the exact value and approximate gamma as 1.02, giving 50 *1.02 =51 s.

6e4 *51= 3,060,000 km. So that's option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, so special relativity applies. The relative velocity between the two frames is \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Steps:
1. **Time Dilation**:  
   In special relativity, the proper time (\( \tau \)) in the ejecta's frame is related to the time (\( t \)) in the Galaxy's frame by the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)):
   \[
   \tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
   \]
   Rearranging for \( t \):
   \[
   t = \frac{\tau}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \tau = 50 \, \text{s} \), \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{(60,000)^2}{(300,000)^2} = 0.04, \quad \sqrt{1 - 0.04} = \sqrt{0.96} \approx 0.979796
   \]
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} \approx 1.020655
   \]
   \[
   t = 50 \cdot 1.020655 \approx 51.03275 \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.03275 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \cdot 51.03275 \approx 3,061,965 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated distance (\( 3,061,965 \, \text{km} \)) is closest to option D (\( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \)). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding during intermediate calculations.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer, accounting for relativistic time dilation, is **D) 3,060,000 km**.

Answer: D
