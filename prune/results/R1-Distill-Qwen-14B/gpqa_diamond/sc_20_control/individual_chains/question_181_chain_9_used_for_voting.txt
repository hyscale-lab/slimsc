Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III reactions stopped, the changes in neutrino production would take that same time to reach us. So, the neutrinos we detect now would be from the time before the pp-III branch stopped.

Wait, no. Because neutrinos are produced in the core and they escape quickly, right? But if the pp-III stopped, wouldn't that affect the neutrinos we detect after that point? Wait, but the question says it's been 8.5 minutes since the stoppage, so the neutrinos from the Sun's core which are just arriving now would be from the time after the stoppage. Or maybe I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, no. Because the neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core and travel out, and it takes about 8.5 minutes to reach Earth. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then the neutrinos that were produced after that stoppage are on their way. But neutrinos are produced in various processes, including pp-III and others.

Wait, the question specifies that only the pp-III branch stopped. All other reactions remain as they were. So, which neutrinos are affected by the pp-III branch?

I remember that the pp chain (proton-proton chain) is the main source of energy in the Sun, and it produces neutrinos as a byproduct. There are different branches of the pp chain. The pp-I and pp-II branches produce different energies of neutrinos. Oh wait, wait, no. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos produced via the pp chain and the CNO cycle. But I think the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton fusion process.

In the pp chain, the dominant process is the fusion of two protons into deuterium, producing a positron and a neutrino. But there's also a branch where a proton captures a deuteron to form tritium, and then that goes on to form helium-3. That's the pp-III branch, perhaps. Alternatively, I might be getting the branches mixed up. Another thought: the pp chain's main branch (pp-I) converts protons into deuterons, then in pp-II, a deuteron captures a proton to become tritium, and then in pp-III, the tritium captures a proton to form helium-3.

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact details, but the key point is that when the pp-III branch stops, the production of some neutrinos would change. Because the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a certain energy of neutrinos. So, which ones?

Wait, neutrinos from the Sun are produced in the following main processes: the proton-proton chain produces neutrinos with energies around 200 keV. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, around 1-2 MeV. But wait, the question is about neutrinos in the 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2) ranges.

Wait, wait. The typical solar neutrino spectrum has a peak around 170 keV, which is from the dominant pp chain. The CNO neutrinos are higher, like a few hundred keV to a few MeV. But wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos than the main pp branch.

Wait, another approach: the main source of neutrinos in the Sun is the proton-proton chain, which produces neutrinos with energies around 200 keV. But there are other processes. The CNO cycle contributes higher-energy neutrinos, but I think the CNO neutrinos are a smaller fraction of the total.

So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of a certain type of neutrinos would decrease. Let's say that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in a higher energy range than the main pp branch. For example, if the main pp branch gives 200 keV neutrinos, and the pp-III gives, say, 500-800 keV or something. Or perhaps the pp-III produces neutrinos in the range of 800 keV.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think of the neutrino energies. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the 200 keV ones. The CNO neutrinos are higher. But the question is about bands around 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So these are in the range of CNO neutrinos? Or perhaps from the higher branches of the pp chain.

Wait, maybe the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a specific part of the neutrino spectrum. Suppose that the main pp chain produces lower energy neutrinos, and the pp-III branch contributes to higher energies, perhaps around 700-800 keV.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux of neutrinos in that higher energy range would decrease. But the lower energy neutrinos (like the main pp chain) would continue as before.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of fluxes between two bands. So band 1 is 700-800 and band 2 is 800-900. So if stopping pp-III affects band 1 and perhaps band 2.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in both bands. Or maybe in band 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are of higher energy, so stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2 more than band 1. Let me think: before the stoppage, the flux in band 1 and band 2 came from both pp-III and whatever else produces neutrinos in those bands. If pp-III is stopped, then the flux in band 2 would decrease more, making the ratio (band1/band2) higher.

Wait, let me think again. The question is, after the pp-III branch stops, what's the ratio of band 1 to band 2 flux.

If pp-III stopped, and it was a major source of high-energy neutrinos, then band 2 would be significantly reduced, but band 1 might be less affected. So for example, if band 2 used to have 90% from pp-III and 10% from others, and band 1 had 50% from pp-III and 50% from others. If pp-III stops, band 2 goes from 90% to 0% (if it's only pp-III), while band 1 goes down to 0% + 50% (if pp-III contributed 50%).

Wait, no. The question states that only the pp-III branch stops; other reactions continue. So other neutrino sources (like pp-I, pp-II, CNO) continue.

But I think the main point is that the pp chain's main neutrino production is around 200 keV, but the pp-III branch might produce a higher energy neutrino. For example, the pp-III branch is thought to contribute to the production of neutrinos in the 600-800 keV range. So if pp-III stops, the flux in that energy band would drop.

But the question is about the ratio of band 1 (700-800) to band 2 (800-900). So if the pp-III neutrinos are mostly in band 1, then stopping pp-III would decrease band 1's flux more than band 2.

Alternatively, maybe pp-III produces neutrinos in both band 1 and band 2, but more in band 1.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the flux contributions.

Assume that in band 1 (700-800), a significant fraction comes from pp-III, say 70%, and the rest from other processes. In band 2 (800-900), maybe 30% from pp-III and the rest from others (like CNO or other branches).

If pp-III stops, the contributions to band 1 would drop from 70% to 0%, while band 2 drops from 30% to 0%.

Wait, but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are all in band 1, and band 2 neutrinos come from other sources, like CNO. So in this case, stopping pp-III would affect band 1, but not band 2.

Wait, but that's not the case. The CNO neutrinos are higher energy, around 1-2 MeV, so they would be in higher energy bands than both 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So maybe the 700-800 and 800-900 keV neutrinos come from the pp chain, particularly the pp-III branch.

Wait, perhaps the pp chain produces neutrinos in the 200 keV range, but the pp-III branch produces a specific part of the spectrum. Let me think of the solar neutrino spectrum. The main peak is at about 170 keV, but the higher-energy part (like 600-800 keV) comes from the pp-III branch.

If that's the case, then when the pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 (700-800) would drop significantly, but band 2 (800-900) might not be affected as much if that's outside the pp-III range. Alternatively, if pp-III contributes to both bands, but more to band 1, then the flux in band 1 would decrease more than band 2, leading to a lower ratio (band1/band2).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energy ranges. Let me think from another angle.

The pp-I branch produces the main neutrinos at around 200 keV. The pp-II and pp-III produce higher-energy ones. The pp-III branch is considered to produce neutrinos around 500-800 keV. So if that's the case, then band 1 (700-800) would have a lot of pp-III neutrinos, and band 2 (800-900) might have a little from pp-III and perhaps some from other sources (but if CNO is higher, maybe 1 MeV and above, so 800-900 could be part of the CNO neutrinos).

Wait, no, because CNO neutrinos are in higher energy ranges. So 800-900 keV would still be in the range of pp-III, perhaps. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces the neutrinos up to about 800 keV, and beyond that, other processes take over. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 (700-800) would be much lower, but band 2 (800-900) might not be affected much if it's from CNO.

Wait, but if CNO neutrinos are in 1-2 MeV, then 800-900 would be below that. So maybe that part is from the pp chain's higher branches, which would include pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the main contributor to the 700-800 keV range, and also contributes to 800-900. So, if pp-III stops, both bands would lose their flux, but perhaps band 1 loses more.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the overall structure. The problem is asking what the flux ratio would be after the pp-III branch stops. So, when the pp-III stops, the flux from that source is removed.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to band 1 and perhaps a significant part of band 2.

If pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band 1 and a smaller source for band 2, then after stopping, the flux in band 1 would drop much more than band 2. So the ratio band1/band2 would be less than 1.

Alternatively, if the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band 2, then the ratio would be higher. Wait, no. Because if band 2's flux is mostly from pp-III, and band 1 is also affected, then the ratio would depend on how much each band is affected.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band 1, and perhaps only a small part of band 2. So without pp-III, band 1's flux drops to a small fraction, while band 2's flux remains roughly the same (assuming band 2 is not much affected by pp-III).

So, for example, if prior to the stoppage, band 1 had 90% from pp-III and 10% from others, and band 2 had 50% from pp-III and 50% from others.

After stopping pp-III, band 1's flux becomes 10% of its previous value, and band 2's becomes 50% of previous.

So, the ratio (band1/band2) would be (0.1)/(0.5) = 0.2. But that's not one of the options. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me think differently.

Suppose that the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to band 1 and a significant part of band 2. Let's say band 1 is 90% pp-III, and band 2 is 50% pp-III.

After the stoppage, band 1 drops to 10% of its original, and band 2 drops to 50% of original.

Then the ratio would be (0.9 / 0.5) = 1.8, which is close to 1.8, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III contributes more to band 2 than band 1, which would make the ratio higher.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relative contributions. Suppose the pp-III neutrinos are about 10% of the total neutrino flux, but concentrated in higher energy bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main source in the 700-800 keV range, and not much in the 800-900. So when pp-III stops, band 1's flux drops to near zero, but band 2's (if it's from another source) remains about the same.

Wait, but if band 2's flux is from a source that's not affected (like CNO), then the flux in band 2 remains the same, while band 1 drops. So the ratio (band1/band2) would be very low.

Wait, but in that scenario, if band 1 is entirely from pp-III, which stopped, and band 2 is from CNO which continues, then band1 flux would drop to zero, and band2 remains same. So ratio would be 0. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in both bands but more so in band 1. So, if we stop pp-III, band 1's flux would decrease by a larger amount than band 2's.

Wait, but without knowing the exact energy distributions, it's hard. Let me think about the options. The options are A)10, B)0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

So, think about it: if pp-III neutrinos are concentrated in band 1, then stopping pp-III would make band1 flux drop more than band2, so the ratio would be lower than 1.

The options for ratios lower than 1 are B, D, and C (1 is same). So, what's the approximate ratio?

If pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band1, then the ratio would decrease. For example, if originally the flux ratio was about 1 (C), but now it drops to 0.1 (D), or even lower.

Alternatively, maybe the flux in 700-800 is from pp-III and the 800-900 is from another source. So, if pp-III stopped, the 700-800 flux drops to 0, while 800-900 remains same. So the ratio is 0, but that's not an option.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stopped. So, for the neutrinos detected now, it's the ones produced after the stoppage. Because the time delay is 8.5 minutes, which is the time for neutrinos to reach us. So, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos we receive now are the ones produced during that time.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced continuously. So, when the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted after that time (which would have taken 8.5 minutes to reach us) would have a different composition.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos that have arrived in the last 8.5 minutes are the ones emitted since the pp-III stopped. So, the current neutrino flux comes from two sources: the pp-III neutrinos (stopped) and other neutrinos.

Wait, no. Because if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted during those 8.5 minutes since the stoppage would have left the Sun and are on their way to Earth. So, the flux we observe now would be the neutrinos produced in the last 8.5 minutes, which do not include the pp-III neutrinos, which were stopped.

But the question is asking about the ratio of the flux between two bands. So, if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos in the higher energy bands (like 700-800 and 800-900) that were previously emitted by pp-III are now not being produced. So, the flux in those bands would decrease.

But the exact effect on the ratio depends on how much each band's flux was contributed by pp-III.

Another approach: think about the solar neutrino spectrum. The main peak is around 170 keV (from the dominant pp chain). Then, there's a higher-energy component from the pp-III branch, perhaps in the 500-800 keV range. The CNO neutrinos are much higher, around 1-2 MeV.

So, band1 is 700-800 keV (within the pp-III range) and band2 is 800-900 keV (which might be the start of the CNO or perhaps the tail end of pp-III).

If pp-III stopped, then the 700-800 band would lose a significant amount of its flux, while the 800-900 band would lose only a little (if any) if its main source is CNO.

Wait, but CNO neutrinos are at higher energies, so 800-900 might be the lower end of CNO's range. But in that case, stopping pp-III would affect band1 more than band2. So the flux in band1 would drop more than band2.

So, the ratio (band1 / band2) would decrease. If before the stoppage, the ratio was about 1, then after, it would drop to, say, 0.1. Which is option D.

Alternatively, if the pp-III contributes more to band2 than band1, the ratio would be higher than 1, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, but without knowing the exact contribution percentages, how can I approximate? The answer options are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1.

If the main contribution to band1 is from pp-III, and band2 is from another source, then the ratio would be (0)/(flux_band2) → 0. But 0 isn't an option. Alternatively, if it's a significant but not complete drop, perhaps the ratio is 0.1.

Wait, another thought: the pp-III neutrinos are in the 700-800 keV band. So, if they stop, band1's flux drops to near zero, but band2 (800-900) is from other sources, so the flux remains the same. So the ratio (band1 / band2) becomes approximately zero, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm wrong about the energy ranges.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos contribute primarily to the 800-900 keV band, making band2 their main source. If that's the case, then stopping pp-III would drop band2 more than band1, making the ratio (band1/band2) higher.

Wait, but this is getting too speculative.

Let me sum up: the pp-III branch is a higher-energy branch in the proton-proton fusion. It produces neutrinos in a higher energy range than the main pp branch. So, if pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in higher energy bands (like 700-800 and 800-900 keV) would decrease.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos are the main source for band1 (700-800 keV), and perhaps a significant source for band2 (800-900 keV), then the flux in these bands would drop.

But the question is, what's the ratio of band1 to band2. If the pp-III neutrinos are mainly in band1, then the ratio would be lower than before. Suppose before the stoppage, band1 and band2 had similar contributions from pp-III. But after stopping, band1 would have less contribution, so the ratio (band1/band2) would be lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band1 is entirely from pp-III, and band2 is from other sources. So, band1's flux drops to zero, while band2 remains the same. So the ratio would be zero, but that's not an option.

Given the options, and considering that the pp-III neutrinos are in the 700-800 keV range, stopping it would cause band1's flux to drop more than band2's. So the ratio would be less than 1. Among the options, 0.1 (option D) or 0.01 (option B) are possibilities.

Which is more likely? If the pp-III neutrinos are a significant fraction (say, 10%) of the total neutrino flux, but concentrated in band1, then the flux in band1 would drop by 10%, making the ratio perhaps 10% of what it was. Alternatively, if band1's flux is 100% from pp-III and band2's is 50% from pp-III, then after stopping, band1 is 0 and band2 is 50% → ratio is 0, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The flux of neutrinos from the pp-III branch in the 700-800 keV band is much higher than in the 800-900 keV band. So, if the pp-III stops, the flux in band1 drops more than in band2. So the ratio (band1/band2) would be smaller. If previously, the ratio was 1, now it's 0.1.

Wait, I think the correct answer is D) 0.1. So the ratio would be approximately 0.1.

The question involves the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core, which affects the production of neutrinos. The pp-III branch is a higher-energy branch of the proton-proton chain and is responsible for producing neutrinos in specific energy ranges. The problem asks for the approximate ratio of the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2) after the pp-III branch stops.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Production in the Sun**:  
   - The dominant proton-proton (pp) chain produces neutrinos with energies around 200 keV.  
   - The pp-III branch, a higher-energy branch of the pp chain, produces neutrinos in the range of 500-800 keV.  
   - The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, typically around 1-2 MeV, which are outside the energy bands in question.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:  
   - The pp-III branch is the primary source of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range (band 1).  
   - The 800-900 keV range (band 2) may have contributions from the pp-III branch, but it is less likely to be dominated by it compared to band 1.  
   - If the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) will decrease significantly, while the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) will decrease less severely, as it may still receive contributions from other sources (e.g., the tail of the pp-III spectrum or other minor processes).

3. **Flux Ratio After the Stoppage**:  
   - Before the stoppage, the flux in band 1 was primarily from the pp-III branch, while band 2 had a smaller contribution from pp-III and possibly other sources.  
   - After the stoppage, band 1's flux drops significantly, while band 2's flux remains relatively unchanged.  
   - This leads to a reduction in the ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2. If the ratio was approximately 1 before the stoppage, it is likely to decrease to around 0.1 after the stoppage.

### Conclusion:
The approximate ratio of the flux between band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch stops is **0.1**.
