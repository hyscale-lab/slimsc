Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So the expression σ · n would be the sum of each Pauli matrix multiplied by the corresponding component of n. Like, n is a unit vector, so n = (n_x, n_y, n_z), and σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. 

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are known. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Each Pauli matrix, when multiplied by a coefficient and summed, forms a Hermitian operator, and the eigenvalues are the possible outcomes of a measurement.

But the Hamiltonian here is a scalar product of ε with the vector of Pauli matrices. So the operator H is a 2x2 matrix because it's built from Pauli matrices. Since each Pauli matrix is 2x2, any linear combination will also be a 2x2 matrix. So the eigenvalues will be two values, as it's a 2x2 matrix.

I remember that for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1. But wait, the Hamiltonian here is a sum of them multiplied by their components in the direction of n, and then scaled by ε.

Wait, the general form for the eigenvalues of a spin-1/2 system in a magnetic field in direction n is proportional to the spin component along n. The eigenvalues should be ± (something) times the magnetic field strength or similar.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the trace and determinant of the Hamiltonian. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the sum of the eigenvalues is the trace, and the product is the determinant.

Wait, but each Pauli matrix has trace zero and determinant -1. But when you have a scaled version, like ε σ · n, what's the trace and determinant?

Wait, the trace of H would be zero because each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues would be λ and -λ. So the eigenvalues are symmetric around zero.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1 and -1. That would fit, but scaled perhaps by some factor.

Option B: ε and -ε. That's possible.

Option C: (εħ/2) and -(εħ/2). That also seems plausible because I remember spin terms often have factors of ħ/2.

Option D: ħ/2 and -ħ/2. That would be if ε was 1 and n was along some axis, but the question is general for any unit vector n, so ε is a given constant.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless. Because each Pauli matrix σ_i is a 2x2 matrix with elements like [0,1;1,0], which are dimensionless. So H has the dimension of ε because σ · n is dimensionless. So the eigenvalues should have the same dimension as ε, which is energy.

So looking at the options, option B has eigenvalues with the same dimension as ε, which is correct. Option C also has the same dimension, since ε is energy, ħ has units of J·s, so ε ħ/2 is energy * action, which would not have the right dimension. Wait, no, wait. No, no, because in the expression H = ε σ · n, the σ matrices are dimensionless, and ε is energy. So H is energy. So its eigenvalues should be energy values.

Wait, let's think about the eigenvalues of σ · n. Because σ·n is a sum of Pauli matrices scaled by their components. The eigenvalues would be ±1 for each Pauli matrix, but when you have a sum, like σ·n, the eigenvalues are ±1 because each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1, and when diagonalizing σ·n, the eigenvalues would be ±1. So H = ε (σ · n) would have eigenvalues ±ε.

So that would point to option B: +ε, -ε.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because I recall that spin matrices have factors of ħ/2. Oh! Because in the Pauli matrices, sometimes they are written as σ_i = (ℏ/ħ) something, but no, wait, the actual Pauli matrices are just the matrices with elements 0,1, etc., which are dimensionless. So in the expression for the Hamiltonian, if H is given as ε times the Pauli vector, perhaps the eigenvalues are ±ε.

Wait another way: the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1 because for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So scaling by ε gives ±ε as the eigenvalues.

So the eigenvalues are plus and minus epsilon. So the correct option is B.

Wait, but wait another thought. The Pauli matrices are represented as spin matrices, which often have a factor of ħ/2 in front. For example, the spin operator S is (ℏ/2) σ. So S · n would have eigenvalues ± ℏ/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. So that's different from S · n.

So if H were proportional to (σ · n) multiplied by some energy factor, then the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

So looking back at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So that's the answer.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the vector of Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The goal is to determine the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Hamiltonian**: The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of the unit vector \( \vec{n} \). This operator is Hermitian, and its eigenvalues are known to be \( \pm 1 \) for any unit vector \( \vec{n} \).

2. **Scaling by \( \varepsilon \)**: The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) scales the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) by \( \varepsilon \). Since the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \).

3. **Dimensional Consistency**: The eigenvalues of \( H \) must have the same dimension as \( \varepsilon \), which is energy. This rules out options that introduce factors inconsistent with the dimensionality of \( \varepsilon \).

4. **Eliminating Incorrect Options**:
   - **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because these eigenvalues are dimensionless, whereas \( \varepsilon \) has the dimension of energy.
   - **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it introduces an extra factor of \( \hbar/2 \), which is not present in the given Hamiltonian.
   - **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it is dimensionally inconsistent with \( \varepsilon \) and does not involve \( \varepsilon \) in the eigenvalues.

5. **Correct Option**: Option B, \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \), is consistent with the structure of the Hamiltonian and the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

### Conclusion:
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).
