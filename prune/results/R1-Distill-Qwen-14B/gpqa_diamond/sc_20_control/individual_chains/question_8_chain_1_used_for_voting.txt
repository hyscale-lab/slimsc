Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The question is about figuring out which genes are involved in resistance to anthracnose based on the knockout mutant data provided.

Let me start by reading the question carefully. We have three genes: G1, G2, and G3. Each has a knockout mutant (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The resistance levels of these mutants are given.

The key here is that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. If a gene is a transcription factor and it's knocked out, the downstream genes it regulates won't be expressed, leading to a more severe phenotype.

Looking at the resistance data:

- Wild-type (control) is 100% resistant.
- g1: 75% → So, less resistant than wild-type but not super bad.
- g2: 0% → Complete loss of resistance, which is pretty severe.
- g3: 50% → Reduced resistance but not as bad as g2.
- Double mutants:
   - g1g3: 10% → Very low resistance, worse than either g1 or g3 alone.
   - g2g3: 0% → Same as g2.
   - g1g2: 0% → Same as g2.

Hmm, so the double mutants involving g2 are all 0%, same as g2 alone. That suggests that when g2 is knocked out, adding another knockout doesn't make things worse or better. So maybe g2 is a transcription factor that's upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 affects both, then knocking out G2 would disable both pathways, leading to maximum susceptibility.

Wait, but looking at the single mutants: g2 is 0% resistance, which is the lowest. So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes (like G1 and G3) which in turn contribute to resistance.

What about the double mutants without g2? Like g1g3: they have 10% resistance. So the double mutant of G1 and G3 is worse than either single mutant. That might suggest that they are in the same pathway, but maybe they have some overlapping functions. Alternatively, if they're in separate pathways, you'd expect the combined effect to be additive or something else.

Wait, but g1 and g3's single mutants have 75% and 50% respectively. Their double is 10%, which is much worse. That suggests that when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower than either alone. That might imply that their functions are additive, or perhaps they're in the same pathway. Alternatively, maybe they are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other. But if both are knocked out, resistance drops more.

Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but perhaps they can each contribute, so when both are gone, the pathway is completely disabled, leading to more severe resistance loss.

Wait, but G2's single mutant already has 0% resistance. So if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So the resistance is zero because both are knocked out. So in the g1 mutant, G2 is still active, so maybe G3 is expressed, but not enough to provide full resistance. Similarly, in g3 mutant, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed, but not enough. So the single mutants have partial loss, while the double mutants where both G1 and G3 are knocked out (like g1g2 and g3g2) are as bad as g2.

Wait, but the double mutants without G2? Like g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So maybe G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that each contribute to resistance. So if you knock out both, it's worse than either one.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3, meaning that in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So the single mutants g1 and g3 might have some residual function because maybe one of the other genes is still active. Hmm, but that might not fit with the data.

Looking at the options:

Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's relevant here. Also, G2 is epistatic to G1. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If G2 is epistatic, maybe G1's effect is only seen when G2 is present. But in the data, g1 has 75%, so perhaps G2 is downstream? Not sure.

Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they are co-regulated, perhaps by G2. But if their promoters are the same, knocking out G2 would knock out both G1 and G3. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then in g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. But then why are the single mutants g1 and g3 showing partial resistance? Unless G1 and G3 are regulated by other factors as well.

Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3, then in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So when you have g1, G2 is active, so G3 would be expressed. Similarly, in g3, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed. That would explain why g1 and g3 have lower but non-zero resistance.

Ah, that makes sense. So in the single mutants, one gene (G2) is active but the other is knocked out. So G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3. So in g1, G2 is active but G1 is knocked out, so G3 is expressed, providing some resistance. Similarly, in g3, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed, providing some resistance.

But wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, then in a g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. So that's why g2 is 0% resistance. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: Same as g2, which is 0% because G2 is knocked out, so G1 is not expressed either, but wait no, in g1g2, both are knocked out. But wait, if G2 is a TF for G1 and G3, then in g2, G1 isn't expressed either. So in g1g2, both G1 and G2 are knocked out. But since G2 is upstream of G1, in g2, G1 is not expressed. So the phenotype of g1g2 would be same as g2.

Similarly, g3g2 would be same as g2.

Now looking at g1g3: their resistance is 10%. If G2 is a TF for both, then in g1g3, G2 is active. So both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is active. Wait, but G2 is a TF for G1 and G3. So in the absence of G1 and G3, but G2 is present. But if G2 doesn't have any function beyond regulating G1 and G3, then the resistance would depend on other factors. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both g1 and g3. So perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, and their combined absence leads to more severe resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so each contributes to resistance, and knocking both out leads to additive effects. But 75% (g1) + 50% (g3) doesn't add up to 10% directly. Hmm, maybe not.

So, from the single mutants, g2 is the most severe, suggesting G2 is a TF. So looking at the options, the correct answer probably has G2 as the transcription factor.

Looking at the options, options C and D have G2 as the TF.

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 affect other traits besides resistance. I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question is about resistance, so maybe that's not the key point.

Epistatic: if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the function of G3 is dependent on G1. Or vice versa.

Wait, what's epistasis? It's when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the presence of a certain allele in gene A masks the effect of gene B.

In terms of the mutants, let's think about the double mutants.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3 would only be seen when G1 is functional. So in a g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as g1, because G1 is epistatic (so G3's effect is masked). But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic towards G3.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic towards G1, then the effect of G1 would only be seen when G3 is functional. So in g1g3, the phenotype would be the same as g3, which is 50%. But the data shows 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, but in the case where G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3, then in the g1g3 double mutant, both are knocked out, so G2 is active, but the downstream genes are gone? No, because if G2 is a TF for G1 and G3, then in the g1g3 mutant (without G1 and G3), G2 is still present. Hmm, but G2's product is a TF, so it's the presence of G2 that allows G1 and G3 to be expressed. So if G1 and G3 are knocked out, their expression is zero regardless of G2.

Wait no, in the mutants, the genes are knocked out, so G1 and G3 are not expressed, regardless of G2. So in the g1g3 double mutant, G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are knocked out. So G2 can't regulate them. So the resistance would depend on other factors. But since G2 is a TF for G1 and G3, which are part of the resistance pathway, their absence leads to lower resistance.

So in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So maybe G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that each contribute to resistance, so knocking both out reduces resistance more.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other. So if one is present, the other can take over. But when both are knocked out, resistance drops more. Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So that could fit.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function, so knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype than either single knockout. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then each can contribute to resistance on their own, but together, their combined loss leads to a much worse phenotype.

But wait, in our case, when G1 and G3 are both knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that fits with redundancy. Because each gene contributes to the same function, so losing both leads to a bigger effect.

So putting it together, G2 is the transcription factor regulating G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are redundant, so their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

So looking at the options:

Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, but does G1 being epistatic fit here?

Epistatic would mean that the effect of G3 is dependent on G1. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of a mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3. So in a g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as g1. But in reality, the double mutant is worse, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps the epistatic relationship isn't accurate here.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. Then the effect of G1 would be masked when G3 is mutated. So in the g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype would resemble g3. But the data shows it's 10%, which is worse than both. So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the epistatic part isn't directly about the double mutant, but about their regulation. If G2 is a transcription factor for both, then G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, because G2's function is upstream. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. → No, because G2's single mutant is worse than G1.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. → Same promoter suggests they're regulated together. But G1 and G3 have different single mutant resistances, so perhaps they're co-regulated but contribute differently.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3. → Perhaps G1's function affects G3's pathway.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3. → Redundancy seems to fit, but the epistatic part may not.

Wait, another approach: looking at the double mutants.

In the double mutants, any mutant that includes g2 has 0% resistance. So the presence of g2 is masking the effect of the other gene. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the effect of G1 or G3 doesn't matter—the resistance is already 0%.

But none of the options directly say that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. So in g2 mutants, G1's effect is masked. Which fits, because in any double mutant involving g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, G1's presence doesn't matter.

Similarly, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So in the g2g3 mutant, the resistance is 0% same as g2.

So in this scenario, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. That is, G2 is upstream. Because if G2 is knocked out, regardless of the state of G1 and G3, the resistance is 0%.

So in the options, which one correctly describes G2 as a TF and that G2 is epistatic to the others.

Looking again at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF → No, because G2 is the TF (since g2 is the most severe).

Option B: G2 is TF → Yes. G3 is epistatic to G1 → Hmm, but in the data, without G2, G3's effect is masked. So G2 is epistatic to both.

Option C: G2 TF → Yes. G1 and G3 pleiotropic → Maybe. G1 epistatic to G3 → Not sure.

Option D: G2 TF → Yes. G1 and G3 redundant → Fits with g1g3 being worse than either. G1 epistatic → Not sure.

So if G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, that would explain why any double mutant including G2 has 0% resistance. So the correct option should have G2 as a TF and G2 being epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, which one mentions G2 as a TF and that G2 is epistatic to G1 and/or G3.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1 → So only G2 is epistatic to G1, but what about G3? It's not clear.

Option B: G2 is TF, G3 is epistatic to G1. So G3's effect masks G1. But in the data, when both are knocked out (g1g3), their resistance is worse than either, so that seems opposite.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3. → I'm not sure about the pleiotropy. Also, G1 being epistatic would mean in g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1, but data is worse.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 redundant. G1 is epistatic to G3. → So in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, which matches redundancy. But the epistasis part doesn't fit since the double is worse than either.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of epistatic relationships. If G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, then the presence of G2's mutation masks the effect of G1 and G3. So in any double mutant involving G2, the phenotype is same as G2, which is what the data shows.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and it's epistatic to G1 and G3. So which option states that?

Looking at the options, option A says G2 is epistatic to G1. But what about G3? There's no option that directly states G2 is epistatic to both.

Option D says G1 is epistatic to G3. Not directly related to G2's epistasis.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not directly about G2 being epistatic, but more about the hierarchy. G2 being a TF suggests that it's upstream, so any downstream effects are dependent on G2.

So, in terms of the hierarchy, G2 is upstream, so G2's mutation would mask the effects of G1 and G3. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

In the options, which one reflects that?

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. So only G1 is downstream of G2.

Option B: G2 is TF; G3 is epistatic to G1. So G3 is upstream of G1.

Option C: G1 is epistatic to G3.

Option D: G1 is epistatic to G3.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is A (G2 epistatic to G1) and since G2 is also epistatic to G3 (as the g2g3 and g1g2 have same as g2), but none of the options state that.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and that the effects of G1 and G3 are only seen when G2 is functional. So G2 is epistatic to both.

In the options, which one has G2 as TF and G2 epistatic.

Option A: G1 is TF → No.

Option B: G2 is TF; G3 epistatic to G1 → Doesn't directly address G2's epistasis.

Option C: G2 is TF; G1 epistatic → Not about G2.

Option D: G2 is TF; G1 and G3 redundant; G1 epistatic → Not about G2’s epistasis.

Wait, perhaps none of the options directly say that G2 is epistatic to both. But I have to choose from the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the data suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning that G2 is upstream.

In that case, the correct option would be the one where G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So looking again:

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1 → Only.

Option B: G3 is epistatic to G1 → No.

Option C: G1 is epistatic → No.

Option D: G1 is epistatic → No.

So the only option where G2 is stated as epistatic is option A. But option A says G1 is a TF, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that G2 is the TF.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's reevaluate. The question says at least one of the genes is a TF. So perhaps G2 is that TF.

In the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is the most severe. So that suggests G2 is a TF regulating other genes that are necessary for resistance.

So, the correct option must have G2 as the TF.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF → No.

Option B: G2 is TF → Yes.

Option C: G2 is TF → Yes.

Option D: G2 is TF → Yes.

So options B, C, D are possible.

Option B's description: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So they're co-regulated. But in the data, g1 has 75%, g3 has 50%. If they have same promoter, knocking out G2 (the TF) would knock out both. But in the data, the single mutants (g1 and g3) have partial resistance. So perhaps G1 and G3 are not solely regulated by G2's TF.

Alternatively, perhaps the promoters are the same, but they have other regulators as well. So in g1, G2 is present but G1 is knocked out. So G3 is expressed via other TFs, leading to 75% resistance. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Maybe, but not directly relevant. G1 is epistatic to G3.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That fits with the g1g3 double mutant being worse than either.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined loss leads to worse resistance. That supports option D.

So, putting it together: G2 is a transcription factor (so it's upstream), G1 and G3 are redundant (so they contribute to the same pathway, and losing both makes it worse), and G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but what does G1 being epistatic to G3 mean in this context? If G1 is epistatic to G3, the presence of a mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3.

But in the data, the g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, the phenotype would be same as g1 (75%), but it's worse. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the epistatic part is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the epistatic relationship is that G3 is epistatic to G1. So the effect of G1 would only be seen when G3 is functional. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the epistatic part in the options isn't directly related to the double mutant data. Maybe it's about their regulation. Like, G1's expression is regulated by G3 or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm getting confused. Let's try to think again.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor. The other conclusion is that the double mutants involving G2 are as bad as G2 alone, which suggests that G2 is epistatic to the others. So in any situation where G2 is knocked out, the others don't matter.

So, any mutant that has g2 has 0% resistance. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

In the options, which one states that G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But since we concluded G2 is the TF, option A is out.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter suggests G1 and G3 are co-regulated, but their single mutants have different resistance levels. So perhaps G1 and G3 are both targets of G2's regulation, but each contributes differently. So maybe the 'same promoter' isn't accurate.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Again, pleiotropy may not fit. But gene redundancy seems more plausible for the g1g3 data.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy fits the g1g3 data. But the epistasis part is unclear.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think about what each option says.

Option D says G1 and G3 are redundant and G1 is epistatic. So in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. That fits redundancy. But what about the epistasis? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in a g1g3 mutant, the effect would be like g1. But the data is worse than both, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps the epistasis statement in option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the epistasis part isn't necessary, but the redundancy is the main point.

Wait, but the options must be correct as a whole. So which option correctly combines the data?

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it from another angle.

The key points:

1. G2's single mutant (g2) is 0% resistant. So G2 is important for resistance.

2. Double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) are 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

3. Single mutants g1 and g3: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So each contributes but when G2 is active.

4. Double mutant g1g3 is 10% → worse than either. So their contributions are additive or in parallel pathways.

So, the correct conclusion is that:

- G2 is a transcription factor (since it's the most severe, and in its absence, all resistance is lost).

- G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 (since any mutation in G2 masks the effect of the others).

- G1 and G3 are either in parallel pathways or are redundant.

Looking at the options, which one has G2 as TF and G2 epistatic.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. So yes, but what about G3? No, it doesn't cover both.

Option B: G2 is TF. G3 is epistatic to G1. So in the g1g3 double, the resistance would be same as g3 (50%), but data shows 10%. So no.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy not directly relevant. But the g1g3 data would fit if they are in the same pathway but their loss makes it worse, but epistasis would predict the opposite.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 are redundant. G1 is epistatic.

Redundancy fits the g1g3 data. But the epistasis part may not.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not present. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I need to think about which is the best fit.

Option D says G1 and G3 are redundant. So their combined knockout is worse than either. That fits the g1g3 data.

But why does the option mention G1 is epistatic to G3? Maybe because G1 is epistatic in the sense that G3's function is redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A, but I think I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But we have G2 as the TF, not G1. So option A is wrong.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 share promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

If G1 and G3 have same promoter, then knocking out G2 would knock out both, but in the data, their single mutants are partially resistant. So perhaps they have other promoters as well. But I'm not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 is epistatic, then in g1g3, the phenotype should resemble g1. But data is worse, so it's not.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy fits, but the epistasis doesn't.

Alternatively, maybe the epistasis part in option D refers to the hierarchy of their redundancy. So G1 is epistatic in that when both are knocked out, the effect is additive beyond just redundancy.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should go with the option that best fits the data.

- G2 is a TF.

- Any mutation in G2 makes the resistance 0%, so G2 is epistatic to both.

- G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps redundant, leading to a worse phenotype when both are knocked out.

So option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But I'm not sure about the epistasis part.

Wait, perhaps redundancy isn't the case. Maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, so their combined knockout leads to an additive effect, which is worse than either.

So perhaps they are in separate pathways. So G2 is a TF for both, each gene contributes to a separate pathway. So knocking out both leads to additive loss of resistance.

In that case, the double mutant's phenotype would be worse than either single mutant, which matches the data.

So, which option reflects that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (non-redundant) and G2 is upstream.

Looking at the options, option B says G1 and G3 have same promoter (so same regulation), but their single mutants have different resistance, so that may not fit.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are co-regulated but have different functions, then knocking out either leads to partial loss, and knocking both leads to worse.

So, perhaps option B is correct.

Wait, option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

If they have same promoter, then both are regulated by G2. So in the g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. In g3 mutant, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed.

In the double mutant, g1g3, both are knocked out. So G2 is active, but no G1 or G3. So resistance is even lower, matching the data.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the effect of G1 is only seen when G3 is present. But in g1g3, both are absent, so the effect is lower than either, which fits.

So, for option B:

- G2 is a TF → correct.

- G1 and G3 have same promoter → correct, as they're co-regulated by G2.

- G3 is epistatic to G1 → So the effect of G1 is only seen when G3 is present.

Hmm, but in the data, g1 mutant has 75% resistance, which is worse than wild type (100%), but better than the g1g3 double at 10%. So perhaps G3 is epistatic in that G3's presence is required for G1's function.

Wait, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the absence of G3, the effect of G1 doesn't matter. So in a g1g3 mutant, the effect is same as g3, which is 50%. But the data shows 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

So perhaps option B is incorrect.

At this point, I think the best fit is option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. But since G2's single mutant already causes 0% resistance, perhaps G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. But none of the options directly state that.

But looking at the options again, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. So if G2 is epistatic to G1, then in the g1g2 mutant, the resistance is same as g2, which is 0%. Similarly for g2g3 and g1g2, which is true in the data.

But what about the g1g3 mutant? Since G2 is present, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and each contributes.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the order of effects.

In a genetic pathway, if gene A is upstream of gene B, then a mutation in A (epistatic) masks the effect of B. So if a mutation in G2 (the TF) is epistatic, then any mutation in G1 or G3 won't change the phenotype when G2 is already mutated.

The data supports this: any double mutant with G2 is 0% (same as G2 single). So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the single mutants' resistances: G1 (75%) and G3 (50%). So both contribute to resistance but are downstream of G2.

The g1g3 double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either. So this might suggest that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. If they were in the same pathway, their combined knockout might not lead to such a severe phenotype beyond what either single mutant shows. But since they are additive, it's possible they are in separate pathways.

So the conclusion is that:

- G2 is a TF, upstream of both G1 and G3.

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (or redundant) contributing to resistance.

So looking at the options, the only one that correctly states G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 is not present, but the closest is option A, which says G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, but the correct option must be among the four. Let's think again.

Another way to look at epistasis: which comes first in the pathway.

If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then A is downstream of B. So the product of A is necessary for B's function.

Wait, no, actually, if A is epistatic to B, then the pathway is B → A. So the mutation in A masks the effect of B.

Wait, correction: If A is epistatic to B, the pathway is B → A. So a mutation in A would prevent the pathway from working, regardless of B's state.

In our case, in the g2 mutants, the resistance is 0%, and any double mutant with g2 has 0%. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream of G1 and G3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then G2 is upstream, so G1 and G3 are downstream. So mutations in G1 or G3 would not affect G2's function.

So G2 being a TF and upstream, when mutated, is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So the correct option must have G2 as TF, and that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is TF → No.

Option B: G2 is TF, G3 is epistatic → So G3 is epistatic to G1. But G2 is upstream of both.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 is epistatic to G3 → But G2 is upstream.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, G1 is epistatic.

Well, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me read option A again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But this contradicts our finding that G2 is the TF. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

If G1 and G3 have same promoter, then they're co-regulated. So in g1, G3 is expressed, leading to 75% resistance. In g3, G1 is expressed, leading to 50% resistance. So G3's contribution is higher than G1's.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3 (50%), but data shows 10%, so this doesn't fit.

So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

Redundancy fits the g1g3 data, but the epistasis doesn't. So perhaps the epistasis part is irrelevant, but the option includes it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think again.

G2's single mutant is 0%, which is worse than G1 and G3. So G2 is a TF upstream of both. So the correct option must have G2 as TF and G2 epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking back, the only option that says G2 is a TF is options B, C, D.

Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. If G3 is epistatic, then in g1g3, resistance would resemble g3, which is 50%. But the data is 10%, so not matching.

Option C: G1 is epistatic → In g1g3, resistance would resemble g1 (75%), but data is 10%. Not matching.

Option D: G1 and G3 redundant → g1g3 is worse, which fits. But G1 is epistatic → doesn't fit the data.

So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the closest is option A, despite it incorrectly stating G1 as TF.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. The question says at least one gene is a TF. It's possible that more than one is a TF, but our conclusion is that G2 is the TF.

So the correct option should have G2 as TF.

Now, looking at the options:

Only options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Now, which of these options correctly describes the gene interactions.

Option B: G1 and G3 have same promoter → same regulation.

But their single mutants have different resistances, so maybe they're co-regulated by G2 but have different functions.

In the g1g3 double, their resistance is 10%, which is worse than either, indicating additive effects. So perhaps they are in parallel pathways.

So, if they're co-regulated by G2, but act in separate pathways, their double knockout leads to additive loss.

So, in that case, G1 and G3 are not redundant but in parallel pathways.

So, which option matches this?

Option B says G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

If they have same promoter, their expression is co-regulated. So in g1, G3 is expressed, and vice versa.

But their single mutants have 75% and 50%, which suggests they contribute differently.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3 (50%), but the data is 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure.

Option D: G1 and G3 show redundancy. So their combined loss is worse.

But the epistasis part in option D doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: which option correctly captures the hierarchy.

G2 is a TF.

g2 has 0% → G2 is essential for any resistance.

g1g2 and g3g2 are 0% → G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

g1 has 75% → So G1 contributes to resistance, but not as much as G2.

g3 has 50% → G3 also contributes, but less.

g1g3 has 10% → Both contribute, but their combined absence leads to additive loss.

So, the pathways involving G1 and G3 are separate, and each contributes to resistance.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

So, the correct conclusion is:

G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, so their combined knockout leads to additive loss of resistance. G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, which option captures this.

Option B: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 same promoter. G3 is epistatic to G1.

But same promoter suggests same regulation, but their resistances suggest different functions. Also, the epistasis part doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 redundant. G1 epistatic to G3.

Redundancy fits the additive effect, but epistasis doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. But then what about G3?

Alternatively, perhaps option A is incorrect because it says G1 is a TF.

So, returning to the options, the only one that states G2 is a TF and that G2 is epistatic to G1 is option A, despite it being incorrect about G1 as TF. But that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming G2 is a TF. Let me think again.

The question says at least one gene is a TF. So it's possible that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are target genes.

In that case, the correct option must have G2 as a TF.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic.

But redundancy plus G1 epistatic doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the order of analysis.

The double mutants involving G2 are 0%, same as G2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF and epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking for an option that says G2 is a TF and epistatic to G1 and G3.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1 → Only.

Option B: G3 is epistatic to G1 → No.

Options C and D: G1 is epistatic → No.

So, among the options, only option A has G2 as epistatic, but option A says G1 is a TF, which contradicts. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The question states that at least one gene is a TF. So we don't know for sure which one, but our data suggests G2 is the TF.

Now, considering the data, the double mutants without G2 are worse than either single, but those with G2 are as bad as G2.

So, the correct option must have G2 as a TF, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, none directly say that.

But perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G2 is epistatic to G1.

But I have to choose from the given options.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option A. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another way: the correct answer is option A: G1 is a TF. But no, because G2's data suggests it's the TF.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another approach: the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). This suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and their combined loss leads to more severe resistance.

Wait, no, if they are in the same pathway, knocking out both wouldn't make it worse than either. Unless they are in parallel pathways.

Alternatively, if they are redundant, then their combined loss leads to worse.

Option D suggests redundancy, which fits.

So, the correct answer is option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Even though the epistasis part doesn't fit, perhaps the redundancy is the key point.

So, I'll go with option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, and G3) contributing to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine. The data provided includes resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to draw conclusions about the roles of these genes, particularly regarding transcription factors (TFs) and epistasis.

### Key Observations:
1. **G2's Single Mutant (g2):** Resistance is 0%, indicating G2 is critical for resistance and likely acts upstream of other genes.
2. **Double Mutants Involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3):** Both show 0% resistance, the same as g2. This suggests G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning G2's function masks the effects of G1 and G3 when it is knocked out.
3. **Single Mutants (g1, g3):** Resistance levels are 75% and 50%, respectively. This indicates that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2.
4. **Double Mutant (g1g3):** Resistance is 10%, worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are either in parallel pathways or are redundant, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** States that G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. However, the data strongly supports G2 as the TF, not G1, making this option incorrect.
- **Option B:** States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1. While G2 is correctly identified as the TF, the data does not support the idea that G1 and G3 have the same promoter or that G3 is epistatic to G1. The resistance levels of g1 and g3 (75% and 50%) suggest they contribute differently, and the double mutant g1g3 (10%) does not align with G3 being epistatic to G1.
- **Option C:** States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy is not directly supported by the data, and the resistance level of g1g3 (10%) does not fit with G1 being epistatic to G3.
- **Option D:** States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. The data supports G2 as the TF, and the resistance level of g1g3 (10%) aligns with G1 and G3 being redundant, as their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 does not fit the data, as the resistance level of g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports G2 as the TF and indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant, as their combined loss leads to additive effects. While the epistasis claim in Option D does not fully align with the data, it is the closest fit among the given options.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The question is about figuring out which genes are involved in resistance to anthracnose based on the knockout mutant data provided.

Let me start by reading the question carefully. We have three genes: G1, G2, and G3. Each has a knockout mutant (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The resistance levels of these mutants are given.

The key here is that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. If a gene is a transcription factor and it's knocked out, the downstream genes it regulates won't be expressed, leading to a more severe phenotype.

Looking at the resistance data:

- Wild-type (control) is 100% resistant.
- g1: 75% → So, less resistant than wild-type but not super bad.
- g2: 0% → Complete loss of resistance, which is pretty severe.
- g3: 50% → Reduced resistance but not as bad as g2.
- Double mutants:
   - g1g3: 10% → Very low resistance, worse than either g1 or g3 alone.
   - g2g3: 0% → Same as g2.
   - g1g2: 0% → Same as g2.

Hmm, so the double mutants involving g2 are all 0%, same as g2 alone. That suggests that when g2 is knocked out, adding another knockout doesn't make things worse or better. So maybe g2 is a transcription factor that's upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 affects both, then knocking out G2 would disable both pathways, leading to maximum susceptibility.

Wait, but looking at the single mutants: g2 is 0% resistance, which is the lowest. So perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes (like G1 and G3) which in turn contribute to resistance.

What about the double mutants without g2? Like g1g3: they have 10% resistance. So the double mutant of G1 and G3 is worse than either single mutant. That might suggest that they are in the same pathway, but maybe they have some overlapping functions. Alternatively, if they're in separate pathways, you'd expect the combined effect to be additive or something else.

Wait, but g1 and g3's single mutants have 75% and 50% respectively. Their double is 10%, which is much worse. That suggests that when both are knocked out, the resistance is much lower than either alone. That might imply that their functions are additive, or perhaps they're in the same pathway. Alternatively, maybe they are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other. But if both are knocked out, resistance drops more.

Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but perhaps they can each contribute, so when both are gone, the pathway is completely disabled, leading to more severe resistance loss.

Wait, but G2's single mutant already has 0% resistance. So if G2 is a transcription factor for G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So the resistance is zero because both are knocked out. So in the g1 mutant, G2 is still active, so maybe G3 is expressed, but not enough to provide full resistance. Similarly, in g3 mutant, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed, but not enough. So the single mutants have partial loss, while the double mutants where both G1 and G3 are knocked out (like g1g2 and g3g2) are as bad as g2.

Wait, but the double mutants without G2? Like g1g3 is 10%, which is much worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So maybe G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that each contribute to resistance. So if you knock out both, it's worse than either one.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is acting upstream of both G1 and G3, meaning that in the absence of G2, both G1 and G3 aren't expressed. So the single mutants g1 and g3 might have some residual function because maybe one of the other genes is still active. Hmm, but that might not fit with the data.

Looking at the options:

Option A) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's relevant here. Also, G2 is epistatic to G1. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If G2 is epistatic, maybe G1's effect is only seen when G2 is present. But in the data, g1 has 75%, so perhaps G2 is downstream? Not sure.

Option B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter would mean they are co-regulated, perhaps by G2. But if their promoters are the same, knocking out G2 would knock out both G1 and G3. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then in g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. But then why are the single mutants g1 and g3 showing partial resistance? Unless G1 and G3 are regulated by other factors as well.

Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3, then in g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed. So when you have g1, G2 is active, so G3 would be expressed. Similarly, in g3, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed. That would explain why g1 and g3 have lower but non-zero resistance.

Ah, that makes sense. So in the single mutants, one gene (G2) is active but the other is knocked out. So G2 is a transcription factor for both G1 and G3. So in g1, G2 is active but G1 is knocked out, so G3 is expressed, providing some resistance. Similarly, in g3, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed, providing some resistance.

But wait, if G2 is a transcription factor, then in a g2 mutant, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. So that's why g2 is 0% resistance. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: Same as g2, which is 0% because G2 is knocked out, so G1 is not expressed either, but wait no, in g1g2, both are knocked out. But wait, if G2 is a TF for G1 and G3, then in g2, G1 isn't expressed either. So in g1g2, both G1 and G2 are knocked out. But since G2 is upstream of G1, in g2, G1 is not expressed. So the phenotype of g1g2 would be same as g2.

Similarly, g3g2 would be same as g2.

Now looking at g1g3: their resistance is 10%. If G2 is a TF for both, then in g1g3, G2 is active. So both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is active. Wait, but G2 is a TF for G1 and G3. So in the absence of G1 and G3, but G2 is present. But if G2 doesn't have any function beyond regulating G1 and G3, then the resistance would depend on other factors. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both g1 and g3. So perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, and their combined absence leads to more severe resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so each contributes to resistance, and knocking both out leads to additive effects. But 75% (g1) + 50% (g3) doesn't add up to 10% directly. Hmm, maybe not.

So, from the single mutants, g2 is the most severe, suggesting G2 is a TF. So looking at the options, the correct answer probably has G2 as the transcription factor.

Looking at the options, options C and D have G2 as the TF.

Option C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 affect other traits besides resistance. I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question is about resistance, so maybe that's not the key point.

Epistatic: if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that the function of G3 is dependent on G1. Or vice versa.

Wait, what's epistasis? It's when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the presence of a certain allele in gene A masks the effect of gene B.

In terms of the mutants, let's think about the double mutants.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the effect of G3 would only be seen when G1 is functional. So in a g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as g1, because G1 is epistatic (so G3's effect is masked). But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic towards G3.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic towards G1, then the effect of G1 would only be seen when G3 is functional. So in g1g3, the phenotype would be the same as g3, which is 50%. But the data shows 10%, which is worse than either. So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, but in the case where G2 is a TF for both G1 and G3, then in the g1g3 double mutant, both are knocked out, so G2 is active, but the downstream genes are gone? No, because if G2 is a TF for G1 and G3, then in the g1g3 mutant (without G1 and G3), G2 is still present. Hmm, but G2's product is a TF, so it's the presence of G2 that allows G1 and G3 to be expressed. So if G1 and G3 are knocked out, their expression is zero regardless of G2.

Wait no, in the mutants, the genes are knocked out, so G1 and G3 are not expressed, regardless of G2. So in the g1g3 double mutant, G2 is present, but G1 and G3 are knocked out. So G2 can't regulate them. So the resistance would depend on other factors. But since G2 is a TF for G1 and G3, which are part of the resistance pathway, their absence leads to lower resistance.

So in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So maybe G1 and G3 are part of separate pathways that each contribute to resistance, so knocking both out reduces resistance more.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other. So if one is present, the other can take over. But when both are knocked out, resistance drops more. Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So that could fit.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function, so knocking out both leads to a worse phenotype than either single knockout. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, then each can contribute to resistance on their own, but together, their combined loss leads to a much worse phenotype.

But wait, in our case, when G1 and G3 are both knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So that fits with redundancy. Because each gene contributes to the same function, so losing both leads to a bigger effect.

So putting it together, G2 is the transcription factor regulating G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are redundant, so their combined knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone.

So looking at the options:

Option D) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, but does G1 being epistatic fit here?

Epistatic would mean that the effect of G3 is dependent on G1. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of a mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3. So in a g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as g1. But in reality, the double mutant is worse, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps the epistatic relationship isn't accurate here.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic to G1. Then the effect of G1 would be masked when G3 is mutated. So in the g1g3 double mutant, the phenotype would resemble g3. But the data shows it's 10%, which is worse than both. So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the epistatic part isn't directly about the double mutant, but about their regulation. If G2 is a transcription factor for both, then G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, because G2's function is upstream. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 are pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. → No, because G2's single mutant is worse than G1.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. → Same promoter suggests they're regulated together. But G1 and G3 have different single mutant resistances, so perhaps they're co-regulated but contribute differently.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3. → Perhaps G1's function affects G3's pathway.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3. → Redundancy seems to fit, but the epistatic part may not.

Wait, another approach: looking at the double mutants.

In the double mutants, any mutant that includes g2 has 0% resistance. So the presence of g2 is masking the effect of the other gene. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the effect of G1 or G3 doesn't matter—the resistance is already 0%.

But none of the options directly say that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. So in g2 mutants, G1's effect is masked. Which fits, because in any double mutant involving g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, G1's presence doesn't matter.

Similarly, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well. So in the g2g3 mutant, the resistance is 0% same as g2.

So in this scenario, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. That is, G2 is upstream. Because if G2 is knocked out, regardless of the state of G1 and G3, the resistance is 0%.

So in the options, which one correctly describes G2 as a TF and that G2 is epistatic to the others.

Looking again at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF → No, because G2 is the TF (since g2 is the most severe).

Option B: G2 is TF → Yes. G3 is epistatic to G1 → Hmm, but in the data, without G2, G3's effect is masked. So G2 is epistatic to both.

Option C: G2 TF → Yes. G1 and G3 pleiotropic → Maybe. G1 epistatic to G3 → Not sure.

Option D: G2 TF → Yes. G1 and G3 redundant → Fits with g1g3 being worse than either. G1 epistatic → Not sure.

So if G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, that would explain why any double mutant including G2 has 0% resistance. So the correct option should have G2 as a TF and G2 being epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, which one mentions G2 as a TF and that G2 is epistatic to G1 and/or G3.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1 → So only G2 is epistatic to G1, but what about G3? It's not clear.

Option B: G2 is TF, G3 is epistatic to G1. So G3's effect masks G1. But in the data, when both are knocked out (g1g3), their resistance is worse than either, so that seems opposite.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3. → I'm not sure about the pleiotropy. Also, G1 being epistatic would mean in g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1, but data is worse.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 redundant. G1 is epistatic to G3. → So in g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, which matches redundancy. But the epistasis part doesn't fit since the double is worse than either.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of epistatic relationships. If G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, then the presence of G2's mutation masks the effect of G1 and G3. So in any double mutant involving G2, the phenotype is same as G2, which is what the data shows.

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and it's epistatic to G1 and G3. So which option states that?

Looking at the options, option A says G2 is epistatic to G1. But what about G3? There's no option that directly states G2 is epistatic to both.

Option D says G1 is epistatic to G3. Not directly related to G2's epistasis.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not directly about G2 being epistatic, but more about the hierarchy. G2 being a TF suggests that it's upstream, so any downstream effects are dependent on G2.

So, in terms of the hierarchy, G2 is upstream, so G2's mutation would mask the effects of G1 and G3. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

In the options, which one reflects that?

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. So only G1 is downstream of G2.

Option B: G2 is TF; G3 is epistatic to G1. So G3 is upstream of G1.

Option C: G1 is epistatic to G3.

Option D: G1 is epistatic to G3.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is A (G2 epistatic to G1) and since G2 is also epistatic to G3 (as the g2g3 and g1g2 have same as g2), but none of the options state that.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and that the effects of G1 and G3 are only seen when G2 is functional. So G2 is epistatic to both.

In the options, which one has G2 as TF and G2 epistatic.

Option A: G1 is TF → No.

Option B: G2 is TF; G3 epistatic to G1 → Doesn't directly address G2's epistasis.

Option C: G2 is TF; G1 epistatic → Not about G2.

Option D: G2 is TF; G1 and G3 redundant; G1 epistatic → Not about G2’s epistasis.

Wait, perhaps none of the options directly say that G2 is epistatic to both. But I have to choose from the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the data suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning that G2 is upstream.

In that case, the correct option would be the one where G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So looking again:

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1 → Only.

Option B: G3 is epistatic to G1 → No.

Option C: G1 is epistatic → No.

Option D: G1 is epistatic → No.

So the only option where G2 is stated as epistatic is option A. But option A says G1 is a TF, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that G2 is the TF.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's reevaluate. The question says at least one of the genes is a TF. So perhaps G2 is that TF.

In the data, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is the most severe. So that suggests G2 is a TF regulating other genes that are necessary for resistance.

So, the correct option must have G2 as the TF.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF → No.

Option B: G2 is TF → Yes.

Option C: G2 is TF → Yes.

Option D: G2 is TF → Yes.

So options B, C, D are possible.

Option B's description: G1 and G3 have the same promoter. So they're co-regulated. But in the data, g1 has 75%, g3 has 50%. If they have same promoter, knocking out G2 (the TF) would knock out both. But in the data, the single mutants (g1 and g3) have partial resistance. So perhaps G1 and G3 are not solely regulated by G2's TF.

Alternatively, perhaps the promoters are the same, but they have other regulators as well. So in g1, G2 is present but G1 is knocked out. So G3 is expressed via other TFs, leading to 75% resistance. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Maybe, but not directly relevant. G1 is epistatic to G3.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. That fits with the g1g3 double mutant being worse than either.

So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then their combined loss leads to worse resistance. That supports option D.

So, putting it together: G2 is a transcription factor (so it's upstream), G1 and G3 are redundant (so they contribute to the same pathway, and losing both makes it worse), and G1 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but what does G1 being epistatic to G3 mean in this context? If G1 is epistatic to G3, the presence of a mutation in G1 would mask the effect of G3.

But in the data, the g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, the phenotype would be same as g1 (75%), but it's worse. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the epistatic part is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the epistatic relationship is that G3 is epistatic to G1. So the effect of G1 would only be seen when G3 is functional. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the epistatic part in the options isn't directly related to the double mutant data. Maybe it's about their regulation. Like, G1's expression is regulated by G3 or vice versa.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm getting confused. Let's try to think again.

The correct conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor. The other conclusion is that the double mutants involving G2 are as bad as G2 alone, which suggests that G2 is epistatic to the others. So in any situation where G2 is knocked out, the others don't matter.

So, any mutant that has g2 has 0% resistance. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

In the options, which one states that G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But since we concluded G2 is the TF, option A is out.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter suggests G1 and G3 are co-regulated, but their single mutants have different resistance levels. So perhaps G1 and G3 are both targets of G2's regulation, but each contributes differently. So maybe the 'same promoter' isn't accurate.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Again, pleiotropy may not fit. But gene redundancy seems more plausible for the g1g3 data.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy fits the g1g3 data. But the epistasis part is unclear.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think about what each option says.

Option D says G1 and G3 are redundant and G1 is epistatic. So in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. That fits redundancy. But what about the epistasis? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in a g1g3 mutant, the effect would be like g1. But the data is worse than both, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps the epistasis statement in option D is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the epistasis part isn't necessary, but the redundancy is the main point.

Wait, but the options must be correct as a whole. So which option correctly combines the data?

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach it from another angle.

The key points:

1. G2's single mutant (g2) is 0% resistant. So G2 is important for resistance.

2. Double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3) are 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

3. Single mutants g1 and g3: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So each contributes but when G2 is active.

4. Double mutant g1g3 is 10% → worse than either. So their contributions are additive or in parallel pathways.

So, the correct conclusion is that:

- G2 is a transcription factor (since it's the most severe, and in its absence, all resistance is lost).

- G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 (since any mutation in G2 masks the effect of the others).

- G1 and G3 are either in parallel pathways or are redundant.

Looking at the options, which one has G2 as TF and G2 epistatic.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. So yes, but what about G3? No, it doesn't cover both.

Option B: G2 is TF. G3 is epistatic to G1. So in the g1g3 double, the resistance would be same as g3 (50%), but data shows 10%. So no.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy not directly relevant. But the g1g3 data would fit if they are in the same pathway but their loss makes it worse, but epistasis would predict the opposite.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 are redundant. G1 is epistatic.

Redundancy fits the g1g3 data. But the epistasis part may not.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is not present. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I need to think about which is the best fit.

Option D says G1 and G3 are redundant. So their combined knockout is worse than either. That fits the g1g3 data.

But why does the option mention G1 is epistatic to G3? Maybe because G1 is epistatic in the sense that G3's function is redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A, but I think I'm making a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But we have G2 as the TF, not G1. So option A is wrong.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 share promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

If G1 and G3 have same promoter, then knocking out G2 would knock out both, but in the data, their single mutants are partially resistant. So perhaps they have other promoters as well. But I'm not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 is epistatic to G3.

If G1 is epistatic, then in g1g3, the phenotype should resemble g1. But data is worse, so it's not.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy fits, but the epistasis doesn't.

Alternatively, maybe the epistasis part in option D refers to the hierarchy of their redundancy. So G1 is epistatic in that when both are knocked out, the effect is additive beyond just redundancy.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should go with the option that best fits the data.

- G2 is a TF.

- Any mutation in G2 makes the resistance 0%, so G2 is epistatic to both.

- G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps redundant, leading to a worse phenotype when both are knocked out.

So option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But I'm not sure about the epistasis part.

Wait, perhaps redundancy isn't the case. Maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, so their combined knockout leads to an additive effect, which is worse than either.

So perhaps they are in separate pathways. So G2 is a TF for both, each gene contributes to a separate pathway. So knocking out both leads to additive loss of resistance.

In that case, the double mutant's phenotype would be worse than either single mutant, which matches the data.

So, which option reflects that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (non-redundant) and G2 is upstream.

Looking at the options, option B says G1 and G3 have same promoter (so same regulation), but their single mutants have different resistance, so that may not fit.

Wait, if G1 and G3 are co-regulated but have different functions, then knocking out either leads to partial loss, and knocking both leads to worse.

So, perhaps option B is correct.

Wait, option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

If they have same promoter, then both are regulated by G2. So in the g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed. In g3 mutant, G2 is active, so G1 is expressed.

In the double mutant, g1g3, both are knocked out. So G2 is active, but no G1 or G3. So resistance is even lower, matching the data.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then the effect of G1 is only seen when G3 is present. But in g1g3, both are absent, so the effect is lower than either, which fits.

So, for option B:

- G2 is a TF → correct.

- G1 and G3 have same promoter → correct, as they're co-regulated by G2.

- G3 is epistatic to G1 → So the effect of G1 is only seen when G3 is present.

Hmm, but in the data, g1 mutant has 75% resistance, which is worse than wild type (100%), but better than the g1g3 double at 10%. So perhaps G3 is epistatic in that G3's presence is required for G1's function.

Wait, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the absence of G3, the effect of G1 doesn't matter. So in a g1g3 mutant, the effect is same as g3, which is 50%. But the data shows 10%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit.

So perhaps option B is incorrect.

At this point, I think the best fit is option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. But since G2's single mutant already causes 0% resistance, perhaps G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. But none of the options directly state that.

But looking at the options again, option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. So if G2 is epistatic to G1, then in the g1g2 mutant, the resistance is same as g2, which is 0%. Similarly for g2g3 and g1g2, which is true in the data.

But what about the g1g3 mutant? Since G2 is present, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and each contributes.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the order of effects.

In a genetic pathway, if gene A is upstream of gene B, then a mutation in A (epistatic) masks the effect of B. So if a mutation in G2 (the TF) is epistatic, then any mutation in G1 or G3 won't change the phenotype when G2 is already mutated.

The data supports this: any double mutant with G2 is 0% (same as G2 single). So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Now, looking at the single mutants' resistances: G1 (75%) and G3 (50%). So both contribute to resistance but are downstream of G2.

The g1g3 double mutant is 10%, which is worse than either. So this might suggest that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways. If they were in the same pathway, their combined knockout might not lead to such a severe phenotype beyond what either single mutant shows. But since they are additive, it's possible they are in separate pathways.

So the conclusion is that:

- G2 is a TF, upstream of both G1 and G3.

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (or redundant) contributing to resistance.

So looking at the options, the only one that correctly states G2 is a TF and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3 is not present, but the closest is option A, which says G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, but the correct option must be among the four. Let's think again.

Another way to look at epistasis: which comes first in the pathway.

If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then A is downstream of B. So the product of A is necessary for B's function.

Wait, no, actually, if A is epistatic to B, then the pathway is B → A. So the mutation in A masks the effect of B.

Wait, correction: If A is epistatic to B, the pathway is B → A. So a mutation in A would prevent the pathway from working, regardless of B's state.

In our case, in the g2 mutants, the resistance is 0%, and any double mutant with g2 has 0%. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream of G1 and G3? No, wait, that doesn't make sense.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then G2 is upstream, so G1 and G3 are downstream. So mutations in G1 or G3 would not affect G2's function.

So G2 being a TF and upstream, when mutated, is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So the correct option must have G2 as TF, and that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: G1 is TF → No.

Option B: G2 is TF, G3 is epistatic → So G3 is epistatic to G1. But G2 is upstream of both.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 is epistatic to G3 → But G2 is upstream.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, G1 is epistatic.

Well, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me read option A again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But this contradicts our finding that G2 is the TF. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

If G1 and G3 have same promoter, then they're co-regulated. So in g1, G3 is expressed, leading to 75% resistance. In g3, G1 is expressed, leading to 50% resistance. So G3's contribution is higher than G1's.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3 (50%), but data shows 10%, so this doesn't fit.

So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

Redundancy fits the g1g3 data, but the epistasis doesn't. So perhaps the epistasis part is irrelevant, but the option includes it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think again.

G2's single mutant is 0%, which is worse than G1 and G3. So G2 is a TF upstream of both. So the correct option must have G2 as TF and G2 epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking back, the only option that says G2 is a TF is options B, C, D.

Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. If G3 is epistatic, then in g1g3, resistance would resemble g3, which is 50%. But the data is 10%, so not matching.

Option C: G1 is epistatic → In g1g3, resistance would resemble g1 (75%), but data is 10%. Not matching.

Option D: G1 and G3 redundant → g1g3 is worse, which fits. But G1 is epistatic → doesn't fit the data.

So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the closest is option A, despite it incorrectly stating G1 as TF.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. The question says at least one gene is a TF. It's possible that more than one is a TF, but our conclusion is that G2 is the TF.

So the correct option should have G2 as TF.

Now, looking at the options:

Only options B, C, D have G2 as TF.

Now, which of these options correctly describes the gene interactions.

Option B: G1 and G3 have same promoter → same regulation.

But their single mutants have different resistances, so maybe they're co-regulated by G2 but have different functions.

In the g1g3 double, their resistance is 10%, which is worse than either, indicating additive effects. So perhaps they are in parallel pathways.

So, if they're co-regulated by G2, but act in separate pathways, their double knockout leads to additive loss.

So, in that case, G1 and G3 are not redundant but in parallel pathways.

So, which option matches this?

Option B says G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

If they have same promoter, their expression is co-regulated. So in g1, G3 is expressed, and vice versa.

But their single mutants have 75% and 50%, which suggests they contribute differently.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3 (50%), but the data is 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Not sure.

Option D: G1 and G3 show redundancy. So their combined loss is worse.

But the epistasis part in option D doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: which option correctly captures the hierarchy.

G2 is a TF.

g2 has 0% → G2 is essential for any resistance.

g1g2 and g3g2 are 0% → G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

g1 has 75% → So G1 contributes to resistance, but not as much as G2.

g3 has 50% → G3 also contributes, but less.

g1g3 has 10% → Both contribute, but their combined absence leads to additive loss.

So, the pathways involving G1 and G3 are separate, and each contributes to resistance.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways.

So, the correct conclusion is:

G2 is a transcription factor acting upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, so their combined knockout leads to additive loss of resistance. G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, which option captures this.

Option B: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 same promoter. G3 is epistatic to G1.

But same promoter suggests same regulation, but their resistances suggest different functions. Also, the epistasis part doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 redundant. G1 epistatic to G3.

Redundancy fits the additive effect, but epistasis doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G2 is epistatic to G1. But then what about G3?

Alternatively, perhaps option A is incorrect because it says G1 is a TF.

So, returning to the options, the only one that states G2 is a TF and that G2 is epistatic to G1 is option A, despite it being incorrect about G1 as TF. But that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming G2 is a TF. Let me think again.

The question says at least one gene is a TF. So it's possible that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are target genes.

In that case, the correct option must have G2 as a TF.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic.

But redundancy plus G1 epistatic doesn't fit the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the order of analysis.

The double mutants involving G2 are 0%, same as G2. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF and epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking for an option that says G2 is a TF and epistatic to G1 and G3.

Option A: G2 is epistatic to G1 → Only.

Option B: G3 is epistatic to G1 → No.

Options C and D: G1 is epistatic → No.

So, among the options, only option A has G2 as epistatic, but option A says G1 is a TF, which contradicts. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The question states that at least one gene is a TF. So we don't know for sure which one, but our data suggests G2 is the TF.

Now, considering the data, the double mutants without G2 are worse than either single, but those with G2 are as bad as G2.

So, the correct option must have G2 as a TF, and G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, none directly say that.

But perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G2 is epistatic to G1.

But I have to choose from the given options.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option A. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another way: the correct answer is option A: G1 is a TF. But no, because G2's data suggests it's the TF.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another approach: the double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). This suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and their combined loss leads to more severe resistance.

Wait, no, if they are in the same pathway, knocking out both wouldn't make it worse than either. Unless they are in parallel pathways.

Alternatively, if they are redundant, then their combined loss leads to worse.

Option D suggests redundancy, which fits.

So, the correct answer is option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Even though the epistasis part doesn't fit, perhaps the redundancy is the key point.

So, I'll go with option D.


The question involves determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, and G3) contributing to resistance against anthracnose in white lupine. The data provided includes resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to draw conclusions about the roles of these genes, particularly regarding transcription factors (TFs) and epistasis.

### Key Observations:
1. **G2's Single Mutant (g2):** Resistance is 0%, indicating G2 is critical for resistance and likely acts upstream of other genes.
2. **Double Mutants Involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3):** Both show 0% resistance, the same as g2. This suggests G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3, meaning G2's function masks the effects of G1 and G3 when it is knocked out.
3. **Single Mutants (g1, g3):** Resistance levels are 75% and 50%, respectively. This indicates that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2.
4. **Double Mutant (g1g3):** Resistance is 10%, worse than either single mutant. This suggests that G1 and G3 are either in parallel pathways or are redundant, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** States that G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. However, the data strongly supports G2 as the TF, not G1, making this option incorrect.
- **Option B:** States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1. While G2 is correctly identified as the TF, the data does not support the idea that G1 and G3 have the same promoter or that G3 is epistatic to G1. The resistance levels of g1 and g3 (75% and 50%) suggest they contribute differently, and the double mutant g1g3 (10%) does not align with G3 being epistatic to G1.
- **Option C:** States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy is not directly supported by the data, and the resistance level of g1g3 (10%) does not fit with G1 being epistatic to G3.
- **Option D:** States that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. The data supports G2 as the TF, and the resistance level of g1g3 (10%) aligns with G1 and G3 being redundant, as their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 does not fit the data, as the resistance level of g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports G2 as the TF and indicates that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The double mutant g1g3 (10%) suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant, as their combined loss leads to additive effects. While the epistasis claim in Option D does not fully align with the data, it is the closest fit among the given options.

**Answer: D**
