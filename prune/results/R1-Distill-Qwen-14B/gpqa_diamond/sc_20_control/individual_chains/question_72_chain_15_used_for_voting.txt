Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it goes through several steps: reaction with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form 2. Next, 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form 3. Finally, heating product 3 at 150°C gives the final product 4, and we need to find how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize each step.

First, the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, the bicyclo structure is a norbornene system, right? Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. I think that's the bridgehead position.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, especially in an SN2 reaction. The dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, so I think this is a Diels-Alder type reaction? Wait, or maybe it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a diene—bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a conjugated diene. The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a cyclohexene ring with two dibromomethyl groups attached at positions 5 and 6. So, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is another conjugated diene.

Wait, but with two dibromomethyl groups. So when they react, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction between the norbornene and the cyclohexene? But norbornene is a bicyclic structure, so maybe it's acting as a diene or a dienophile.

Wait, in Diels-Alder, the diene is the conjugated diene (four pi electrons) and the dienophile is something with two pi electrons, like a ketone or another diene. But here, both reagents are dienes. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a [4+4] cycloaddition? No, that's less common. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross Diels-Alder where one acts as diene and the other as dienophile.

Wait, but the molecule with two dibromomethyl groups—those could be leaving groups. So perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition or some kind of coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of the norbornene diene. Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic compound, and the diene is strained, so maybe it can undergo some kind of addition.

Alternatively, sodium iodide could be a nucleophile. The dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups (like Br), so perhaps each bromide is replaced by something.

Wait, but in the presence of a diene, perhaps it's a 1,4-addition. Alternatively, considering that the norbornene is a bicyclic diene, and the other molecule is a cyclohexene with two substituents.

Wait, maybe it's a coupling reaction, like a Heck reaction, but that usually involves palladium and aryl halides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder where the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexa-diene is the dienophile. But in Diels-Alder, the dienophile is usually something like a carbonyl, not another diene. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the norbornene has a diene and a substituent (tert-butoxy). The other reagent is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups. So perhaps the reaction is a [4+4] cycloaddition, but I'm not too familiar with that. Or maybe it's a coupling where the norbornene's double bonds attack those dibromomethyl groups.

Wait, the first step uses two equivalents of the cyclohexa-diene. So perhaps each molecule of the starting norbornene reacts with two equivalents of the cyclohexa-diene. Alternatively, maybe each cyclohexa-diene molecule contributes two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is acting as a dienophile. So, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would be the diene, and the bicyclo structure would attack as a dienophile. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a [2+4] cycloaddition, which is the Diels-Alder. So, if the starting norbornene is the dienophile, then the cyclohexa-diene would act as the diene. So the dienophile is something like a dienophile, perhaps an electron-deficient dienophile. But the norbornene's diene is probably electron-rich.

Wait, Diels-Alder typically requires a diene (electron-rich) and a dienophile (electron-deficient, like a ketone or an ester). So perhaps the norbornene is the dienophile. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder between norbornene and the cyclohexa-diene, but I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the starting diene is reacting with itself, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the transfer of the substituents via some coupling. Let me think about the substituents. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups. So, perhaps each of those bromides is replaced by a group from the starting molecule.

Wait, but the starting molecule has a tert-butoxy group. So perhaps the bromides are being substituted by the norbornene's substituent? Hmm, but sodium iodide is present, which is a source of iodide ions. So perhaps it's an SN2 reaction where the iodide replaces the bromide.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that would connect the two molecules. Maybe the norbornene is acting as a base, abstracting a proton, leading to some cycloaddition. Or perhaps it's a Diels-Alder-like reaction, where two new sigma bonds form between the diene and dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. For example, the norbornene's double bond could undergo ring-opening via addition of the cyclohexa-diene. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the products. After the reaction, product 1 is formed. Then, treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid leads to product 2. Then, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO gives product 3. Then, heating product 3 gives product 4.

Alternatively, perhaps each step is a functional group transformation. Let me think about each reaction.

First, product 1: combining the starting material with the cyclohexa-diene and sodium iodide. So, perhaps this is a coupling reaction. Wait, when dienes react with dienophiles, they form six-membered rings. So, maybe the starting norbornene's diene part is reacting with the cyclohexene's dienophile part.

Wait, but the cyclohexa-diene has two substituents (dibromomethyl groups). So, perhaps the Diels-Alder reaction would form a bridge structure, incorporating the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is the dienophile, and the cyclohexa-diene is the diene. So, the Diels-Alder would form a bicyclic structure, connecting the two rings.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexa-diene is the diene, and the norbornene's ring is the dienophile. Then, the Diels-Alder adduct would form a new ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's double bonds are undergoing some kind of addition.

Wait, maybe the starting material's diene is reacting with the cyclohexa-diene in a [4+4] cycloaddition, but I don't remember the details. That's probably less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling via the dibromomethyl groups. The sodium iodide would deprotonate something, maybe. Or, the bromides could leave, and the iodide comes in via an SN2.

Wait, but the cyclohexa-diene has two dibromomethyl groups. So perhaps each cyclohexa-diene molecule is connecting two molecules of the starting material. Since two equivalents are used, perhaps each starting molecule reacts with one cyclohexa-diene.

Wait, but the starting molecule has a tert-butoxy group, which is a good leaving group? Wait no, tert-butoxy is a poor leaving group. But in the presence of acid, it can leave, but here the first step is with NaI, which is a polar aprotic solvent perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups in the cyclohexa-diene are undergoing elimination, forming a diene, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening metathesis, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product after the first step.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4, which is a strong acid. That might protonate something, or cause a ring-opening or a rearrangement.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. SO3 is a strong acid, but in DMSO and with pyridine, it's probably used for sulfonation or some kind of acetylation. Wait, no, DMSO and SO3 with pyridine is similar to the conditions for the Swern oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones. But in this case, maybe it's a sulfonation.

Wait, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO: that sounds like it's introducing a sulfate group, perhaps sulfonating something. For example, if there's a phenolic -OH group, it would get sulfonated to a good leaving group.

Then, product 3 is heated at 150°C to give product 4. Heating often leads to elimination reactions, like E2, or ring-closing via elimination. Or maybe it's a rearrangement.

Wait, let's try to approach this backwards. The final step is heating product 3 to give product 4. Suppose product 3 is a sulfonated compound. Heating it might cause it to lose the sulfate group, perhaps via elimination, leading to a double bond or ring formation.

But wait, let me think about the overall process. The starting material is a bicyclo structure with a tert-butoxy group. Then, it reacts with something to form product 1, which after acid treatment becomes product 2. Then, product 2 is sulfonated to form product 3, which upon heating gives product 4.

Putting it all together: perhaps the first reaction is a Diels-Alder, adding the cyclohexene to the norbornene, creating a larger ring. Then, treating with acid (H2SO4) might protonate something, leading to ring opening or rearrangement. Then, sulfonating would introduce a good leaving group, which upon heating would eliminate, forming a double bond or a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a substitution reaction, where the dibromomethyl groups are replaced by something from the starting material.

Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, the substituent is at position 7, which is a bridgehead in the norbornene structure. So, when it reacts with the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups, perhaps it's a coupling reaction where the bicyclo structure is adding across the cyclohexene's substituents.

Hmm, maybe each dibromomethyl group is replaced by the norbornene's substituent. But wait, there are two equivalents of cyclohexa-diene, so maybe each cyclohexa-diene connects to the starting material once.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the tert-butoxy group acts as a leaving group. But tert-butoxy is not a good leaving group. However, in the presence of acid, the tert-butyl group can become a better leaving group. But the first step is with NaI, which is a base, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, and the iodide from NaI substitutes them. So, the cyclohexa-diene would have two iodides after substitution.

Wait, but how does that connect to the starting material? Maybe the starting material's oxygen acts as a nucleophile, attacking the cyclohexa-diene? Hmm, but the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)... So, the tert-butoxy group is O-t-Bu. That's a bulky group, maybe not a great nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexa-diene is adding across the double bonds of the starting material, leading to a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what SO3 and pyridine in DMSO do. That's a classic Swern oxidation condition, which oxidizes an alcohol to a ketone. But in another context, if the molecule has a phenol group, SO3 could sulfonate it, turning it into a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group.

So, if product 2 has a phenolic -OH group, then treating with SO3 and pyridine would convert it to a sulfonate ester, which is a good leaving group. Then, heating product 3 (the sulfonate) would cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

Wait, but how does product 2 have a phenolic group? Let's track back.

Product 1 is formed from the initial reaction. Then, treating product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid forms product 2. So perhaps product 1 has an epoxide, which upon acid treatment becomes a diol. Or maybe it's a ring-opening.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, which upon acid treatment might undergo some rearrangement, like a hemiacetal formation or something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a Diels-Alder forming a bridged structure. Then, treating with H2SO4 could protonate and cause ring-opening, perhaps forming a diol or another structure.

Alternatively, product 1 is a bicyclic ether, and upon acid treatment, it rearranges.

Alternatively, let's think about the first reaction differently. The starting material, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, when heated with a dienophile (cyclohexa-diene with dibromomethyl groups and NaI), perhaps the norbornene's double bonds undergo [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder) with the cyclohexene's double bonds.

Wait, but the cyclohexene has two substituents, each with Br. So, perhaps the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring, incorporating the substituents.

But wait, the starting material's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1], which is a norbornene. Its structure has a bridge, so perhaps the Diels-Alder adds across one of the rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is the diene, and the norbornene is the dienophile, but that would require the norbornene to be electron-deficient, which it isn't. So that's perhaps unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexene is the dienophile. So the dienophile (cyclohexene) would have two substituents (dibromomethyl).

Wait, Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene (dienophile) and a dienophile (electron-deficient). So if the cyclohexene is the dienophile, it would have to have an electron-withdrawing group, but the substituents are Br, which are EWG. So perhaps the cyclohexene with two dibromomethyl groups is the dienophile.

So, the norbornene's conjugated diene would be the diene, and the cyclohexene with Br substituents would be the dienophile. So the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring, incorporating the two substituents.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to imagine the structure. The starting material is norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene), which has two double bonds, but in the bicyclo structure, perhaps only one is reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is acting as a dienophile. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the product after Diels-Alder. The Diels-Alder would add four atoms from the diene and two from the dienophile, forming a six-membered ring with substituents.

If the norbornene's double bond is the dienophile, and the cyclohexene is the diene, then the product would be a bicyclic structure with a new ring added.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the overall process.

The first reaction probably forms a new ring, incorporating two substituents from the cyclohexene. Then, acid treatment might protonate and rearrange, perhaps opening a ring or forming a diol. Then, sulfonation adds a good leaving group, which upon heating eliminates, perhaps forming a double bond or a ring.

Wait, the final product after heating would likely have some elimination, leading to a more conjugated structure.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about the number of hydrogen atoms.

Wait, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So, perhaps the final structure is a highly symmetric molecule with multiple equivalent H's, but some unique ones.

The options are 8,4,10,7. So, I need to find which is correct.

Let me consider the final step: heating product 3 at 150°C. Product 3 is from treating product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. So, product 3 likely has a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group. Heating would cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

So, if product 3 has a -SO3H group attached to an alcohol, upon heating, it might lose H2O and form a double bond, creating a ring or extending conjugation.

Alternatively, product 3 could have a leaving group that, upon elimination, forms a new ring structure.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to say, but perhaps I can think about symmetry.

If the final structure is something like a tricyclic compound with multiple equivalent hydrogens, the number could be a small number.

For example, if product 4 is a completely symmetric molecule with multiple identical environments, maybe it has 4 distinct H's. Or perhaps 7.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cubane-like structure, but that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a highly symmetrical molecule, like adamantane, which has several equivalent H's, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the initial structure. The starting material is a norbornene with a tert-butoxy group. After the first reaction, perhaps it's undergoing a Diels-Alder with the cyclohexene, adding two substituents.

Then, the acid treatment could protonate, perhaps leading to ring-opening or formation of a diol. Then, sulfonation adds a leaving group, and elimination upon heating forms a double bond, leading to a more rigid structure.

If the final structure is a bridged bicyclic compound with several methyl groups and double bonds, the number of chemically distinct hydrogens could be 7.

Alternatively, think about the number of substituents and symmetry. For example, norbornene derivatives often have multiple equivalent H's.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cubane. Cubane has eight equivalent H's, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the final molecule has a structure that leads to 7 distinct H's. For example, in adamantane, each H is in a different environment, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a polycyclic structure with several bridges, each contributing unique H's.

Another approach: the number of H's can be determined by considering symmetry. If the molecule has several planes or centers of symmetry, some H's will be equivalent.

For instance, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, the molecule is symmetric, leading to fewer distinct H's.

Wait, if the final product is a norbornene derivative with several substituents, maybe the number of H's would be 7.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a fully symmetric molecule, leading to a low number of H's. For example, in cubane, all H's are equivalent, but that's only one H environment. But cubane has eight H's, all equivalent. So if that's the case, the number of chemically distinct H's would be one. But that's not among the options.

Wait, the options don't have one, so cubane isn't the product here.

Another thought: the starting material's substitution pattern might influence the symmetry of the final product. If after all reactions, the product has multiple substituents in a symmetric arrangement, the number of H's would be less.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a bridge structure, leading to several equivalent H's. For example, in norbornane, there are two types of H's: the bridge H's and the others. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has multiple rings, each with equivalent H's.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should look for the answer through another approach.

Wait, the first reaction uses two equivalents of the cyclohexene. So perhaps the starting material (norbornene) is adding two cyclohexene units, each bringing two substituents. So, after the first step, product 1 would have four substituents added.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution, replacing the dibromomethyl groups with the starting material's substituent, but that seems unlikely.

Another angle: The second step is treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid. Acid typically protonates something, perhaps leading to ring-opening or diol formation.

If product 1 is an epoxide, then acid would open it to a diol. But I don't know if product 1 is an epoxide.

The third step is treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. As I thought earlier, this could be a sulfonation. So, product 2, after acid treatment, has a hydroxyl group, which is then sulfonated in product 3.

Then, heating product 3 would eliminate the sulfonic acid group, forming a double bond.

If product 3 is a sulfonated diol, then upon heating, it could lose H2SO4 (sulfonic acid leaving as HSO3−, but more likely it would eliminate to form a double bond.

For example, if product 3 is a sulfonate ester, heating might cause it to eliminate, forming a new double bond.

So the final product 4 would have a new double bond, possibly in a ring system.

But how does that affect the number of distinct H's? It would depend on the structure.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with several substituents, leading to 7 distinct H's. So the answer would be D) 7.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the final structure is symmetric, like a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative, the number of H's could be lower.

Wait, another thought: the starting material's norbornene is a bicyclo[2.2.1], which has specific symmetry. After reactions, perhaps the product becomes a more symmetric structure, leading to fewer H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final structure is a cubane-like structure, but as I thought before, that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a norbornene derivative with some substituents that make several H's equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cage compound like adamantane, which has several equivalent H's. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the number of chemically distinct H's is determined by their environments. Any symmetry in the molecule reduces the number.

If the final molecule has multiple planes of symmetry, the number of chemically distinct H's would be fewer.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 7, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 4, but that seems low.

In the absence of a clear path, I'll have to make an educated guess. Considering the steps, especially the final elimination leading to a conjugated structure, the molecule might have several unique H environments, possibly 7.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which undergoes multiple transformations to yield the final product, 4. The key steps are as follows:

1. **First Reaction**: The starting material reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. This likely involves a substitution or cycloaddition reaction, potentially forming a bridged or fused bicyclic structure. The tert-butoxy group or the cyclohexene's dibromomethyl groups may participate in the reaction, leading to product 1.

2. **Second Step**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. Acidic conditions may protonate or rearrange the structure, potentially opening rings or forming diols or other intermediates, resulting in product 2.

3. **Third Step**: Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. These conditions suggest sulfonation, likely introducing a sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) or a sulfonate ester, forming product 3.

4. **Fourth Step**: Product 3 is heated at 150°C. Heating typically induces elimination or rearrangement, possibly removing the sulfonic acid group or forming a double bond, leading to the final product, 4.

The final product, 4, is likely a bicyclic or polycyclic compound with some degree of symmetry. The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms depends on the symmetry and substitution pattern of the molecule. Given the transformations, the final structure may have several equivalent hydrogen environments due to symmetry, reducing the total number of distinct hydrogens.

After analyzing the possible structures and transformations, the most plausible number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product is **7**.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it goes through several steps: reaction with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form 2. Next, 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form 3. Finally, heating product 3 at 150°C gives the final product 4, and we need to find how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize each step.

First, the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, the bicyclo structure is a norbornene system, right? Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. I think that's the bridgehead position.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, especially in an SN2 reaction. The dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, so I think this is a Diels-Alder type reaction? Wait, or maybe it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a diene—bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a conjugated diene. The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a cyclohexene ring with two dibromomethyl groups attached at positions 5 and 6. So, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is another conjugated diene.

Wait, but with two dibromomethyl groups. So when they react, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction between the norbornene and the cyclohexene? But norbornene is a bicyclic structure, so maybe it's acting as a diene or a dienophile.

Wait, in Diels-Alder, the diene is the conjugated diene (four pi electrons) and the dienophile is something with two pi electrons, like a ketone or another diene. But here, both reagents are dienes. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a [4+4] cycloaddition? No, that's less common. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cross Diels-Alder where one acts as diene and the other as dienophile.

Wait, but the molecule with two dibromomethyl groups—those could be leaving groups. So perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-addition or some kind of coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of the norbornene diene. Wait, norbornene is a bicyclic compound, and the diene is strained, so maybe it can undergo some kind of addition.

Alternatively, sodium iodide could be a nucleophile. The dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups (like Br), so perhaps each bromide is replaced by something.

Wait, but in the presence of a diene, perhaps it's a 1,4-addition. Alternatively, considering that the norbornene is a bicyclic diene, and the other molecule is a cyclohexene with two substituents.

Wait, maybe it's a coupling reaction, like a Heck reaction, but that usually involves palladium and aryl halides. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder where the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexa-diene is the dienophile. But in Diels-Alder, the dienophile is usually something like a carbonyl, not another diene. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the norbornene has a diene and a substituent (tert-butoxy). The other reagent is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups. So perhaps the reaction is a [4+4] cycloaddition, but I'm not too familiar with that. Or maybe it's a coupling where the norbornene's double bonds attack those dibromomethyl groups.

Wait, the first step uses two equivalents of the cyclohexa-diene. So perhaps each molecule of the starting norbornene reacts with two equivalents of the cyclohexa-diene. Alternatively, maybe each cyclohexa-diene molecule contributes two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is acting as a dienophile. So, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would be the diene, and the bicyclo structure would attack as a dienophile. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a [2+4] cycloaddition, which is the Diels-Alder. So, if the starting norbornene is the dienophile, then the cyclohexa-diene would act as the diene. So the dienophile is something like a dienophile, perhaps an electron-deficient dienophile. But the norbornene's diene is probably electron-rich.

Wait, Diels-Alder typically requires a diene (electron-rich) and a dienophile (electron-deficient, like a ketone or an ester). So perhaps the norbornene is the dienophile. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder between norbornene and the cyclohexa-diene, but I'm not sure how that would proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the starting diene is reacting with itself, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the transfer of the substituents via some coupling. Let me think about the substituents. The cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups. So, perhaps each of those bromides is replaced by a group from the starting molecule.

Wait, but the starting molecule has a tert-butoxy group. So perhaps the bromides are being substituted by the norbornene's substituent? Hmm, but sodium iodide is present, which is a source of iodide ions. So perhaps it's an SN2 reaction where the iodide replaces the bromide.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that would connect the two molecules. Maybe the norbornene is acting as a base, abstracting a proton, leading to some cycloaddition. Or perhaps it's a Diels-Alder-like reaction, where two new sigma bonds form between the diene and dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. For example, the norbornene's double bond could undergo ring-opening via addition of the cyclohexa-diene. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the products. After the reaction, product 1 is formed. Then, treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid leads to product 2. Then, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO gives product 3. Then, heating product 3 gives product 4.

First, product 1: combining the starting material with the cyclohexa-diene and sodium iodide. So, perhaps this is a coupling reaction. Wait, when dienes react with dienophiles, they form six-membered rings. So, maybe the starting norbornene's diene part is reacting with the cyclohexene's dienophile part.

Wait, but the cyclohexa-diene has two substituents (dibromomethyl groups). So, perhaps the Diels-Alder reaction would form a bridge structure, incorporating the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is the dienophile, and the cyclohexa-diene is the diene. So, the Diels-Alder would form a bicyclic structure, connecting the two rings.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexa-diene is the diene, and the norbornene's ring is the dienophile. Then, the Diels-Alder adduct would form a new ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's double bonds are undergoing some kind of addition.

Wait, maybe the starting material's diene is reacting with the cyclohexa-diene in a [4+4] cycloaddition, but I don't remember the details. That's probably less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling via the dibromomethyl groups. The sodium iodide would deprotonate something, maybe. Or, the bromides could leave, and the iodide comes in via an SN2.

Wait, but the cyclohexa-diene has two dibromomethyl groups. So perhaps each cyclohexa-diene molecule is connecting two molecules of the starting material. Since two equivalents are used, perhaps each starting molecule reacts with one cyclohexa-diene.

Wait, but the starting molecule has a tert-butoxy group, which is a good leaving group? Wait no, tert-butoxy is a poor leaving group. But in the presence of acid, it can leave, but here the first step is with NaI, which is a polar aprotic solvent perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups in the cyclohexa-diene are undergoing elimination, forming a diene, but I don't know.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening metathesis, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product after the first step.

Product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4, which is a strong acid. That might protonate something, or cause a ring-opening or a rearrangement.

Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. SO3 is a strong acid, but in DMSO and with pyridine, it's probably used for sulfonation or some kind of acetylation. Wait, no, DMSO and SO3 with pyridine is similar to the conditions for the Swern oxidation, which oxidizes alcohols to ketones. But in this case, maybe it's a sulfonation.

Wait, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO: that sounds like it's introducing a sulfate group, perhaps sulfonating something. For example, if there's a phenolic -OH group, it would get sulfonated to a good leaving group.

Then, product 3 is heated at 150°C to give product 4. Heating often leads to elimination reactions, like E2, or ring-closing via elimination. Or maybe it's a rearrangement.

Wait, let's try to approach this backwards. The final step is heating product 3 to give product 4. Suppose product 3 is a sulfonated compound. Heating it might cause it to lose the sulfate group, perhaps via elimination, leading to a double bond or ring formation.

But wait, let me think about the overall process. The starting material is a bicyclo structure with a tert-butoxy group. Then, it reacts with something to form product 1, which after acid treatment becomes product 2. Then, product 2 is sulfonated to form product 3, which upon heating gives product 4.

Putting it all together: perhaps the first reaction is a Diels-Alder, adding the cyclohexene to the norbornene, creating a larger ring. Then, treating with acid (H2SO4) might protonate something, leading to ring opening or rearrangement. Then, sulfonating would introduce a good leaving group, which upon heating would eliminate, forming a double bond or a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a substitution reaction, where the dibromomethyl groups are replaced by something from the starting material.

Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So, the substituent is at position 7, which is a bridgehead in the norbornene structure. So, when it reacts with the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups, perhaps it's a coupling reaction where the bicyclo structure is adding across the cyclohexene's substituents.

Hmm, maybe each dibromomethyl group is replaced by the norbornene's substituent. But wait, there are two equivalents of cyclohexa-diene, so maybe each cyclohexa-diene connects to the starting material once.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the tert-butoxy group acts as a leaving group. But tert-butoxy is not a good leaving group. However, in the presence of acid, the tert-butyl group can become a better leaving group. But the first step is with NaI, which is a base, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, and the iodide from NaI substitutes them. So, the cyclohexa-diene would have two iodides after substitution.

Wait, but how does that connect to the starting material? Maybe the starting material's oxygen acts as a nucleophile, attacking the cyclohexa-diene? Hmm, but the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)... So, the tert-butoxy group is O-t-Bu. That's a bulky group, maybe not a great nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexa-diene is adding across the double bonds of the starting material, leading to a more complex structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what SO3 and pyridine in DMSO do. That's a classic Swern oxidation condition, which oxidizes an alcohol to a ketone. But in another context, if the molecule has a phenol group, SO3 could sulfonate it, turning it into a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group.

So, if product 2 has a phenolic -OH group, then treating with SO3 and pyridine would convert it to a sulfonate ester, which is a good leaving group. Then, heating product 3 (the sulfonate) would cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

Wait, but how does product 2 have a phenolic group? Let's track back.

Product 1 is formed from the initial reaction. Then, treating product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid forms product 2. So perhaps product 1 has an epoxide, which upon acid treatment becomes a diol. Or maybe it's a ring-opening.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol, which upon acid treatment might undergo some rearrangement, like a hemiacetal formation or something else.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a Diels-Alder forming a bridged structure. Then, treating with H2SO4 could protonate and cause ring-opening, perhaps forming a diol or another structure.

Alternatively, product 1 is a bicyclic ether, and upon acid treatment, it rearranges.

Alternatively, let's think about the first reaction differently. The starting material, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, when heated with a dienophile (cyclohexa-diene with dibromomethyl groups and NaI), perhaps the norbornene's double bonds undergo [4+2] cycloaddition (Diels-Alder) with the cyclohexene's double bonds.

Wait, but the cyclohexene has two substituents, each with Br. So, perhaps the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring, incorporating the substituents.

But wait, the starting material's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1], which is a norbornene. Its structure has a bridge, so perhaps the Diels-Alder adds across one of the rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is the diene, and the norbornene is the dienophile, but that would require the norbornene to be electron-deficient, which it isn't. So that's perhaps unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexene is the dienophile. So the dienophile (cyclohexene) would have two substituents (dibromomethyl).

Wait, Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene (dienophile) and a dienophile (electron-deficient). So if the cyclohexene is the dienophile, it would have to have an electron-withdrawing group, but the substituents are Br, which are EWG. So perhaps the cyclohexene with two dibromomethyl groups is the dienophile.

So, the norbornene's conjugated diene would be the diene, and the cyclohexene with Br substituents would be the dienophile. So the Diels-Alder would form a six-membered ring, incorporating the two substituents.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to imagine the structure. The starting material is norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene), which has two double bonds, but in the bicyclo structure, perhaps only one is reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is acting as a dienophile. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the product after Diels-Alder. The Diels-Alder would add four atoms from the diene and two from the dienophile, forming a six-membered ring with substituents.

If the norbornene's double bond is the dienophile, and the cyclohexene is the diene, then the product would be a bicyclic structure with a new ring added.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the overall process.

The first reaction probably forms a new ring, incorporating two substituents from the cyclohexene. Then, acid treatment might protonate and rearrange, perhaps opening a ring or forming a diol. Then, sulfonation adds a good leaving group, which upon heating eliminates, perhaps forming a double bond or a ring.

Wait, the final product after heating would likely have some elimination, leading to a more conjugated structure.

But I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about the number of hydrogen atoms.

Wait, the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So, perhaps the final structure is a highly symmetric molecule with multiple equivalent H's, but some unique ones.

The options are 8,4,10,7. So, I need to find which is correct.

Let me consider the final step: heating product 3 at 150°C. Product 3 is from treating product 2 with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. So, product 3 likely has a sulfonic acid group, which is a good leaving group. Heating would cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

So, if product 3 has a -SO3H group attached to an alcohol, upon heating, it might lose H2O and form a double bond, creating a ring or extending conjugation.

Alternatively, product 3 could have a leaving group that, upon elimination, forms a new ring structure.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's hard to say, but perhaps I can think about symmetry.

If the final structure is something like a tricyclic compound with multiple equivalent hydrogens, the number could be a small number.

For example, if product 4 is a completely symmetric molecule with multiple identical environments, maybe it has 4 distinct H's. Or perhaps 7.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cubane-like structure, but that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a highly symmetrical molecule, like adamantane, which has several equivalent H's, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the initial structure. The starting material is a norbornene with a tert-butoxy group. After the first reaction, perhaps it's undergoing a Diels-Alder with the cyclohexene, adding two substituents.

Then, the acid treatment could protonate, perhaps leading to ring-opening or formation of a diol. Then, sulfonation adds a leaving group, and elimination upon heating forms a double bond, leading to a more rigid structure.

If the final structure is a bridged bicyclic compound with several methyl groups and double bonds, the number of chemically distinct hydrogens could be 7.

Alternatively, think about the number of substituents and symmetry. For example, norbornene derivatives often have multiple equivalent H's.

Wait, perhaps the final product is cubane. Cubane has eight equivalent H's, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the final molecule has a structure that leads to 7 distinct H's. For example, in adamantane, each H is in a different environment, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a polycyclic structure with several bridges, each contributing unique H's.

Another approach: the number of H's can be determined by considering symmetry. If the molecule has several planes or centers of symmetry, some H's will be equivalent.

For instance, in bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, the molecule is symmetric, leading to fewer distinct H's.

Wait, if the final product is a norbornene derivative with several substituents, maybe the number of H's would be 7.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a fully symmetric molecule, leading to a low number of H's. For example, in cubane, all H's are equivalent, but that's only one H environment. But cubane has eight H's, all equivalent. So if that's the case, the number of chemically distinct H's would be one. But that's not among the options.

Wait, the options don't have one, so cubane isn't the product here.

Another thought: the starting material's substitution pattern might influence the symmetry of the final product. If after all reactions, the product has multiple substituents in a symmetric arrangement, the number of H's would be less.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a molecule with a bridge structure, leading to several equivalent H's. For example, in norbornane, there are two types of H's: the bridge H's and the others. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has multiple rings, each with equivalent H's.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should look for the answer through another approach.

Wait, the first reaction uses two equivalents of the cyclohexene. So perhaps the starting material (norbornene) is adding two cyclohexene units, each bringing two substituents. So, after the first step, product 1 would have four substituents added.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction is a substitution, replacing the dibromomethyl groups with the starting material's substituent, but that seems unlikely.

Another angle: The second step is treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid. Acid typically protonates something, perhaps leading to ring-opening or diol formation.

If product 1 is an epoxide, then acid would open it to a diol. But I don't know if product 1 is an epoxide.

The third step is treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. As I thought earlier, this could be a sulfonation. So, product 2, after acid treatment, has a hydroxyl group, which is then sulfonated in product 3.

Then, heating product 3 would eliminate the sulfonic acid group, forming a double bond.

If product 3 is a sulfonated diol, then upon heating, it could lose H2SO4 (sulfonic acid leaving as HSO3−, but more likely it would eliminate to form a double bond.

For example, if product 3 is a sulfonate ester, heating might cause it to eliminate, forming a new double bond.

So the final product 4 would have a new double bond, possibly in a ring system.

But how does that affect the number of distinct H's? It would depend on the structure.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a tricyclic compound with several substituents, leading to 7 distinct H's. So the answer would be D) 7.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the final structure is symmetric, like a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative, the number of H's could be lower.

Wait, another thought: the starting material's norbornene is a bicyclo[2.2.1], which has specific symmetry. After reactions, perhaps the product becomes a more symmetric structure, leading to fewer H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final structure is a cubane-like structure, but as I thought before, that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a norbornene derivative with some substituents that make several H's equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a cage compound like adamantane, which has several equivalent H's. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the number of chemically distinct H's is determined by their environments. Any symmetry in the molecule reduces the number.

If the final molecule has multiple planes of symmetry, the number of chemically distinct H's would be fewer.

So, perhaps the correct answer is 7, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 4, but that seems low.

In the absence of a clear path, I'll have to make an educated guess. Considering the steps, especially the final elimination leading to a conjugated structure, the molecule might have several unique H environments, possibly 7.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which undergoes multiple transformations to yield the final product, 4. The key steps are as follows:

1. **First Reaction**: The starting material reacts with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide. This likely involves a substitution or cycloaddition reaction, potentially forming a bridged or fused bicyclic structure. The tert-butoxy group or the cyclohexene's dibromomethyl groups may participate in the reaction, leading to product 1.

2. **Second Step**: Product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid. Acidic conditions may protonate or rearrange the structure, potentially opening rings or forming diols or other intermediates, resulting in product 2.

3. **Third Step**: Product 2 is treated with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO. These conditions suggest sulfonation, likely introducing a sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) or a sulfonate ester, forming product 3.

4. **Fourth Step**: Product 3 is heated at 150°C. Heating typically induces elimination or rearrangement, possibly removing the sulfonic acid group or forming a double bond, leading to the final product, 4.

The final product, 4, is likely a bicyclic or polycyclic compound with some degree of symmetry. The number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms depends on the symmetry and substitution pattern of the molecule. Given the transformations, the final structure may have several equivalent hydrogen environments due to symmetry, reducing the total number of distinct hydrogens.

After analyzing the possible structures and transformations, the most plausible number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product is **7**.
