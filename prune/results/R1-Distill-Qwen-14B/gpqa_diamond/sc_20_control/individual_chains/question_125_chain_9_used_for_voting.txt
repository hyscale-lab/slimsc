Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which I remember is the form for a harmonic oscillator. The question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy level.

Wait, let's break it down. I think in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers nx, ny, and nz, but no wait, actually in spherical coordinates, it's more about the principal quantum number n and the angular momentum quantum number l. Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Oh right, for the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. I think the energy is given by E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω, where nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, sometimes it's given in terms of the principal quantum number n, where n = nx + ny + nz + 3/2? Wait, no, let me get that right. The energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers plus 3/2? No, I think n is the sum of (nx, ny, nz), but perhaps not. Wait, no, I think each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so the total is (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but the problem refers to the third excited state. Oh, right! The ground state is the lowest energy level, and each excited state is higher. So I need to figure out what the quantum numbers are for the third excited state.

Wait, but first, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the energy levels. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and the degeneracy (number of states with the same energy) depends on the energy level.

The ground state is when all three quantum numbers are zero: nx=0, ny=0, nz=0. So the energy is E = (0+0+0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. Then the first excited state would be when one of the quantum numbers is 1, and the others are zero. So nx=1, ny=0, nz=0. That gives E = (1+0+0 +3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. The second excited state would be when one quantum number is 2, others zero, or perhaps when two are 1. Let me think. Wait, no, the ordering might be based on the sum of the quantum numbers.

Wait, in 3D, the energy depends on the sum n = nx + ny + nz. So each unique value of n gives a distinct energy level. So for each n, the energy is E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω. So the ground state is n=0 (sum of 0+0+0=0), energy 3/2 ħω. Then the first excited state is n=1, energy 5/2 ħω. Next, n=2 gives 7/2 ħω, that's the second excited state. Wait, but wait, how many states are there for each n? Because the degeneracy increases as n increases.

Wait, the question is about the third excited state. Let me clarify:

The ground state is n=0 → energy (3/2) ħω → 0th excited state.

First excited state: n=1 → 5/2 ħω.

Second excited state: n=2 →7/2 ħω.

Third excited state: n=3 →9/2 ħω.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, because when n=3, the energy is (3 + 3/2)ħω = 9/2 ħω. So the third excited state is that. So the energy is (9/2) ħω.

Now, the number of eigenfunctions (linearly independent) for that energy eigenvalue. That's the degeneracy. The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by (n +1)(n +2)/2 for each n, but wait, no, I think the formula is (n + 2 choose 2), which is (n+2)(n+1)/2. Or wait, perhaps it's (n + 2)(n +1)/2?

Wait, let me think about the number of ways to have nx + ny + nz = n'. Wait no, wait, for a given n = nx + ny + nz, the number of states is (n + 2 choose 2) = (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for n=3, that would be (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2=10. So 10 states. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but let me confirm. For n=0, the sum is 0, so the number is 1 (only 0,0,0). For n=1, the sum is 1: possible (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So 3 states. (1+2 choose 2) = 3, which matches.

n=2: possible states are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). That's 6 states. (2+2 choose 2)=4 choose 2=6. Correct.

n=3: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3), (2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (1,0,2), (0,2,1), (0,1,2), (1,1,1). Let's count: 3 for the triple zeros, 6 for the two with 2 and 1, and 1 for triple 1s. Wait wait, wait. Let me list them:

- All permutations where one is 3, others are 0: 3 states.

- All permutations where one is 2 and another is 1, others 0: (3 choose 2) * 1 = 3? No, wait, for each permutation, we have each possible arrangement. The number of states where two are non-zero and sum to 3 would be (2,1,0) in any order. The number of such states is 3!/(1!1!1!) ) but wait no, actually, it's the number of ways to arrange the 2 and 1 in the three dimensions. So for (2,1,0), the number of distinct permutations is 3!/(1!1!1! ) per arrangement? Wait, perhaps it's (3 choose 2) * (1)= 3, because for each pair of axes, you can assign 2 and 1.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the number as (n+2 choose 2) when n is the sum. So for n=3, (3+2 choose 2)=5 choose 2= 10. So 10 states.

So the energy is 9/2 ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10. So that matches.

Option C: same energy, but 3. That's not correct.

Other options have different energies, like 11 pi^2 hbar^2/(2 m r^2), which doesn't make sense dimensionally because the potential is in terms of r^2, but energy should have units of (mass × length^2)/time^2, but that term has 1/(m r^2), which would be inverse mass times inverse length squared. That's probably not correct. So the correct option is A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of such a system are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$, which are non-negative integers. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) for a given energy level is determined by the number of ways to distribute the quantum numbers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ such that their sum equals $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$. The degeneracy is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}.
\]

### Step 1: Determine the energy of the third excited state
- The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$ (all $n_x, n_y, n_z = 0$), with energy $E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega$.
- The first excited state corresponds to $n = 1$, with energy $E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega$.
- The second excited state corresponds to $n = 2$, with energy $E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega$.
- The third excited state corresponds to $n = 3$, with energy $E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$.

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$.

### Step 2: Determine the number of eigenfunctions for the third excited state
For $n = 3$, the degeneracy is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue of the third excited state.

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(9/2) \hbar \omega, 10$ — This matches the calculated energy and degeneracy.
- **Option B**: $11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ — The energy expression is dimensionally incorrect and does not match the harmonic oscillator energy formula.
- **Option C**: $(9/2) \hbar \omega, 3$ — The energy is correct, but the degeneracy is incorrect.
- **Option D**: $11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$ — Both the energy and degeneracy are incorrect.

### Final Answer
The correct option is **A**, as it provides the correct energy and degeneracy for the third excited state.
