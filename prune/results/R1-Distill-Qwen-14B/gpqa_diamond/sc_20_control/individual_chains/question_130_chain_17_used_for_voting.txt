Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options given are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that redshift in astronomy tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The higher the redshift, the farther away the object is. So, if a quasar's light is absorbed by hydrogen clouds, the absorption line we detect would be at a different wavelength than the emitted one.

The Lyman alpha line is emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from the second to the first energy level. Its rest wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But since the universe is expanding, this wavelength gets stretched, or redshifted, depending on how far the cloud is from us.

Now, the problem is about detecting these clouds using optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths in the visible spectrum, which is about 400-700 nm or 4000-7000 Angstroms. So, the redshifted Lyman alpha line must fall into this range for us to detect it with optical telescopes.

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength. So, we can set up the equation to find the minimum z such that the observed wavelength is just above the optical range. Wait, but wait—no, actually, it's the opposite. The observed wavelength should be in the optical, so longer than the rest wavelength. So the observed wavelength must be greater than 400 nm (4000 Angstroms) because anything below that is ultraviolet and not visible to ground-based optical telescopes (which can't see through the atmosphere for UV light).

So the Lyman alpha line at 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm) when redshifted will be observed at (1216)*(1+z) Angstroms. We need this to be >= 4000 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait: 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, and 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So:

(1216) * (1 + z) >= 4000

Let me solve for z.

(1 + z) >= 4000 / 1216

Let me calculate 4000 divided by 1216. Let me see, 1216 times 3 is 3648, which is less than 4000. 1216 * 3.29 would be around 4000. Let's calculate 4000/1216.

Hmm, 1216 * 3 = 3648. 4000 - 3648 = 352. So 352/1216 is approximately 0.289. So 3 + 0.289 is about 3.289. So z has to be at least around 3.289.

Wait, but wait—am I doing this right? Because if the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms, that's the minimum detectable by optical telescopes. So any redshift less than 3.289 would result in an observed wavelength less than 4000 Angstroms, which is in the UV, which can't be detected by ground-based optical telescopes. Therefore, the redshift needs to be at least approximately 3.29 to have the Lyman alpha line in the optical range.

Looking back at the options, the choices are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. Wait, option A is 3, which is just below our calculated 3.29. Hmm, but wait—could I have messed up the calculation? Let me double-check.

4000 divided by 1216.

Let me compute 1216 * 3 = 3648. 4000 - 3648 = 352. So 352/1216 = 0.289 approx. So 3.289 is the required z. So any z >= 3.29 would be visible in optical. So the lower limit is approximately 3.29. The options given are A)3, which is lower than 3.29, so z=3 would only give an observed wavelength of 1216*(4) = 4864 Angstroms, wait no—wait, wait. Wait, no: z=3 would make the observed wavelength 1216*(1+3) = 4864 Angstroms, which is 486.4 nm, which is blue-green and definitely in the optical range. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, wait. Let me correct this. I think I confused the numbers. The Lyman alpha rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. If the redshift is z, then observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z).

Wait, so the observed wavelength must be greater than or equal to the minimum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. What's the minimum wavelength for optical? Well, optical usually starts at about 400 nm (violet), which is 4000 Angstroms. So the smallest observed wavelength we can detect is 4000 Angstroms.

So we have 1216*(1+z) >= 4000.

So 1+z >= 4000/1216 ≈ 3.290.

So z >= 2.290.

Wait, wait. Wait, 4000 divided by 1216 is approximately 3.290. So 1+z =3.290 → z=2.290.

Ah, I see! I made a mistake earlier when I thought the required z was 3.289. But wait, no, because 4000/1216 is approximately 3.29. So 1+z needs to be that, so z is about 2.29.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me compute 4000 / 1216 accurately.

Let me compute 1216 * 3 = 3648. 1216 * 3.2 = 3648 + (0.2 *1216) = 3648 + 243.2= 3891.2. 3891.2 is less than 4000. 1216 * 3.29 → 3.29 is 3 + 0.29.

1216 *3=3648. 1216*0.29= 1216 *0.3 is 364.8, minus 1216 *0.01=12.16 → 364.8-12.16=352.64. So 3648 +352.64=3999.64. Oh, so 1216 *3.29 ≈ 3999.64, which is just under 4000. So to reach 4000, it's just a bit higher than 3.29. So 3.29 gives 3999.64, so we need a redshift just over 3.29 for the observed wavelength to reach 4000 Angstroms.

That would mean the redshift z is about 2.29, but wait, wait no. Oh wait, no, wait. Because 1+z = 3.29, which would make z ≈ 2.29. But wait, that can't be right because 1216 * (1+2.29) =1216 *3.29 ≈3999.64, which is just under 4000 Angstroms. So for the observed wavelength to be 4000, z must be just a little more than 2.29.

Wait, so the minimal redshift would be about z=2.29. So any object with z >=2.29 would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical (since 1216*(1+2.29) ~4000 Angstroms, which is the lower limit of optical). So then, looking at the options, the closest higher value is option C) 2.4, and option D) 1.9 which is lower than 2.29.

Wait, but does that make sense? Because if z=2.29, then the observed wavelength is just 4000, but if the telescope can detect down to 4000 Angstroms, then higher z would be detected. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the options are:

A) 3 → z=3 is higher than 2.29, so it would be detected.

B)1.2 → z=1.2: 1216*(2.2)=2675.2. That's 2675 Angstroms, which is 267.5 nm, which is in the UV. So ground-based optical can't see that; it's absorbed by the atmosphere. So that's too low.

C)2.4 → 1216*(3.4)=4134.4 Angstroms, which is in the optical (413 nm is blue). So that's detectable.

D)1.9 → 1216*(2.9)=3526.4 Angstroms, which is 352.6 nm, still UV. So not visible with optical telescopes.

Wait, so the question is about the lower limit on the redshift for detection. So the minimal redshift where the Lyman alpha line is just at the optical limit (4000 Angstroms) is about z=2.29. So any z >=2.29 would have the observed wavelength in optical.

So the lower limit is z=2.29. Now looking at the options, which one is the minimal z that is above 2.29? Option C is 2.4, which is higher, but option D is 1.9, which is lower. So the minimal z is about 2.29, so the lower limit on the redshift is around 2.29. Therefore, any object with a redshift equal to or higher than that can be detected. So the minimal required is around 2.29, so the lower limit would be z=2.29. Therefore, the minimal z for detection is z=2.29. So among the options, the only one that's higher than that is C)2.4 and A)3. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the rest frame and observed frame. Let's re-express the problem.

The quasar emits light at Lyman alpha (1216 Angstroms). If the cloud is at redshift z, then the quasar's light is at a higher redshift. Wait, no, wait: the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud is at a redshift between the quasar and us. So the quasar's emitted Lyman alpha would be at 1216 Angstroms, but because the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, the cloud would see the quasar's light redshifted. Then, the cloud would absorb at a wavelength longer than 1216 Angstroms, and then when this absorption is observed by us, it would be at even longer wavelengths.

Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the quasar's emission and the cloud's absorption. Let me think.

Assume the quasar is at redshift z_q, and the neutral hydrogen cloud is at redshift z_c, which is less than z_q. The quasar emits light at Lyman alpha (1216 Angstroms). The cloud, being at a lower redshift, would see the quasar's Lyman alpha line at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms. The cloud's hydrogen would then absorb at that longer wavelength. So the absorption line we observe would correspond to the cloud's redshift.

Wait, that might change the approach. Let me think.

The quasar emits Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. The cloud, which is at redshift z_c, is between us and the quasar. So the quasar's emitted Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms. But the cloud, being at a lower redshift, sees the quasar's light redshifted. So the wavelength at which the cloud absorbs is longer than 1216 Angstroms. The cloud's Lyman alpha absorption would then be at wavelength lambda_cloud = 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But when this absorption is transmitted towards us, the entire system (cloud and quasar) is at redshift z_cloud, so the wavelength of the absorption line we observe is lambda_obs = lambda_cloud * (1 + z_cloud) ?

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me model it.

The quasar emits light at Lyman alpha (1216 Angstroms). The cloud is in front of the quasar, so when the quasar's light reaches the cloud, the cloud sees the quasar's light redshifted. The cloud's hydrogen will absorb at Lyman alpha in its own rest frame, which is 1216 Angstroms. But since the quasar's light is redshifted when it reaches the cloud, the wavelength at which the cloud absorbs is longer than 1216 Angstroms. So the absorption occurs at lambda_abs = 1216*(1 + z_cloud_quasar), where z_cloud_quasar is the redshift from the quasar to the cloud. Wait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the frame of the cloud.

In the cloud's frame, the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms. So the cloud's hydrogen will absorb at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame, which is lambda_cloud = 1216*(1 + z_cloud_quasar). Then, when this absorption is observed by us, the entire system (cloud) is at redshift z_cloud. So the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_cloud * (1 + z_cloud) = 1216*(1 + z_cloud_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. The quasar is at a higher redshift (z_q) than the cloud (z_c). The Lyman alpha emission from the quasar is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame. The cloud, which is at a lower redshift, would see this emission as redshifted. So the quasar's Lyman alpha would be at lambda_quasar_cloud = 1216 * (1 + z_q_cloud), where z_q_cloud is the redshift between the quasar and the cloud. But then, the cloud's hydrogen would absorb at its own Lyman alpha wavelength, which would be 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame, which corresponds to lambda_quasar_cloud * (1 + z_c_quasar), where z_c_quasar is the redshift from the cloud to the quasar. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as the cloud having a redshift z. The quasar is at a higher redshift, say z_q = z + delta_z. The Lyman alpha emission of the quasar is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's frame. The cloud, being at redshift z, would see this emission at a longer wavelength. The cloud's hydrogen will absorb at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame, which is 1216*(1 + z) in our frame. So the observed wavelength of the absorption line would be at 1216*(1 + z).

Ah, that makes more sense. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). So we can observe this line only if it's in the optical range, say >=4000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 → 1 + z >= 4000/1216 → 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29 → z >= 2.29.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher value is 2.4 (option C), and the next is 3 (option A). But since the question asks for the lower limit, we need the smallest z where detection is possible. So 2.29 is the minimum, so any z >=2.29 would be detected. So the options given are:

A)3 → yes, detected.

B)1.2 → no, because 1216*(1+1.2)=1216*2.2=2675.2, which is UV.

C)2.4 → 1216*3.4=4134.4, which is optical.

D)1.9 → 1216*2.9=3526.4, UV.

So the minimal z is ~2.29. So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.29. The options don't have exactly that, but the closest higher option is option C)2.4. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any z >=2.29 is detectable. The question is about the lower limit, so it's the minimal z where detection is possible. So the correct answer is the minimal z which is just above 2.29. The options don't have 2.29, so the next possible is option C)2.4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29, so it's not sufficient. So the correct lower limit is around 2.29, so the minimal z is that. But among the options, the only possible lower limit would be the smallest z where the absorption is in the optical. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit on z is ~2.3. So the options for possible answers would be the smallest z that is higher than that. So the answer should be option C)2.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we start by noting that the Lyman alpha line has a rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms. Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths in the range of 4000-7000 Angstroms (visible light). For the absorption line to be detectable, the redshifted wavelength must satisfy:

\[
\lambda_{\text{observed}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z) \geq 4000 \, \text{Angstroms}.
\]

Substituting the rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms:

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 4000.
\]

Solving for \( z \):

\[
1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z \geq 2.29.
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z = 2.29 \). Any redshift \( z \geq 2.29 \) will place the Lyman alpha absorption line in the optical range, making it detectable by ground-based telescopes.

Now, analyzing the options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than 2.29 and satisfies the condition, so it is detectable.
- **B) 1.2**: For \( z = 1.2 \), the observed wavelength is \( 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.2) = 2675.2 \, \text{Angstroms} \), which is in the ultraviolet range and not detectable by optical telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: For \( z = 2.4 \), the observed wavelength is \( 1216 \cdot (1 + 2.4) = 4134.4 \, \text{Angstroms} \), which is in the optical range and detectable.
- **D) 1.9**: For \( z = 1.9 \), the observed wavelength is \( 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526.4 \, \text{Angstroms} \), which is still in the ultraviolet range and not detectable.

The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z = 2.29 \). Among the options, the smallest value greater than this is **C) 2.4**, which satisfies the condition for detection.

Answer: C
