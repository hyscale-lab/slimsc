Okay, so I've got this question about stereoisomers. Hmm, I remember that stereoisomers are compounds that have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution), but differ only in the three-dimensional geometries of their atoms. So, stereoisomerism arises when there's chirality, or maybe geometric isomerism, like in alkenes.

The compound in question is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. Let me try to visualize its structure. Undecane has 11 carbons. The substituents are:

- At carbon 6: chlorine.
- At carbon 9: ethyl group.
- At carbon 2: methyl group.
- And the hydroxyl group is at carbon 5.

Wait, but then there are double bonds at positions 3 and 7. So the structure is something like this:

Positions 3 and 7 are double bonds. So the molecule is undeca-3,7-diene. That means there are two double bonds, each between carbons 3-4 and 7-8.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, undeca-3,7-dien would have double bonds starting at 3 and 7. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-... but wait, perhaps I should draw it more carefully.

Wait, n=11 for undecane. So positions 1 to 11.

So the substituents:

- Carbon 2: methyl (so CH2CH(CH3)... )
- Carbon 5: OH (so ...CH(OH)CH2...)
- Carbon 6: Cl (so ...CHCl...)
- Carbon 9: ethyl (so ...CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- ... but wait, ethyl is CH2CH2? No, ethyl is CH2CH3. So at carbon 9, it's CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, carbon 9 is attached to an ethyl group, so it's CH2-CH2CH3? Or maybe I should think of it as CH2CH2-CH3.

But maybe the exact structure isn't critical right now. What's important is the presence of stereogenic centers and double bonds that could lead to geometric isomerism.

So, the question is about the number of stereoisomers. So, stereoisomer count comes from two sources: stereogenic centers (chirality) and double bonds (cis-trans isomerism).

First, I need to find how many chiral centers there are. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

Looking at the compound, the OH is on carbon 5. So carbon 5 is attached to:

- The OH group.
- The neighboring carbons (4 and 6).
- The substituents on those carbons.

Wait, so for carbon 5 to be a chiral center, it must have four distinct groups. Let's see:

Carbon 5 is connected to:

- Carbon 4: which is part of the chain. What's attached to carbon 4? Well, the chain goes from 4 to 3, which is a double bond. So carbon 4 is connected to a double bond (so maybe CH2 or CH). Let me think about the structure.

Wait, maybe I should number the carbons:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11

But wait, the double bonds are at 3 and 7. So, the structure is probably:

1: CH3-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2-

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the double bonds are between 3 and 4, and 7 and 8. So positions 3 and 7 are double bonds.

So, the molecule is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Double bonds between 3-4 and 7-8.

So, carbon 3 is connected to carbon 2 and 4. Carbon 4 is double bonded to 3 and single bonded to 5. Similarly, carbon 7 is double bonded to 8 and single bonded to 6 and 8.

Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(CH3)-

Carbon 3: CH2-

Wait, no, wait. If it's undeca-3,7-dien, then the double bonds are between 3-4 and 7-8.

So, the structure is:

1: CH3-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2-

Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the substituents. The OH is on carbon 5, which is in the middle of the chain. So carbon 5 is connected to carbons 4, 6, an OH, and a hydrogen? Or maybe not.

Wait, perhaps carbon 5 is a chiral center. Let me check: substituents on C5 are:

- OH
- CH2Cl (from C6)
- CH2CH2 (from C4, perhaps)
- And another group, perhaps a CH2 group from the other side.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Carbon 5 is in the middle. Let me imagine the structure as:

...-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-... ?

Wait, but the substituents on C5 are:

- OH
- The substituent from C4 (which is connected to C3, which is part of a double bond)
- The substituent from C6 (which has Cl)
- And a hydrogen? Or maybe another substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each substituent.

Let me imagine that carbon 5 is connected to:

1. Hydroxyl group (-OH)
2. Carbon 4: which is CH2 (since there's a double bond at 3,4)
3. Carbon 6: which is CHCl (since 6 has Cl)
4. And another substituent, perhaps a CH2 group from the other side. Or maybe carbon 5 is connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe it's:

At C5, the structure is: -CH(OH)-

But then, looking at the neighboring carbons:

C4 is connected via a single bond to C3, which is part of a double bond (C3=C4). So C4 is CH2.

So C5 is connected to:

- C4: CH2
- C6: CHCl (since C6 has a Cl)
- C5's substituents: OH, H, CH2 (from C4), and CHCl (from C6? Or maybe another group?).

Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let's think about whether C5 is a chiral center.

Chiral centers require four different substituents.

If C5 has:

- OH group,
- H,
- two different CH2 groups,
- and something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think more carefully.

Let me try to imagine the structure:

From C5, looking at the substituents:

- To the left: C4, which is part of the double bond (so C4 is CH2, because the double bond is between C3 and C4: C3=C4. So C4 is connected to C5, which is CH(OH), so C4 would be CH2-CH(OH)-...

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to write out the structure.

The chain is 11 carbons long. Let's list them as positions 1 through 11.

Positions with substituents:

- Position 2: methyl (CH(CH3))
- Position 5: OH (so CH(OH))
- Position 6: Cl (so CHCl)
- Position 9: ethyl (CH2CH2CH3? No, ethyl is CH2CH3. So CH2CH2CH3 is propyl. Wait, no, ethyl is -CH2CH3.

So, the structure from 1 to 11:

1: CH3-
2: CH(CH3)-
3: CH2- (since the double bond starts at 3)
4: C= (since 3,4 double bond)
Wait, that's not right. Wait, the double bonds are between 3-4 and 7-8.

So, position 3 is CH2, position 4 is CH with a double bond to 3.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH(CH3)-

Carbon 3: CH2-

But wait, between 3 and 4 is a double bond. So, Carbon 3: CH2-CH2- for single bonds, but wait, no. The double bond is between 3 and 4: so, it's CH2-CH2- becomes CH2=CH.

Ah, so:

1: CH3-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: C=CH-

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it as:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11

CH3-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-... etc. No, wait, because of the double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

1: CH3-

2: CH(CH3)-

3: CH2-

4: C=CH- (since 3,4 is a double bond)

5: CH(OH)-

6: CHCl-

7: CH2-

8: C=CH-

9: CH(CH2CH3)-

10: CH2-

11: CH3

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged as:

At position 3: double bond to 4 (so 3 is CH2 and 4 is CH, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about each carbon's substituents.

Let me think of each carbon:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(CH3)

Carbon 3: CH2 (since it's connected to C2 and C4, which is a double bond)

Wait no: if 3 and 4 are double bonded, then C3 is CH2-CH2? No, wait, a double bond between C3 and C4 would make C3=CH-CH2-...

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the exact structure, but maybe I should focus on the stereoisomer possibilities.

The main points are:

1. Identify all chiral centers.
2. Determine if any double bonds can lead to geometric isomerism.

So, first, chiral centers.

Looking at the compound, which carbons can be chiral centers?

Carbon 5: the hydroxyl group is here. So, substituents on C5: OH, and three other groups. Let's see:

What's attached to C5?

- The OH group.
- The substituent from C4: which is a CH2 group (since the double bond is between C3 and C4, so C4 is connected to C5 via a single bond. So C4 is CH2).
- The substituent from C6: which is CHCl (since C6 has Cl).
- And the other substituent is the chain beyond C5, which is CH2... something.

Wait, perhaps C5 is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2 (from C4),
- CHCl (from C6),
- And another CH2 group towards C5's other side.

Wait, but that would mean that two substituents are the same (both CH2), making C5 not a chiral center. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C5 is connected to four different groups. Let me consider:

If C5 is attached to:

1. OH
2. CH2- (from C4, which is part of the double bond)
3. CHCl- (from C6, which has Cl)
4. And another group, say, CH2- in the other direction, which might be different.

Wait, but if the substituents are all different, then C5 is a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the groups are:

- OH
- CH2CH2 (from C4, which is part of a double bond, so maybe CH2-CH2 is part of a longer chain)
- CHCl (from C6)
- And another group, perhaps a longer chain.

Hmmm, maybe it's better to think that C5 is a chiral center, so that's one source of stereoisomerism.

Next, are there any other chiral centers?

Looking at the molecule, any other carbons with four different substituents?

Carbon 9 has an ethyl group: so it's attached to CH2CH3. So, substituents on C9:

- CH2CH3
- CH2 (from C8)
- Maybe another CH2 group from C10
- And perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because CH2CH3 is a substituent, and CH2 from C8 and C10. So, the substituents on C9 would be:

- ethyl (CH2CH3)
- CH2- (from C8)
- CH2- (from C10)
- H

Wait, but that would mean that two substituents are CH2, so C9 can't be a chiral center.

Similarly, carbon 6 has Cl. Substituents would be:

- Cl
- CH2 (from C5)
- CH2 (from C7)
- H

Wait, no, perhaps:

Carbon 6 is connected to:

- Cl
- C5 (CH(OH)...)
- C7 (which is part of a double bond)
- And another substituent, perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, not sure, but maybe C6 is connected to four different groups, making it a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps C6 is CHCl connected to C5 and C7, which are each connected to different groups.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck again. Let me think of each carbon with substituents:

Carbon 2: has a methyl group. So, substituents are:

- CH(CH3)
- CH3 (from C1)
- CH2 (from C3)
- And another group, possibly a CH2.

If all four are different, then C2 could be a chiral center. But wait, substituents would be:

- methyl (CH3)
- CH(CH3)
- CH2 connected to C3 (which is part of a double bond)
- And another substituent.

Wait, no. Carbon 2 is attached to:

- C1: which is CH3
- C3: which is CH2 (since C3 is part of a double bond)
- The methyl group (CH(CH3))
- And another substituent, which is a CH2 group to C3, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think that C2 is connected to:

- a methyl group (CH3)
- a CH3 from C1 (but that's same as the substituent)
Wait, no, C2 is CH(CH3), so its substituents are:

- CH3 (from C1)
- CH3 (as the methyl group)
- CH2 (to C3)
- And another CH group, perhaps.

Wait, that would mean two substituents are CH3, making C2 not a chiral center.

Hmm. So maybe C2 isn't a chiral center.

Similarly, checking other carbons:

Carbon 9: attached to ethyl group. Substituents:

- ethyl (CH2CH3)
- CH2 from C8
- CH2 from C10
- H?

If that's the case, two substituents are CH2, so not a chiral center.

Carbon 6: substituents:

- Cl
- CH2 from C5
- CH2 from C7 (since C7 is part of a double bond, perhaps)
- And another group, maybe a CH?

Wait, perhaps C6 is connected to four different groups: Cl, CH2 (from C5, which is OH-bearing), CH2 (from C7, which is part of a double bond), and another group. If so, then C6 is a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe not. It's a bit unclear, but perhaps C6 is a chiral center.

So far, possible chiral centers are C5 and C6. If both are chiral, that's 2 stereocenters, leading to 2^2=4 stereoisomers from them.

Wait, but wait. What about the double bonds?

The molecule has two double bonds: at 3,4 and 7,8.

Each double bond can have cis or trans configuration, leading to geometric isomerism.

So for each double bond, there are two possibilities (cis or trans), but wait, wait. The question is, do these double bonds have substituents that allow for geometric isomerism?

So, for a double bond to have geometric isomerism, each carbon in the double bond must be connected to two different groups.

Let's check each double bond.

First double bond: between C3 and C4.

C3: what's attached?

- C2: which is CH(CH3)
- C4: which is part of the double bond (so, CH2, perhaps)
Wait, no. Because the double bond is C3=C4.

Wait, if C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH(CH3)), and to C4 (which is connected via double bond), then C3 is also connected to two H's perhaps?

Wait, maybe the structure is:

C3: CH2-
C4: CH-

Wait, no, that can't be right because of the double bond. Let me think again. For a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other groups.

At C3:

- Connected to C2 (CH(CH3))
- Connected to C4 (double bond)
- And two H's? Or perhaps other substituents.

Wait, if C3 is CH2, then the double bond would be between C3 and C4. So, C3 would have substituents:

- CH(CH3)
- CH2 (from C4)
- Two H's.

Wait, so for C3, substituents are CH(CH3), CH2 (from C4), and two H's. So, same groups on each side. Thus, the double bond between C3 and C4 can't have geometric isomerism because each carbon isn't connected to two different groups.

Wait, wait, no. For geometric isomerism (cis/trans), each carbon in the double bond must have two different substituents besides the double bond.

So, for C3 and C4:

C3: connected to C2 (CH(CH3)), C4 (double bond), and two H's.

So, substituents on C3: CH(CH3), H, H, and the double bond to C4.

Similarly, C4 is connected to C3, C5 (CH(OH)), and two H's.

So, substituents on C4: CH(OH), H, H, and double bond to C3.

In such a case, each carbon in the double bond has two H's and one other substituent. So, the groups on each carbon are not all different. Therefore, the double bond at 3,4 cannot have geometric isomerism.

Now, checking the second double bond between C7 and C8.

C7: connected to C6 (CHCl), C8 (double bond), and perhaps two H's.

C8: connected to C7 (double bond), C9 (CH(CH2CH3)), and two H's.

So, substituents on C7: CHCl, H, H, and double bond to C8.

Substituents on C8: CH(CH2CH3), H, H, and double bond to C7.

Again, each carbon in the 7,8 double bond has two H's and one substituent. Thus, the double bonds at 3,4 and 7,8 don't allow for geometric isomerism.

Wait, but that can't be right because the presence of substituents on each double bond carbon could allow for cis or trans configurations. Perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the substituents.

Wait, at C7, substituents would be:

- CHCl (from C6)
- Two H's
- Double bond to C8.

But wait, perhaps C7 is connected to more substituents. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are different. Let's think about what's attached to C7 and C8.

C7 is attached to:

- C6 (which has Cl, but perhaps C6 is CHCl)
- C8 (double bond)
- Maybe a CH2 group to C9?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

...-CHCl-CH2-CH2-C=C-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-...

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C7 and C8 are more varied.

If, for example, C7 is attached to CHCl and a CH2 group towards C9, then perhaps the substituents are different, allowing geometric isomerism.

Wait, maybe I should consider the substituents on each end of the double bond.

For the double bond between C7 and C8:

At C7, substituents could be:

- CHCl (from C6)
- CH2 group leading to C8 (but wait, C8 is part of a double bond, so C7 would be CH2 leading to C8.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to determine if each double bond allows for cis/trans isomerism.

For the 3,4 double bond:

Each carbon in the double bond (C3 and C4) has:

- C3: connected to C2 (CH(CH3)), and two H's.
- C4: connected to C5 (CH(OH)), and two H's.

So, each has two H's and another substituent. Thus, same groups on each side, so no geometric isomerism.

For the 7,8 double bond:

C7: connected to C6 (which is CHCl), and two H's.
C8: connected to C9 (which is CH(CH2CH3)), and two H's.

So, substituents on C7: CHCl and two H's.
Substituents on C8: CH(CH2CH3) and two H's.

Thus, each carbon in the double bond has two H's and another substituent. So again, no geometric isomerism.

Wait a minute, that can't be right. Because if each end of the double bond has a substituent and two H's, then the substituent on each end is unique, but the other two substituents are H's, which are same. So, perhaps the double bond can't have cis/trans isomerism because each carbon only has one non-H substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again about the conditions for geometric isomerism. For a double bond to exhibit geometric isomerism, each carbon in the double bond must have at least two different substituents besides the double bond.

So, for example, each carbon should have two different groups attached besides the double bond.

In the case of the 3,4 double bond:

C3 has substituents: CH(CH3) and two H's.
C4 has substituents: CH(OH) and two H's.

So, each has only one non-H substituent. Therefore, no geometric isomerism.

Same for the 7,8 double bond:

C7 has CHCl and two H's.
C8 has CH(CH2CH3) and two H's.

Again, only one non-H substituent on each carbon. So, no geometric isomerism.

So, the only source of stereoisomerism is the chiral centers.

Earlier, I thought maybe C5 and C6 are chiral centers.

If both are chiral, that's 2 stereocenters, leading to 2^2=4 stereoisomers.

Wait, but earlier I wasn't sure if C6 is a chiral center.

Let me re-examine C6.

C6 has a Cl substituent. What's attached to it?

C5: which is CH(OH), perhaps.

C7: which is part of a double bond, so perhaps CH2.

And two other substituents, perhaps CH2 groups.

Wait, I'm not getting the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps C6 has four different substituents:

- Cl
- CH(OH) from C5
- CH2 from C7 (since C7 is double bonded, perhaps)
- And another substituent, like CH2 leading to C8.

Wait, but if C6 is connected to Cl, a CH(OH), a CH2, and another CH2, then two substituents are same (CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C6 is connected to four different groups.

If C6 is connected to:

- Cl
- CH2 from C5 (if C5 has a CH2 group)
- CH2 from C7 (if C7 is CH2)
- And another group, perhaps a CH leading to C8.

Wait, not sure. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps C5 is a chiral center, but C6 is not. So only one chiral center, leading to 2 stereoisomers. But the options don't have 2, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, the options are A)4, B)16, C)32, D)8.

Hmm, perhaps there are more chiral centers.

Wait, maybe I missed some. Let me try to think of other carbons.

Carbon 9: attached to ethyl group. Substituents:

- CH2CH3
- CH2 from C8
- CH2 from C10
- H?

If substituents are CH2CH3, CH2 (from C8), CH2 (from C10), and H: so two CH2 groups, so same substituent. Not a chiral center.

Carbon 4: attached to C3 (double bond) and C5 (CH(OH)).

So substituents on C4: C3 (double bond), C5 (CH(OH)), and two H's.

So, substituents are double bond, CH(OH), H, H. Thus, same substituents, not a chiral center.

Carbon 8: attached to C7 (double bond), C9 (CH(CH2CH3)), and two H's.

So substituents are double bond, CH(CH2CH3), H, H. So same substituents, not a chiral center.

Carbon 7: substituents are C6 (CHCl?), double bond to C8, and two H's. So substituents are CHCl, double bond, H, H. Again, same substituents on two sides, so no.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, what about carbon 5: substituents are OH, CH2 (from C4), CHCl (from C6), and another group, perhaps a CH2 leading to C5's other side.

Wait, if the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2 (from C4)
- CHCl (from C6)
- And another CH2 group leading to C5's other side.

But if the other side is CH2, then two substituents are same (CH2 groups), so C5 isn't a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C5 are different. Let me think about the groups:

C5 is connected to:

- OH group
- CH2 from C4 (so, maybe CH2-CH2-)
- CHCl from C6 (so, CHCl-CH2-)
- And a CH2 leading to C5's other side (like, after C5 comes C6, but perhaps the chain continues).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe C5 isn't a chiral center. That would leave no chiral centers, leading to only one stereoisomer, but that's not one of the options either.

Hmm. Now I'm confused. Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the double bonds contribute to isomerism. Maybe the double bonds do allow for geometric isomerism.

Wait, perhaps in the 7,8 double bond, each end has a substituent besides the H's. Let me think: C7 is connected to C6 (which is CHCl) and C8 (which is connected to C9, which is CH(CH2CH3)).

So, substituents on C7: CHCl and CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, because C7 is connected via a double bond to C8, so the substituents would be:

C7: connected to CHCl, CH(CH2CH3), and two H's?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of the structure around the double bonds.

If the structure is ...CHCl-CH2-CH2-C=C-CH(CH2CH3)-..., then the substituents on the double bond carbons are:

C7: CHCl and CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps in this scenario, each carbon of the double bond has two different substituents, allowing for cis/trans isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me imagine the structure around the double bond.

For the 7,8 double bond:

C7 is connected to C6 (CHCl) and C8 (which is part of the double bond and connected to C9 (CH(CH2CH3)).

So, substituents on C7: CHCl, CH2 (from C6?), and two H's.

Wait, perhaps I'm not visualizing this correctly. Maybe it's better to think that each carbon in the double bond has two substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, for a double bond to have geometric isomerism, each carbon must have two different groups attached.

If C7 is connected to CHCl and a CH2 group (leading to C8), but also has two H's, then no, because the CH2 might not be different from the H's.

Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has more substituents.

In any case, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to proceed with what I think.

Assuming that the only chiral center is C5, which would give 2 stereoisomers. But the options don't have 2, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps there are two chiral centers: C5 and another.

Wait, perhaps C6 is a chiral center.

If C6 has substituents:

- Cl
- CH2 from C5 (which is OH bearing)
- CH2 from C7 (double bond)
- And another substituent, perhaps a CH group from somewhere else.

If all four substituents are different, then C6 is chiral.

So, if both C5 and C6 are chiral centers, that's two stereocenters, leading to 2^2=4 stereoisomers.

Additionally, if the double bonds don't contribute, then the total is 4.

Looking at the options, option A is 4. So the answer would be A.

But wait, earlier I thought the double bonds don't contribute to geometric isomerism. So, if only two chiral centers, the answer is 4.

Yes, so the answer should be A)4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of stereoisomers for the compound 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol, we analyze the sources of stereoisomerism: chiral centers and geometric isomerism from double bonds.

### 1. **Chiral Centers**
A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. The compound has the following potential chiral centers:

- **Carbon 5 (C5):**  
  C5 is bonded to:
  - Hydroxyl group (-OH),
  - Carbon 4 (CH2 group),
  - Carbon 6 (CHCl group),
  - A hydrogen atom or another group in the chain.  
  Since C5 has four distinct substituents, it is a chiral center.

- **Carbon 6 (C6):**  
  C6 is bonded to:
  - Chlorine atom (-Cl),
  - Carbon 5 (CH(OH) group),
  - Carbon 7 (CH2 group, part of the double bond),
  - A hydrogen atom or another group in the chain.  
  Since C6 has four distinct substituents, it is also a chiral center.

Thus, there are **2 chiral centers** in the molecule.

### 2. **Geometric Isomerism from Double Bonds**
The compound has two double bonds at positions 3,4 and 7,8. For a double bond to exhibit geometric isomerism (cis/trans), each carbon in the double bond must be bonded to two different groups. 

- **Double bond at 3,4:**  
  C3 is bonded to:
  - Carbon 2 (CH(CH3)),
  - Two hydrogen atoms.  
  C4 is bonded to:
  - Carbon 5 (CH(OH)),
  - Two hydrogen atoms.  
  Since both carbons in the 3,4 double bond have two identical substituents (hydrogen atoms), this double bond does not contribute to geometric isomerism.

- **Double bond at 7,8:**  
  C7 is bonded to:
  - Carbon 6 (CHCl),
  - Two hydrogen atoms.  
  C8 is bonded to:
  - Carbon 9 (CH(CH2CH3)),
  - Two hydrogen atoms.  
  Again, both carbons in the 7,8 double bond have two identical substituents (hydrogen atoms), so this double bond also does not contribute to geometric isomerism.

### 3. **Total Number of Stereoisomers**
The only sources of stereoisomerism are the two chiral centers (C5 and C6). Each chiral center can exist in two configurations (R or S), so the total number of stereoisomers is:

\[
2^n = 2^2 = 4
\]

Thus, the compound has **4 stereoisomers**.
