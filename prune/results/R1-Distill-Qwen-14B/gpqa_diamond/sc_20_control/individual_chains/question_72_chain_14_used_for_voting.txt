Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me think about what each part does and see if I can figure out the final product.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta... something usually refers to a norbornene structure. Norbornene has that bridge structure—so the molecule looks like a bicyclic compound with two rings.

Then, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is often a good nucleophile in substitution reactions, especially with dibromides. Wait, the compound has two dibromomethyl groups on the cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those groups has two bromines attached to a methyl. 

When you have such a molecule reacting with a nucleophile like iodide, it's probably undergoing a substitution. Since there are two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound, maybe each methyl group is reacting once? So each methyl would replace Br with iodide? Wait, but wait, it's 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so each of the two methyl groups on carbons 5 and 6 of the cyclohexadiene has two Br atoms.

Wait, but substitution with iodide would require some leaving group. The Br is a good leaving group, so perhaps each methyl loses Br and gains iodide? But wait, I'm confused. Let's think differently: when you have a di-substituted dibromomethyl group, like perhaps each methyl is actually CH2Br2. So each CH2Br2 would react with iodide.

Wait, but how? Each Br is a leaving group. So in a substitution reaction, each Br could get replaced by iodide. So each CH2Br2 would become CH2I2? Hmm, no, because each substitution would be SN2 perhaps. But methyl is a poor candidate for SN2 because it's a primary center but maybe sterically hindered? Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination, but I think the main point is that the dibromomethyl groups react with the iodide nucleophile.

Wait, but the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)... which is a good protecting group for an ether. So the presence of tert-butoxy suggests that the oxygen is not very reactive, but perhaps in the reaction conditions, it's acting as a base? Or maybe it's just a spectator.

So when the dibromomethyl compounds react with sodium iodide, perhaps each of the two methyl groups (on 5 and 6) substitute one Br for iodide. So each gives CH2I. Wait, but each group has two Brs. So each would substitute both Brs, giving CH2I2? That seems a bit odd, but I think that's possible. But wait, if you use two equivalents, perhaps each methyl group (two in total) substitutes once each, leading to two CH2I groups. But wait, the dibromomethyl groups have two Brs each. So if each methyl group donates two equivalents, but we have two such groups, that's four Brs in total. But the problem states two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps each dibromomethyl group in the cyclohexadiene is undergoing a substitution where one Br is replaced by iodide. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI. But that would use one equivalent. Wait, but we have two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound. So perhaps each of the two methyl groups (5 and 6) substitutes both Brs, giving CH2I2 on each. But that would require two equivalents per molecule, but we only have two equivalents in total. Hmm, maybe each molecule of the dibromomethyl compound only reacts once? Or maybe each CH2Br2 group reacts twice, but that would require four equivalents, which we don't have. So perhaps each CH2Br2 only reacts once, replacing one Br with iodide, giving CH2BrI. That would use up two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound (since there are two such groups), each replacing one Br. So each group becomes CH2BrI.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something else here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling. The norbornene has a diene structure, and the cyclohexadiene has another diene. Maybe a Diels-Alder reaction is happening here. Oh wait, but the conditions are with sodium iodide and elevated temperature. Diels-Alder typically doesn't require such conditions. So perhaps it's more of a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the norbornene's double bonds are reacting with the dienophile, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the norbornene's oxygen is acting as a base, abstracting a proton and leading to some kind of ring-opening or addition.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what the product might be. The norbornene has an ether group, and the other molecule has two methyl groups with two Br each. The reaction is with NaI, which is a source of iodide ions. So perhaps each Br in the dibromomethyl groups is displaced by iodide. Each CH2Br2 would become CH2I2. But how many equivalents? Each CH2Br2 has two Brs, so for each, two equivalents of NaI are needed. But the problem states that two equivalents are used in total. Hmm, but the dibromomethyl compound is present in two equivalents.

Wait, perhaps each molecule of the dibromomethyl compound has two Brs, and each Br is replaced by iodide, so each molecule becomes CH2I2. But then, since we have two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound, each CH2Br2 would have both Brs replaced, leading to two CH2I2 groups. But that would require four equivalents of NaI, which is more than what's available. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the two dibromomethyl groups only replaces one Br, so each becomes CH2BrI. That would use two equivalents of NaI (each Br substitution is one equivalent), and each group uses one. But since there are two groups, that's two equivalents. That makes sense. So the product would have two CH2BrI groups on the cyclohexadiene.

Wait, but then the product would have two CH2BrI groups. But perhaps the cyclohexadiene is being cross-linked or something else. Alternatively, maybe the norbornene is acting as a nucleophile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting norbornene is the diene, and the dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene is the dienophile. But then, under heat, perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction occurs. So the bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (norbornene) would react with the cyclohexadiene as a dienophile. But Diels-Alder usually requires a diene and a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups. The cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene, but without EWG, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are activating the cyclohexadiene as a dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. The norbornene has a diene, and the other molecule has a dienophile (maybe the dibromomethyl groups are activating something). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing a ring-opening substitution. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group? No, tert-butoxy is usually a poor leaving group. Wait, no, tert-butoxy is O-t-Bu, which is a good nucleophile but a poor leaving group. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene isn't participating in the substitution. Maybe the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is reacting with the sodium iodide, substituting both Brs with I, but that would require four equivalents, but we only have two. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each of the two dibromomethyl groups in the cyclohexadiene is substituting one Br. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI, using one equivalent each. So with two equivalents, that's two substitutions, each on a different CH2Br2 group. So each of the two CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI.

But then, the product after step 1 would have two CH2BrI groups. Then, what's next?

Step 2: product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming product 2. Hmm, aqueous H2SO4. That's typically a condition for acid-catalyzed reactions, perhaps hydrolysis or elimination.

If product 1 has CH2BrI groups, then in acid, perhaps the Br is a good leaving group. So maybe the Br is leaving, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the iodide is a leaving group. Wait, I is a poor leaving group compared to Br, but maybe under acidic conditions, something else happens.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2BrI groups undergo some reaction. Wait, CH2BrI is a primary alkyl iodide, but in acidic conditions, perhaps it's protonated, making it a better leaving group. But I'm not sure what reaction would occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the H2SO4 is causing some kind of ring-opening of the norbornene structure. The norbornene has a bicyclic structure, perhaps it's opening under acidic conditions. The tert-butoxy group is a bulky protecting group. In acid, maybe the ether is cleaved. Wait, but tert-butoxy is an ether, and under strong acidic conditions, ethers can undergo cleavage. For example, in H2SO4, an ether might break, especially if it's a good leaving group. The tert-butoxy group is O-t-Bu, which is a strong base. Under acidic conditions, it could protonate, but O-t-Bu is a poor leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the cleavage of the ether isn't the main reaction here. Alternatively, perhaps the Br and I in the CH2BrI groups are being replaced. Alternatively, perhaps the H2SO4 is causing some elimination. Let me think: if we have CH2BrI, perhaps in acid, the Br leaves, and the I stays, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the I leaves, but that's less likely. Hmm, perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2BrI undergoes hydrolysis in acidic conditions. But under aqueous H2SO4, perhaps the Br is replaced by hydroxide. Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, maybe the OH- is not present. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 has iodine atoms, and in step 2, they're being replaced. Or maybe elimination is happening, forming double bonds.

Wait, maybe product 1 has the two CH2BrI groups. Then, in aqueous H2SO4, perhaps the Br is removed. So perhaps each CH2BrI becomes CH2OH. Because H2SO4 can act as an oxidizing agent or facilitate substitutions.

Wait, but Br is a better leaving group than I. So if we have CH2BrI in acidic conditions, perhaps the Br leaves, and then water attacks, forming an alcohol. So substitution: CH2BrI → CH2OH. That would make sense. So each CH2BrI would become CH2OH, so two OH groups are added.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the Br is replaced by hydroxide. So each CH2BrI would become CH2I, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe both Br and I are leaving, but that's unlikely. Hmm, perhaps I should move forward and see what the next steps are.

Step 3: product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. SO3 in DMSO with pyridine is a typical condition for sulfonation or sulfonamide formation. Alternatively, I think it's used for the synthesis of sulfonic acids, perhaps through the diazonium salt reaction, but I'm not quite recalling. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfonation of an aromatic ring, but product 2 may not have an aromatic ring.

Wait, product 2 would have the cyclohexadiene with CH2OH groups. Maybe after step 2, the CH2BrI groups became CH2OH. So product 2 has two CH2OH groups on the cyclohexadiene.

So when product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, what happens? SO3 is a sulfonating agent. So perhaps the CH2OH groups are being converted into something else. Alternatively, maybe the diol groups are reacting.

Wait, another thought: when a diol is treated with SO3 and pyridine, it can form a cyclic sulfate ester. Like, for example, vicinal diols (1,2-diols) can form cyclic sulfate esters when treated with SO3 and a base. But the diol here is on adjacent carbons? Let me think, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has methyl groups on 5 and 6. So in product 2, the groups are on 5 and 6 as CH2OH. Are they adjacent? Let me visualize the structure.

Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a six-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions. So the substituents are at 5 and 6. Wait, in a six-membered ring, positions 5 and 6 are adjacent. So the two CH2OH groups are on adjacent carbons. So that would be a 5,6-bis(CH2OH)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a 1,3-diene with two adjacent CH2OH groups.

So under treatment with SO3 and pyridine, which is a typical condition for forming cyclic sulfates, perhaps the two vicinal diol groups form a cyclic sulfate. So the two CH2OH groups would lose their hydroxyls and form a sulfate bridge between the two adjacent carbons. So product 3 would be a cyclohexa-1,3-diene with a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the structure. Vicinal diols (1,2-diols) can form cyclic sulfates, so if the two hydroxyls are on adjacent carbons, they can form a five-membered ring when the sulfate is formed. So the product would have a cyclic sulfate ester between C5 and C6.

So after step 3, product 3 is a cyclohexene ring with a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6, and the 1,3-diene remains.

Then, step 4: product 3 is heated at 150°C, forming the final product 4. Heating cyclic sulfates usually leads to cleavage. The ring opens, and depending on the conditions, it can form different products. For example, in acidic conditions, the sulfate ring might hydrolyze to form diols, but since this is just heat, perhaps it's a different pathway.

Wait, but wait: the sulfate bridge is between C5 and C6, which are adjacent. Heating would cause the ring to break. When cyclic sulfates are heated, especially in the presence of something like a base, they can open to form a sulfate ester or possibly eliminate. Alternatively, in the absence of water, perhaps an elimination occurs.

Wait, another thought: when a cyclic sulfate is heated, it can undergo ring-opening to form a sulfate ester. For example, the ring opens to form a sulfate group on each of the two adjacent carbons. But that would require breaking the sulfate bridge.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclic sulfate, upon heating, undergoes elimination to form a triple bond or a longer double bond.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material after step 3 is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene with a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6. When heated, the bridge might break, leading to the formation of a longer conjugated diene or a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new double bond. Let me think: the structure has the cyclohexene ring with a 1,3-diene. The sulfate bridge is between C5 and C6. When the bridge breaks, perhaps the two adjacent CH2 groups (now as sulfate) lose the sulfate and form a new double bond.

Wait, perhaps the ring opens, and a new double bond forms between C5 and C6, converting the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene? Or maybe the ring becomes a larger conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond. For example, if the sulfate bridge is between C5 and C6, heating could cause the loss of SO2 and the formation of a triple bond between C5 and C6. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would then have a triple bond at 5,6, making it a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene? No, that's not possible because triple bonds can't be conjugated with double bonds in a ring like that.

Wait, maybe the ring opens, and the structure becomes a larger conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe the ring becomes a bicyclic structure again but with a different arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens to form a dienophile. Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let's try to approach it differently.

Let me think about the overall process. The initial reaction involves substitution to add iodide groups, then acid treatment, then sulfonation, then heating. The final product's hydrogen count is what's being asked.

Let me try to outline each step:

1. Reaction of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI.

Assuming that each dibromomethyl group (CH2Br2) substitutes one Br for I, using one equivalent each. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI. But with two equivalents of NaI, perhaps each CH2Br2 group substitutes both Brs, making CH2I2. But that would require 4 equivalents of NaI, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the diene is undergoing a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The norbornene's diene reacts with the dibromomethyl dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, forming a six-membered ring with substituents. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing an addition reaction. The dienophile (if any) would add across the diene. But without a proper dienophile, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the norbornene's oxygen attacks the dibromomethyl group. But the oxygen is part of a bulky tert-butoxy group, making it a poor nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene isn't reacting, and the substitution is happening on the dibromomethyl groups. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2 using two equivalents of NaI. But that would require four equivalents, but the problem says two. So perhaps each CH2Br2 group substitutes one Br, making two CH2BrI groups. So product 1 would have two CH2BrI groups on the cyclohexadiene.

Let me move forward.

Step 2: treating with H2SO4 aqueous. So each CH2BrI in product 1 would have the Br replaced by OH, forming CH2OH. So product 2 is 5,6-bis(CH2OH)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Step 3: treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. This is a common method for sulfonating diols, especially vicinal diols, to form cyclic sulfates. Since the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons (5 and 6), the product 3 would have a cyclic sulfate ester between C5 and C6. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene now has a bridge between C5 and C6 as a sulfate group.

Step 4: heating product 3 at 150°C. Heating cyclic sulfates can lead to ring cleavage. One possibility is that the ring opens, and the sulfate group is eliminated. For example, the sulfate bridge breaks, releasing SO2 and forming a new double bond between C5 and C6. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would become a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene? But that's not possible because the ring would become a seven-membered ring, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the ring might open into a larger conjugated diene.

Wait, another thought: when the cyclic sulfate is heated, it might undergo elimination, releasing SO2 and forming a triple bond between C5 and C6. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have a triple bond at 5,6, making it a cyclohexa-1,3,5-trien-5-yne? That seems unlikely in a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens and the structure becomes a larger fused ring. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the heating leads to the formation of a more stable structure, like a fused ring. Alternatively, maybe the ring opens and forms a diene that's part of a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclic sulfate upon heating undergoes ring-opening to form a diol again, but that doesn't make sense since we started with a diol and formed a sulfate.

Wait, perhaps the cyclic sulfate is not stable upon heating and breaks down. Let me think about the structure again: cyclohexa-1,3-diene with a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6. Heating would break that bridge, but how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the heating causes the elimination of the sulfate group, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C5 and C6. The mechanism would involve the loss of SO2 and the formation of a triple bond. So the product 4 would have a triple bond between C5 and C6, making it a cyclohexa-1,3,5-trien-5-yne, but that's not possible due to ring strain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens and the structure becomes a hexatriene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the heating leads to the loss of the sulfate group and the formation of a new double bond. For example, breaking the bridge between C5 and C6 and forming a double bond between C5 and C6, making the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. But cyclohexene can't have three double bonds because that would require too many conjugated double bonds in a six-membered ring.

Wait, another possibility: the ring opens, and the structure becomes a bicyclic compound. For example, the cyclohexene ring could become a seven-membered ring with a bridge, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating causes the cyclohexene ring to lose the sulfate bridge and form a more stable structure, such as a diene that's part of a larger conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens to form a 1,3-diene and a new substituent. For example, the cyclohexene could become a 1,3,5-triene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what the final product might look like after each step.

After step 4, product 4 is the result of heating product 3 (the cyclic sulfate) at 150°C. Let me think about what happens when a cyclic sulfate is heated. One possibility is that the ring opens, and the two adjacent oxygens (from the sulfate) are replaced by hydroxyl groups, but that would just bring us back to product 2, which doesn't make sense as a final step.

Alternatively, the ring might break to form a larger ring with a double bond. For example, if the cyclohexene ring breaks at C5 and C6, where the sulfate bridge was, and then the chain forms a new ring, perhaps a bicyclic structure.

Wait, another possibility: the cyclohexene ring could undergo ring expansion upon heating, incorporating the sulfate bridge into a larger ring. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating leads to the loss of the sulfate group as SO2 and the formation of a new double bond. So the ring would have an additional double bond, making it more conjugated.

Wait, perhaps the final structure is a norbornene derivative. Wait, the starting material was a norbornene. Maybe the product after all steps is a more complex norbornene derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating leads to the formation of a new ring, such as a bicyclo structure. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

But since the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, perhaps I can think about the structure after each step and count the hydrogens.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Combine norbornene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexadiene and NaI. Assuming substitution occurs, each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I. So each of the two groups substitutes once, leading to CH2I and CH2Br.

Wait, no, that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br2 group is converted to CH2I, so each has one Br and one I. So product 1 has two CH2BrI groups on the cyclohexadiene.

2. Treat with H2SO4: perhaps each CH2BrI becomes CH2OH. So product 2 has two CH2OH groups on adjacent carbons.

3. Treat with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO: forms a cyclic sulfate between those two carbons. So product 3 is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene with a sulfate bridge between 5 and 6.

4. Heat product 3: the cyclic sulfate breaks, possibly forming a new structure. One possibility is that the ring opens and the two carbons (5 and 6) now have double bonds, leading to a diene that's part of a larger conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps when the sulfate bridge breaks, it forms a new double bond between C5 and C6, making the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. But that's not feasible in a six-membered ring as it would require three conjugated double bonds, which is possible but may lead to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene becomes a bicyclo structure. For example, the ring could break between C5 and C6, and the molecule becomes a bicyclo compound again, but with a different arrangement.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the heating leads to the elimination of the sulfate group and the formation of a triple bond. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene becomes a cyclohexa-1,3-dien-5-yne. But a triple bond in a six-membered ring would be strained, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens into a straight chain with conjugated double bonds. For example, the cyclohexene becomes a hexatriene. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating causes the norbornene part to undergo some change. Wait, but the norbornene was the starting material and didn't seem to react in step 1. So maybe the norbornene remains intact, and the cyclohexadiene part is modified.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a fused bicyclic compound. If the cyclohexene ring breaks and fuses with the norbornene, perhaps forming a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating leads to the loss of the sulfate bridge, and the two adjacent carbons (5 and 6) form a double bond, making the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. But that would require conjugation and may lead to a more stable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens, and the molecule becomes a triene, but I'm not certain.

But regardless of the exact structure, the key is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

Let me think about the possible structures.

If the final product has multiple equivalent environments due to symmetry, the number of distinct hydrogens would be lower. Alternatively, if the structure is asymmetric, the number of distinct hydrogens would be higher.

Assuming that the final structure is a norbornene derivative with several substituents, perhaps the symmetry would lead to fewer distinct hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a norbornadiene or a similar structure with multiple substituents leading to several distinct hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a bicyclo structure with substituents that lead to several distinct H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating leads to the formation of a new norbornene-like structure with more substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a bridge structure with several substituents, leading to each hydrogen in a unique environment.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, the options given are 4, 7, 8, or 10.

If I think about the possible structures, perhaps the final product has a symmetric structure, leading to fewer distinct hydrogens. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, certain hydrogens would be equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has 7 distinct hydrogens. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the final structure has a bridged bicyclic system with several substituents. For example, the norbornene part remains, and the other part forms a bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a norbornene with multiple substituents, each leading to distinct hydrogen environments.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's really hard to count. But perhaps I can think about each step's effect on the number of hydrogens.

Let me think about each step again.

1. Starting with norbornene. The structure has an ether group (tert-butoxy) and a bicyclic system with two double bonds. The norbornene's structure has several equivalent hydrogens, perhaps leading to fewer distinct H's.

After step 1: combining with the dibromomethyl compound, assuming substitution occurs, product 1 would have two CH2I groups on the cyclohexadiene. Each substitution adds I atoms but doesn't change the number of H's on the cyclohexadiene (since CH2Br2 → CH2I, so each CH2Br2 has 2 H and 2 Br, which becomes CH2I with 2 H and 2 I? Wait, no, changing from CH2Br2 (which is CH2 with two Br) to CH2I would require substitution. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, each CH2Br2 group has two Br atoms attached to a CH2. Substituting each Br with I would lead to CH2I2? But that's possible, but CH2I2 is a diiodomethyl group. So each substitution replaces a Br with I, so each CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI after one substitution and CH2I2 after two substitutions. But with two equivalents of NaI, each CH2Br2 group can substitute both Brs, leading to CH2I2 on each of the two positions.

Product 1 would then have two CH2I2 groups on the cyclohexadiene.

Then, step 2: treating with H2SO4. If each CH2I2 group undergoes substitution, perhaps replacing I with OH. So each CH2I2 becomes CH2OH. So product 2 would have two CH2OH groups on adjacent carbons (5 and 6 of cyclohexadiene).

Step 3: treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. This forms a cyclic sulfate between the two adjacent diol groups. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene now has a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6, making a five-membered cyclic sulfate.

Step 4: heating this. The cyclic sulfate ring opens, perhaps eliminating SO2 and forming a new structure. One possibility is that the two adjacent CH2 groups (which were part of the cyclic sulfate) now form a double bond between C5 and C6.

So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would now have a double bond between 5 and 6, making it a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. But that's not possible in a six-membered ring because having three conjugated double bonds would be highly strained.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens, and the structure becomes a straight chain with conjugated double bonds, making a triene. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring remains, but the double bonds shift. For example, the 1,3-diene could become 1,3,5-triene, but again, that's not feasible in a six-membered ring.

Another possibility is that the ring opens, and the molecule becomes a bicyclo structure. For example, the cyclohexene ring could break, and the ends could fuse with the norbornene part, creating a more complex bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclic sulfate upon heating loses the sulfate group as SO2 and forms a triple bond between C5 and C6, making the structure a cyclohexa-1,3-dien-5-yne. But that would be a very strained structure, so maybe it's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the heating leads to the formation of a new ring. For example, the cyclohexene could lose the sulfate bridge and form a bridge between C5 and C1, creating a bicyclo structure.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say. However, the main point is to figure out how many chemically distinct H's are present in the final structure.

Assuming that the final product has multiple equivalent environments, perhaps the number is lower. Let's say that the final structure is a bicyclo compound with several symmetry planes, leading to fewer distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a fully symmetrical molecule, leading to fewer H environments.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me think of the options given: 4,7,8,10.

If the final product is a norbornene derivative with several substituents, perhaps it has 7 distinct H's. I recall that norbornene has 7 distinct H's in its structure. So if the substituents are added in a symmetric way, the number of H's could remain the same or increase slightly.

Wait, norbornene itself has a bridge structure. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene has seven carbons. The structure has two methyl groups (or similar) leading to distinct H environments. Wait, no, the bridge structure leads to several unique H's.

Wait, the norbornene structure without substituents has four equivalent H's on the bridge and three others, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the norbornene has 7 distinct H's, but I'm not confident.

Another approach: think about the options. The options are 4,7,8,10.

If the final product is a norbornadiene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene), which is the structure of the starting material (without the tert-butoxy group), how many distinct H's are present?

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The tert-butoxy is a bulky group, so it probably causes the adjacent H's to be unique. The structure has a bridge, which may lead to several distinct H's.

But after all the reactions, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is removed. Wait, in step 2, when product 1 is treated with H2SO4, perhaps the tert-butoxy ether is cleaved. Because in step 2, the product 2 has two CH2OH groups, but what about the norbornene part?

Wait, perhaps the norbornene's tert-butoxy group is cleaved under acidic conditions. Because tert-butoxy ethers are generally stable under acidic conditions, but maybe under strong acidic conditions, they can be cleaved.

If the ether is cleaved, the norbornene would lose the tert-butoxy group, perhaps forming a carbocation, which could rearrange or form a new structure. Alternatively, it could form a diol if water is present.

Wait, but in step 2, the conditions are aqueous H2SO4, which is strongly acidic. So the tert-butoxy group on the norbornene could undergo cleavage. The cleavage of an ether under acidic conditions typically forms an oxonium ion and then a carbocation, followed by attack by a nucleophile like water.

So the norbornene's oxygen would be protonated, leading to cleavage. The bridgehead carbon (C7) would bear a positive charge, which could be attacked by water, leading to a diol structure.

Wait, but the structure of norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The bridgehead is C7. Cleavage of the tert-butoxy group would lead to a diol structure on the bridgehead, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the bridgehead becomes a carbocation, leading to ring expansion.

But I'm not certain about this. However, if the tert-butoxy group is cleaved, the norbornene would be opened, perhaps forming a different structure.

Assuming that the norbornene part is modified, perhaps the final product is a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene remains intact, and only the cyclohexadiene part is modified.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to count the H's.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each step's effect on the number of H's.

Starting with the norbornene, which has a certain number of H's. Then, the cyclohexadiene has substituents that change their H's.

But perhaps focusing on the options, the correct answer is likely option D)7, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a structure with 7 distinct H's, similar to norbornene.

But I'm really not certain. Given the time I've spent and the information I have, I'll make an educated guess that the final product has 7 distinct hydrogen atoms.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and ending with a final product, 4. The goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Step 1**: The reaction of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide likely results in substitution at the dibromomethyl groups. Each CH₂Br₂ group reacts with iodide, forming CH₂BrI. Thus, product 1 has two CH₂BrI groups on the cyclohexadiene.

2. **Step 2**: Treatment of product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid likely replaces the bromine atoms in the CH₂BrI groups with hydroxyl groups, forming two CH₂OH groups on adjacent carbons (C5 and C6). Product 2 is therefore 5,6-bis(CH₂OH)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

3. **Step 3**: Reaction of product 2 with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO forms a cyclic sulfate ester between the two adjacent CH₂OH groups. Product 3 is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene with a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6.

4. **Step 4**: Heating product 3 at 150°C likely leads to the cleavage of the cyclic sulfate bridge. This results in the formation of a new structure, potentially a conjugated system with a double bond between C5 and C6, or a rearranged bicyclic structure. The exact structure is not fully resolved, but the final product is assumed to retain some symmetry or specific substituents that influence the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

### Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:
- The starting material, norbornene, has a bicyclic structure with several equivalent hydrogens. After the reaction sequence, the final product likely retains some symmetry or substituents that reduce the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.
- Based on the options provided (4, 7, 8, 10), the most plausible answer is **7**, as it aligns with the structural features of the starting material and the transformations described.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me think about what each part does and see if I can figure out the final product.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta... something usually refers to a norbornene structure. Norbornene has that bridge structure—so the molecule looks like a bicyclic compound with two rings.

Then, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is often a good nucleophile in substitution reactions, especially with dibromides. Wait, the compound has two dibromomethyl groups on the cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of those groups has two bromines attached to a methyl. 

When you have such a molecule reacting with a nucleophile like iodide, it's probably undergoing a substitution. Since there are two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound, maybe each methyl group is reacting once? So each methyl would replace Br with iodide? Wait, but wait, it's 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so each of the two methyl groups on carbons 5 and 6 of the cyclohexadiene has two Br atoms.

Wait, but substitution with iodide would require some leaving group. The Br is a good leaving group, so perhaps each methyl loses Br and gains iodide? But wait, I'm confused. Let's think differently: when you have a di-substituted dibromomethyl group, like perhaps each methyl is actually CH2Br2. So each CH2Br2 would react with iodide.

Wait, but how? Each Br is a leaving group. So in a substitution reaction, each Br could get replaced by iodide. So each CH2Br2 would become CH2I2? Hmm, no, because each substitution would be SN2 perhaps. But methyl is a poor candidate for SN2 because it's a primary center but maybe sterically hindered? Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination, but I think the main point is that the dibromomethyl groups react with the iodide nucleophile.

Wait, but the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)... which is a good protecting group for an ether. So the presence of tert-butoxy suggests that the oxygen is not very reactive, but perhaps in the reaction conditions, it's acting as a base? Or maybe it's just a spectator.

So when the dibromomethyl compounds react with sodium iodide, perhaps each of the two methyl groups (on 5 and 6) substitute one Br for iodide. So each gives CH2I. Wait, but each group has two Brs. So each would substitute both Brs, giving CH2I2? That seems a bit odd, but I think that's possible. But wait, if you use two equivalents, perhaps each methyl group (two in total) substitutes once each, leading to two CH2I groups. But wait, the dibromomethyl groups have two Brs each. So if each methyl group donates two equivalents, but we have two such groups, that's four Brs in total. But the problem states two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps each dibromomethyl group in the cyclohexadiene is undergoing a substitution where one Br is replaced by iodide. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI. But that would use one equivalent. Wait, but we have two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound. So perhaps each of the two methyl groups (5 and 6) substitutes both Brs, giving CH2I2 on each. But that would require two equivalents per molecule, but we only have two equivalents in total. Hmm, maybe each molecule of the dibromomethyl compound only reacts once? Or maybe each CH2Br2 group reacts twice, but that would require four equivalents, which we don't have. So perhaps each CH2Br2 only reacts once, replacing one Br with iodide, giving CH2BrI. That would use up two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound (since there are two such groups), each replacing one Br. So each group becomes CH2BrI.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something else here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling. The norbornene has a diene structure, and the cyclohexadiene has another diene. Maybe a Diels-Alder reaction is happening here. Oh wait, but the conditions are with sodium iodide and elevated temperature. Diels-Alder typically doesn't require such conditions. So perhaps it's more of a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the norbornene's double bonds are reacting with the dienophile, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the norbornene's oxygen is acting as a base, abstracting a proton and leading to some kind of ring-opening or addition.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what the product might be. The norbornene has an ether group, and the other molecule has two methyl groups with two Br each. The reaction is with NaI, which is a source of iodide ions. So perhaps each Br in the dibromomethyl groups is displaced by iodide. Each CH2Br2 would become CH2I2. But how many equivalents? Each CH2Br2 has two Brs, so for each, two equivalents of NaI are needed. But the problem states that two equivalents are used in total. Hmm, but the dibromomethyl compound is present in two equivalents.

Wait, perhaps each molecule of the dibromomethyl compound has two Brs, and each Br is replaced by iodide, so each molecule becomes CH2I2. But then, since we have two equivalents of the dibromomethyl compound, each CH2Br2 would have both Brs replaced, leading to two CH2I2 groups. But that would require four equivalents of NaI, which is more than what's available. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the two dibromomethyl groups only replaces one Br, so each becomes CH2BrI. That would use two equivalents of NaI (each Br substitution is one equivalent), and each group uses one. But since there are two groups, that's two equivalents. That makes sense. So the product would have two CH2BrI groups on the cyclohexadiene.

Wait, but then the product would have two CH2BrI groups. But perhaps the cyclohexadiene is being cross-linked or something else. Alternatively, maybe the norbornene is acting as a nucleophile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting norbornene is the diene, and the dibromomethyl cyclohexadiene is the dienophile. But then, under heat, perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction occurs. So the bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (norbornene) would react with the cyclohexadiene as a dienophile. But Diels-Alder usually requires a diene and a dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups. The cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene, but without EWG, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are activating the cyclohexadiene as a dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. The norbornene has a diene, and the other molecule has a dienophile (maybe the dibromomethyl groups are activating something). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing a ring-opening substitution. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group? No, tert-butoxy is usually a poor leaving group. Wait, no, tert-butoxy is O-t-Bu, which is a good nucleophile but a poor leaving group. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene isn't participating in the substitution. Maybe the 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is reacting with the sodium iodide, substituting both Brs with I, but that would require four equivalents, but we only have two. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each of the two dibromomethyl groups in the cyclohexadiene is substituting one Br. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI, using one equivalent each. So with two equivalents, that's two substitutions, each on a different CH2Br2 group. So each of the two CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI.

But then, the product after step 1 would have two CH2BrI groups. Then, what's next?

Step 2: product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid, forming product 2. Hmm, aqueous H2SO4. That's typically a condition for acid-catalyzed reactions, perhaps hydrolysis or elimination.

If product 1 has CH2BrI groups, then in acid, perhaps the Br is a good leaving group. So maybe the Br is leaving, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the iodide is a leaving group. Wait, I is a poor leaving group compared to Br, but maybe under acidic conditions, something else happens.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2BrI groups undergo some reaction. Wait, CH2BrI is a primary alkyl iodide, but in acidic conditions, perhaps it's protonated, making it a better leaving group. But I'm not sure what reaction would occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the H2SO4 is causing some kind of ring-opening of the norbornene structure. The norbornene has a bicyclic structure, perhaps it's opening under acidic conditions. The tert-butoxy group is a bulky protecting group. In acid, maybe the ether is cleaved. Wait, but tert-butoxy is an ether, and under strong acidic conditions, ethers can undergo cleavage. For example, in H2SO4, an ether might break, especially if it's a good leaving group. The tert-butoxy group is O-t-Bu, which is a strong base. Under acidic conditions, it could protonate, but O-t-Bu is a poor leaving group. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the cleavage of the ether isn't the main reaction here. Alternatively, perhaps the Br and I in the CH2BrI groups are being replaced. Alternatively, perhaps the H2SO4 is causing some elimination. Let me think: if we have CH2BrI, perhaps in acid, the Br leaves, and the I stays, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the I leaves, but that's less likely. Hmm, perhaps that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2BrI undergoes hydrolysis in acidic conditions. But under aqueous H2SO4, perhaps the Br is replaced by hydroxide. Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, maybe the OH- is not present. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 has iodine atoms, and in step 2, they're being replaced. Or maybe elimination is happening, forming double bonds.

Wait, maybe product 1 has the two CH2BrI groups. Then, in aqueous H2SO4, perhaps the Br is removed. So perhaps each CH2BrI becomes CH2OH. Because H2SO4 can act as an oxidizing agent or facilitate substitutions.

Wait, but Br is a better leaving group than I. So if we have CH2BrI in acidic conditions, perhaps the Br leaves, and then water attacks, forming an alcohol. So substitution: CH2BrI → CH2OH. That would make sense. So each CH2BrI would become CH2OH, so two OH groups are added.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the Br is replaced by hydroxide. So each CH2BrI would become CH2I, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe both Br and I are leaving, but that's unlikely. Hmm, perhaps I should move forward and see what the next steps are.

Step 3: product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, forming product 3. SO3 in DMSO with pyridine is a typical condition for sulfonation or sulfonamide formation. Alternatively, I think it's used for the synthesis of sulfonic acids, perhaps through the diazonium salt reaction, but I'm not quite recalling. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfonation of an aromatic ring, but product 2 may not have an aromatic ring.

Wait, product 2 would have the cyclohexadiene with CH2OH groups. Maybe after step 2, the CH2BrI groups became CH2OH. So product 2 has two CH2OH groups on the cyclohexadiene.

So when product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO, what happens? SO3 is a sulfonating agent. So perhaps the CH2OH groups are being converted into something else. Alternatively, maybe the diol groups are reacting.

Wait, another thought: when a diol is treated with SO3 and pyridine, it can form a cyclic sulfate ester. Like, for example, vicinal diols (1,2-diols) can form cyclic sulfate esters when treated with SO3 and a base. But the diol here is on adjacent carbons? Let me think, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has methyl groups on 5 and 6. So in product 2, the groups are on 5 and 6 as CH2OH. Are they adjacent? Let me visualize the structure.

Cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a six-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions. So the substituents are at 5 and 6. Wait, in a six-membered ring, positions 5 and 6 are adjacent. So the two CH2OH groups are on adjacent carbons. So that would be a 5,6-bis(CH2OH)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a 1,3-diene with two adjacent CH2OH groups.

So under treatment with SO3 and pyridine, which is a typical condition for forming cyclic sulfates, perhaps the two vicinal diol groups form a cyclic sulfate. So the two CH2OH groups would lose their hydroxyls and form a sulfate bridge between the two adjacent carbons. So product 3 would be a cyclohexa-1,3-diene with a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the structure. Vicinal diols (1,2-diols) can form cyclic sulfates, so if the two hydroxyls are on adjacent carbons, they can form a five-membered ring when the sulfate is formed. So the product would have a cyclic sulfate ester between C5 and C6.

So after step 3, product 3 is a cyclohexene ring with a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6, and the 1,3-diene remains.

Then, step 4: product 3 is heated at 150°C, forming the final product 4. Heating cyclic sulfates usually leads to cleavage. The ring opens, and depending on the conditions, it can form different products. For example, in acidic conditions, the sulfate ring might hydrolyze to form diols, but since this is just heat, perhaps it's a different pathway.

Wait, but wait: the sulfate bridge is between C5 and C6, which are adjacent. Heating would cause the ring to break. When cyclic sulfates are heated, especially in the presence of something like a base, they can open to form a sulfate ester or possibly eliminate. Alternatively, in the absence of water, perhaps an elimination occurs.

Wait, another thought: when a cyclic sulfate is heated, it can undergo ring-opening to form a sulfate ester. For example, the ring opens to form a sulfate group on each of the two adjacent carbons. But that would require breaking the sulfate bridge.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclic sulfate, upon heating, undergoes elimination to form a triple bond or a longer double bond.

Wait, let me think again. The starting material after step 3 is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene with a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6. When heated, the bridge might break, leading to the formation of a longer conjugated diene or a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new double bond. Let me think: the structure has the cyclohexene ring with a 1,3-diene. The sulfate bridge is between C5 and C6. When the bridge breaks, perhaps the two adjacent CH2 groups (now as sulfate) lose the sulfate and form a new double bond.

Wait, perhaps the ring opens, and a new double bond forms between C5 and C6, converting the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene? Or maybe the ring becomes a larger conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond. For example, if the sulfate bridge is between C5 and C6, heating could cause the loss of SO2 and the formation of a triple bond between C5 and C6. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would then have a triple bond at 5,6, making it a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene? No, that's not possible because triple bonds can't be conjugated with double bonds in a ring like that.

Wait, maybe the ring opens, and the structure becomes a larger conjugated diene. Alternatively, maybe the ring becomes a bicyclic structure again but with a different arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens to form a dienophile. Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let's try to approach it differently.

Let me think about the overall process. The initial reaction involves substitution to add iodide groups, then acid treatment, then sulfonation, then heating. The final product's hydrogen count is what's being asked.

Let me try to outline each step:

1. Reaction of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI.

Assuming that each dibromomethyl group (CH2Br2) substitutes one Br for I, using one equivalent each. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI. But with two equivalents of NaI, perhaps each CH2Br2 group substitutes both Brs, making CH2I2. But that would require 4 equivalents of NaI, so perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the diene is undergoing a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The norbornene's diene reacts with the dibromomethyl dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, forming a six-membered ring with substituents. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing an addition reaction. The dienophile (if any) would add across the diene. But without a proper dienophile, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the norbornene's oxygen attacks the dibromomethyl group. But the oxygen is part of a bulky tert-butoxy group, making it a poor nucleophile.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene isn't reacting, and the substitution is happening on the dibromomethyl groups. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2 using two equivalents of NaI. But that would require four equivalents, but the problem says two. So perhaps each CH2Br2 group substitutes one Br, making two CH2BrI groups. So product 1 would have two CH2BrI groups on the cyclohexadiene.

Let me move forward.

Step 2: treating with H2SO4 aqueous. So each CH2BrI in product 1 would have the Br replaced by OH, forming CH2OH. So product 2 is 5,6-bis(CH2OH)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

Step 3: treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. This is a common method for sulfonating diols, especially vicinal diols, to form cyclic sulfates. Since the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons (5 and 6), the product 3 would have a cyclic sulfate ester between C5 and C6. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene now has a bridge between C5 and C6 as a sulfate group.

Step 4: heating product 3 at 150°C. Heating cyclic sulfates can lead to ring cleavage. One possibility is that the ring opens, and the sulfate group is eliminated. For example, the sulfate bridge breaks, releasing SO2 and forming a new double bond between C5 and C6. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would become a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene? But that's not possible because the ring would become a seven-membered ring, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the ring might open into a larger conjugated diene.

Wait, another thought: when the cyclic sulfate is heated, it might undergo elimination, releasing SO2 and forming a triple bond between C5 and C6. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have a triple bond at 5,6, making it a cyclohexa-1,3,5-trien-5-yne? That seems unlikely in a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens and the structure becomes a larger fused ring. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the heating leads to the formation of a more stable structure, like a fused ring. Alternatively, maybe the ring opens and forms a diene that's part of a larger ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclic sulfate upon heating undergoes ring-opening to form a diol again, but that doesn't make sense since we started with a diol and formed a sulfate.

Wait, perhaps the cyclic sulfate is not stable upon heating and breaks down. Let me think about the structure again: cyclohexa-1,3-diene with a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6. Heating would break that bridge, but how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the heating causes the elimination of the sulfate group, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C5 and C6. The mechanism would involve the loss of SO2 and the formation of a triple bond. So the product 4 would have a triple bond between C5 and C6, making it a cyclohexa-1,3,5-trien-5-yne, but that's not possible due to ring strain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens and the structure becomes a hexatriene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the heating leads to the loss of the sulfate group and the formation of a new double bond. For example, breaking the bridge between C5 and C6 and forming a double bond between C5 and C6, making the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. But cyclohexene can't have three double bonds because that would require too many conjugated double bonds in a six-membered ring.

Wait, another possibility: the ring opens, and the structure becomes a bicyclic compound. For example, the cyclohexene ring could become a seven-membered ring with a bridge, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating causes the cyclohexene ring to lose the sulfate bridge and form a more stable structure, such as a diene that's part of a larger conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens to form a 1,3-diene and a new substituent. For example, the cyclohexene could become a 1,3,5-triene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what the final product might look like after each step.

After step 4, product 4 is the result of heating product 3 (the cyclic sulfate) at 150°C. Let me think about what happens when a cyclic sulfate is heated. One possibility is that the ring opens, and the two adjacent oxygens (from the sulfate) are replaced by hydroxyl groups, but that would just bring us back to product 2, which doesn't make sense as a final step.

Alternatively, the ring might break to form a larger ring with a double bond. For example, if the cyclohexene ring breaks at C5 and C6, where the sulfate bridge was, and then the chain forms a new ring, perhaps a bicyclic structure.

Wait, another possibility: the cyclohexene ring could undergo ring expansion upon heating, incorporating the sulfate bridge into a larger ring. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating leads to the loss of the sulfate group as SO2 and the formation of a new double bond. So the ring would have an additional double bond, making it more conjugated.

Wait, perhaps the final structure is a norbornene derivative. Wait, the starting material was a norbornene. Maybe the product after all steps is a more complex norbornene derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating leads to the formation of a new ring, such as a bicyclo structure. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

But since the question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4, perhaps I can think about the structure after each step and count the hydrogens.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Combine norbornene with 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexadiene and NaI. Assuming substitution occurs, each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I. So each of the two groups substitutes once, leading to CH2I and CH2Br.

Wait, no, that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br2 group is converted to CH2I, so each has one Br and one I. So product 1 has two CH2BrI groups on the cyclohexadiene.

2. Treat with H2SO4: perhaps each CH2BrI becomes CH2OH. So product 2 has two CH2OH groups on adjacent carbons.

3. Treat with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO: forms a cyclic sulfate between those two carbons. So product 3 is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene with a sulfate bridge between 5 and 6.

4. Heat product 3: the cyclic sulfate breaks, possibly forming a new structure. One possibility is that the ring opens and the two carbons (5 and 6) now have double bonds, leading to a diene that's part of a larger conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps when the sulfate bridge breaks, it forms a new double bond between C5 and C6, making the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. But that's not feasible in a six-membered ring as it would require three conjugated double bonds, which is possible but may lead to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene becomes a bicyclo structure. For example, the ring could break between C5 and C6, and the molecule becomes a bicyclo compound again, but with a different arrangement.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the heating leads to the elimination of the sulfate group and the formation of a triple bond. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene becomes a cyclohexa-1,3-dien-5-yne. But a triple bond in a six-membered ring would be strained, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens into a straight chain with conjugated double bonds. For example, the cyclohexene becomes a hexatriene. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating causes the norbornene part to undergo some change. Wait, but the norbornene was the starting material and didn't seem to react in step 1. So maybe the norbornene remains intact, and the cyclohexadiene part is modified.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a fused bicyclic compound. If the cyclohexene ring breaks and fuses with the norbornene, perhaps forming a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating leads to the loss of the sulfate bridge, and the two adjacent carbons (5 and 6) form a double bond, making the cyclohexa-1,3-diene into a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. But that would require conjugation and may lead to a more stable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens, and the molecule becomes a triene, but I'm not certain.

But regardless of the exact structure, the key is to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

Let me think about the possible structures.

If the final product has multiple equivalent environments due to symmetry, the number of distinct hydrogens would be lower. Alternatively, if the structure is asymmetric, the number of distinct hydrogens would be higher.

Assuming that the final structure is a norbornene derivative with several substituents, perhaps the symmetry would lead to fewer distinct hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a norbornadiene or a similar structure with multiple substituents leading to several distinct hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a bicyclo structure with substituents that lead to several distinct H environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating leads to the formation of a new norbornene-like structure with more substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a bridge structure with several substituents, leading to each hydrogen in a unique environment.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, the options given are 4, 7, 8, or 10.

If I think about the possible structures, perhaps the final product has a symmetric structure, leading to fewer distinct hydrogens. For example, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, certain hydrogens would be equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has 7 distinct hydrogens. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the final structure has a bridged bicyclic system with several substituents. For example, the norbornene part remains, and the other part forms a bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a norbornene with multiple substituents, each leading to distinct hydrogen environments.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's really hard to count. But perhaps I can think about each step's effect on the number of hydrogens.

Let me think about each step again.

1. Starting with norbornene. The structure has an ether group (tert-butoxy) and a bicyclic system with two double bonds. The norbornene's structure has several equivalent hydrogens, perhaps leading to fewer distinct H's.

After step 1: combining with the dibromomethyl compound, assuming substitution occurs, product 1 would have two CH2I groups on the cyclohexadiene. Each substitution adds I atoms but doesn't change the number of H's on the cyclohexadiene (since CH2Br2 → CH2I, so each CH2Br2 has 2 H and 2 Br, which becomes CH2I with 2 H and 2 I? Wait, no, changing from CH2Br2 (which is CH2 with two Br) to CH2I would require substitution. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, each CH2Br2 group has two Br atoms attached to a CH2. Substituting each Br with I would lead to CH2I2? But that's possible, but CH2I2 is a diiodomethyl group. So each substitution replaces a Br with I, so each CH2Br2 becomes CH2BrI after one substitution and CH2I2 after two substitutions. But with two equivalents of NaI, each CH2Br2 group can substitute both Brs, leading to CH2I2 on each of the two positions.

Product 1 would then have two CH2I2 groups on the cyclohexadiene.

Then, step 2: treating with H2SO4. If each CH2I2 group undergoes substitution, perhaps replacing I with OH. So each CH2I2 becomes CH2OH. So product 2 would have two CH2OH groups on adjacent carbons (5 and 6 of cyclohexadiene).

Step 3: treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. This forms a cyclic sulfate between the two adjacent diol groups. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene now has a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6, making a five-membered cyclic sulfate.

Step 4: heating this. The cyclic sulfate ring opens, perhaps eliminating SO2 and forming a new structure. One possibility is that the two adjacent CH2 groups (which were part of the cyclic sulfate) now form a double bond between C5 and C6.

So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene would now have a double bond between 5 and 6, making it a cyclohexa-1,3,5-triene. But that's not possible in a six-membered ring because having three conjugated double bonds would be highly strained.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring opens, and the structure becomes a straight chain with conjugated double bonds, making a triene. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring remains, but the double bonds shift. For example, the 1,3-diene could become 1,3,5-triene, but again, that's not feasible in a six-membered ring.

Another possibility is that the ring opens, and the molecule becomes a bicyclo structure. For example, the cyclohexene ring could break, and the ends could fuse with the norbornene part, creating a more complex bicyclic structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclic sulfate upon heating loses the sulfate group as SO2 and forms a triple bond between C5 and C6, making the structure a cyclohexa-1,3-dien-5-yne. But that would be a very strained structure, so maybe it's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the heating leads to the formation of a new ring. For example, the cyclohexene could lose the sulfate bridge and form a bridge between C5 and C1, creating a bicyclo structure.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say. However, the main point is to figure out how many chemically distinct H's are present in the final structure.

Assuming that the final product has multiple equivalent environments, perhaps the number is lower. Let's say that the final structure is a bicyclo compound with several symmetry planes, leading to fewer distinct H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a fully symmetrical molecule, leading to fewer H environments.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me think of the options given: 4,7,8,10.

If the final product is a norbornene derivative with several substituents, perhaps it has 7 distinct H's. I recall that norbornene has 7 distinct H's in its structure. So if the substituents are added in a symmetric way, the number of H's could remain the same or increase slightly.

Wait, norbornene itself has a bridge structure. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene has seven carbons. The structure has two methyl groups (or similar) leading to distinct H environments. Wait, no, the bridge structure leads to several unique H's.

Wait, the norbornene structure without substituents has four equivalent H's on the bridge and three others, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the norbornene has 7 distinct H's, but I'm not confident.

Another approach: think about the options. The options are 4,7,8,10.

If the final product is a norbornadiene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene), which is the structure of the starting material (without the tert-butoxy group), how many distinct H's are present?

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The tert-butoxy is a bulky group, so it probably causes the adjacent H's to be unique. The structure has a bridge, which may lead to several distinct H's.

But after all the reactions, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is removed. Wait, in step 2, when product 1 is treated with H2SO4, perhaps the tert-butoxy ether is cleaved. Because in step 2, the product 2 has two CH2OH groups, but what about the norbornene part?

Wait, perhaps the norbornene's tert-butoxy group is cleaved under acidic conditions. Because tert-butoxy ethers are generally stable under acidic conditions, but maybe under strong acidic conditions, they can be cleaved.

If the ether is cleaved, the norbornene would lose the tert-butoxy group, perhaps forming a carbocation, which could rearrange or form a new structure. Alternatively, it could form a diol if water is present.

Wait, but in step 2, the conditions are aqueous H2SO4, which is strongly acidic. So the tert-butoxy group on the norbornene could undergo cleavage. The cleavage of an ether under acidic conditions typically forms an oxonium ion and then a carbocation, followed by attack by a nucleophile like water.

So the norbornene's oxygen would be protonated, leading to cleavage. The bridgehead carbon (C7) would bear a positive charge, which could be attacked by water, leading to a diol structure.

Wait, but the structure of norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The bridgehead is C7. Cleavage of the tert-butoxy group would lead to a diol structure on the bridgehead, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the bridgehead becomes a carbocation, leading to ring expansion.

But I'm not certain about this. However, if the tert-butoxy group is cleaved, the norbornene would be opened, perhaps forming a different structure.

Assuming that the norbornene part is modified, perhaps the final product is a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene remains intact, and only the cyclohexadiene part is modified.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to count the H's.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each step's effect on the number of H's.

Starting with the norbornene, which has a certain number of H's. Then, the cyclohexadiene has substituents that change their H's.

But perhaps focusing on the options, the correct answer is likely option D)7, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has a structure with 7 distinct H's, similar to norbornene.

But I'm really not certain. Given the time I've spent and the information I have, I'll make an educated guess that the final product has 7 distinct hydrogen atoms.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene and ending with a final product, 4. The goal is to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Step 1**: The reaction of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide likely results in substitution at the dibromomethyl groups. Each CH₂Br₂ group reacts with iodide, forming CH₂BrI. Thus, product 1 has two CH₂BrI groups on the cyclohexadiene.

2. **Step 2**: Treatment of product 1 with aqueous sulfuric acid likely replaces the bromine atoms in the CH₂BrI groups with hydroxyl groups, forming two CH₂OH groups on adjacent carbons (C5 and C6). Product 2 is therefore 5,6-bis(CH₂OH)cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

3. **Step 3**: Reaction of product 2 with SO₃ and pyridine in DMSO forms a cyclic sulfate ester between the two adjacent CH₂OH groups. Product 3 is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene with a sulfate bridge between C5 and C6.

4. **Step 4**: Heating product 3 at 150°C likely leads to the cleavage of the cyclic sulfate bridge. This results in the formation of a new structure, potentially a conjugated system with a double bond between C5 and C6, or a rearranged bicyclic structure. The exact structure is not fully resolved, but the final product is assumed to retain some symmetry or specific substituents that influence the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

### Counting Chemically Distinct Hydrogen Atoms:
- The starting material, norbornene, has a bicyclic structure with several equivalent hydrogens. After the reaction sequence, the final product likely retains some symmetry or substituents that reduce the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.
- Based on the options provided (4, 7, 8, 10), the most plausible answer is **7**, as it aligns with the structural features of the starting material and the transformations described.
