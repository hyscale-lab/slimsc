Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. So, it's mounted on an 8m telescope. The question is about the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) achieved per binned pixel during a one-hour exposure. The threshold is at least 10 S/N.

The question lists six stars (a to f) and I need to figure out how many of them meet the detectability criteria. Let's break down each star.

Starting with the basics: the S/N ratio depends on factors like the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the noise sources (like background noise or photon noise).

I think the key here is the apparent magnitude of each star because that's what determines how much light we get, which directly affects S/N.

So, for each star, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude. The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is:

m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d / 10 pc)

Where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Because the zero point is when d=10 pc, m = M. So yes, correct.

Now, the V magnitude (apparent) determines how bright the star appears from Earth. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star.

ESPRESSO's performance depends on the brightness of the star. From what I recall, ESPRESSO can achieve high S/N ratios for bright stars because they provide more photons. But for very faint stars, the S/N might drop below the threshold.

I think I need to find the apparent magnitude of each star and then see if ESPRESSO can reach a S/N of 10 per binned pixel in an hour.

Wait, but I don't know the exact S/N curve of ESPRESSO. Hmm. So perhaps I should look for any resources or known data on ESPRESSO's S/N performance as a function of magnitude.

Wait, I remember that for a typical spectrograph, the S/N improves with the square root of the exposure time, and the number of photons (which depends on the star's brightness). So for a given star, the S/N scales with sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) / sqrt(N_pix), where m0 is the magnitude where the S/N is 1 per pixel.

Wait, maybe I can find what is the typical S/N per pixel for a given apparent magnitude with ESPRESSO.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is based on the distance: only stars within a certain distance are bright enough.

Looking at the options:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star, maybe around magnitude 0 or so. So that's definitely bright, S/N should be way above 10.

b) Polaris: Polaris is a bright star, but I think it's more like around 2nd magnitude. Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Wait, Canopus is about magnitude -0.7, so brighter than Polaris. Polaris is around magnitude 2? Or maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think: Canopus is the brightest star in the southern sky, very bright. Polaris is the North Star, magnitude about 2.0. So yes, that's correct. So Polaris is also bright enough.

c) Star with V=15 mag at 10 pc. Wait, the absolute magnitude is 15. So the apparent magnitude m = M + 5 log10(d/10) = 15 + 5 log10(10/10) = 15 + 5 * 0 = 15. So m=15. That's a very faint star.

d) Same M=15, but d=200 pc. So m = 15 + 5 log10(200/10) = 15 + 5 log10(20) = 15 + 5*(1.3010) ≈ 15 + 6.505 ≈ 21.505. So m≈21.5. That's way too faint.

e) M=15, d=5 pc. m = 15 +5 log10(5/10) = 15 +5 log10(0.5) = 15 +5*(-0.3010) ≈15 -1.505=13.495. So m≈13.5. Hmm, that's still quite faint.

f) M=15, d=50 pc. m=15 +5 log10(50/10)=15 +5 log10(5)=15 +5*(0.69897)=15 +3.495≈18.495. So m≈18.5.

Wait, but all of these (c, d, e, f) have m much higher than 0. So for the stars a and b, the m is lower (brighter), so they are more detectable.

But wait, I need to determine for each star whether the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel in 1 hour.

So the question now is: which of these stars (a to f) would have an apparent magnitude such that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N ≥10 per binned pixel in 1 hour.

I think I should figure out the faintest apparent magnitude (brightest star) that ESPRESSO can detect with S/N 10.

I don't have the exact data, but I can think about what I know. ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, so it's designed for bright stars, but maybe it can go a bit fainter.

Wait, I remember that ESPRESSO's design allows it to reach S/N ratios of tens for very bright stars, but for stars around m ~ 20, perhaps it's harder.

Alternatively, considering exposure time, the formula for S/N is proportional to sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) ), where m0 is the zero point.

But I don't know the exact m0 or the exposure time.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the limiting magnitude. If I can figure out what is the faintest star that ESPRESSO can reach S/N 10 in 1 hour, then I can count how many stars are brighter than that.

I found a resource (I think from ESO) that ESPRESSO is optimized for stars with V magnitudes around 8-10, but can go fainter. For example, for a 1-hour exposure, maybe it can reach down to about m=15 or so? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the S/N for each star.

Let's make an assumption: the S/N per binned pixel is given by S/N = (number of photons) / sqrt(number of photons + background photons).

Assuming that the background is negligible, the S/N is roughly sqrt(N_photons) per pixel.

The number of photons depends on the star's flux.

The flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)), where m0 is the reference magnitude. Let's say m0 is like 0 for simplicity.

The exposure time is 1 hour, which is 3600 seconds.

The collecting area of the VLT is (8m)^2 = 64 m². Wait, no, the effective area is π*(D/2)^2, where D is in meters. So 8m is 800 cm. The area A = π*(800/2)^2 = π*(400)^2 = 502655 cm², which is about 5.02655 m².

Wait, but each telescope has four mirrors, but wait, each VLT unit is 8.2m in diameter. Oh, right, the VLT has four 8.2m telescopes. But when using the VLT as a single telescope (like for the ESPRESSO spectrograph), it's using a single 8m mirror. Wait, no, ESPRESSO is mounted on a single VLT unit, so it's using one 8.2m mirror. So the effective area is A = π*(8.2/2)^2 = π*(4.1)^2 ≈ 52.8 m².

Wait, no, wait. The formula is A = π*(D/2)^2, where D is in meters. So D=8.2m → A= π*(4.1)^2 ≈ 52.8 m².

The number of photons collected depends on the flux from the star, the exposure time, and the collecting area. The flux F from a star with apparent magnitude m is F = F0 * 10^(-0.4*m), where F0 is the flux from a star of m=0 (about 3.64e-9 erg/s/cm²/Å, but perhaps I should think in terms of photons).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the S/N. The formula for S/N per pixel is:

S/N = (A * T * F * QE * eff) / sqrt(2 * A * T * F * QE * eff + R * N_bkg)

But I don't have exact values for quantum efficiency (QE), efficiency (eff), and read noise (R), or background photons (N_bkg). So maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an approximate relationship. I'll try to find the formula for S/N as a function of magnitude, given other parameters.

Another approach: the ESPRESSO spectrograph has a known capability. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed to achieve a certain S/N ratio for stars of a certain magnitude in a given exposure time. For example, perhaps it can reach S/N=100 per pixel for stars around V=10 in 1 hour. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the ESPRESSO website says something about its performance. Let me think; I can't actually access the link, but I'll recall. ESPRESSO can reach high S/N ratios for bright stars. For example, for a V=8 star, it can get S/N ~ 200 per pixel in 1 minute. So for V=15, which is 7 magnitudes fainter, that's 10^(-0.4*7) ≈ 10^-2.8 ≈ 0.0016 of the flux. So in 1 hour (which is 60 times longer than a minute), the S/N would be sqrt(60 * 0.0016) times the original. Wait, no, the S/N scales as sqrt(t) and sqrt(flux). Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the S/N ratio in a spectrograph:

S/N = (A * T * F * QE * ε) / sqrt(2 * A * T * F * QE * ε + R * N_bkg)

Where:
- A: telescope area
- T: exposure time
- F: flux from star (photons/s/cm²/Å)
- QE: quantum efficiency
- ε: efficiency of the spectrograph
- R: read noise per pixel (electrons)
- N_bkg: background photons per pixel per second

But without knowing these values, it's hard to compute. Maybe I can make some assumptions.

Assume:
- F0 (flux for m=0) is about 1 photon/s/cm²/Å (this is a rough estimate; actual value is lower since V-band photons are longer wavelength, but this is for approximation).
- QE ≈ 10% (0.1)
- ε ≈ 50% (0.5) (assuming)
- R ≈ 10 electrons per pixel (read noise)
- N_bkg is negligible (assuming dark sky, or perhaps there's background, but without data, this is tricky)

But perhaps I can proceed with this.

The flux F from a star of magnitude m is F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 * m)

F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 m)

So for m=0, F=F0.

Number of photons per second per cm² per Å: F = F0 * 1e-0.4m.

The number of photons per second per m² per Å is F * 1e4 cm²/m² = F * 1e4.

So for the telescope area A (m²), the photons per second per Å is A * F * 1e4.

Then, considering QE and efficiency:

Photons collected per second per Å: A * F * 1e4 * QE * ε.

Exposure time T in seconds: 3600 s.

Total photons per Å: A * F *1e4 * QE * ε * T.

S/N per Å is sqrt(total_photons) / sqrt( R + total_photons )

Assuming background is negligible, S/N ≈ sqrt(total_photons) / R.

Wait, no, wait. The noise is sqrt(total_photons + R), but if R << total_photons, noise ≈ sqrt(total_photons).

But without knowing R, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the background is negligible, so noise is just sqrt(total_photons).

Wait, but the question says S/N per binned pixel. So perhaps the pixel size is important. The spectrograph's resolving power affects the number of pixels. Wait, ESPRESSO has a resolving power R ≈ 140,000. But that's for resolving lines. The pixel size in wavelength space would be about λ/R. For V-band (say, 500 nm), the pixel size is about 500e-9 m / 140,000 ≈ 3.57e-12 m or 3.57e-9 m in meters. Wait, but in terms of pixels per resolution element, the number of pixels per resolution element is about 3 (I think). So the number of binned pixels depends on the spectrograph's design. Hmm, maybe I'm getting into too much detail here.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this question, each binned pixel corresponds to a certain amount of wavelength coverage, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says 'per binned pixel'. So if the spectrograph bins pixels together, the S/N per bin would increase.

But without knowing how many pixels are being binned, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the binned pixel is a single spectrograph pixel after some binning.

Wait, perhaps another approach: find the limiting magnitude for which S/N=10 is achieved.

Suppose the S/N is given by:

S/N = (A * T * F * QE * ε) / sqrt(A * T * F * QE * ε + R) )

Assuming R is small, S/N ≈ (A * T * F * QE * ε) / sqrt(A * T * F * QE * ε).

Which simplifies to sqrt(A * T * F * QE * ε) / 1.

So S/N = sqrt( A T F QE ε )

But without knowing these constants, perhaps we can find the ratio between different stars.

Alternatively, since all the stars have the same M and different distances, we can compare their apparent magnitudes and see which are bright enough.

Wait, but stars a and b are real stars, so their apparent magnitudes are known. For example:

Canopus (a): It's a very bright star, about 0.7 magnitudes, so m ≈ -0.7.

Polaris (b): It's a variable star, typically around magnitude 2.0, but sometimes brighter or dimmer. Let's say m ≈ 2.0.

The other stars (c to f) are made-up stars with M=15 mag and varying distances.

So for stars a and b, their apparent magnitudes are much lower (brighter) than the others. So their S/N would be higher.

Now, the question is, which of these have m such that, when observed with ESPRESSO for 1 hour, the S/N is ≥10 per binned pixel.

I think that for extremely bright stars like Canopus (m ~ -1), the S/N would be way higher than 10. Similarly, Polaris (m ~2) would also have high S/N.

But what about the other stars (c, e, f). Let's see.

c) m=15 → which is very faint.

e) m=13.5 → faint but possibly detectable.

f) m=18.5 → quite faint.

Wait, but without knowing the exact S/N curve, I'm not sure. But perhaps ESPRESSO can only reach a certain faintness. Let me think about what the ESPRESSO design allows.

Wait, I found a source (though I can't access it now) that ESPRESSO can reach S/N ~ 200 per pixel for a V=8 star in 1 minute. Wait, that's impressive. But for a V=15 star, which is 7 magnitudes dimmer, which is 10^(-2.8) ≈ 0.0016 times the flux.

Exposure time is 1 hour, which is 60 times longer. So the flux is 0.0016 * 60 = 0.096 times the flux of V=8.

So the S/N would be sqrt(0.096) times the initial S/N if all else scales. Wait, no, because for a star that's dimmer, the number of photons is lower. The initial calculation for V=8: 200 S/N per pixel in 1 minute. So in 60 minutes, it would be 200 * sqrt(60) ≈ 200 * 7.75 ≈ 1550 S/N.

But that's for a V=8 star. For V=15, which is 7 magnitudes fainter, the flux is (10^(-0.4 * 7)) ≈ 0.0016 times. So the number of photons would be 0.0016 * (exposure time factor).

Wait, but the exposure time is 60 times longer. So for V=15:

S/N = 1550 * sqrt(0.0016) = 1550 * 0.04 = 62.

Wait, that seems high, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no. Let's think differently. The S/N scales as sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 m). Because for each magnitude, the flux changes by a factor of 10^(-0.4) per magnitude.

Wait, the formula would be S/N = S0 * sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 (m - m0)) )

Where m0 is the reference magnitude. Suppose m0 is 8, and S0 is 200 per pixel for m=8 and t=1 minute. Now, for m=15 and t=60 minutes:

S/N = 200 * sqrt(60) * 10^(-0.2*(15-8)) ) = 200 * 7.746 * 10^(-2.2) ≈ 200 *7.746 * 0.0631 ≈ 200 * 0.490 ≈ 98.

So S/N would be about 98 per pixel, which is way above 10. So for a V=15 star, that's possible.

Wait, but that's assuming the same setup as the initial example. But wait, in reality, for lower S/N, maybe the noise sources (like background or read noise) become more significant. So for fainter stars, the photon noise dominates, but perhaps for this calculation, the S/N is high enough.

But wait, in this example, the S/N is 98 per pixel for a V=15 star, which is way above 10. So that suggests that even the fainter stars (like c, e, f) would be detectable.

Wait, but the problem is that for a star with m=15, the S/N is 98, which is way above 10. Hmm, so perhaps all stars except the very faintest (like d with m=21.5) are detectable.

Wait, but wait, let me check for star d: m=21.5.

Using same formula:

S/N = 200 * sqrt(60) * 10^(-0.2*(21.5 -8)) ) 

= 200 *7.746 * 10^(-0.2 * 13.5) 

= 200 *7.746 * 10^(-2.7) 

= 200*7.746*0.002 ≈ 200 *7.746 *0.002 → 200*0.0155≈3.1.

So S/N≈3.1 <10. So star d is not detectable.

So for each star:

a) Canopus, m≈-0.7 → S/N way above 10.

b) Polaris, m≈2 → S/N also way above 10.

c) m=15 → S/N ~98 → detectable.

d) m=21.5 → S/N ~3 → not detectable.

e) m=13.5 → let's compute:

S/N = 200 * sqrt(60) * 10^(-0.2*(13.5-8)) = 200*7.746 * 10^(-1.3) → 200 * 7.746 * 0.0501 ≈ 200 * 0.388 → 77.6 → S/N ~78 → detectable.

f) m=18.5 → compute:

S/N = 200 *7.746 * 10^(-0.2*(18.5 -8)) = 200 *7.746 *10^(-1.05) → 200 *7.746 * ~0.0891 ≈ 200 * 0.690 → ~138 → S/N ~138 → detectable.

So all except d would be detectable. So how many stars are detectable?

Looking at each option:

a: yes

b: yes

c: yes

d: no

e: yes

f: yes

So that's a total of 5 detectable stars.

Wait, wait. So a, b, c, e, f → 5 stars.

But let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the initial assumption was that for V=8, in 1 minute, S/N=200. But the question uses 1 hour. So the calculation for V=8 would be 200 * sqrt(60) ≈ 200*7.75 ≈1550 per pixel.

But then for V=15, the formula gives 1550 * 10^(-0.2*(15-8)) ) = 1550 * 10^(-2.2) ≈ 1550 * 0.0631 ≈98 per pixel. So yes, that's correct.

So for each star:

a: m=-0.7 → way above 10.

b: m=2 → way above.

c: m=15 → S/N=98 → yes.

d: m=21.5 → S/N=3 → no.

e: m=13.5 → S/N=78 → yes.

f: m=18.5 → S/N=138 → yes.

So that's 5 stars (a, b, c, e, f) detectable.

Wait, but the options are:

Options:

A) 2

B) 5

C)4

D)3

So the correct answer would be option B, which is 5.

But wait, I thought the initial example for m=8 is 200 per pixel in 1 minute. But wait, the question specifies that each binned pixel must have S/N≥10. So perhaps the calculation is per binned pixel, which might involve more binning, reducing the S/N.

Wait, if the spectrograph bins multiple pixels together, the per-pixel S/N increases, but the number of pixels reduces. But in this case, the question says "per binned pixel", which suggests that each binned pixel is treated as a single entity. So perhaps the calculation I did earlier is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the binned pixel refers to the fact that ESPRESSO might sum multiple pixels to achieve higher S/N, but the per-binned-pixel S/N is still sufficient.

But according to my earlier calculation, stars c, e, f, a, and b are detectable. So that's 5 stars.

Looking back at the options, option B is 5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes, we assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude of the star, which is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10)
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux from the star, which decreases as \( 10^{-0.4 \cdot (m - m_0)} \), where \( m_0 \) is a reference magnitude.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Canopus (a):** Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \). This makes it extremely detectable, as the S/N ratio will be far above 10.

2. **Polaris (b):** Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \). It is also detectable, as the S/N ratio will exceed 10.

3. **Star c (M = 15, \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)):**  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15
   \]  
   For \( m = 15 \), the S/N ratio is calculated to be approximately 98 per binned pixel, which is detectable.

4. **Star d (M = 15, \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \)):**  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 \cdot 1.301 \approx 21.5
   \]  
   For \( m = 21.5 \), the S/N ratio is approximately 3 per binned pixel, which is below the detectability threshold.

5. **Star e (M = 15, \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)):**  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 15 - 1.505 \approx 13.5
   \]  
   For \( m = 13.5 \), the S/N ratio is approximately 78 per binned pixel, which is detectable.

6. **Star f (M = 15, \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \)):**  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 \cdot 0.699 \approx 18.5
   \]  
   For \( m = 18.5 \), the S/N ratio is approximately 138 per binned pixel, which is detectable.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are Canopus (a), Polaris (b), Star c (m = 15), Star e (m = 13.5), and Star f (m = 18.5). Star d (m = 21.5) is not detectable. Therefore, a total of **5 stars** meet the detectability criteria.

**Answer: B**
