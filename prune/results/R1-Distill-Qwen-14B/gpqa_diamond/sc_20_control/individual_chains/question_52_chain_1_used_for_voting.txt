Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

Alright, the star's normal effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K when there are no spots. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere? Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of the star where the light is emitted, so its temperature is what we're talking about here. 

The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So, when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when there are spots, the ratio is lower. The factor would be the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n1 and n2) is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight and k is Boltzmann's constant. 

Wait, the ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, right? So when the temperature changes, this ratio changes. But wait, in the problem, the observed ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the Teff drops, the ratio n1/n2 goes down.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative because T is in the denominator. So exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) would be smaller, meaning that if E1 > E2 (since we're talking about a transition between two levels, and the wavelength is given), then level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ). Let me think about that.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Let me get the formula right. The ratio is (n2)/(n1) equals (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because higher energy levels have fewer atoms. So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative, and exp(negative) makes the ratio small. So if E2 is higher than E1, then n2 is smaller than n1. 

Wait, but in the problem, the observed ratio is n1/n2. So if the ratio decreases when spots are present, that means n1/n2 is getting smaller. So when the star has spots (Teff drops to 5500 K), the n1/n2 ratio is lower than when it's at 6000 K. 

Why? Because lower temperatures mean that higher energy levels are less populated. So the ratio of lower to higher energy levels would be lower when the temperature is lower. So when the star is cooler, the ratio n1/n2 is smaller. So the ratio without spots (6000 K) is larger than the ratio with spots (5500 K).

The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So let's say the ratio without spots is R1, and with spots is R2. The factor is R1/R2.

So R1 is the ratio at 6000 K, R2 is the ratio at 5500 K. So R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ), and R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T2) ). 

So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k T1) ) - ( (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ] )

Wait, that's because when you take R1/R2, the (g1/g2) terms cancel. So it's exp( (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )).

But wait, E1-E2 is the energy difference. Alternatively, we can write it as (E1-E2) = hc/lambda, since the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Angstroms. So E = hc/lambda.

Let me compute the energy difference. H is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. C is 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 1448 A, which is 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10) = approximately 1.373e-16 J.

Wait that's the energy per photon. But for the Boltzmann factor, we need E/(k), where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E/(k) = (1.373e-16 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e7 K ≈ approximately 9.95e6 K, roughly 1e7 K.

Wait, that's a very high temperature. So the energy difference is about 1e7 K in terms of k.

But wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Compute E = hc/(lambda) = (6.62607015e-34 J·s) * (299792458 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is 1448e-10 meters. Let me calculate:

E = (6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8) / (1448e-10)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let's recompute:

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 J.

Now, E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = (1.373 / 1.38) ) * 1e5 K ≈ (approx 0.995) * 1e5 ≈ ~9.95e4 K, about 1e5 K.

Wait, so E/(k) is approximately 1e5 K.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me compute E again.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) ) * 1e-18 = approx 1.373 * 1e-18 = 1.373e-18 J.

Now, E/(k) = 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 / 1.38) ) * 1e5 = about 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 9.95e4 K. So approximately 1e5 K.

So E/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Now, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is -(E1-E2)/(k T). Wait, but E1 and E2 are levels, so if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which emits a photon with this wavelength, then E2 = E1 + hν, so E2 - E1 = hν. So in terms of energy, higher level is E2, lower level E1.

So in the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no. The Boltzmann equation is (n2 / n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because if you take the reciprocal of (n2/n1), you get (n1/n2) = [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) ]^{-1} = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, the ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But the energy difference E2 - E1 is the same as hν, which is h*c/(lambda). So substituting E2 - E1 = hc / lambda.

So, the ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (hc/(lambda k)) / T )

So, when T increases, the exponent (hc/(lambda k T)) becomes smaller, so exp(something smaller) is a smaller number, which would mean that (n1/n2) increases as T increases? Wait, no. Because (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So the exponent is smaller. So for (n1/n2), which is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so the ratio (n1/n2) would decrease. Wait, no, because E is positive. So for example, suppose T is larger, the exponent term is smaller, so the exp is smaller, so the ratio (n1/n2) is smaller.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's take numbers. Suppose T is high, then (E2-E1)/(k T) is small. So the exponent is a small positive number. So exp(small positive) is about 1 + small.

But when T is low, the exponent is larger, so exp(large positive) could be a large number. Wait, but our E2-E1 is positive.

Wait, but E2 is higher than E1, so E2-E1 is positive. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So when T is higher, the exponent is smaller, so exp(small) is about 1, so (n1/n2) is proportional to 1. When T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp(large) is a large number, making (n1/n2) larger.

Wait, that's the opposite of what the problem states. The problem says that when the star has spots (Teff lower), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. But according to this, lower T would make (n1/n2) larger. That contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, maybe I messed up the levels. Because in the Boltzmann equation, n2 is the higher level. So if E2 is higher than E1, then n2 is the number in the higher level, n1 in the lower.

So, (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

As T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so (n2/n1) increases. So (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1) would decrease as T increases.

Wait, so if T increases, (n1/n2) decreases. So when the star is hotter, the ratio of lower to higher level is smaller. And when the star is cooler, the ratio is larger. But the problem says that when spots are present (lower T), the ratio decreases. So this is contradictory.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when the star is cooler, the ratio is smaller. That would imply that higher T leads to a larger ratio.

But according to the Boltzmann equation: (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So for E2-E1 positive, as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponential becomes smaller. So (n1/n2) would decrease. So when T is higher, (n1/n2) is smaller. So when the star is hotter (6000 K), (n1/n2) is smaller. When cooler (5500 K), (n1/n2) is larger.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (5500 K), the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease. That would mean that (n1/n2) is smaller when the star is cooler, which contradicts the Boltzmann equation unless I've messed up something.

Wait, perhaps I got the levels mixed up. Let me think. Suppose the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon. So E2 > E1. So (E2 - E1) is positive.

Then, the ratio (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So (n2/n1) is (g2/g1) times exp( -deltaE/(k T) )

So, for lower T, deltaE/(k T) is larger, so the exponent is more negative. So exp(-x) is smaller when x is larger. So (n2/n1) is smaller when T is lower. So n2 is less than n1. So (n1/n2) is larger when T is lower.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease. That's the opposite. So perhaps the energy levels are opposite? Or perhaps I have the ratio reversed.

Wait, perhaps the ratio the problem refers to is (n2/n1). Because if that's the case, then when T is lower, (n2/n1) would be smaller, because (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -deltaE/(k T) ). So for lower T, deltaE/(k T) is larger, so the exponent is more negative, making (n2/n1) smaller.

So if the ratio observed is (n2/n1), then when T is lower, the ratio is smaller, which matches the problem statement. So perhaps the problem refers to (n2/n1) as the ratio, and the ratio decreases when T is lower.

Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases when the star has spots. So it's (n1/n2) that decreases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) would increase when T decreases. So that would mean that the observed ratio (n1/n2) is higher when T is lower, but the problem states that it decreases. Hmm, this is confusing. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the ratio as (n2/n1) instead. Let's think again.

Problem says when the star has spots, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So (n1/n2) is lower at 5500 K than at 6000 K. So (n1/n2) is lower when T is lower.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So as T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is smaller, and exp(small) is about 1. So (n1/n2) would be (g1/g2) multiplied by something close to 1. But when T is lower, the exponent is larger, so exp(larger) is a bigger number, making (n1/n2) larger. So when T is lower, (n1/n2) is larger, which contradicts the problem statement. So this suggests that the ratio observed (n1/n2) should increase when T decreases, but the problem says it decreases. So perhaps I have an error in the way I'm applying the formula.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so E2 is higher than E1. So the energy emitted is E2 - E1. So when an atom in level 2 transitions to level 1, it emits a photon. So in that case, the ratio (n2/n1) would be (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1)/(k T) is positive, and the exponent is negative, so (n2/n1) is less than 1 if g2/g1 is 1.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio (n1/n2), which would be 1/(n2/n1). So if (n2/n1) is small, then (n1/n2) is large. So when T increases, (n2/n1) increases because the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) becomes larger, making (n2/n1) larger. Thus, (n1/n2) decreases as T increases.

So when T is higher (6000 K), (n1/n2) is smaller. When T is lower (5500 K), (n1/n2) is larger. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease. Wait, that can't be right because according to this, lower T would make (n1/n2) larger.

This is confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the factor by which the ratio changes.

The factor is R1/R2, where R1 is the ratio when T is 6000 K, and R2 is when T is 5500 K.

R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] )

Wait, no. Because R1/R2 = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] )

Wait, no, actually, 1/T1 is 1/6000 and 1/T2 is 1/5500. So 1/T1 < 1/T2, because 6000 <5500? No, wait, 6000 is larger than 5500, so 1/6000 is smaller than 1/5500. So 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative.

So the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) = (E2-E1)/(k) * ( (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) ) ) 

Which is (E2-E1)/(k) * ( (-500) )/(33,000,000) ) = (E2-E1)/(k) * (-500)/(3.3e7) )

Wait, let me compute that. 5500 *6000 =33,000,000. So 5500-6000 = -500. So 1/6000 -1/5500 = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -1.515e-5.

So, R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )

But E2-E1 is positive, so the product is negative. So the exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is a fraction. So R1/R2 is less than 1.

But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio R (n1/n2) is lower. So R1 is the ratio when T is higher (6000 K), R2 when T is lower (5500 K). So R1 is the ratio without spots, R2 with spots. And the problem says R is lower when there are spots (R2 < R1). So R1/R2 would be greater than 1. But according to our calculation, R1/R2 is exp(negative number), which is less than 1. So this contradicts.

Hmm. I must have made a mistake in the setup. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1). Let's say that the observed ratio is (n2/n1). The problem says that when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

So R1 = (n2/n1) at 6000 K.

R2 = (n2/n1) at 5500 K.

So R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, same as before. So 1/T1 is 1/6000, 1/T2 is 1/5500.

So 1/T1 (approx 0.00016667), 1/T2 (approx 0.00018182). So 1/T1 -1/T2 = 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 = -0.00001515.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (-0.00001515) 

We calculated (E2-E1)/(k) earlier as roughly 1e5 K.

So (1e5 K) * (-0.00001515) = -1.515.

So exponent is -1.515.

So R1/R2 = exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.22. So R1/R2 is about 0.22. So R1 is about 0.22 times R2.

But wait, I thought R1 is (n2/n1) at 6000 K, and R2 is (n2/n1) at 5500 K. So R1 is the ratio without spots, R2 with spots.

If R1 is 0.22 R2, that means R2 is larger than R1, which would imply that with spots, the ratio (n2/n1) is higher. That can't be right because the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present.

Hmm, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe it's time to approach this with numbers.

Let me compute the exponent for each temperature.

(E2-E1)/(k T) = hc/(lambda k T) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T )

So, for T1 = 6000 K:

(E2-E1)/(k T1) = 1.373e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 6000) = 1.373e-18 / (8.28e-20) ≈ 16.56.

Similarly, for T2 =5500 K:

(E2-E1)/(k T2) = 1.373e-18 / (1.38e-23 *5500) = 1.373e-18 / (7.59e-20) ≈ 18.08.

Wait, wait, no: 1.38e-23 * 5500 = 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 1.38 *5.5 * 1e-20 =7.59e-20.

So 1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 = approximately 17.99, say 18.

Wait, but wait, 1.373e-18 divided by 7.59e-20 is (1.373 / 7.59) ) * 1e2 ≈ (0.1808) * 100 ≈ 18.08.

So for T1=6000K, (E2-E1)/(k T1)=16.56.

For T2=5500 K, same term is 18.08.

So the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Assuming g1 and g2 are the same (if the statistical weights are equal), which is a common assumption unless stated otherwise.

So, without spots (T1=6000K), (n1/n2) = exp(16.56) ≈ ?

But wait, 16.56 is a large exponent. Exp(16) is about 8.89e6, exp(16.56) is even larger. So (n1/n2) would be huge, which is impossible because (n1 +n2) can't be more than the total number of Ti atoms.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. Because if (E2-E1) is about 1e5 K, then at T=6000 K, (E2-E1)/(k T)= (1e5 K) / 6000 ≈ 16.667.

So exp(16.667) is about 1e7 (since exp(16) is ~8.89e6, so exp(16.667)= exp(16)*exp(0.667)= 8.89e6 *1.948≈ 1.73e7). So (n1/n2) would be about 1.7e7, which is a very high ratio, implying almost all atoms are in level 1 and very few in level 2.

But when T drops to 5500 K, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases to 1e5 /5500 ≈ 18.18. So exp(18.18) is even larger, about 6e7. So (n1/n2) would be even higher. So the ratio (n1/n2) increases as T decreases, which would mean that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is larger. But the problem states that it decreases.

This contradicts, so I must be wrong in the formula. Another possibility is that the energy difference is small compared to k*T, which would make the exponent small, but our calculation shows that E/(k) is about 1e5 K, and T is about 6e3 K, so E/(k T) is about 16, which is large, leading to a huge ratio. But that's not possible because in reality, the number of atoms in lower levels can't be that high compared to higher levels unless the energy difference is small.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so E2 is higher than E1. So, the energy per photon is hc/lambda. Let's compute that again.

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is in the extreme UV, perhaps. So the energy per photon is E = hc/(lambda).

Wait, but in the Boltzmann factor, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T). If E2-E1 is much larger than k T, then the exponent is large, and the ratio would be very small. Wait, but in this case, E2-E1 is about 1e5 K, and T is about 6e3 K, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is about 1e5/6e3 ≈ 16.66.

So, exp(16.66) is a very large number, which suggests that (n1/n2) is exp(16.66) ≈ 1e7, which is a huge ratio. But in reality, if E2 is much higher than E1, then the number of atoms in E2 would be very low, so (n2/n1) would be very small, and (n1/n2) would be very large. But the problem states that when the spots are present (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases, which would mean when T is lower, the ratio is smaller. But according to our calculation, (n1/n2) increases as T decreases, which is the opposite.

I must have something wrong here. Let's think about this again.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K, and the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when T is lower, (n1/n2) is lower.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2>E1, (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So as T increases, the exponent (a positive number) decreases, making the ratio (n1/n2) decrease.

Thus, when T increases (from 5500 to 6000 K), (n1/n2) decreases. So when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio is lower. But the problem says when the star has spots (cooler, 5500 K), the ratio is lower. So that can't be right.

Wait, no. Let's say at T1=6000 K, ratio R1 = (n1/n2) = exp(16.56) ≈ 1e7.

At T2=5500 K, R2 = exp(18.18) ≈ 6e7. So R2 is larger than R1. So when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio (n1/n2) is larger, which contradicts the problem statement that it decreases. So I'm getting conflicting results.

Hmm. I think I'm missing something here. Let me approach it differently. Maybe the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so the photon emitted is when an electron jumps from level 2 to level 1. So E2 is higher than E1. So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/lambda.

So when the star is cooler, the ratio (n2/n1) is smaller because fewer atoms are in the higher energy level. So (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 -E1)/(k T) )

So when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so (n2/n1) is smaller, so (n1/n2) is larger. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease. So this contradicts, leading me to think that perhaps the problem refers to (n2/n1) as the ratio. So let's assume that.

If the ratio is (n2/n1), then when T is lower, (n2/n1) is smaller. So the ratio decreases, which matches the problem statement. So perhaps the problem refers to (n2/n1) as the ratio that decreases.

So, the ratio we're looking at is (n2/n1), which is (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So the factor we're looking for is R1/R2, where R1 is (n2/n1) at T1=6000, R2 is (n2/n1) at T2=5500.

So R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So, R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, because R1/R2 = exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ] - [ -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ] ) )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because 1/T2 >1/T1 (since T2=5500 < T1=6000, so 1/5500 >1/6000).

So (1/T2 -1/T1 )= 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(33,000,000) )= 1.515e-5.

So, (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T2 -1/T1) = (1e5 K) * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.515.

So the exponent is 1.515, so R1/R2 = exp(1.515) ≈ 4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches.

So the factor by which (n2/n1) changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does is about 4.5. So the ratio without spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. Or, wait, R1 is when no spots (T=6000), R2 when spots (T=5500). So R1/R2 is about 4.5, meaning R1 is 4.5 times R2. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio (n2/n1) is 4.5 times higher than when it does. So the factor is 4.5.

So the correct answer would be option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation in the context of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference**:  
   The energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the transition wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting this to temperature units using \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:
   \[
   \frac{E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Ratio of Ratios**:  
   The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots). Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = -\frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Using \(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}\), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = (1 \times 10^5)(-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.515.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(-1.515) \approx 0.22.
   \]

3. **Interpretation**:  
   The ratio \(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\) decreases when the star has spots (lower temperature). The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \(1 / 0.22 \approx 4.5\). This matches the observed behavior in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

Alright, the star's normal effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K when there are no spots. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere? Oh right, the photosphere is the layer of the star where the light is emitted, so its temperature is what we're talking about here. 

The problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So, when there are no spots, the ratio is higher, and when there are spots, the ratio is lower. The factor would be the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n1 and n2) is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight and k is Boltzmann's constant. 

Wait, the ratio they're talking about is n1/n2, right? So when the temperature changes, this ratio changes. But wait, in the problem, the observed ratio decreases when there are spots. So when the Teff drops, the ratio n1/n2 goes down.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative because T is in the denominator. So exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) would be smaller, meaning that if E1 > E2 (since we're talking about a transition between two levels, and the wavelength is given), then level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. So the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) ). Let me think about that.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Let me get the formula right. The ratio is (n2)/(n1) equals (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because higher energy levels have fewer atoms. So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative, and exp(negative) makes the ratio small. So if E2 is higher than E1, then n2 is smaller than n1. 

Wait, but in the problem, the observed ratio is n1/n2. So if the ratio decreases when spots are present, that means n1/n2 is getting smaller. So when the star has spots (Teff drops to 5500 K), the n1/n2 ratio is lower than when it's at 6000 K. 

Why? Because lower temperatures mean that higher energy levels are less populated. So the ratio of lower to higher energy levels would be lower when the temperature is lower. So when the star is cooler, the ratio n1/n2 is smaller. So the ratio without spots (6000 K) is larger than the ratio with spots (5500 K).

The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So let's say the ratio without spots is R1, and with spots is R2. The factor is R1/R2.

So R1 is the ratio at 6000 K, R2 is the ratio at 5500 K. So R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ), and R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T2) ). 

So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k T1) ) - ( (E1-E2)/(k T2) ) ] )

Wait, that's because when you take R1/R2, the (g1/g2) terms cancel. So it's exp( (E1-E2)/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) )).

But wait, E1-E2 is the energy difference. Alternatively, we can write it as (E1-E2) = hc/lambda, since the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Angstroms. So E = hc/lambda.

Let me compute the energy difference. H is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. C is 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 1448 A, which is 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / (1448e-10) = approximately 1.373e-16 J.

Wait that's the energy per photon. But for the Boltzmann factor, we need E/(k), where k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E/(k) = (1.373e-16 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e7 K ≈ approximately 9.95e6 K, roughly 1e7 K.

Wait, that's a very high temperature. So the energy difference is about 1e7 K in terms of k.

But wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

Compute E = hc/(lambda) = (6.62607015e-34 J·s) * (299792458 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is 1448e-10 meters. Let me calculate:

E = (6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8) / (1448e-10)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let's recompute:

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J.

So E = 1.373e-18 J.

Now, E/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = (1.373 / 1.38) ) * 1e5 K ≈ (approx 0.995) * 1e5 ≈ ~9.95e4 K, about 1e5 K.

Wait, so E/(k) is approximately 1e5 K.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me compute E again.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) ) * 1e-18 = approx 1.373 * 1e-18 = 1.373e-18 J.

Now, E/(k) = 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 / 1.38) ) * 1e5 = about 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 9.95e4 K. So approximately 1e5 K.

So E/(k) ≈ 1e5 K.

Now, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is -(E1-E2)/(k T). Wait, but E1 and E2 are levels, so if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which emits a photon with this wavelength, then E2 = E1 + hν, so E2 - E1 = hν. So in terms of energy, higher level is E2, lower level E1.

So in the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no. The Boltzmann equation is (n2 / n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because if you take the reciprocal of (n2/n1), you get (n1/n2) = [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) ]^{-1} = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, the ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But the energy difference E2 - E1 is the same as hν, which is h*c/(lambda). So substituting E2 - E1 = hc / lambda.

So, the ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (hc/(lambda k)) / T )

So, when T increases, the exponent (hc/(lambda k T)) becomes smaller, so exp(something smaller) is a smaller number, which would mean that (n1/n2) increases as T increases? Wait, no. Because (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So the exponent is smaller. So for (n1/n2), which is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller, so the ratio (n1/n2) would decrease. Wait, no, because E is positive. So for example, suppose T is larger, the exponent term is smaller, so the exp is smaller, so the ratio (n1/n2) is smaller.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's take numbers. Suppose T is high, then (E2-E1)/(k T) is small. So the exponent is a small positive number. So exp(small positive) is about 1 + small.

But when T is low, the exponent is larger, so exp(large positive) could be a large number. Wait, but our E2-E1 is positive.

Wait, but E2 is higher than E1, so E2-E1 is positive. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So when T is higher, the exponent is smaller, so exp(small) is about 1, so (n1/n2) is proportional to 1. When T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp(large) is a large number, making (n1/n2) larger.

Wait, that's the opposite of what the problem states. The problem says that when the star has spots (Teff lower), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. But according to this, lower T would make (n1/n2) larger. That contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, maybe I messed up the levels. Because in the Boltzmann equation, n2 is the higher level. So if E2 is higher than E1, then n2 is the number in the higher level, n1 in the lower.

So, (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

As T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so (n2/n1) increases. So (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1) would decrease as T increases.

Wait, so if T increases, (n1/n2) decreases. So when the star is hotter, the ratio of lower to higher level is smaller. And when the star is cooler, the ratio is larger. But the problem says that when spots are present (lower T), the ratio decreases. So this is contradictory.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when the star is cooler, the ratio is smaller. That would imply that higher T leads to a larger ratio.

But according to the Boltzmann equation: (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So for E2-E1 positive, as T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponential becomes smaller. So (n1/n2) would decrease. So when T is higher, (n1/n2) is smaller. So when the star is hotter (6000 K), (n1/n2) is smaller. When cooler (5500 K), (n1/n2) is larger.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (5500 K), the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease. That would mean that (n1/n2) is smaller when the star is cooler, which contradicts the Boltzmann equation unless I've messed up something.

Wait, perhaps I got the levels mixed up. Let me think. Suppose the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon. So E2 > E1. So (E2 - E1) is positive.

Then, the ratio (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So (n2/n1) is (g2/g1) times exp( -deltaE/(k T) )

So, for lower T, deltaE/(k T) is larger, so the exponent is more negative. So exp(-x) is smaller when x is larger. So (n2/n1) is smaller when T is lower. So n2 is less than n1. So (n1/n2) is larger when T is lower.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease. That's the opposite. So perhaps the energy levels are opposite? Or perhaps I have the ratio reversed.

Wait, perhaps the ratio the problem refers to is (n2/n1). Because if that's the case, then when T is lower, (n2/n1) would be smaller, because (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -deltaE/(k T) ). So for lower T, deltaE/(k T) is larger, so the exponent is more negative, making (n2/n1) smaller.

So if the ratio observed is (n2/n1), then when T is lower, the ratio is smaller, which matches the problem statement. So perhaps the problem refers to (n2/n1) as the ratio, and the ratio decreases when T is lower.

Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases when the star has spots. So it's (n1/n2) that decreases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) would increase when T decreases. So that would mean that the observed ratio (n1/n2) is higher when T is lower, but the problem states that it decreases. Hmm, this is confusing. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the ratio as (n2/n1) instead. Let's think again.

Problem says when the star has spots, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases. So (n1/n2) is lower at 5500 K than at 6000 K. So (n1/n2) is lower when T is lower.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So as T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent is smaller, and exp(small) is about 1. So (n1/n2) would be (g1/g2) multiplied by something close to 1. But when T is lower, the exponent is larger, so exp(larger) is a bigger number, making (n1/n2) larger. So when T is lower, (n1/n2) is larger, which contradicts the problem statement. So this suggests that the ratio observed (n1/n2) should increase when T decreases, but the problem says it decreases. So perhaps I have an error in the way I'm applying the formula.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so E2 is higher than E1. So the energy emitted is E2 - E1. So when an atom in level 2 transitions to level 1, it emits a photon. So in that case, the ratio (n2/n1) would be (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1)/(k T) is positive, and the exponent is negative, so (n2/n1) is less than 1 if g2/g1 is 1.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio (n1/n2), which would be 1/(n2/n1). So if (n2/n1) is small, then (n1/n2) is large. So when T increases, (n2/n1) increases because the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) becomes larger, making (n2/n1) larger. Thus, (n1/n2) decreases as T increases.

So when T is higher (6000 K), (n1/n2) is smaller. When T is lower (5500 K), (n1/n2) is larger. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease. Wait, that can't be right because according to this, lower T would make (n1/n2) larger.

This is confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the factor by which the ratio changes.

The factor is R1/R2, where R1 is the ratio when T is 6000 K, and R2 is when T is 5500 K.

R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] )

Wait, no. Because R1/R2 = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ] = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/T1 - 1/T2] )

Wait, no, actually, 1/T1 is 1/6000 and 1/T2 is 1/5500. So 1/T1 < 1/T2, because 6000 <5500? No, wait, 6000 is larger than 5500, so 1/6000 is smaller than 1/5500. So 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative.

So the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) = (E2-E1)/(k) * ( (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) ) ) 

Which is (E2-E1)/(k) * ( (-500) )/(33,000,000) ) = (E2-E1)/(k) * (-500)/(3.3e7) )

Wait, let me compute that. 5500 *6000 =33,000,000. So 5500-6000 = -500. So 1/6000 -1/5500 = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -1.515e-5.

So, R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5) )

But E2-E1 is positive, so the product is negative. So the exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is a fraction. So R1/R2 is less than 1.

But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio R (n1/n2) is lower. So R1 is the ratio when T is higher (6000 K), R2 when T is lower (5500 K). So R1 is the ratio without spots, R2 with spots. And the problem says R is lower when there are spots (R2 < R1). So R1/R2 would be greater than 1. But according to our calculation, R1/R2 is exp(negative number), which is less than 1. So this contradicts.

Hmm. I must have made a mistake in the setup. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1). Let's say that the observed ratio is (n2/n1). The problem says that when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

So R1 = (n2/n1) at 6000 K.

R2 = (n2/n1) at 5500 K.

So R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, same as before. So 1/T1 is 1/6000, 1/T2 is 1/5500.

So 1/T1 (approx 0.00016667), 1/T2 (approx 0.00018182). So 1/T1 -1/T2 = 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 = -0.00001515.

So the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (-0.00001515) 

We calculated (E2-E1)/(k) earlier as roughly 1e5 K.

So (1e5 K) * (-0.00001515) = -1.515.

So exponent is -1.515.

So R1/R2 = exp(-1.515) ≈ 0.22. So R1/R2 is about 0.22. So R1 is about 0.22 times R2.

But wait, I thought R1 is (n2/n1) at 6000 K, and R2 is (n2/n1) at 5500 K. So R1 is the ratio without spots, R2 with spots.

If R1 is 0.22 R2, that means R2 is larger than R1, which would imply that with spots, the ratio (n2/n1) is higher. That can't be right because the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present.

Hmm, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe it's time to approach this with numbers.

Let me compute the exponent for each temperature.

(E2-E1)/(k T) = hc/(lambda k T) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * T )

So, for T1 = 6000 K:

(E2-E1)/(k T1) = 1.373e-18 / (1.38e-23 * 6000) = 1.373e-18 / (8.28e-20) ≈ 16.56.

Similarly, for T2 =5500 K:

(E2-E1)/(k T2) = 1.373e-18 / (1.38e-23 *5500) = 1.373e-18 / (7.59e-20) ≈ 18.08.

Wait, wait, no: 1.38e-23 * 5500 = 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 1.38 *5.5 * 1e-20 =7.59e-20.

So 1.373e-18 /7.59e-20 = approximately 17.99, say 18.

Wait, but wait, 1.373e-18 divided by 7.59e-20 is (1.373 / 7.59) ) * 1e2 ≈ (0.1808) * 100 ≈ 18.08.

So for T1=6000K, (E2-E1)/(k T1)=16.56.

For T2=5500 K, same term is 18.08.

So the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Assuming g1 and g2 are the same (if the statistical weights are equal), which is a common assumption unless stated otherwise.

So, without spots (T1=6000K), (n1/n2) = exp(16.56) ≈ ?

But wait, 16.56 is a large exponent. Exp(16) is about 8.89e6, exp(16.56) is even larger. So (n1/n2) would be huge, which is impossible because (n1 +n2) can't be more than the total number of Ti atoms.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. Because if (E2-E1) is about 1e5 K, then at T=6000 K, (E2-E1)/(k T)= (1e5 K) / 6000 ≈ 16.667.

So exp(16.667) is about 1e7 (since exp(16) is ~8.89e6, so exp(16.667)= exp(16)*exp(0.667)= 8.89e6 *1.948≈ 1.73e7). So (n1/n2) would be about 1.7e7, which is a very high ratio, implying almost all atoms are in level 1 and very few in level 2.

But when T drops to 5500 K, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases to 1e5 /5500 ≈ 18.18. So exp(18.18) is even larger, about 6e7. So (n1/n2) would be even higher. So the ratio (n1/n2) increases as T decreases, which would mean that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio is larger. But the problem states that it decreases.

This contradicts, so I must be wrong in the formula. Another possibility is that the energy difference is small compared to k*T, which would make the exponent small, but our calculation shows that E/(k) is about 1e5 K, and T is about 6e3 K, so E/(k T) is about 16, which is large, leading to a huge ratio. But that's not possible because in reality, the number of atoms in lower levels can't be that high compared to higher levels unless the energy difference is small.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so E2 is higher than E1. So, the energy per photon is hc/lambda. Let's compute that again.

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is in the extreme UV, perhaps. So the energy per photon is E = hc/(lambda).

Wait, but in the Boltzmann factor, the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T). If E2-E1 is much larger than k T, then the exponent is large, and the ratio would be very small. Wait, but in this case, E2-E1 is about 1e5 K, and T is about 6e3 K, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is about 1e5/6e3 ≈ 16.66.

So, exp(16.66) is a very large number, which suggests that (n1/n2) is exp(16.66) ≈ 1e7, which is a huge ratio. But in reality, if E2 is much higher than E1, then the number of atoms in E2 would be very low, so (n2/n1) would be very small, and (n1/n2) would be very large. But the problem states that when the spots are present (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases, which would mean when T is lower, the ratio is smaller. But according to our calculation, (n1/n2) increases as T decreases, which is the opposite.

I must have something wrong here. Let's think about this again.

The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K, and the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when T is lower, (n1/n2) is lower.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2>E1, (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So as T increases, the exponent (a positive number) decreases, making the ratio (n1/n2) decrease.

Thus, when T increases (from 5500 to 6000 K), (n1/n2) decreases. So when the star is hotter (no spots), the ratio is lower. But the problem says when the star has spots (cooler, 5500 K), the ratio is lower. So that can't be right.

Wait, no. Let's say at T1=6000 K, ratio R1 = (n1/n2) = exp(16.56) ≈ 1e7.

At T2=5500 K, R2 = exp(18.18) ≈ 6e7. So R2 is larger than R1. So when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio (n1/n2) is larger, which contradicts the problem statement that it decreases. So I'm getting conflicting results.

Hmm. I think I'm missing something here. Let me approach it differently. Maybe the transition is from level 1 to level 2, so the photon emitted is when an electron jumps from level 2 to level 1. So E2 is higher than E1. So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/lambda.

So when the star is cooler, the ratio (n2/n1) is smaller because fewer atoms are in the higher energy level. So (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 -E1)/(k T) )

So when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so (n2/n1) is smaller, so (n1/n2) is larger. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease. So this contradicts, leading me to think that perhaps the problem refers to (n2/n1) as the ratio. So let's assume that.

If the ratio is (n2/n1), then when T is lower, (n2/n1) is smaller. So the ratio decreases, which matches the problem statement. So perhaps the problem refers to (n2/n1) as the ratio that decreases.

So, the ratio we're looking at is (n2/n1), which is (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So the factor we're looking for is R1/R2, where R1 is (n2/n1) at T1=6000, R2 is (n2/n1) at T2=5500.

So R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So, R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, because R1/R2 = exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ] - [ -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ] ) )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because 1/T2 >1/T1 (since T2=5500 < T1=6000, so 1/5500 >1/6000).

So (1/T2 -1/T1 )= 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(33,000,000) )= 1.515e-5.

So, (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/T2 -1/T1) = (1e5 K) * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.515.

So the exponent is 1.515, so R1/R2 = exp(1.515) ≈ 4.55.

So the factor is approximately 4.55. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches.

So the factor by which (n2/n1) changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does is about 4.5. So the ratio without spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. Or, wait, R1 is when no spots (T=6000), R2 when spots (T=5500). So R1/R2 is about 4.5, meaning R1 is 4.5 times R2. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio (n2/n1) is 4.5 times higher than when it does. So the factor is 4.5.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation in the context of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference**:  
   The energy difference between the two levels corresponds to the transition wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting this to temperature units using \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:
   \[
   \frac{E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Ratio of Ratios**:  
   The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (spots). Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = -\frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx -1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Using \(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \approx 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}\), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = (1 \times 10^5)(-1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx -1.515.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(-1.515) \approx 0.22.
   \]

3. **Interpretation**:  
   The ratio \(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\) decreases when the star has spots (lower temperature). The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \(1 / 0.22 \approx 4.5\). This matches the observed behavior in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
