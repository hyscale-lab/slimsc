Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and think it through step by step.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels can be explained using the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 (or maybe n2/n1? Wait let me clarify) is lower. Wait, the ratio of level 1 to level 2: when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. So I need to see how that affects the ratio.

Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, ratio is higher. So let me think, when the temperature is lower, does the ratio increase or decrease?

The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). If the energy difference ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term gets smaller. So the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)) would decrease as T decreases. Because the exponential term is getting smaller, so n2/n1 goes down. So if the star has lower Teff, the n2/n1 ratio is lower. 

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when it has spots, the ratio is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor by which the ratio increases is when going from spotted to no spots? Or wait, the question is the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it has. So the ratio when no spots (R1) divided by the ratio when spots (R2) is the factor.

So R1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), where T1 is 6000 K. R2 is when T is 5500 K, so R2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Wait, no, wait. The ratio is n1/n2. Or is it level 1 to level 2? The problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So let's say it's n1/n2. Then the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, because the Boltzmann equation can be written as n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k T) ). So if level 1 has lower energy than level 2, then E_i - E_j is negative if i=1 and j=2. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), because E_i is E1, E_j is E2. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is for the probability of being in a higher energy state. If the temperature is higher, more atoms can be in higher energy states.

But for this problem, the key point is the ratio of the populations. Let me define the ratio as R = (n1)/(n2). So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because E2 is higher than E1, so (E2-E1) is positive. So as T increases, exp(...) increases, so R increases. So when the star has no spots, T is higher (6000 K), so R is higher. When it's spotted, T is 5500 K, so R is lower. Thus, the ratio decreases when spots are present, which matches the problem statement.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1 / R2, where R1 is when there are no spots (T1=6000 K) and R2 is when the spots are present (T2=5500 K).

So R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] 

The g factors cancel out. So R1/R2 = exp( ΔE (1/(k T1) - 1/(k T2)) )

Wait, let me compute the exponent:

= exp( (ΔE)/(k) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) ) )

But wait, ΔE is E2 - E1, which is positive. So when T1 is higher than T2, 1/T1 is less than 1/T2, so 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) is negative. So the exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is a small number. So R1/R2 = exp( negative ) < 1. So the ratio when no spots is less than when there are spots? Wait no, wait.

Wait, no. Let me re-express the exponent:

Wait the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] )

Since T1 > T2, 1/T1 < 1/T2 → 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative. So the exponent is negative → exp(negative) is 1 over exp(positive).

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = 1 / exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe an alternative approach is better.

Alternatively, compute the ratio R1/R2 as [exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

But 1/T1 is 1/6000, 1/T2 is 1/5500.

So 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182.

1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -500/(3.3e7) )= approximately -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (-1.515e-5 )

But wait, without knowing ΔE, how can I proceed? The question gives us a wavelength corresponding to the transition. The transition is between the two levels, so the energy difference can be found from the wavelength.

The energy difference ΔE corresponds to the photon emitted when an electron transitions from level 2 to level 1, which emits a photon of wavelength λ. So ΔE = hc/λ.

Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Ångströms. Since 1 Å is 1e-10 meters, so 1448e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, that's in joules. We might need to convert that to eV, but perhaps it's easier to work in terms of k*T.

Alternatively, compute the exponent term (ΔE)/(k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K.

So for each temperature, compute (ΔE) / (k*T).

Wait, but wait, the exponent in the ratio R1/R2 is (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Which can be written as (ΔE/k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ]

So let's compute that:

But perhaps it's easier to compute (ΔE/(k)) = (hc)/(λ k )

Because ΔE = hc/λ, so ΔE/(k) = (hc)/(λ k)

So let's compute that value.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c =3e8 m/s

λ = 1.448e-7 m

k=1.38e-23 J/K

So (h c)/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 )

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = (1.448 *1.38) e-30 ~ 2.00e-30 (exactly, 1.448 *1.38 = approx 2.00064)

So denominator is approximately 2.00e-30 J·m.

So (h c)/(λ k) = 1.9878e-25 / 2.00e-30 = (1.9878 /2 )e5 = approx 0.9939e5 → ~99390. So about 9.939e4.

So (ΔE/(k)) = ~9.939e4 K.

Wait, because when you have units: (J·s * m/s) / (m * J/K) ) → J·s * m/s is J·m, denominator is m * J/K → J·m / (m J/K) ) → K.

So the value is ~99,390 K.

Wait, so (ΔE/(k)) ≈ 99,390 K.

So now, the exponent in (ΔE/k) (1/T1 -1/T2) is:

99390 K * (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) K^-1

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818.

The difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

So 99390 * 0.000015151 ≈ 99390 * 1.5151e-5.

Calculate 99390 * 1.515e-5:

99390 *1.5e-5 = 99390 * 0.000015 = approximately 1.49085.

But more accurately, 99390 *1.5151e-5 = ?

Let me compute 99390 * 1.5151e-5:

1.5151e-5 is 0.000015151.

Multiply 99390 by 0.000015151.

Compute 99390 * 0.000015151:

Let me do 99390 * 15151e-10.

Wait 99390 * 15151 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is:

Take 1e5 → 99390 is approximately 99390 ≈ 1e5.

So 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = 1.5151.

But 99390 is 99.39% of 1e5.

So 99390 * 1.5151e-5 = (1e5 * 0.9939) *1.5151e-5 = 0.9939 *1.5151 ≈ approximately 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

Wait, but wait, the difference in 1/T is (1/T2 - 1/T1) as that would be positive since T2<T1.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, in the calculation above, when I compute 1/T1 -1/T2, that's 1/6000 -1/5500, which is negative, as T1 is larger. But in the problem, the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/T1 -1/T2 ), which is (99390 K) * (-1.5151e-5 K^-1 ) → approximately -1.505.

So the exponent is about -1.505.

So R1/R2 = exp( -1.505 )

What is exp(-1.505) approximately? Well, exp(-1) is about 0.3679, exp(-2) is about 0.1353. 1.5 is between them. Let me compute it.

exp(-1.5) ≈ 0.2231.

But my exponent is 1.505, so approximately 1.505 is about 1.5, so exp(-1.505) ≈ about 0.223.

Wait, but wait, the factor R1/R2 is this value. So if R1/R2 is about 0.223, that means the ratio when no spots is about 0.223 times the ratio when there are spots.

But the question is, what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So that's R1 / R2 = 0.223. But wait, that's less than one. Which would imply that when the star has no spots, the ratio is lower than when it has spots. But earlier, I thought that when T is higher, the ratio R (n1/n2) is higher, because higher T favors higher energy levels. Wait, no, earlier I said R is n1/n2 = (g1/g2)*exp(ΔE/(k T)), so when T increases, exp increases, so R increases.

Wait, if R1 = n1/n2 when T=6000 K, R2 = n1/n2 when T=5500 K.

Since T1 > T2, R1 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)),

R2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)),

So R1/R2 = exp(ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2)) )

Which is exp(ΔE/k ( (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) )) )

Since T2 < T1, (T2 - T1) is negative, so (1/T1 -1/T2) is negative.

So R1/R2 = exp( negative number ), which is less than 1. So R1 < R2.

But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (spots present), R2 is lower than R1. But according to our calculation, R1 is less than R2, which would imply that the ratio is higher when the star does not have spots, which would be inconsistent with the problem statement.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when we have spots, the ratio is lower than when we don't have spots. So R2 < R1.

But according to our calculation, R1/R2 is approximately 0.223, meaning R1 is about 0.223 times R2. So R1 is less than R2. Which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, that suggests I have a mistake in my approach. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio backwards. Let me double-check the definition. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R_with_spots = R2 is lower than R_without_spots = R1. So R1 > R2.

But according to our calculation, R1/R2 is about 0.223, which would mean R1 is less than R2, which can't be right.

What's wrong here? Let me re-express the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. Because if the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that would imply that n2/n1 goes down, which would make sense.

Let me think: if the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T is higher, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) is larger because the exponent becomes less negative. So n2/n1 increases with higher T.

So without spots, T is higher (6000 K), so n2/n1 is higher. When spots are present, T is lower (5500 K), so n2/n1 is lower. Thus, the ratio n2/n1 (R) decreases when spots are present, which matches the problem statement.

So the ratio R = n2/n1.

So when the star has no spots, R1 = n2/n1 at 6000 K.

When the star has spots, R2 = n2/n1 at 5500 K.

We need to find R1/R2, the factor by which the ratio is higher without spots.

So R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

We already computed ΔE/(k) ≈99390 K.

So 1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/T1=0.000166667.

So 1/T2 -1/T1 is 0.000015151.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) : 99390 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.505.

So the exponent is positive 1.505.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.505) ≈ 4.50.

Because exp(1.5) is approximately 4.4817, and 1.505 is a bit more, so about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Observations:
1. The problem specifies that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. This implies that the ratio is higher at the higher temperature (\(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\)) without spots compared to the lower temperature (\(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\)) with spots.
2. The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the wavelength of the transition (\(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\)) and can be calculated using \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light.

### Calculations:
1. **Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\)):**
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Boltzmann Factor (\(\Delta E / k\)):**
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} \approx 99,390 \, \text{K}.
   \]

3. **Exponent in the Ratio:**
   The ratio of the populations at two temperatures is given by:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.000015151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,390 \times 0.000015151 \approx 1.505.
   \]

4. **Final Ratio:**
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately **4.5 times higher** when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and think it through step by step.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star doesn't have dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels can be explained using the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 (or maybe n2/n1? Wait let me clarify) is lower. Wait, the ratio of level 1 to level 2: when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. So I need to see how that affects the ratio.

Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, ratio is higher. So let me think, when the temperature is lower, does the ratio increase or decrease?

The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)). If the energy difference ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term gets smaller. So the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)) would decrease as T decreases. Because the exponential term is getting smaller, so n2/n1 goes down. So if the star has lower Teff, the n2/n1 ratio is lower. 

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when it has spots, the ratio is lower. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor by which the ratio increases is when going from spotted to no spots? Or wait, the question is the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it has. So the ratio when no spots (R1) divided by the ratio when spots (R2) is the factor.

So R1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), where T1 is 6000 K. R2 is when T is 5500 K, so R2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Wait, no, wait. The ratio is n1/n2. Or is it level 1 to level 2? The problem says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So let's say it's n1/n2. Then the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, because the Boltzmann equation can be written as n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k T) ). So if level 1 has lower energy than level 2, then E_i - E_j is negative if i=1 and j=2. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), because E_i is E1, E_j is E2. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ).

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is for the probability of being in a higher energy state. If the temperature is higher, more atoms can be in higher energy states.

But for this problem, the key point is the ratio of the populations. Let me define the ratio as R = (n1)/(n2). So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because E2 is higher than E1, so (E2-E1) is positive. So as T increases, exp(...) increases, so R increases. So when the star has no spots, T is higher (6000 K), so R is higher. When it's spotted, T is 5500 K, so R is lower. Thus, the ratio decreases when spots are present, which matches the problem statement.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R1 / R2, where R1 is when there are no spots (T1=6000 K) and R2 is when the spots are present (T2=5500 K).

So R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] 

The g factors cancel out. So R1/R2 = exp( ΔE (1/(k T1) - 1/(k T2)) )

Wait, let me compute the exponent:

= exp( (ΔE)/(k) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) ) )

But wait, ΔE is E2 - E1, which is positive. So when T1 is higher than T2, 1/T1 is less than 1/T2, so 1/(T1) - 1/(T2) is negative. So the exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is a small number. So R1/R2 = exp( negative ) < 1. So the ratio when no spots is less than when there are spots? Wait no, wait.

Wait, no. Let me re-express the exponent:

Wait the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] )

Since T1 > T2, 1/T1 < 1/T2 → 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative. So the exponent is negative → exp(negative) is 1 over exp(positive).

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = 1 / exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe an alternative approach is better.

Alternatively, compute the ratio R1/R2 as [exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

But 1/T1 is 1/6000, 1/T2 is 1/5500.

So 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182.

1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= -500/(3.3e7) )= approximately -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (-1.515e-5 )

But wait, without knowing ΔE, how can I proceed? The question gives us a wavelength corresponding to the transition. The transition is between the two levels, so the energy difference can be found from the wavelength.

The energy difference ΔE corresponds to the photon emitted when an electron transitions from level 2 to level 1, which emits a photon of wavelength λ. So ΔE = hc/λ.

Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Ångströms. Since 1 Å is 1e-10 meters, so 1448e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But wait, that's in joules. We might need to convert that to eV, but perhaps it's easier to work in terms of k*T.

Alternatively, compute the exponent term (ΔE)/(k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K.

So for each temperature, compute (ΔE) / (k*T).

Wait, but wait, the exponent in the ratio R1/R2 is (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Which can be written as (ΔE/k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ]

So let's compute that:

But perhaps it's easier to compute (ΔE/(k)) = (hc)/(λ k )

Because ΔE = hc/λ, so ΔE/(k) = (hc)/(λ k)

So let's compute that value.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c =3e8 m/s

λ = 1.448e-7 m

k=1.38e-23 J/K

So (h c)/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 )

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = (1.448 *1.38) e-30 ~ 2.00e-30 (exactly, 1.448 *1.38 = approx 2.00064)

So denominator is approximately 2.00e-30 J·m.

So (h c)/(λ k) = 1.9878e-25 / 2.00e-30 = (1.9878 /2 )e5 = approx 0.9939e5 → ~99390. So about 9.939e4.

So (ΔE/(k)) = ~9.939e4 K.

Wait, because when you have units: (J·s * m/s) / (m * J/K) ) → J·s * m/s is J·m, denominator is m * J/K → J·m / (m J/K) ) → K.

So the value is ~99,390 K.

Wait, so (ΔE/(k)) ≈ 99,390 K.

So now, the exponent in (ΔE/k) (1/T1 -1/T2) is:

99390 K * (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) K^-1

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818.

The difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

So 99390 * 0.000015151 ≈ 99390 * 1.5151e-5.

Calculate 99390 * 1.515e-5:

99390 *1.5e-5 = 99390 * 0.000015 = approximately 1.49085.

But more accurately, 99390 *1.5151e-5 = ?

Let me compute 99390 * 1.5151e-5:

1.5151e-5 is 0.000015151.

Multiply 99390 by 0.000015151.

Compute 99390 * 0.000015151:

Let me do 99390 * 15151e-10.

Wait 99390 * 15151 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is:

Take 1e5 → 99390 is approximately 99390 ≈ 1e5.

So 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = 1.5151.

But 99390 is 99.39% of 1e5.

So 99390 * 1.5151e-5 = (1e5 * 0.9939) *1.5151e-5 = 0.9939 *1.5151 ≈ approximately 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

Wait, but wait, the difference in 1/T is (1/T2 - 1/T1) as that would be positive since T2<T1.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, in the calculation above, when I compute 1/T1 -1/T2, that's 1/6000 -1/5500, which is negative, as T1 is larger. But in the problem, the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/T1 -1/T2 ), which is (99390 K) * (-1.5151e-5 K^-1 ) → approximately -1.505.

So the exponent is about -1.505.

So R1/R2 = exp( -1.505 )

What is exp(-1.505) approximately? Well, exp(-1) is about 0.3679, exp(-2) is about 0.1353. 1.5 is between them. Let me compute it.

exp(-1.5) ≈ 0.2231.

But my exponent is 1.505, so approximately 1.505 is about 1.5, so exp(-1.505) ≈ about 0.223.

Wait, but wait, the factor R1/R2 is this value. So if R1/R2 is about 0.223, that means the ratio when no spots is about 0.223 times the ratio when there are spots.

But the question is, what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So that's R1 / R2 = 0.223. But wait, that's less than one. Which would imply that when the star has no spots, the ratio is lower than when it has spots. But earlier, I thought that when T is higher, the ratio R (n1/n2) is higher, because higher T favors higher energy levels. Wait, no, earlier I said R is n1/n2 = (g1/g2)*exp(ΔE/(k T)), so when T increases, exp increases, so R increases.

Wait, if R1 = n1/n2 when T=6000 K, R2 = n1/n2 when T=5500 K.

Since T1 > T2, R1 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)),

R2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)),

So R1/R2 = exp(ΔE/k (1/T1 - 1/T2)) )

Which is exp(ΔE/k ( (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) )) )

Since T2 < T1, (T2 - T1) is negative, so (1/T1 -1/T2) is negative.

So R1/R2 = exp( negative number ), which is less than 1. So R1 < R2.

But according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (spots present), R2 is lower than R1. But according to our calculation, R1 is less than R2, which would imply that the ratio is higher when the star does not have spots, which would be inconsistent with the problem statement.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when we have spots, the ratio is lower than when we don't have spots. So R2 < R1.

But according to our calculation, R1/R2 is approximately 0.223, meaning R1 is about 0.223 times R2. So R1 is less than R2. Which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm, that suggests I have a mistake in my approach. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I got the ratio backwards. Let me double-check the definition. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R_with_spots = R2 is lower than R_without_spots = R1. So R1 > R2.

But according to our calculation, R1/R2 is about 0.223, which would mean R1 is less than R2, which can't be right.

What's wrong here? Let me re-express the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2. Because if the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that would imply that n2/n1 goes down, which would make sense.

Let me think: if the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T is higher, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) is larger because the exponent becomes less negative. So n2/n1 increases with higher T.

So without spots, T is higher (6000 K), so n2/n1 is higher. When spots are present, T is lower (5500 K), so n2/n1 is lower. Thus, the ratio n2/n1 (R) decreases when spots are present, which matches the problem statement.

So the ratio R = n2/n1.

So when the star has no spots, R1 = n2/n1 at 6000 K.

When the star has spots, R2 = n2/n1 at 5500 K.

We need to find R1/R2, the factor by which the ratio is higher without spots.

So R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 -1/T1) )

We already computed ΔE/(k) ≈99390 K.

So 1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/T1=0.000166667.

So 1/T2 -1/T1 is 0.000015151.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) : 99390 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.505.

So the exponent is positive 1.505.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.505) ≈ 4.50.

Because exp(1.5) is approximately 4.4817, and 1.505 is a bit more, so about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is approximately 4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Observations:
1. The problem specifies that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. This implies that the ratio is higher at the higher temperature (\(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\)) without spots compared to the lower temperature (\(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\)) with spots.
2. The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the wavelength of the transition (\(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\)) and can be calculated using \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light.

### Calculations:
1. **Energy Difference (\(\Delta E\)):**
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s})(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})}{1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Boltzmann Factor (\(\Delta E / k\)):**
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} \approx 99,390 \, \text{K}.
   \]

3. **Exponent in the Ratio:**
   The ratio of the populations at two temperatures is given by:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\). Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.000015151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99,390 \times 0.000015151 \approx 1.505.
   \]

4. **Final Ratio:**
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately **4.5 times higher** when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.
