Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure out the energy spectrum for a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that in two-dimensional problems, especially in polar coordinates, it's helpful to separate the potential into radial and angular parts. But wait, the potential here seems to depend on both r and θ, so it's not spherically symmetric. That probably means the solution won't be as straightforward as the hydrogen atom problem or the 3D harmonic oscillator.

Looking at the potential, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor that a bit. I can write it as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, that might not help much. Alternatively, maybe I can separate it into functions of r and θ.

Wait, maybe I can think of this as a sum of two terms. The first term is (1/2)k r², which is like a radial part, and the second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. The second term depends on θ, so perhaps that's the angular part. But wait, cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is equal to (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3k r²)(1 + cos2θ)/4. Hmm, but not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, the overall potential is a combination of a radial harmonic oscillator and an angular component. So maybe I can separate the problem into radial and angular parts, but perhaps in a different coordinate system or by using some change of variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of this as a sum of two harmonic oscillators. Like, one in the r direction and another in the θ direction? But since θ is an angular coordinate, that approach might not directly work.

Wait, another thought. In polar coordinates, the kinetic energy is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²). The potential here is a function of r and cosθ, so perhaps the system is separable. Let me check if I can write the Hamiltonian in a way that allows separation of variables.

The Hamiltonian is H = p_r²/(2m) + p_θ²/(2m r²) + V(r,θ). So substituting V, we have H = p_r²/(2m) + p_θ²/(2m r²) + (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Wait, perhaps I can rewrite the potential as (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. That would be V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So, maybe this is a sum of a radial part and an angular part. Let me see: 1 + 3 cos²θ = 4 cos²θ + (1 - 3 cos²θ + ... Hmm, no, that's not helpful. Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3 (cosθ)^2.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this as a function that's a product of functions in r and θ, but that doesn't seem directly possible here. Because 1 + 3 cos²θ is a function of θ, but multiplied by r².

Wait, wait a second, maybe I can consider a change of coordinates. For example, in some cases, when the potential depends on cosθ, it's useful to switch to Cartesian coordinates, perhaps. Let me think: in 2D, polar coordinates can be converted to Cartesian via x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, cosθ = x/r. Then, cos²θ = x²/r².

So substituting into the potential, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Because x = r cosθ, so x² = r² cos²θ. So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Oh, wait! That's interesting. So, the potential is now expressed in terms of x and r, but since x is a Cartesian coordinate, and r is the radial distance, perhaps this suggests that the potential is a combination of a radial harmonic oscillator and a linear harmonic oscillator in the x-direction.

Wait, but how can that be? Because if I'm in polar coordinates, and I express x in terms of r and θ, then the potential becomes (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Hmm, but x is r cosθ, so this is equivalent to (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k (r cosθ)^2. Which is the same as the original expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a harmonic oscillator in x and a harmonic oscillator in r. Wait, but r is √(x² + y²), so that's not a linear term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Let me switch to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). So, the potential is V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Because r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(x²+y²). So then, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x²/(x² + y²)) (x² + y²) ). Wait, no, let me recompute that.

Wait, the original V(r,θ) is (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So substituting r² = x² + y² and cosθ = x/r, we have:

V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) * (x²/(x² + y²)) ). Simplifying the second term: (x² + y²) * (x²/(x²+y²)) ) = x². So V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Combining like terms, that's (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y². Which is 2k x² + (1/2)k y². 

Wait, that simplifies to V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the x-direction with frequency sqrt(2k/m) and another in the y-direction with frequency sqrt( (1/2 k)/m ), which is sqrt(k/(2m)).

Hmm, that makes things much clearer! So, the potential is separable into x and y components. So the Hamiltonian becomes H = p_x²/(2m) + p_y²/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, but wait a minute: the potential is V(x,y)=2k x² + (1/2)k y². So each direction is a harmonic oscillator. So the energy in the x-direction would be (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x, where ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), and similarly, the energy in y would be (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y, with ω_y = sqrt( (1/2)k / m ) = sqrt( k/(2m) ).

So the total energy would be the sum of these two energies: E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Wait, so substituting the frequencies, E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/(2m)).

Hmm, but looking at the options, they all have a common factor of ℏ sqrt(k/m), so perhaps I can factor that out.

Let me compute each ω in terms of sqrt(k/m):

omega_x = sqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m)
omega_y = sqrt( (1/2)k/m ) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m)

So substituting into the energy expression:

E = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m)

Let me factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = ℏ sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps I can combine these terms. Let me compute the coefficients:

sqrt(2) = 2 / sqrt(2). So (n_x + 1/2) * 2 / sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) * (1 / sqrt(2)) ) = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, that would give E = [ (2n_x +1) + (n_y + 1/2) ) ] * (ℏ sqrt(k/m)) / sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Because sqrt(2) is 2^0.5, and 1/sqrt(2) is 2^-0.5. So to factor sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(2), perhaps I can find a common denominator.

Alternatively, maybe I can express both terms with the same denominator. Let me see:

Let me write sqrt(2) as 2^{1/2} and 1/sqrt(2) as 2^{-1/2}. Let me think about combining the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2) to rationalize. Let's see:

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] * (ℏ sqrt(k/m)).

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me compute this for specific values to see if it matches any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

Wait, maybe if I can adjust the coefficients so that the total expression becomes a multiple of sqrt(k/m) and some combination of n_x and n_y.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the separation. Let me double-check.

Wait, in my calculation, the potential in x is 2k x², so the angular frequency for x is sqrt(2k/m), right? Because for a harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So in this case, 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Wait wait, I think I messed up earlier. Let me redo that part.

The standard form of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2) m ω² x². So our potential is 2k x². So 2k x² = (1/2) m ω² x² → (1/2) m ω² = 2k → m ω² = 4k → ω² = 4k/m → ω = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-component is (1/2) k y². So comparing to (1/2) m ω² y², we have ω_y² = (k)/(m) → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Ah, okay, that's a crucial correction. So earlier, I miscalculated the frequencies.

So going back: the x-component has ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), and y-component ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the energy for the x-direction is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = 2 (n_x + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

And the energy for the y-direction is (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy is E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding that: 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that's the correct one.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option A: (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ... no, doesn't match.

Option B: (n_x +3n_y +3/2) ... nope.

Option C: 2n_x +n_y + 3/2. Yeah, that's what I got.

Option D: 3n_x +2n_y +1/2. No.

So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves determining the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To solve this, the potential is analyzed in Cartesian coordinates by converting \( r \) and \( \theta \) using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting these into the potential, it simplifies to:

\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This reveals that the potential is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

The energy eigenvalues for each harmonic oscillator are given by:

\[
E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x, \quad E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting the frequencies, the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + 1 + n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Simplifying, the energy spectrum is:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure out the energy spectrum for a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The second term depends on θ, so perhaps that's the angular part. But wait, cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is equal to (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3k r²)(1 + cos2θ)/4. Hmm, but not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, the overall potential is a combination of a radial harmonic oscillator and an angular component. So maybe I can separate the problem into radial and angular parts, but perhaps in a different coordinate system or by using some change of variables.

Let me see: 1 + 3 cos²θ = 4 cos²θ + (1 - 3 cos²θ + ... Hmm, no, that's not helpful. Wait, 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3 (cosθ)^2.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this as a function that's a product of functions in r and θ, but that doesn't seem directly possible here. Because 1 + 3 cos²θ is a function of θ, but multiplied by r².

Oh, wait! That's interesting. So, the potential is now expressed in terms of x and r, but since x is a Cartesian coordinate, and r is the radial distance, perhaps this suggests that the potential is a combination of a radial harmonic oscillator and a linear harmonic oscillator in the x-direction.

Wait, but how can that be? Because if I'm in polar coordinates, and I express x in terms of r and θ, then the potential becomes (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Hmm, but x is r cosθ, so this is equivalent to (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k (r cosθ)^2. Which is the same as the original expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a harmonic oscillator in x and a harmonic oscillator in r. Wait, but r is √(x² + y²), so that's not a linear term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Let me switch to Cartesian coordinates (x, y). So, the potential is V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Because r² = x² + y², and cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(x²+y²). So then, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x²/(x² + y²)) (x² + y²) ). Wait, no, let me recompute that.

Wait, the original V(r,θ) is (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So substituting r² = x² + y² and cosθ = x/r, we have:

V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k (x² + y²) * (x²/(x² + y²)) ). Simplifying the second term: (x² + y²) * (x²/(x²+y²)) ) = x². So V(x,y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Combining like terms, that's (1/2 + 3/2)k x² + (1/2)k y². Which is 2k x² + (1/2)k y². 

Wait, that simplifies to V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². Oh! So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is a sum of two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the x-direction with frequency sqrt(2k/m) and another in the y-direction with frequency sqrt( (1/2 k)/m ), which is sqrt(k/(2m)).

Hmm, that makes things much clearer! So, the potential is separable into x and y components. So the Hamiltonian becomes H = p_x²/(2m) + p_y²/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, but wait a minute: the potential is V(x,y)=2k x² + (1/2)k y². So each direction is a harmonic oscillator. So the energy in the x-direction would be (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x, where ω_x = sqrt(2k/m), and similarly, the energy in y would be (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y, with ω_y = sqrt( (1/2)k / m ) = sqrt( k/(2m) ).

So the total energy would be the sum of these two energies: E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y.

Wait, so substituting the frequencies, E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/(2m)).

Hmm, but looking at the options, they all have a common factor of ℏ sqrt(k/m), so perhaps I can factor that out.

Let me compute each ω in terms of sqrt(k/m):

omega_x = sqrt(2k/m) = sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m)
omega_y = sqrt( (1/2)k/m ) = (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m)

So substituting into the energy expression:

E = (n_x + 1/2) * ℏ * sqrt(2) sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) * ℏ * (1/sqrt(2)) sqrt(k/m)

Let me factor out ℏ sqrt(k/m):

E = ℏ sqrt(k/m) [ (n_x + 1/2) sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps I can combine these terms. Let me compute the coefficients:

sqrt(2) = 2 / sqrt(2). So (n_x + 1/2) * 2 / sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) * (1 / sqrt(2)) ) = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, that would give E = [ (2n_x +1) + (n_y + 1/2) ) ] * (ℏ sqrt(k/m)) / sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Because sqrt(2) is 2^0.5, and 1/sqrt(2) is 2^-0.5. So to factor sqrt(2) and 1/sqrt(2), perhaps I can find a common denominator.

Alternatively, maybe I can express both terms with the same denominator. Let me see:

Let me write sqrt(2) as 2^{1/2} and 1/sqrt(2) as 2^{-1/2}. Let me think about combining the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(2) to rationalize. Let's see:

E = [ (n_x + 1/2) * sqrt(2) + (n_y + 1/2) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ] * (ℏ sqrt(k/m)).

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me compute this for specific values to see if it matches any of the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

Wait, maybe if I can adjust the coefficients so that the total expression becomes a multiple of sqrt(k/m) and some combination of n_x and n_y.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the separation. Let me double-check.

Wait, in my calculation, the potential in x is 2k x², so the angular frequency for x is sqrt(2k/m), right? Because for a harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2) m ω² x². So in this case, 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x² → (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Wait wait, I think I messed up earlier. Let me redo that part.

The standard form of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2) m ω² x². So our potential is 2k x². So 2k x² = (1/2) m ω² x² → (1/2) m ω² = 2k → m ω² = 4k → ω² = 4k/m → ω = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y-component is (1/2) k y². So comparing to (1/2) m ω² y², we have ω_y² = (k)/(m) → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Ah, okay, that's a crucial correction. So earlier, I miscalculated the frequencies.

So going back: the x-component has ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m), and y-component ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the energy for the x-direction is (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ * 2 sqrt(k/m) = 2 (n_x + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

And the energy for the y-direction is (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy is E = [2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2)] ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding that: 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 = 2n_x + n_y + 3/2.

So E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that's the correct one.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option A: (2n_x+3n_y+1/2) ... no, doesn't match.

Option B: (n_x +3n_y +3/2) ... nope.

Option C: 2n_x +n_y + 3/2. Yeah, that's what I got.

Option D: 3n_x +2n_y +1/2. No.

So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves determining the energy spectrum of a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). To solve this, the potential is analyzed in Cartesian coordinates by converting \( r \) and \( \theta \) using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting these into the potential, it simplifies to:

\[
V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
\]

This reveals that the potential is separable into two independent harmonic oscillators: one in the \( x \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), and one in the \( y \)-direction with frequency \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

The energy eigenvalues for each harmonic oscillator are given by:

\[
E_x = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x, \quad E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y.
\]

Substituting the frequencies, the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + 1 + n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Simplifying, the energy spectrum is:

\[
E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2})\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).**

Answer: C
