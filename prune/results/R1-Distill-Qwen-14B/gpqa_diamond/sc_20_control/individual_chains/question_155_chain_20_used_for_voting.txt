Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read through it again.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And we need to find the uncertainty in P_z.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for ΔP_z, I need to compute the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

But first, I should check if the state is normalized because the uncertainty formula requires the state to be normalized. Let me calculate the norm of the state vector.

The vector is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

The norm squared is (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2.

Calculating each term:
(-1/2)^2 = 1/4
(1/√2)^2 = 1/2
Another 1/4.

Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Oh, so it's already normalized. Great, so I don't have to worry about that.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z⟩. Since P_z is an operator, I have to apply it to the state and then take the inner product.

Looking at P_z's matrix:
First row: [ħ, 0, 0]
Second row: [0, 0, 0]
Third row: [0, 0, -ħ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

So when I apply P_z to the state vector |ψ⟩, I just multiply each component by the corresponding diagonal element.

The state vector |ψ⟩ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So P_z |ψ⟩ would be:
First component: ħ*(-1/2) = -ħ/2
Second component: 0*(1/√2) = 0
Third component: (-ħ)*(-1/2) = ħ/2

Now, ⟨P_z⟩ is the inner product of ψ with P_z |ψ⟩. So ψ† * P_z |ψ⟩.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = [ (-1/2), (1/√2), (-1/2) ] multiplied by [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

So computing each term:
-1/2 * (-ħ/2) = (ħ/4)
1/√2 * 0 = 0
-1/2 * (ħ/2) = (-ħ/4)

Adding them up: (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. Interesting.

Now I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just each diagonal element squared.

P_z squared would have elements:

(ħ)^2, 0, 0 in first row,
0, 0, 0 in second row,
0, 0, (-ħ)^2 = ħ² in third row.

So P_z² is a diagonal matrix with [ħ², 0, ħ²].

Applying P_z² to |ψ⟩ gives:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2)
Second component: 0 * (1/√2)
Third component: ħ² * (-1/2)

So P_z² |ψ⟩ is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is the inner product of ψ with P_z² |ψ⟩.

So again, [ (-1/2), (1/√2), (-1/2) ] multiplied by [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]

Compute each term:

-1/2 * (-ħ²/2) = (ħ²/4)
1/√2 * 0 = 0
-1/2 * (-ħ²/2) = (ħ²/4)

Adding them up: (ħ²/4 + 0 + ħ²/4) = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Wait, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. So the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) which is sqrt(ħ²/2 - 0) = sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Hmm, so looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). That must be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Let me recheck the ⟨P_z⟩ calculation. The components after P_z |ψ⟩ are (-ħ/2, 0, ħ/2). Then the inner product is:

(-1/2)*(-ħ/2) = ħ/4,

(1/√2)*0=0,

(-1/2)*(ħ/2)= -ħ/4.

Sum is ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. Correct.

⟨P_z²⟩: Each component after P_z² |ψ⟩ is (-ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2).

Inner product:

(-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) = ħ²/4,

(1/√2)*0 =0,

(-1/2)*(-ħ²/2) = ħ²/4.

Sum is ħ²/2. So yes, that's correct.

So ΔP_z is sqrt( (ħ²/2) ) = ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Verify normalization of the state
The given state is the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The norm squared is:

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = 1.
\]

Since the norm is 1, the state is normalized.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying $P_z$ to $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is the inner product of $|\psi\rangle$ with $P_z |\psi\rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z |\psi \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying $P_z^2$ to $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z^2 |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is the inner product of $|\psi\rangle$ with $P_z^2 |\psi\rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 |\psi \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
