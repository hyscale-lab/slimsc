Okay, so I have this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets. I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down.

So the setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but their radii are the same. I guess that means they're similar in size, but Planet_1's star is more massive.

The question is about the probability of a transit. Since the researchers have limited time, they want to observe the planet with a higher probability of transiting. So I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula for transit probability is something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (in the plane of the sky) to its orbital distance from the star. Wait, actually, I think the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital size and the square root of the star's size times something else.

Wait, more accurately, the probability P of a transit is given by:

P = (R_p / a)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, maybe that's different. Wait, another approach: the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a. But wait, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so maybe it's roughly R_star / a multiplied by some function.

Wait, no, another formula I recall. The probability is (R_p / a) * something. Or perhaps the transit probability is given by (R*/a) * (sin i), where i is the inclination. But wait, sin i is 90 degrees for edge-on, which gives maximum probability. But since we don't know the inclination, maybe the average probability is considered.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. For a circular orbit, the probability is:

P = (R_*/a) * ( (1 + (R_p / R_*) ) ) / ( ... )

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. But wait, no, that would make the probability larger if a is smaller. But a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (R_*/a) * (some factor about the star's position in the sky). Hmm. Alternatively, I think the transit probability can be approximated as the ratio of the area of the circle where the planet's path would cross the star's disk divided by the area of the star. Wait, no, that can't be right because it's more about the geometry of the orbit.

Wait, okay, another approach. The transit probability is the fraction of the orbit where the planet's path intersects the star's disk. For a circular orbit, the probability is approximately (R_*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since e=0 here, it's just R_*/a.

Wait, but I've read that the transit probability is given by (R_*/a) * (2 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but again, since e=0, it's (R_*/a) * 2. Wait, no, I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_*/a) times something else. Wait, maybe the formula is:

P = (R_p + R_*) / a * (1 / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try to think of it from first principles. The probability that the planet's path crosses the star's disk is based on the relative sizes and the alignment. For a distant observer, the chance is the ratio of the star's apparent size to the planet's orbital size in the sky.

So the star's angular radius is θ* = R_* / (distance). The planet's orbital semi-major axis is a, so the planet's orbital radius in the sky is a / distance. The probability that the planet's orbit lies within the star's disk (i.e., the planet transits) is (θ*) / (θ_orb), where θ_orb is the angular size of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. But wait, θ_orb is a/distance. So θ* = R*/distance, θ_orb = a/distance. So θ*/θ_orb = R_*/a.

Wait, that can't be right because if a is much larger than R*, then R*/a is small, so the probability is low. But that's correct because when the planet is far away (large a), it's less likely to transit.

So the transit probability P is approximately (R_* / a) multiplied by something else? Or is that all? Or perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, I think the formula is P ≈ ( R_* / a ) * (1 / (1 + cos i) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is (R_* / a) * (1 / (1 - e²))^0.5, but e is zero here.

Wait, I found a formula online before: The probability P is approximately (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I found is P = (R_*/a) * ( (1 + cos i) / 2 ), but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula from the transit method. The transit probability is given by:

P = (R_*/a) * ( (R_*/a) + (R_p/a) )^{-1} ?

No, perhaps that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the basic transit probability equation. The probability that a planet transits is approximately equal to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, multiplied by the ratio of (1 + R_p/R_*) to something else.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is P = (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p/R_* )) / (sqrt(1 - e^2)) ), but again, e is zero here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the problem. The question says that both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. The host stars have the same radius but different masses.

Wait, the formula for transit probability is P = (R_*/a) * ( (1 + R_p/R_*) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) ) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the main factors are (R_*/a) and the alignment.

Wait, but given that the host stars have the same radius, R1 = R2. So the only factors are the semi-major axis, a, and any other factors.

Wait, considering that the transit probability is P = (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the key is the formula for the transit probability, which is:

P ≈ (R_*/a) * ( (1 + R_p/R_*) ) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) )

But since both planets have the same mass, and R_p is the same (assuming they're Earth-like, same radius), the (1 + R_p/R_*) term is the same for both, as R_* is same for both. So the denominator term (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) would be different for each planet.

Wait, let's compute that. Planet_1's star has mass 2 M_*, Planet_2's star has mass M_*.

So for Planet_1:

Denominator term = 1 + (M1*/M_p)^(1/3) = 1 + (2 M_*/M_p)^(1/3)

Similarly for Planet_2, denominator = 1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)

Wait, but M_p is the planet's mass, which is the same for both. So 2 M_* is the star's mass for Planet_1. So for Planet_1, the denominator is 1 + (2)^(1/3) ≈ 1 + 1.26 ≈ 2.26.

For Planet_2, denominator is 1 + 1^(1/3) = 2. So the denominator for Planet_1 is about 2.26, and for Planet_2 it's 2.

So the (denominator term) for Planet_1 is higher, which would make the entire P lower for Planet_1. Because P is inversely proportional to that denominator.

Wait, but wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a) multiplied by (1 + R_p/R_*) divided by (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)).

But in this problem, R_* is same for both, R_p is same, so (1 + R_p/R_*) is same. So the ratio of P1 to P2 is (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2) * ( denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 )

Because P1 = (R_*/a1) * (1 + Rp/R*) / denominator_P1

Similarly, P2 = (R_*/a2) * (1 + Rp/R*) / denominator_P2

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2 / a1) * (denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 )

Because (R_*/a1)/(R_*/a2) = a2/a1.

So let's compute a1 and a2. Since Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_*) )/(4 pi^2). So a^3 = (G (M_*) P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

But since both planets are orbiting different stars, their a depends on their period and the host star's mass.

Wait, the formula is a^3 = (G (M_* + M_p) P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ). But since M_p << M_*, we can ignore M_p.

So a1^3 = (G (M_*) (P1)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 ), for Planet_1.

Similarly, a2^3 = (G (M_2) (P2)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Given that P1 = P2 / 3 (since P1 is three times shorter), and M1 = 2 M2 (since M1 is twice M2? Wait, no. Wait, the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M2.

So substituting:

a1^3 = (G (M2) ( (P2/3)^2 )) / (4 pi^2 )

a2^3 = (G (M2) (P2)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Dividing a1^3 by a2^3:

(a1/a2)^3 = (G M2 (P2^2 /9 )) / (G M2 P2^2 ) ) = (1/9 )

So a1/a2 = (1/9 )^(1/3 ) = 1/(9^(1/3)) )

9^(1/3) is approximately 2.08, so a1/a2 ≈ 1/2.08 ≈ 0.48.

So a1 is about 0.48 times a2.

So a2 = a1 * 2.08.

Wait, but in the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1) * (denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 )

We have a2/a1 = 1 / (a1/a2 ) = 1 / 0.48 ≈ 2.08.

Denominator_P2 is 2, denominator_P1 is approx 2.26.

So denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 = 2 / 2.26 ≈ 0.885.

So putting it all together, P1/P2 = 2.08 * 0.885 ≈ 1.845.

Which is about 1.85 times. So P1 is about 1.85 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait. The transit probability is higher if a is smaller. Because R_* is same, so R_*/a is larger when a is smaller. So a1 is smaller than a2, so R_* /a1 is larger than R_* /a2, which would make P1 higher.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, P1 is about 1.85 times higher than P2. So the probability is higher for Planet_1.

But wait, let's recalculate the a ratio.

Wait, more accurately, let's compute a1 and a2 properly.

Given that for Planet_1, a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

But wait, M1 is twice M2. So M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = P2 /3.

So substituting:

a1^3 = ( G (2 M2) ( (P2/3)^2 ) ) / (4 pi^2 )

a2^3 = ( G (M2) (P2)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Dividing a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M2) * (P2^2 /9 ) ] / [ M2 * P2^2 ) ] = (2/9 ) / 1 = 2/9.

Therefore, a1 / a2 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) = cube root of (2/9 ) ≈ cube root of 0.222 ≈ 0.6 (since 0.6^3=0.216, close to 0.222).

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.666 a1.

So in the ratio P1/P2: (a2/a1) * (denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 ) = (1/0.6) * (2 / 2.26 )

1/0.6 is approximately 1.6667.

2/2.26 is approximately 0.885.

Multiply them: 1.6667 * 0.885 ≈ 1.48.

So P1 is about 1.48 times higher than P2.

Wait, that's about 1.5 times higher. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

But let me compute more accurately.

Cube root of (2/9 ) = (2/9 )^(1/3 )

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

0.2222^(1/3) can be calculated.

0.2222 = 222.2e-3. Let's compute cube of 0.6: 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is very close to 0.2222.

So cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 = a2 * 0.606.

Thus, a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So a2/a1 is 1.65.

Denominator_P2 is 2, denominator_P1 is about 2.26.

So denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 = 2 / 2.26 ≈ 0.885.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1) * (denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 ) = 1.65 * 0.885 ≈ 1.46.

So about 1.46 times.

Which is approx 1.5 times.

So Planet_1 has about 1.5 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

Wait, but wait. Let me dig deeper because I might have missed another factor.

Wait, the transit probability also depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

But if the host stars have the same radius, R1 = R2.

Wait, so for each planet, the transit probability is (R*/a) * (1 + R_p/R_*) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3) )

But wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

P = (R_p + R_*) / a * (1/(1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)))

But more accurately, I think the transit probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_*/a) * ( (1) ) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3) )

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another source says that the transit probability is:

P = (R_*/a) * ( (1 + R_p/R_*) ) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3) )

Assuming R_p << R_*, this approximates to (R_*/a) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3) )

So, for each planet, P = (R_*/a) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3) )

Since R_*/R_* is same for both, and a is different, and M_* is different.

We can compute P1 and P2.

Given that, let's compute the ratio P1/P2.

P1 = (R_*/a1) / [1 + (M1/M_p)^(1/3) ]

M1 = 2 M2.

But M_p is same for both, so M1/M_p = 2 (M2)/M_p.

Wait, M_p is same, so for Planet_1, M1 = 2 M2. So in the denominator, (M1/M_p)^(1/3) = (2 M2 / M_p )^(1/3 )

But wait, M2 is the mass of the host star of Planet_2.

Wait, no, M2 is the host mass for Planet_2, and M1 is 2 M2.

So for Planet_1, denominator term: 1 + (2 M2 / M_p )^(1/3 )

For Planet_2, denominator term: 1 + ( M2 / M_p )^(1/3 )

Since M_p is same for both, let's denote k = M2 / M_p.

So for Planet_1: denominator term is 1 + (2k )^(1/3 )

For Planet_2: denominator term is 1 + (k )^(1/3 )

So the ratio P1/P2 is:

( (R_*/a1) / [1 + (2k)^(1/3 ) ] ) / ( (R_*/a2) / [1 + (k)^(1/3 ) ] )

Simplify:

= (a2/a1) * [ (1 + k^(1/3 )) / (1 + (2k )^(1/3 )) ]

Now, from Kepler's law, a scales with (M_* P^2 )^(1/3 )

So for a1, a1 ~ ( M1 P1^2 )^(1/3 )

M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 ~ ( 2 M2 ( P2^2 /9 ) )^(1/3 ) = ( (2/9 ) M2 P2^2 )^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 ~ ( M2 P2^2 )^(1/3 )

Thus, a1 = a2 * (2/9 )^(1/3 )

So a2/a1 = 1/(2/9 )^(1/3 ) = (9/2 )^(1/3 )

Which is same as (4.5 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.65.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

Now, let's compute the other factor:

[ (1 + k^(1/3 )) / (1 + (2k )^(1/3 )) ]

But what is k? k = M2 / M_p.

But M_p is the planet's mass. Since both planets have same mass, same M_p.

But without knowing M_p's value, perhaps it's a factor that remains as is, but let's think:

If M_p is much less than M2, then k is small, so k^(1/3 ) is small.

If M_p is a significant fraction of M2, then it's larger.

But as Earth-like planets, M_p is much smaller than M2, which is a star. So k is small, let's approximate k^(1/3 ) <<1.

So 1 + k^(1/3 ) ≈ 1, and 1 + (2k )^(1/3 ) ≈1.

Wait, but then the ratio becomes approximately 1, which can't be right. So perhaps I need to not make that approximation.

Wait, perhaps M_p is not negligible compared to M2. Let's see.

But without exact numbers, perhaps it's better to proceed with the variables.

Alternatively, perhaps M_p is much smaller than M_*, so that M_*/M_p is large, making the denominator term approximately (M_*/M_p )^(1/3 ), and the 1 is negligible.

In that case, denominator_P1 ≈ (2 M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) = 2^(1/3 ) (M2/M_p )^(1/3 )

Denominator_P2 ≈ (M2/M_p )^(1/3 )

So the ratio becomes:

P1/P2 = (a2/a1 ) * [ ( M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) ) / ( 2^(1/3 ) (M2/M_p )^(1/3 )) ) ]

The (M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) terms cancel out.

So ratio becomes (a2/a1 ) * (1/ 2^(1/3 ) )

a2/a1 is (9/2 )^(1/3 ) = (4.5 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.65.

2^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.26.

So 1.65 / 1.26 ≈ 1.309.

So P1 is about 1.3 times P2.

Wait, but earlier I had about 1.46 times when considering the denominator terms as 2 and 2.26. Hmm, but this approach gives a different number. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is simply proportional to (R_*/a) and not involving the mass of the star.

Wait, another possible approach: the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_* / M_p )^(1/3) )) )

But if that's the case, then for P1 and P2.

P1 = (R_*/a1) / (1 + (2 M2/M_p )^(1/3) )

P2 = (R_*/a2) / (1 + (M2/M_p )^(1/3) )

Then the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1) * [ (1 + (M2/M_p )^(1/3) ) / (1 + (2 M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) ) ]

Which is the same as earlier.

So let's compute this ratio.

Assuming that M_p << M2, so (M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) is a large number, say x.

Then the ratio becomes:

P1/P2 ≈ (a2/a1 ) * [ x / (2^(1/3 ) x ) ) ] = (a2/a1 ) * (1/2^(1/3 ) )

As before, which gives 1.65 / 1.26 ≈ 1.309.

So P1 is about 1.3 times P2.

Which is about a 30% higher probability for Planet_1.

Now, looking at the options, the options are about factors of 1.5 or 2.7 times.

The options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher.

So according to my calculation, Planet_1's P is about 1.3 times higher than P2. But this isn't among the options. The closest is option C, which says 1.65 times higher for P1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio.

Wait, let me re-do the a ratio calculation.

Given:

a^3 = ( G (M_*) P² )/(4 pi² )

So for a1 and a2.

M1 = 2 M2

P1 = P2 /3

So a1^3 = (G (2 M2) (P2² /9 )) / (4 pi² )

a2^3 = (G (M2) (P2² )) / (4 pi² )

Dividing a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 M2 * (P2²/9 )) / ( M2 * P2² ) ) = (2/9 )

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3

Thus, a1 = a2 * (2/9 )^(1/3 )

So a2 = a1 * (9/2 )^(1/3 )

Which is (9/2 )^(1/3 )= (4.5 )^(1/3 )≈1.65.

So a2 = 1.65 a1.

So a2/a1=1.65.

So in the ratio P1/P2, when considering the (a2/a1) factor, it's 1.65.

But in transit probability, P is proportional to (R_*/a ). So if a is smaller, P is larger.

So for P1, (R_*/a1 ) is bigger than (R_*/a2 )

But when considering all factors, P1 is (R_*/a1 ) / denominator_P1, and P2 is (R_*/a2 ) / denominator_P2.

In the approximation where M_* >> M_p, the denominators are approximately (M_* / M_p )^(1/3 )

But let's think of it as (M_*/M_p )^(1/3 ), which for Planet_1 is (2 M2 / M_p )^(1/3 ) = 2^(1/3 ) (M2/M_p )^(1/3 )

Similarly, Planet_2's denominator is (M2/M_p )^(1/3 )

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1 ) * [ denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 ]

Which is (1.65 ) * [ (M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) / ( 2^(1/3 ) (M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) ) ]

So the (M2/M_p ) terms cancel, and we get (1.65 ) * (1/ 2^(1/3 ) )

2^(1/3 )=1.26.

So 1.65 / 1.26 ≈1.31.

So P1 is about 1.31 times P2.

Thus, Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability.

But according to calculation, it's about 1.3 times, so none of the options match exactly. However, perhaps the correct calculation considers only the a ratio and not the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability does not involve the (M_* / M_p )^(1/3 ) factor. Maybe that's part of the RV method's probability, not the transit probability.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is simply (R_*/a ), as the main factor, and other factors are considered.

In that case, the ratio P1/P2 = (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2 ) ) = a2/a1 =1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times higher.

Which would make option C correct.

But wait, why would the RV method's detection affect the transit probability? Because both planets are already detected via RV, so perhaps the RV's factors are not part of the transit probability calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the RV method gives us the inclination, but in this case, both planets have the same minimum mass, implying similar RV semi-amplitudes.

But for transit probability, the inclination is a factor. But without knowing the inclination, we assume it's random. So the transit probability is based on the geometric probability, which is (R_*/a ), or similar.

Wait, according to the transit method, the geometric probability is (R_* + R_p ) / a. Since R_p << R_*, it's approx R_*/a.

So the geometric probability is (R_*/a ), assuming edge-on orbit. But the actual probability is lower because not all orbits are edge-on. The actual probability is the geometric probability multiplied by the probability of the correct inclination, which depends on the RV data.

Wait, but in reality, the RV method gives a lower limit on the planet's mass because it depends on sin i, where i is the inclination. If the planet's orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), sin i is 1, and we get the true mass. Otherwise, we get a minimum mass.

But in this question, both planets have the same minimum mass and same period. But their true masses could be higher if their inclinations are lower.

But the question says that both planets have the same mass. Wait, no, the question says both have the same minimum masses. Or, no, the question says "both have the same masses" — I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question states: "Both of these planets have the same masses." So their true masses are the same, not just the minimum masses. So the RV method has already confirmed their masses, meaning their sin i must be 1, implying edge-on orbits.

Ah! That's a crucial point. If the RV method has detected their masses (not just the minimum mass), then their orbits are edge-on, because RV measures the true mass. That would mean that their inclination i is 90 degrees, so the transit probability is higher.

Wait, if the planets have edge-on orbits, then the geometric probability is 1. So the probability of transit is not the usual (R_*/a ), but actually 1 if the orbit is edge-on and the planet's path crosses the star's disk, which depends on whether the distance a is such that the planet's path is in front of the star.

Wait, no. If the inclination is 90 degrees, the planet's orbit is edge-on, so the probability of transit is 100% if the orbital plane is aligned. But the question states that the planets have already been detected via RV, so their masses are known, implying that their orbits are edge-on. Hence, their transit probability is not a probabilistic thing — it's either they transit or not.

Wait, but that can't be correct because even with edge-on orbits, the planet might not pass in front of the star if the orbital plane is not exactly aligned with our line of sight.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In reality, even with an edge-on orbit (i=90 degrees), the planet may or may not transit, depending on the alignment of the orbit in the sky. The transit probability in that case is (R_*/a ), as that's the fraction of the orbit where the planet's path crosses the star's disk.

Ah, right. So even if i=90 degrees, the planet may not transit every orbit. It's just that the RV method can detect it regardless, but the transit depends on the alignment.

So for the transit probability, the formula (R_*/a ) still applies, because it's the fraction of the orbit where the planet passes in front of the star.

So back to the calculation.

If the transit probability is (R_*/a ), and considering that a is smaller for Planet_1, then Planet_1 has a higher R_*/a, hence higher transit probability.

But earlier, considering the (M_* / M_p )^(1/3 ) term, which complicates things, but perhaps in reality that term isn't part of the transit probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct transit probability is only (R_*/a ), so let's compute that.

a1 = (2 M2 * (P2/3 )^2 )^(1/3 ) / sqrt( G * (4 pi² ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the ratio approach.

We've already found that a1 = a2 * (2/9 )^(1/3 ) ≈ a2 * 0.6.

Thus, a1 is smaller than a2.

Thus, R_* / a1 is larger than R_* / a2.

So transit probability for Planet_1 is (R_*/a1 ) = ( R_*/a2 ) * (a2/a1 ) = (R_*/a2 ) *1.65.

So P1 = 1.65 * (R_* / a2 )

P2 = R_* / a2.

Thus, P1 = 1.65 * P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is 1.65 times higher.

Which would mean that the researchers should observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.

Looking back at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula and the given parameters. The transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the key factor is the ratio \( \frac{1}{a} \), which depends on the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_* \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* P^2
\]

### Step 1: Compute the semi-major axis ratio
For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter).

Using Kepler's law:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{(2M_2)(P_2/3)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Compute the transit probability ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.65
\]
This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2's probability is not 1.5 times higher.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Planet_1's probability is not 2.7 times higher.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller orbital semi-major axis, making it the better target for observation. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets. I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down.

So the setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but their radii are the same. I guess that means they're similar in size, but Planet_1's star is more massive.

The question is about the probability of a transit. Since the researchers have limited time, they want to observe the planet with a higher probability of transiting. So I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula for transit probability is something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (in the plane of the sky) to its orbital distance from the star. Wait, actually, I think the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital size and the square root of the star's size times something else.

Wait, more accurately, the probability P of a transit is given by:

P = (R_p / a)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, maybe that's different. Wait, another approach: the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a. But wait, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so maybe it's roughly R_star / a multiplied by some function.

Wait, no, another formula I recall. The probability is (R_p / a) * something. Or perhaps the transit probability is given by (R*/a) * (sin i), where i is the inclination. But wait, sin i is 90 degrees for edge-on, which gives maximum probability. But since we don't know the inclination, maybe the average probability is considered.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. For a circular orbit, the probability is:

P = (R_*/a) * ( (1 + (R_p / R_*) ) ) / ( ... )

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. But wait, no, that would make the probability larger if a is smaller. But a is the semi-major axis.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (R_*/a) * (some factor about the star's position in the sky). Hmm. Alternatively, I think the transit probability can be approximated as the ratio of the area of the circle where the planet's path would cross the star's disk divided by the area of the star. Wait, no, that can't be right because it's more about the geometry of the orbit.

Wait, okay, another approach. The transit probability is the fraction of the orbit where the planet's path intersects the star's disk. For a circular orbit, the probability is approximately (R_*/a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since e=0 here, it's just R_*/a.

Wait, but I've read that the transit probability is given by (R_*/a) * (2 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but again, since e=0, it's (R_*/a) * 2. Wait, no, I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is (R_*/a) times something else. Wait, maybe the formula is:

P = (R_p + R_*) / a * (1 / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try to think of it from first principles. The probability that the planet's path crosses the star's disk is based on the relative sizes and the alignment. For a distant observer, the chance is the ratio of the star's apparent size to the planet's orbital size in the sky.

So the star's angular radius is θ* = R_* / (distance). The planet's orbital semi-major axis is a, so the planet's orbital radius in the sky is a / distance. The probability that the planet's orbit lies within the star's disk (i.e., the planet transits) is (θ*) / (θ_orb), where θ_orb is the angular size of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. But wait, θ_orb is a/distance. So θ* = R*/distance, θ_orb = a/distance. So θ*/θ_orb = R_*/a.

Wait, that can't be right because if a is much larger than R*, then R*/a is small, so the probability is low. But that's correct because when the planet is far away (large a), it's less likely to transit.

So the transit probability P is approximately (R_* / a) multiplied by something else? Or is that all? Or perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, I think the formula is P ≈ ( R_* / a ) * (1 / (1 + cos i) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is (R_* / a) * (1 / (1 - e²))^0.5, but e is zero here.

Wait, I found a formula online before: The probability P is approximately (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I found is P = (R_*/a) * ( (1 + cos i) / 2 ), but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula from the transit method. The transit probability is given by:

P = (R_*/a) * ( (R_*/a) + (R_p/a) )^{-1} ?

No, perhaps that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the basic transit probability equation. The probability that a planet transits is approximately equal to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, multiplied by the ratio of (1 + R_p/R_*) to something else.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is P = (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_p/R_* )) / (sqrt(1 - e^2)) ), but again, e is zero here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the problem. The question says that both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. The host stars have the same radius but different masses.

Wait, the formula for transit probability is P = (R_*/a) * ( (1 + R_p/R_*) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) ) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the main factors are (R_*/a) and the alignment.

Wait, but given that the host stars have the same radius, R1 = R2. So the only factors are the semi-major axis, a, and any other factors.

Wait, considering that the transit probability is P = (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the key is the formula for the transit probability, which is:

P ≈ (R_*/a) * ( (1 + R_p/R_*) ) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) )

But since both planets have the same mass, and R_p is the same (assuming they're Earth-like, same radius), the (1 + R_p/R_*) term is the same for both, as R_* is same for both. So the denominator term (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)) would be different for each planet.

Wait, let's compute that. Planet_1's star has mass 2 M_*, Planet_2's star has mass M_*.

So for Planet_1:

Denominator term = 1 + (M1*/M_p)^(1/3) = 1 + (2 M_*/M_p)^(1/3)

Similarly for Planet_2, denominator = 1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)

Wait, but M_p is the planet's mass, which is the same for both. So 2 M_* is the star's mass for Planet_1. So for Planet_1, the denominator is 1 + (2)^(1/3) ≈ 1 + 1.26 ≈ 2.26.

For Planet_2, denominator is 1 + 1^(1/3) = 2. So the denominator for Planet_1 is about 2.26, and for Planet_2 it's 2.

So the (denominator term) for Planet_1 is higher, which would make the entire P lower for Planet_1. Because P is inversely proportional to that denominator.

Wait, but wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a) multiplied by (1 + R_p/R_*) divided by (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)).

But in this problem, R_* is same for both, R_p is same, so (1 + R_p/R_*) is same. So the ratio of P1 to P2 is (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2) * ( denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 )

Because P1 = (R_*/a1) * (1 + Rp/R*) / denominator_P1

Similarly, P2 = (R_*/a2) * (1 + Rp/R*) / denominator_P2

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2 / a1) * (denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 )

Because (R_*/a1)/(R_*/a2) = a2/a1.

So let's compute a1 and a2. Since Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_*) )/(4 pi^2). So a^3 = (G (M_*) P^2 )/(4 pi^2 )

But since both planets are orbiting different stars, their a depends on their period and the host star's mass.

Wait, the formula is a^3 = (G (M_* + M_p) P^2 )/(4 pi^2 ). But since M_p << M_*, we can ignore M_p.

So a1^3 = (G (M_*) (P1)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 ), for Planet_1.

Similarly, a2^3 = (G (M_2) (P2)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Given that P1 = P2 / 3 (since P1 is three times shorter), and M1 = 2 M2 (since M1 is twice M2? Wait, no. Wait, the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M2.

So substituting:

a1^3 = (G (M2) ( (P2/3)^2 )) / (4 pi^2 )

a2^3 = (G (M2) (P2)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Dividing a1^3 by a2^3:

(a1/a2)^3 = (G M2 (P2^2 /9 )) / (G M2 P2^2 ) ) = (1/9 )

So a1/a2 = (1/9 )^(1/3 ) = 1/(9^(1/3)) )

9^(1/3) is approximately 2.08, so a1/a2 ≈ 1/2.08 ≈ 0.48.

So a1 is about 0.48 times a2.

So a2 = a1 * 2.08.

Wait, but in the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1) * (denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 )

We have a2/a1 = 1 / (a1/a2 ) = 1 / 0.48 ≈ 2.08.

Denominator_P2 is 2, denominator_P1 is approx 2.26.

So denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 = 2 / 2.26 ≈ 0.885.

So putting it all together, P1/P2 = 2.08 * 0.885 ≈ 1.845.

Which is about 1.85 times. So P1 is about 1.85 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait. The transit probability is higher if a is smaller. Because R_* is same, so R_*/a is larger when a is smaller. So a1 is smaller than a2, so R_* /a1 is larger than R_* /a2, which would make P1 higher.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, P1 is about 1.85 times higher than P2. So the probability is higher for Planet_1.

But wait, let's recalculate the a ratio.

Wait, more accurately, let's compute a1 and a2 properly.

Given that for Planet_1, a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

But wait, M1 is twice M2. So M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = P2 /3.

So substituting:

a1^3 = ( G (2 M2) ( (P2/3)^2 ) ) / (4 pi^2 )

a2^3 = ( G (M2) (P2)^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

Dividing a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M2) * (P2^2 /9 ) ] / [ M2 * P2^2 ) ] = (2/9 ) / 1 = 2/9.

Therefore, a1 / a2 = (2/9 )^(1/3 ) = cube root of (2/9 ) ≈ cube root of 0.222 ≈ 0.6 (since 0.6^3=0.216, close to 0.222).

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.666 a1.

So in the ratio P1/P2: (a2/a1) * (denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 ) = (1/0.6) * (2 / 2.26 )

1/0.6 is approximately 1.6667.

2/2.26 is approximately 0.885.

Multiply them: 1.6667 * 0.885 ≈ 1.48.

So P1 is about 1.48 times higher than P2.

Wait, that's about 1.5 times higher. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

But let me compute more accurately.

Cube root of (2/9 ) = (2/9 )^(1/3 )

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

0.2222^(1/3) can be calculated.

0.2222 = 222.2e-3. Let's compute cube of 0.6: 0.6^3 = 0.216, which is very close to 0.2222.

So cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 = a2 * 0.606.

Thus, a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So a2/a1 is 1.65.

Denominator_P2 is 2, denominator_P1 is about 2.26.

So denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 = 2 / 2.26 ≈ 0.885.

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1) * (denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 ) = 1.65 * 0.885 ≈ 1.46.

So about 1.46 times.

Which is approx 1.5 times.

So Planet_1 has about 1.5 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

Wait, but wait. Let me dig deeper because I might have missed another factor.

Wait, the transit probability also depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

But if the host stars have the same radius, R1 = R2.

Wait, so for each planet, the transit probability is (R*/a) * (1 + R_p/R_*) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3) )

But wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

P = (R_p + R_*) / a * (1/(1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3)))

But more accurately, I think the transit probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_*/a) * ( (1) ) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3) )

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another source says that the transit probability is:

P = (R_*/a) * ( (1 + R_p/R_*) ) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3) )

Assuming R_p << R_*, this approximates to (R_*/a) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3) )

So, for each planet, P = (R_*/a) / (1 + (M_*/M_p)^(1/3) )

Since R_*/R_* is same for both, and a is different, and M_* is different.

We can compute P1 and P2.

Given that, let's compute the ratio P1/P2.

P1 = (R_*/a1) / [1 + (M1/M_p)^(1/3) ]

M1 = 2 M2.

But M_p is same for both, so M1/M_p = 2 (M2)/M_p.

Wait, M_p is same, so for Planet_1, M1 = 2 M2. So in the denominator, (M1/M_p)^(1/3) = (2 M2 / M_p )^(1/3 )

But wait, M2 is the mass of the host star of Planet_2.

Wait, no, M2 is the host mass for Planet_2, and M1 is 2 M2.

So for Planet_1, denominator term: 1 + (2 M2 / M_p )^(1/3 )

For Planet_2, denominator term: 1 + ( M2 / M_p )^(1/3 )

Since M_p is same for both, let's denote k = M2 / M_p.

So for Planet_1: denominator term is 1 + (2k )^(1/3 )

For Planet_2: denominator term is 1 + (k )^(1/3 )

So the ratio P1/P2 is:

( (R_*/a1) / [1 + (2k)^(1/3 ) ] ) / ( (R_*/a2) / [1 + (k)^(1/3 ) ] )

Simplify:

= (a2/a1) * [ (1 + k^(1/3 )) / (1 + (2k )^(1/3 )) ]

Now, from Kepler's law, a scales with (M_* P^2 )^(1/3 )

So for a1, a1 ~ ( M1 P1^2 )^(1/3 )

M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So a1 ~ ( 2 M2 ( P2^2 /9 ) )^(1/3 ) = ( (2/9 ) M2 P2^2 )^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 ~ ( M2 P2^2 )^(1/3 )

Thus, a1 = a2 * (2/9 )^(1/3 )

So a2/a1 = 1/(2/9 )^(1/3 ) = (9/2 )^(1/3 )

Which is same as (4.5 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.65.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

Now, let's compute the other factor:

[ (1 + k^(1/3 )) / (1 + (2k )^(1/3 )) ]

But what is k? k = M2 / M_p.

But M_p is the planet's mass. Since both planets have same mass, same M_p.

But without knowing M_p's value, perhaps it's a factor that remains as is, but let's think:

If M_p is much less than M2, then k is small, so k^(1/3 ) is small.

If M_p is a significant fraction of M2, then it's larger.

But as Earth-like planets, M_p is much smaller than M2, which is a star. So k is small, let's approximate k^(1/3 ) <<1.

So 1 + k^(1/3 ) ≈ 1, and 1 + (2k )^(1/3 ) ≈1.

Wait, but then the ratio becomes approximately 1, which can't be right. So perhaps I need to not make that approximation.

Wait, perhaps M_p is not negligible compared to M2. Let's see.

But without exact numbers, perhaps it's better to proceed with the variables.

Alternatively, perhaps M_p is much smaller than M_*, so that M_*/M_p is large, making the denominator term approximately (M_*/M_p )^(1/3 ), and the 1 is negligible.

In that case, denominator_P1 ≈ (2 M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) = 2^(1/3 ) (M2/M_p )^(1/3 )

Denominator_P2 ≈ (M2/M_p )^(1/3 )

So the ratio becomes:

P1/P2 = (a2/a1 ) * [ ( M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) ) / ( 2^(1/3 ) (M2/M_p )^(1/3 )) ) ]

The (M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) terms cancel out.

So ratio becomes (a2/a1 ) * (1/ 2^(1/3 ) )

a2/a1 is (9/2 )^(1/3 ) = (4.5 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.65.

2^(1/3 ) ≈ 1.26.

So 1.65 / 1.26 ≈ 1.309.

So P1 is about 1.3 times P2.

Wait, but earlier I had about 1.46 times when considering the denominator terms as 2 and 2.26. Hmm, but this approach gives a different number. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is simply proportional to (R_*/a) and not involving the mass of the star.

Wait, another possible approach: the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_* / M_p )^(1/3) )) )

But if that's the case, then for P1 and P2.

P1 = (R_*/a1) / (1 + (2 M2/M_p )^(1/3) )

P2 = (R_*/a2) / (1 + (M2/M_p )^(1/3) )

Then the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1) * [ (1 + (M2/M_p )^(1/3) ) / (1 + (2 M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) ) ]

Which is the same as earlier.

So let's compute this ratio.

Assuming that M_p << M2, so (M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) is a large number, say x.

Then the ratio becomes:

P1/P2 ≈ (a2/a1 ) * [ x / (2^(1/3 ) x ) ) ] = (a2/a1 ) * (1/2^(1/3 ) )

As before, which gives 1.65 / 1.26 ≈ 1.309.

So P1 is about 1.3 times P2.

Which is about a 30% higher probability for Planet_1.

Now, looking at the options, the options are about factors of 1.5 or 2.7 times.

The options are:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher.

So according to my calculation, Planet_1's P is about 1.3 times higher than P2. But this isn't among the options. The closest is option C, which says 1.65 times higher for P1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the a ratio.

Wait, let me re-do the a ratio calculation.

Given:

a^3 = ( G (M_*) P² )/(4 pi² )

So for a1 and a2.

M1 = 2 M2

P1 = P2 /3

So a1^3 = (G (2 M2) (P2² /9 )) / (4 pi² )

a2^3 = (G (M2) (P2² )) / (4 pi² )

Dividing a1^3 / a2^3 = (2 M2 * (P2²/9 )) / ( M2 * P2² ) ) = (2/9 )

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3

Thus, a1 = a2 * (2/9 )^(1/3 )

So a2 = a1 * (9/2 )^(1/3 )

Which is (9/2 )^(1/3 )= (4.5 )^(1/3 )≈1.65.

So a2 = 1.65 a1.

So a2/a1=1.65.

So in the ratio P1/P2, when considering the (a2/a1) factor, it's 1.65.

But in transit probability, P is proportional to (R_*/a ). So if a is smaller, P is larger.

So for P1, (R_*/a1 ) is bigger than (R_*/a2 )

But when considering all factors, P1 is (R_*/a1 ) / denominator_P1, and P2 is (R_*/a2 ) / denominator_P2.

In the approximation where M_* >> M_p, the denominators are approximately (M_* / M_p )^(1/3 )

But let's think of it as (M_*/M_p )^(1/3 ), which for Planet_1 is (2 M2 / M_p )^(1/3 ) = 2^(1/3 ) (M2/M_p )^(1/3 )

Similarly, Planet_2's denominator is (M2/M_p )^(1/3 )

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2/a1 ) * [ denominator_P2 / denominator_P1 ]

Which is (1.65 ) * [ (M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) / ( 2^(1/3 ) (M2/M_p )^(1/3 ) ) ]

So the (M2/M_p ) terms cancel, and we get (1.65 ) * (1/ 2^(1/3 ) )

2^(1/3 )=1.26.

So 1.65 / 1.26 ≈1.31.

So P1 is about 1.31 times P2.

Thus, Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability.

But according to calculation, it's about 1.3 times, so none of the options match exactly. However, perhaps the correct calculation considers only the a ratio and not the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability does not involve the (M_* / M_p )^(1/3 ) factor. Maybe that's part of the RV method's probability, not the transit probability.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is simply (R_*/a ), as the main factor, and other factors are considered.

In that case, the ratio P1/P2 = (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2 ) ) = a2/a1 =1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 times higher.

Which would make option C correct.

But wait, why would the RV method's detection affect the transit probability? Because both planets are already detected via RV, so perhaps the RV's factors are not part of the transit probability calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the RV method gives us the inclination, but in this case, both planets have the same minimum mass, implying similar RV semi-amplitudes.

But for transit probability, the inclination is a factor. But without knowing the inclination, we assume it's random. So the transit probability is based on the geometric probability, which is (R_*/a ), or similar.

Wait, according to the transit method, the geometric probability is (R_* + R_p ) / a. Since R_p << R_*, it's approx R_*/a.

So the geometric probability is (R_*/a ), assuming edge-on orbit. But the actual probability is lower because not all orbits are edge-on. The actual probability is the geometric probability multiplied by the probability of the correct inclination, which depends on the RV data.

Wait, but in reality, the RV method gives a lower limit on the planet's mass because it depends on sin i, where i is the inclination. If the planet's orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), sin i is 1, and we get the true mass. Otherwise, we get a minimum mass.

But in this question, both planets have the same minimum mass and same period. But their true masses could be higher if their inclinations are lower.

But the question says that both planets have the same mass. Wait, no, the question says both have the same minimum masses. Or, no, the question says "both have the same masses" — I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question states: "Both of these planets have the same masses." So their true masses are the same, not just the minimum masses. So the RV method has already confirmed their masses, meaning their sin i must be 1, implying edge-on orbits.

Ah! That's a crucial point. If the RV method has detected their masses (not just the minimum mass), then their orbits are edge-on, because RV measures the true mass. That would mean that their inclination i is 90 degrees, so the transit probability is higher.

Wait, if the planets have edge-on orbits, then the geometric probability is 1. So the probability of transit is not the usual (R_*/a ), but actually 1 if the orbit is edge-on and the planet's path crosses the star's disk, which depends on whether the distance a is such that the planet's path is in front of the star.

Wait, no. If the inclination is 90 degrees, the planet's orbit is edge-on, so the probability of transit is 100% if the orbital plane is aligned. But the question states that the planets have already been detected via RV, so their masses are known, implying that their orbits are edge-on. Hence, their transit probability is not a probabilistic thing — it's either they transit or not.

Wait, but that can't be correct because even with edge-on orbits, the planet might not pass in front of the star if the orbital plane is not exactly aligned with our line of sight.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In reality, even with an edge-on orbit (i=90 degrees), the planet may or may not transit, depending on the alignment of the orbit in the sky. The transit probability in that case is (R_*/a ), as that's the fraction of the orbit where the planet's path crosses the star's disk.

Ah, right. So even if i=90 degrees, the planet may not transit every orbit. It's just that the RV method can detect it regardless, but the transit depends on the alignment.

So for the transit probability, the formula (R_*/a ) still applies, because it's the fraction of the orbit where the planet passes in front of the star.

So back to the calculation.

If the transit probability is (R_*/a ), and considering that a is smaller for Planet_1, then Planet_1 has a higher R_*/a, hence higher transit probability.

But earlier, considering the (M_* / M_p )^(1/3 ) term, which complicates things, but perhaps in reality that term isn't part of the transit probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct transit probability is only (R_*/a ), so let's compute that.

a1 = (2 M2 * (P2/3 )^2 )^(1/3 ) / sqrt( G * (4 pi² ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the ratio approach.

We've already found that a1 = a2 * (2/9 )^(1/3 ) ≈ a2 * 0.6.

Thus, a1 is smaller than a2.

Thus, R_* / a1 is larger than R_* / a2.

So transit probability for Planet_1 is (R_*/a1 ) = ( R_*/a2 ) * (a2/a1 ) = (R_*/a2 ) *1.65.

So P1 = 1.65 * (R_* / a2 )

P2 = R_* / a2.

Thus, P1 = 1.65 * P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is 1.65 times higher.

Which would mean that the researchers should observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.

Looking back at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula and the given parameters. The transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the key factor is the ratio \( \frac{1}{a} \), which depends on the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_* \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* P^2
\]

### Step 1: Compute the semi-major axis ratio
For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter).

Using Kepler's law:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{(2M_2)(P_2/3)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6
\]
Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Compute the transit probability ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since \( R_* \) is the same for both stars:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.65
\]
This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 does not have a higher probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2's probability is not 1.5 times higher.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Planet_1's probability is not 2.7 times higher.

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has a higher transit probability due to its smaller orbital semi-major axis, making it the better target for observation. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
