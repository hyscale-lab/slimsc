Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I remember that ring-closing metathesis is a reaction where a diene undergoes a process to form a ring, usually with the help of a catalyst like Grubbs catalyst. The catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are at positions 3,4, and 5. Specifically, 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and 5 has an isopropyl group. So the ring has six carbons, with the double bond at position 1, making it cyclohex-1-ene.

Wait, numbering in cyclohexene is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents are on C3, C4, and C5.

Now, ring-closing metathesis typically involves a diene. The diene would have two double bonds or perhaps one double bond with substituents that can form a ring when the metathesis happens. But wait, no, metathesis usually involves two alkenes. Oh, right, in ring-closing metathesis, you have a diene with two double bonds that undergo exchange to form a ring. Or maybe I got that wrong. Wait, actually, ring-closing metathesis usually involves a diene with two double bonds that are connected in such a way that when the catalyst breaks the bonds, a new ring forms.

Wait, no, more accurately, ring-closing metathesis typically involves a single diene that can cyclize when the catalyst causes the exchange of the ends. So for example, if you have a molecule with two double bonds, the catalyst can cause the ends to cross, forming a ring.

Wait, but alternatively, I think the process can also involve a terminal alkyne, but in this case, it's about alkenes.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: when you have a molecule with two alkenes separated by a certain number of carbons, the ring-closing metathesis will form a ring by connecting the ends. So the starting material would have two double bonds, and the positions of those double bonds would determine the size of the ring and the substituents.

The target is a cyclohexene, so the ring has six members. So the starting material should have eight carbons, because when the two ends come together, four carbons would form the ring, but wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, let me think about the structure.

The target is 3,4-dimethyl-5-isopropylcyclohex-1-ene. So the ring is six carbons, with substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, these substituents would be part of a chain that will form the ring.

In ring-closing metathesis, the starting material is an alkyne or a diene. Wait, no, more accurately, the starting material is a diene, which upon metathesis forms the ring. So for a cyclohexene, the starting material must have a diene that can form a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a dialkene that, when the metathesis occurs, forms the ring. So the diene has two double bonds or is a conjugated diene?

Wait, no, the starting material for ring-closing metathesis is an alkyne with two alkenes, perhaps, or a molecule with two alkenes in positions that, when the metathesis occurs, they form a ring.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of the starting material. The target molecule is a cyclohexene with substituents. So the starting material before metathesis would be a diene that can cyclize into the ring.

So the target has substituents at positions 3,4,5. Let me number the ring as positions 1 (the double bond between 1 and 2), then 2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the starting material as a chain that will form the ring.

Let me think about the positions. The target has substituents at 3,4,5.

So perhaps the starting material is a diene that, when it undergoes metathesis, forms the ring with substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an octadiene. Because when you form a six-membered ring via metathesis, you would need a chain that is longer.

Wait, 6-membered ring would require a diene with two double bonds or a chain that can form the ring upon breaking and rejoining.

Wait, perhaps it's an octadiene. So, the starting material is an 8-carbon diene, which, when the metathesis occurs, forms a six-membered ring with substituents.

Wait, so the starting material has two alkenes, and the positions of these alkenes would determine where the ring forms.

So for a cyclohexene, the metathesis would connect two ends of the chain to form a six-membered ring. So the starting material would be a diene like octa-diene, with the double bonds positioned such that when they react, the ring forms.

Let me try to figure out the structure.

The target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexene.

So the cyclohexene has substituents on 3,4,5. So the substituents are at positions 3,4, and 5.

In the starting material, which is a diene, these substituents would be at positions that, upon ring-closing, end up on 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a molecule where the substituents are positioned so that when the ring forms, they are on the correct carbons.

Wait, let me imagine the starting material as a chain with substituents. Suppose we have a chain of 8 carbons with two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

That would be an eight-carbon chain with double bonds at 1,2 and 7,8 positions.

Wait, but in that case, during metathesis, the ends (1 and 7) would form the ring.

Wait, but octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at the ends, but that's a conjugated diene? No, 1,7 would be separated by several carbons.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene with the substituents in such a way that when the ring forms, they end up in the correct positions.

Wait, or maybe the starting material is a diene where the double bonds are at positions that, when the ring forms, the substituents are placed correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with two double bonds, such that when the metathesis occurs, the ends connect to form the ring.

Wait, let's think about the structure: target is cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4,5. So substituents are on adjacent carbons.

So in the starting material, these substituents must be on adjacent carbons in the chain, which will become adjacent in the ring after the ring closes.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are on the same positions in the chain that will become the ring.

So for example, in the starting material, the substituents are on carbons 3 and 4, which in the ring become 3,4, and 5.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try drawing it out.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the metathesis. In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst (like Grubbs) breaks the double bonds and forms new ones to create the ring.

So starting with a diene, the reaction would swap the ends of the alkenes to form a ring.

So for a six-membered ring, the starting material would be an 8-carbon diene, maybe with double bonds at positions that would allow the ring to form when the ends cross.

Wait, for example, suppose the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 7-8.

Wait, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diene such that the two double bonds are in positions that, when the metathesis occurs, the substituents (like isopropyl and dimethyl groups) are positioned correctly.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at 3,4,5. So when the ring closes, those substituents end up at 3,4,5 in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene (option A). So, the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, but that's a 10-carbon chain, no. Wait, octa means 8 carbons. So the structure would be something like:

Positions 1-2: double bond.

Then positions 3,4 have methyl groups.

Position 5 has isopropyl.

Then position 7-8: double bond.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, that's 10 carbons. Wait, no, octa would be 8 carbons.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the substituents.

The target molecule has substituents at 3,4,5. So the starting material must have these substituents in positions that, when the ring forms, they are correctly placed.

In the starting material, the substituents are in positions that, when the ring closes, they end up on carbons 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the middle of the chain, so when the ends are connected, they become the substituents on the ring.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has the substituents on carbons that, when the ring forms, those carbons become 3,4,5.

Suppose the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at positions 3 and 4 (two methyl groups) and position 5 (isopropyl). So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, but that's 10 carbons, not 8. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Let me see.

Wait, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7 positions. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But that doesn't have substituents. Wait, but in our case, substituents are present.

Wait, the substituents are in positions 3,4,5. So in the starting material, perhaps they're at positions 3,4,5 in the chain.

Wait, maybe the substituents in the starting material are at positions 3,4,5, and during metathesis, the ends (positions 1 and 6) form the ring, bringing substituent 5 into the ring's position 5, and 3 and 4 remain as substituents in positions 3 and 4.

Hmm, perhaps if the starting material is octa-1,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5, then during metathesis, the 1 and 6 positions would form the ring, creating a six-membered ring.

Wait, the starting material would have the structure:

Positions:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on carbons 3,4,5 of the chain, and the double bonds are at 1 and 6.

Wait, perhaps when the ring forms, the 1 and 6 positions connect, making the ring. So the substituents at 3,4,5 would end up on the ring as positions 3,4,5.

So the starting material would be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So which option would give the correct substituents when the ring forms?

In the case of option C: octa-1,6-diene.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but that might not be exactly correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions 3,4,5 of the chain.

Wait, when the ring forms, the double bonds at 1 and 6 would form a six-membered ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would be on the ring.

So in the starting material, substituents are at 3,4,5.

Wait, when the ring forms, the chain would connect from position 1 to position 6.

So the ring would have six carbons: 1 (from the first double bond), 2,3,4,5,6 (from the second double bond). So the substituents at 3,4,5 in the chain would be on carbons 3,4,5 in the ring.

Which is exactly what the target molecule requires: 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl.

Thus, the starting material should be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So that's the correct starting material.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the target molecule and the options provided.

The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. Position 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and position 5 has an isopropyl group. In ring-closing metathesis, the starting material must be a diene with double bonds positioned such that, upon reaction, the substituents end up at the correct positions in the ring.

The starting material must be an octadiene, as forming a six-membered ring requires a chain long enough to cyclize. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the target molecule must correspond to the substituents in the starting material at positions that will become 3, 4, and 5 in the ring after the reaction.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7. If this were the starting material, the ring-closing metathesis would form a six-membered ring. However, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the chain would not align correctly with the target molecule's substituents. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2 and 6. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the chain would not align correctly with the target molecule's substituents after ring formation. This option is also incorrect.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 6. During ring-closing metathesis, the double bonds at positions 1 and 6 would react to form a six-membered ring. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the chain would correctly align with the target molecule's substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the ring. This option is correct.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, but the substituents are positioned at 4, 5, and 6. These substituents would not align correctly with the target molecule's substituents after ring formation. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the correct substituents and double bond positions to form the target molecule via ring-closing metathesis.

Wait, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7 positions. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But that doesn't have substituents. Wait, but in our case, substituents are present.

Wait, maybe the substituents in the starting material are at positions 3,4,5, and during metathesis, the ends (positions 1 and 6) form the ring, bringing substituent 5 into the ring's position 5, and 3 and 4 remain as substituents in positions 3 and 4.

Hmm, perhaps if the starting material is octa-1,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5, then during metathesis, the 1 and 6 positions would form the ring, creating a six-membered ring.

Wait, the starting material would have the structure:

Positions:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on carbons 3,4,5 of the chain, and the double bonds are at 1 and 6.

Wait, perhaps when the ring forms, the 1 and 6 positions connect, making the ring. So the substituents at 3,4,5 would end up on the ring as positions 3,4,5.

So the starting material would be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So which option would give the correct substituents when the ring forms?

In the case of option C: octa-1,6-diene.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but that might not be exactly correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions 3,4,5 of the chain.

Wait, when the ring forms, the double bonds at 1 and 6 would form a six-membered ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would be on the ring.

So in the starting material, substituents are at 3,4,5.

Wait, when the ring forms, the chain would connect from position 1 to position 6.

So the ring would have six carbons: 1 (from the first double bond), 2,3,4,5,6 (from the second double bond). So the substituents at 3,4,5 in the chain would be on carbons 3,4,5 in the ring.

Which is exactly what the target molecule requires: 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl.

Thus, the starting material should be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So that's the correct starting material.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the target molecule and the options provided.

The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. Position 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and position 5 has an isopropyl group. In ring-closing metathesis, the starting material must be a diene with double bonds positioned such that, upon reaction, the substituents end up at the correct positions in the ring.

The starting material must be an octadiene, as forming a six-membered ring requires a chain long enough to cyclize. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the target molecule must correspond to the substituents in the starting material at positions that will become 3, 4, and 5 in the ring after the reaction.

   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7. If this were the starting material, the ring-closing metathesis would form a six-membered ring. However, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the chain would not align correctly with the target molecule's substituents. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2 and 6. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the chain would not align correctly with the target molecule's substituents after ring formation. This option is also incorrect.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 6. During ring-closing metathesis, the double bonds at positions 1 and 6 would react to form a six-membered ring. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the chain would correctly align with the target molecule's substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the ring. This option is correct.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, but the substituents are positioned at 4, 5, and 6. These substituents would not align correctly with the target molecule's substituents after ring formation. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the correct substituents and double bond positions to form the target molecule via ring-closing metathesis.
