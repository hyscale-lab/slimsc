Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. So the setup is this: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center; its center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. 

Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, I need to visualize this. Imagine a big sphere (the conductor) and a smaller sphere inside it, but not centered. The charge q is somewhere inside the cavity. So, point P is outside the conductor. The options give different expressions for E, so I need to figure out which formula applies here.

I remember that when a charge is inside a conducting shell, the conductor's inner surface induces an opposite charge, and the outer surface induces a positive charge if the conductor was neutral. But wait, in this case, the conductor is uncharged. So, when the charge q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q. But then, since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. So the conductor as a whole becomes a dipole or something? Or wait, maybe not necessarily a dipole. It depends on the placement.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, so total charge on it is zero. When +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor had no net charge, the outer surface must have +q. But that's only if the cavity was at the center. But in our case, the cavity is off-center.

Hmm, so the placement of the charge inside the cavity affects the induced charges. The inner surface induced charge is -q, but distributed in a particular way. Since the cavity is not centered, the charge distribution on the inner surface of the conductor might not be uniform. So the conductor's outer surface would have a charge of +q, but how would that be arranged?

But wait, when I'm outside the conductor, does the electric field depend on the outer charge distribution? Yes, because the field outside a conductor is determined by the charges on the outer surface.

Wait, but how does the position of the cavity affect the field outside? Because normally, for a conductor with charge inside, the field outside is as if all the charge were at the center. So for a spherical cavity, if the charge were at the center, the field outside would be like a point charge. But here, the cavity isn't centered, so the charge is offset. But wait, the conductor's inner surface has an induced charge that's -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the total charge outside is +q.

Wait, no. The conductor was uncharged, so when we add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q (because the conductor's total charge is zero; -q + outer = 0 → outer = +q). So the outer surface's charge is +q, but spread over the sphere. But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer charge distribution would still be uniform, right? Because the conductor is a sphere, and in electrostatic equilibrium, charges on the outer surface distribute themselves uniformly regardless of inner charges. Or is that only when the cavity is centered?

Wait, no. Wait, if the cavity is not centered, the inner induced charge would be in a non-uniform distribution. But the outer surface charge would still have to be uniform because the conductor is a sphere. Because any external influences would be symmetrical. Or wait, maybe not. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, but when the cavity isn't at the center, the inner surface of the conductor has an induced charge whose distribution is not uniform. It's like a dipole maybe. So the inner surface has -q, but not uniformly distributed. The outer surface, being a conductor, must have a uniform charge distribution only if the external environment is symmetric. But in this case, since the point P is outside, and the conductor is a sphere, maybe the outer charge behaves as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the outer surface has +q. So for points outside the conductor, the electric field would be the same as that produced by a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor's outer charge behaves as if it's a spherical shell with charge +q, which for external points, the field is as if all the charge is at the center. That's the shell theorem, right? So the field at P depends only on the outer charge, which is +q, located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in this problem, the cavity isn't centered. So does the position of the charge inside the cavity affect the field outside? From what I remember, no. Because the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, and regardless of how it's distributed (as a uniform sphere), the external field would be as if it's a point charge. So the field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is exactly that. Option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, let me think again. Because the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, but the outer surface's charge is still distributed uniformly (since the conductor is a sphere). So the field outside is the same as if the charge were at the center. So the position of the cavity (s, theta) doesn't matter for the external field. So the point P's field only depends on the charge q located at the center, so the distance is L.

Wait, but what if the conductor's outer surface isn't a uniform distribution? But no, because the conductor is a sphere, and in electrostatic conditions, the charges on the outer surface of a spherical conductor arrange themselves uniformly regardless of internal charges. Because any asymmetry in internal charges is screened by the inner surface. So the outer charge remains uniform. Therefore, the external field is as if all the outer charge is at the center.

So in this case, the charge on the outer surface is +q, so the field at point P (distance L from conductor's center) is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, that's option B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem statement says that point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. The angle between l and s is theta.

Does that matter? Because if the outer charge is uniformly distributed, then the field at P only depends on the charge and the distance from the center. So regardless of where the charge inside is, the outer field is as if it's at the center. So the position of the cavity doesn't affect the external field.

So the correct expression would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor Properties**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged, meaning its total charge is zero. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Outer Surface Charge Distribution**: For a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface distribute themselves uniformly in electrostatic equilibrium. This uniformity holds regardless of the position of the cavity or the charge inside it. Thus, the outer surface behaves as if all its charge is concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge on its outer surface and the distance from the center. By the shell theorem, the field at a point outside the conductor is equivalent to that produced by a point charge located at the center of the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$ is $L$, so the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Irrelevance of Cavity Position**: The position of the cavity (determined by $s$, $l$, and $\theta$) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. This is because the outer surface charge distribution remains uniform, and the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. This expression does not account for the fact that the electric field outside depends only on the total charge and the distance $L$.
   - **Option B**: Correct. This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. This expression introduces unnecessary terms related to the cavity's position, which do not affect the external field.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While this resembles the correct form, it uses $l$ instead of $L$, which is the correct distance for the external field.

Thus, the electric field at point $P$ is determined solely by the charge $q$ on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.
