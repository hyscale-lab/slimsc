Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses, and the periods between consecutive primary eclipses are 2 years and 1 year, respectively. So the orbital period of system_1 is 2 years, and system_2 is 1 year. 

Then, spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass is the sum of the two stars in each system.

Wait, I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses. The velocities are related to the masses of the stars. Oh right, the more massive star has a smaller velocity because it's orbiting around a common center of mass closer to it. So if a star has a higher velocity amplitude, it must be less massive.

Right, the formula I think is something like the ratio of the velocities equals the inverse ratio of the masses. So if star A has velocity v_A and star B has velocity v_B, then m_A / m_B = v_B / v_A. Because the center of mass is such that m_A * a_A = m_B * a_B, where a is the orbit radius. And since velocity is proportional to angular velocity times radius, v = ω * a. So putting it together, m_A/m_B = a_B / a_A = v_B / v_A. 

Wait, so for each system, the velocity amplitudes are given. Let me think about system_1 first. The two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. So star 1 has 10, star 2 has 5. So the mass ratio would be m1/m2 = v2/v1. So that's 5/10 = 0.5. So m1 is 0.5 times m2. So the total mass of system_1 would be m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Wait, wait, no. Because the mass of the system is the sum, but wait, in reality, the masses are m1 and m2, with m1 being the mass of the star with velocity v1, and m2 the one with v2. So since v1 is larger than v2, m1 is smaller. So m1 = (v2 / v1) * m2. 

So for system_1, v1=10, v2=5. So m1 = (5/10) * m2 = 0.5 * m2. So m1 = 0.5 m2. So the total mass for system_1 is m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2. Hmm, but wait, that's only for system_1, but we need to compare the total masses of both systems.

Wait, no. The total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2, but system_2 also has its own masses. So let me think about system_2 as well.

In system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10. So v1=15, v2=10. So the mass ratio m1/m2 = v2 / v1 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So m1 = (2/3) m2. So the total mass for system_2 is m1 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3) m2 ≈ 1.6667 m2.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, each system's own masses. So in system_1, the masses are m1 and m2, and their velocities are 10 and 5. In system_2, the masses are M1 and M2, with velocities 15 and 10. So for system_1, the mass ratio is m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5, so m1=0.5 m2. So total mass system_1 is m1 + m2 = 0.5m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

For system_2, M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3. So M1 = (2/3) M2. Total mass system_2 is M1 + M2 = (2/3) M2 + M2 = (5/3) M2 ≈ 1.6667 M2.

Wait, but system_1's total is 1.5 m2, system_2's is 1.6667 M2. Wait, but I'm comparing the two systems' total masses. Wait, but wait, the systems have different orbital periods too. How does that factor in?

Ah, right, the period of the system is the same for both stars. So the period P is related to the total mass. The formula for the orbital period comes from Kepler's third law for binary systems. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) ) * a³, but wait, a is the separation between the stars. Alternatively, I think the formula can be expressed in terms of the velocities and the period.

Alternatively, I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass function. The mass function for a star in a binary system is given by (m² sin³ i) / ( (M + m)² ), where M is the mass of the other star and i is the inclination. But since both stars are in the same system, perhaps the inclination is the same for both, so maybe we can relate their masses from that.

Alternatively, considering that the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses, as earlier, but perhaps the total mass can be found via another approach.

Wait, considering that the period is the same as the orbital period. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (m sin i) / ( (M + m)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ). But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the mass ratio and the period.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v1) = ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * (m2 sin i) / ( (m1 + m2)^(2/3) ) )

But since we don't know the inclination angle i, which is the angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight, we can't directly measure the true mass. However, the problem doesn't mention inclination, but since both stars in a system are observed with the same period and same line of sight, perhaps the same i applies to both. So maybe we can find the mass ratio and then relate the total masses via the period.

Wait, but each system has its own period. System_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.

Alternatively, another approach: the total mass of the binary system can be calculated if you know the orbital period and the velocity amplitudes. Because the mass function relates the measured velocities to the masses.

The mass function for each star is (m^3 sin^3 i)/( (M + m)^2 ) ), where M is the mass of the other star. But since we don't know i, perhaps we can relate the mass ratios.

Wait, but perhaps an alternative approach is to compute the mass ratio from the velocity amplitudes, then use the period to find the total mass.

Wait, let's think again. Let's denote for each system:

For system_1:

Star A has velocity K1 = 10 km/s.

Star B has velocity K2 = 5 km/s.

So the mass ratio q = m2/m1 = K1/K2 =10/5=2. So m2 = 2 m1.

So the total mass M1 = m1 + m2 = m1 + 2 m1 =3 m1.

So M1 =3 m1. So m1 = M1/3, m2=2 M1/3.

Similarly, for system_2:

Star A has K1=15 km/s.

Star B has K2=10 km/s.

So mass ratio q'= K1/K2=15/10=1.5. So m2' =1.5 m1'.

Total mass M2 = m1' + m2' = m1' + 1.5 m1' =2.5 m1'.

So M2=2.5 m1'.

So, m1' = M2/(2.5) = (2/5) M2.

Hmm, but how does the period come into play here?

Because the period P is governed by Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π² G)^(-1) * (a1 + a2)^3 (M1 + M2). But since a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes, and a1/a2 = m2/m1 = q.

Wait, let me think again. The separation a between the two stars is a = a1 +a2. And from the center of mass, a1 = (m2/(m1+m2)) * a, and a2 = (m1/(m1+m2)) * a.

The orbital period P is given by:

P² = (4π² G)^(-1) * (a^3) / (M1 + M2)

But a can be expressed in terms of the velocities. Since velocity v = 2π a / P. Because each star orbits the center of mass in a circle with circumference 2π a_i, so their orbital speed is v = (2π a_i) / P.

Wait, for each star, v = (2π a_i ) / P. And a1 + a2 = a.

But a1 = (m2/(M1)) * a, and a2 = (m1/(M1)) * a.

So a1 = (m2/(M1)) * a, a2 = (m1/(M1)) * a.

So for star 1, v1 = 2π a1 / P = 2π (m2/(M1) a ) / P.

But a is the separation, which is a1 +a2 = (m2 +m1) a / (M1) )? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, since a1 = (m2/(M1)) * a, and v1 = 2π a1 / P.

Similarly, v2 = 2π a2 / P = 2π (m1/(M1) a) / P.

So for each star:

v1 = (2 π a m2 ) / ( P M1 )

v2 = (2 π a m1 ) / (P M1 )

But a is the separation. So let's find a in terms of M1 and P.

From Kepler's third law, P² = (4 π² G)^(-1) (a^3) / (M1 + M2) ) → but wait, M1 is the sum of m1 and m2. So M = M1 = m1 + m2.

So P² = (4 π² G)^(-1) a³ / (M1 )

Rearranged, a^3 = G M1 P² (4 π² )

So a = [ G M1 P² (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Hmm, substituting back into v1.

v1 = (2 π a m2 ) / ( P M1 )

Substituting a:

v1 = (2 π [ ( G M1 P² 4 π² )^(1/3) ] m2 ) / ( P M1 )

Let me compute this.

Let me write it as:

v1 = (2 π) * [ ( G M1 P² 4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] * m2 / ( P M1 )

Let me factor this.

Let me take it step by step.

Compute ( G M1 P² 4 π² )^(1/3 ):

= (4 π² G M1 P² )^(1/3 )

= (4 π²)^(1/3) * (G)^(1/3) * (M1)^(1/3) * (P²)^(1/3)

= (4^(1/3)) (π^(2/3)) ) (G^(1/3)) (M1^(1/3)) (P^(2/3))

So the numerator is 2 π multiplied by this and m2.

So:

v1 = [ 2 π * (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) G^(1/3) M1^(1/3) P^(2/3)) ) * m2 ] / ( P M1 )

Simplify the denominator: P M1.

So:

v1 = [ 2 π * 4^(1/3) π^(2/3) G^(1/3) M1^(1/3) P^(2/3) m2 ] / ( P M1 )

Simplify the numerator:

2 π * 4^(1/3) π^(2/3) = 2 * 4^(1/3) * π^(1 + 2/3) ) = 2 * 4^(1/3) π^(5/3)

So:

v1 = [ 2 * 4^(1/3) π^(5/3) G^(1/3) M1^(1/3) P^(2/3) m2 ] / ( P M1 )

Simplify denominator P M1 = P * M1^(1)

So:

v1 = (2 *4^(1/3) π^(5/3) G^(1/3) ) * ( M1^(1/3) m2 ) * P^(2/3) ) / ( P M1 )

Let me write M1 as (m1 + m2) = M1.

So:

v1 = [ 2 *4^(1/3) π^(5/3) G^(1/3) ] * [ m2 M1^(1/3) ] * [ P^(2/3) ] / [ P M1 ]

Simplify P terms: P^(2/3) / P = P^(-1/3)

So:

v1 = [ 2 *4^(1/3) π^(5/3) G^(1/3) ] * ( m2 ) * ( M1^(1/3) ) * ( P^(-1/3) )

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, perhaps using the formula that relates the velocity amplitude to the mass. I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G P )/(2 π) )^(1/3) * ( m sin i ) / ( (M + m )^(2/3) ) )

But since we don't know i, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe we can relate the velocities and the periods to the total mass.

Wait, for each system, the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses, as previously. So for system_1, the mass ratio is 0.5, so system_1's total mass is 1.5 m2 (where m2 is the mass of the companion star). But without knowing the actual masses, how do the periods factor in?

Wait, another approach: The total mass of the binary system M can be expressed in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the period.

The formula for the mass function is f(M) = ( (K^3 P ) ) / (2942 ) ) [in solar masses, where K is in km/s and P in years]

Wait, but I think I'm getting this from somewhere—maybe an equation I vaguely remember. Alternatively, perhaps for each system, the mass function is f(M) = ( (K^3 P ) ) / (2942 ), but I'm not entirely sure about the constants.

Wait, the mass function is given by f(M) = ( (v_1)^3 P ) / (2.15e5 ), where v_1 is in km/s, P in years, and f(M) is in solar masses.

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression, but perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that combines the velocity amplitudes and the period to get the total mass.

But perhaps I can use the concept that the mass of the binary system is proportional to (K^3 P) / (G), but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another thought. Since the period is the same for both stars in a system, perhaps the sum of the velocities can be used in combination with the period to find the total mass.

Wait, for both stars in a system, v1 + v2 is the same as the orbital speed of the center of mass around the system's center. No, actually, the sum of the velocities isn't directly meaningful, but the mass ratio is determined by the velocity ratio.

Wait, perhaps we can model each system's total mass in terms of their velocity amplitudes and period.

The formula for the orbital period being P, and the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2. The total mass is M = m1 + m2. Each m can be expressed in terms of the velocities.

From the mass ratio:

m1 / m2 = K2 / K1 → m1 = (K2/K1) m2.

So M = m1 + m2 = (K2/K1 + 1) m2.

But what else do I know? From Kepler's law, which relates the period, separation, and mass. So perhaps I can express M in terms of the velocities and the period.

Alternatively, the orbital separation a is related to the velocities and the period. The formula is a = (v1 + v2) * P / (2 π). Wait, because each star completes an orbit in time P, so the distance each travels is v * P. So the sum of their distances is 2π a (the circumference) → a = (v1 + v2) P / (2 π).

But a is also related to the masses and the period via Kepler's law: a³ = G M P² / (4 π² )

So combining the two expressions for a:

[(v1 + v2) P/(2 π)]^3 = G M P² / (4 π² )

Let me cube the left side:

[ (v1 + v2) P / (2 π) ) ]^3 = (v1 + v2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 )

Set equal to the right side:

(v1 + v2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 ) = (G M P² ) / (4 π² )

Multiply both sides by 8 π^3:

(v1 + v2)^3 P^3 = (8 π^3 G M P² ) / (4 π² )

Simplify the right side:

8 π^3 / (4 π^2 ) = 2 π.

So:

(v1 + v2)^3 P^3 = 2 π G M P²

Divide both sides by P²:

(v1 + v2)^3 P = 2 π G M

Solve for M:

M = ( (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / (2 π G )

Wait, that looks promising.

So, M = [ (v1 + v2)^3 * P ] / (2 π G )

But since I don't have G in convenient units, maybe I can use this formula for both systems and take the ratio.

So for system_1 and system_2, compute M1 and M2 using this formula, then take M1/M2.

Let me proceed.

For system_1:
v1 = 10 km/s, v2 =5 km/s.
P = 2 years.

So (v1 + v2) = 15 km/s.

M1 = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / (2 π G )

Wait, but I need to make sure units are consistent. Let me think about the units. G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2. But perhaps it's easier to work in solar masses and appropriate units.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the formula in terms of constants and ratios.

But maybe a better approach is to compute the ratio M1/M2.

Because M = [ (v1 +v2)^3 * P ] / ( 2 π G )

So M1/M2 = [ (v1_1 +v2_1)^3 P1 ] / [ (v1_2 +v2_2)^3 P2 ]

Because the 2 π G terms cancel when taking the ratio.

So:

M1/M2 = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / [ (25)^3 * 1 ]

Wait, let's compute this.

v1_1 + v2_1 =10 +5=15.

v1_2 +v2_2=15+10=25.

So,

M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1 )

Compute 15^3 = 3375.

25^3 = 15625.

So,

M1/M2 = (3375 *2 ) / (15625 *1 ) = (6750) / (15625 ) = 0.432.

So M1 is approximately 0.432 times M2. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is about 0.43.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~0.4, or option D) ~0.7.

Wait, 0.432 is closer to 0.4 (0.432 is 0.43, which is closer to 0.4 than to 0.5, but the options don't have 0.43, but option A is ~0.4, and option D is ~0.7. So the correct answer would be option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

M1/M2 = (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 *1 )

15^3 = 3375.

25^3=15625.

So 3375 *2 =6750.

15625 *1=15625.

Divide 6750 by 15625.

Let me compute that: 6750 ÷ 15625.

Let me compute: 15625 × 0.43 = ?

15625 × 0.4 = 6250.

15625 × 0.03 = 468.75.

So 0.43 × 15625 = 6250 +468.75=6718.75.

Which is a bit less than 6750. The difference is 6750 -6718.75= 31.25.

So 31.25 / 15625 = 0.002.

So 0.43 + 0.002= 0.432.

So M1/M2= ~0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive is approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but wait a second. The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So if system_1 is 0.43 times the mass of system_2, then system_1 is less massive. But the question is phrased as "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2." So wait, that would mean if system_1 were more massive, but according to our calculation, system_1 is less massive. So perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, M1 is 0.43 times M2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of 0.43. So the factor is 0.43, meaning system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, so system_2 is more massive.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2." So if system_1 is less massive, then the factor is less than 1. So the factor is ~0.43. So the correct answer would be option A) ~0.4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, so that's the right choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data and apply the relevant formulas.

### Key Information:
1. **System Observations**:
   - **System_1**:
     - Orbital period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
     - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - **System_2**:
     - Orbital period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \)
     - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)

2. **Mass Ratio and Total Mass**:
   - The mass ratio of the two stars in a binary system is inversely proportional to their velocity amplitudes:
     \[
     \frac{m_1}{m_2} = \frac{K_2}{K_1}
     \]
   - For **System_1**:
     \[
     \frac{m_{1,1}}{m_{2,1}} = \frac{K_{2,1}}{K_{1,1}} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5
     \]
     The total mass of System_1 is:
     \[
     M_1 = m_{1,1} + m_{2,1} = 0.5m_{2,1} + m_{2,1} = 1.5m_{2,1}
     \]

   - For **System_2**:
     \[
     \frac{m_{1,2}}{m_{2,2}} = \frac{K_{2,2}}{K_{1,2}} = \frac{10}{15} = 0.6667
     \]
     The total mass of System_2 is:
     \[
     M_2 = m_{1,2} + m_{2,2} = 0.6667m_{2,2} + m_{2,2} = 1.6667m_{2,2}
     \]

3. **Mass Ratio Between Systems**:
   Using Kepler's third law and the relationship between velocity amplitudes, periods, and total mass, the total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:
   \[
   M = \frac{(v_1 + v_2)^3 P}{2\pi G}
   \]
   Taking the ratio of the total masses of the two systems:
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(v_{1,1} + v_{2,1})^3 P_1}{(v_{1,2} + v_{2,2})^3 P_2}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(10 + 5)^3 \cdot 2}{(15 + 10)^3 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{15^3 \cdot 2}{25^3 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Compute:
   \[
   15^3 = 3375, \quad 25^3 = 15625
   \]
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625} = \frac{6750}{15625} \approx 0.432
   \]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately **0.432 times** as massive as System_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.4**.

**Answer: A**
