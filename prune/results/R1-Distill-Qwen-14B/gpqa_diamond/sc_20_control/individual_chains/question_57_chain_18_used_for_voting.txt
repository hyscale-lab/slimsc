Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts δ0 to δ4 as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, especially for particles like electrons, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the optical theorem or partial wave expansion comes into play here.

Hmm, the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by the partial wave expansion. The general formula for f(θ) when expressed in terms of phase shifts δ_l is:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) / ( (1 - e^{-2i δ_l}) ) * ... Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, no, another approach. The scattering amplitude can be written as a sum over angular momentum states. Each partial wave contributes, and the amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) )

But I'm trying to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. That would be θ=0°, because that's the direction of the incident beam.

Wait, but when θ=0°, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for l=0, and zero for l>0 because P_l(1) = 1 for l=0, and for higher l, it's zero? No, wait, the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) equals 1 for any l. No, wait, no—Legendre polynomials of even and odd orders behave differently at 1. Wait, no, actually, P_l(1) is always 1, because when x=1, P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Wait, no, that's correct. Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So for θ=0°, all the terms contribute.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum. So when θ=0°, each term contributes. But in our case, the phase shifts given are δ0 to δ4, so l goes up to 4.

The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so we include l=0 to l=4.

But the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0°, so let's compute Im[f(0)].

So the formula for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) )

At θ=0°, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So each term becomes (2l +1)(e^{2i δ_l} - 1) * 1.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l +1)(e^{2i δ_l} - 1) )

We need the imaginary part of this. Let's break it down.

First, let's compute each term (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1), then sum them, then multiply by (1/(2ik)), and then find the imaginary part.

Wait, but k is the wave number. k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But E is 50 MeV. I need to compute k in appropriate units.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to compute Im[f(0)] without knowing k, but let's see.

Wait, the options are given in fm (femtometers), which is 1e-15 meters. So the units must come from the calculation involving k.

But perhaps there's a simpler way. Let me think again about the expression for f(θ).

Wait, another approach. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the optical theorem, which says that Im[f(θ)] is proportional to the total cross-section. But wait, no, the optical theorem relates the integral of |f|² to the total cross-section. Alternatively, for small angles, maybe we can use certain approximations, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part of f(0) directly from the partial wave expansion.

So, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) ), for l=0 to 4.

Let me compute each term (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} - 1), then sum them, then multiply by 1/(2ik), and take the imaginary part.

So first, let's compute each term:

For l=0: δ0 =90°, which is π/2 radians.
e^{2i δ0} = e^{i π} = cos(π) + i sin(π) = -1 + 0i. So e^{2i δ0} -1 = (-1) -1 = -2.

So term for l=0: (2*0+1)*(e^{2i δ0} -1 ) = 1*(-2) = -2.

l=1: δ1=67°, which is about 1.169 radians.
Compute e^{2i δ1} = cos(2δ1) + i sin(2δ1)
2δ1 is 134°, which is approximately 2.340 radians.

cos(134°) ≈ -0.6947, sin(134°) ≈ 0.7193.

So e^{2i δ1} = (-0.6947) + i (0.7193).
So e^{2i δ1} -1 = (-0.6947 -1) + i (0.7193) = (-1.6947) + i (0.7193).

Multiply by (2*1 +1)=3: 3*(-1.6947 + i 0.7193) = -5.0841 + i 2.1579.

l=2: δ2=55°, 1.95 radians.
2δ2=110°, which is 1.919 radians.
cos(110°) ≈ -0.3420, sin(110°)≈ 0.9397.

e^{2i δ2} = (-0.3420) + i 0.9397.
e^{2i δ2} -1 = (-1.3420) + i 0.9397.

Multiply by (2*2+1)=5: 5*(-1.3420 + i 0.9397) = -6.71 + i 4.6985.

l=3: δ3=30°, which is 0.5236 radians.
2δ3=60°, 1.0472 radians.
cos(60°)=0.5, sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660.

e^{2i δ3} = 0.5 +i 0.8660.
e^{2i δ3} -1 = (-0.5) + i 0.8660.

Multiply by (2*3+1)=7: 7*(-0.5 +i 0.8660) = -3.5 + i 6.062.

l=4: δ4=13°, which is approximately 0.2269 radians.
2δ4=26°, about 0.4538 radians.
cos(26°)=0.8988, sin(26°)=0.4384.

e^{2i δ4}=0.8988 + i 0.4384.
e^{2i δ4} -1 = (0.8988-1) + i 0.4384 = (-0.1012) + i 0.4384.

Multiply by (2*4+1)=9: 9*(-0.1012 + i 0.4384) = -0.9108 + i 3.9456.

Now, summing all these terms:

Let's collect the real and imaginary parts:

l=0:
Real: -2
Imag: 0

l=1:
Real: -5.0841
Imag: 2.1579

l=2:
Real: -6.71
Imag:4.6985

l=3:
Real: -3.5
Imag:6.062

l=4:
Real: -0.9108
Imag:3.9456

Summing all real parts:

-2 -5.0841 = -7.0841
-7.0841 -6.71 = -13.7941
-13.7941 -3.5 = -17.2941
-17.2941 -0.9108 = -18.2049

Summing all imaginary parts:

0 + 2.1579 = 2.1579
2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564
6.8564 +6.062=12.9184
12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So the sum S is ( -18.2049 ) + i (16.864 )

Then, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * S.

We need to compute Im[f(0)].

So let me factor this expression:

f(0) = [ (-18.2049) + i (16.864) ] / (2ik) = [ (-18.2049) + i (16.864) ] * (1/(2ik)).

Expressed as a complex number, 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = (-i/(2)) * (1/k).

So,

f(0) = [ (-18.2049) + i (16.864) ] * ( -i/(2k) )

Multiplying this out:

First, multiply each term:

= [ (-18.2049) * (-i) ) / (2k) ) ] + [ (i 16.864) * (-i) ) / (2k) ) ]

Simplify each part:

First term: (18.2049 * i ) / (2k)

Second term: [ i * (-i) * 16.864 ] / (2k ) = [ (-i²) 16.864 ] / (2k) ) = [ (16.864) ] / (2k) because i² =-1, so -i² =1.

So,

f(0) = [ (18.2049 i) + 16.864 ] / (2k )

Which can be written as:

f(0) = (16.864) / (2k) + i (18.2049)/(2k )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (18.2049)/(2k).

Wait, because when you have a complex number a + ib, the imaginary part is b.

So, Im[f(0)] = (18.2049) / (2k )

Hmm, and what is k?

k is the wave number, given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But I need to make sure about the units.

Wait, E is given in MeV. Let's convert that to joules. 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So 50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 8.0109e-13 J.

But m is the mass of the electron, which is 9.10938e-31 kg.

So,

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ

But ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

2mE = 2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.0109e-13 J = let's compute that.

Wait, E is in joules. Let me compute 2mE:

2*(9.10938e-31 kg) * (8.0109e-13 J) = 2 *9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13.

Compute 9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13 = 7.2990e-43.

Multiply by 2: 1.4598e-43.

So sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(1.4598e-43) = sqrt(1.4598) * 1e-21.5 ≈ 1.208 * 1e-21.5? Wait, no. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1e-43 is (1e-21.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-43) is 1e-21.5, which is 3.1623e-22 m.

Wait, 1e-21.5 is 1e-21 * sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623e-22.

So sqrt(1.4598e-43) = sqrt(1.4598) * 1e-21.5 ≈ 1.208 * 3.1623e-22 ≈ 3.826e-22 m.

Wait, but let me compute it exactly:

2mE = 2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.0109e-13 J.

Compute 9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13:

9.10938 *8.0109 ≈ 72.987, and 1e-31 *1e-13=1e-44. So 72.987e-44 = 7.2987e-43.

Multiply by 2: 14.5974e-43 = 1.45974e-42.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2 *9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13 = 2 * (9.10938 *8.0109) * 1e-31-13) = 2 *72.987 *1e-44 = 145.974e-44 = 1.45974e-42.

So sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(1.45974e-42) = sqrt(1.45974) * 1e-21 = approx 1.208 * 1e-21 = 1.208e-21 m.

Then, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ = (1.208e-21 m) / (1.05457e-34 J·s) ) 

Let me compute the division:

1.208e-21 / 1.05457e-34 = (1.208 / 1.05457) * 1e13 ≈ (1.145) * 1e13 ≈ 1.145e13 m^-1.

Wait, because 1e-21 / 1e-34 = 1e13.

So k ≈ 1.145e13 m^-1.

Wait, but we can be more precise with the calculation. Let me compute 1.208 / 1.05457:

1.208 / 1.05457 ≈ 1.145 approximately.

So k ≈1.145e13 m^-1.

Now, back to Im[f(0)] = (18.2049)/(2k).

k is 1.145e13 m^-1, so 2k is 2.29e13 m^-1.

So,

Im[f(0)] = 18.2049 / (2.29e13) ≈ (18.2049 / 2.29) ) * 1e-13.

18.2049 / 2.29 ≈ 7.958.

So Im[f(0)]≈7.958e-13 m.

But wait, the options are in femtometers (fm), which is 1e-15 m. So we need to convert 7.958e-13 m to fm.

1e-13 m = 100 fm. So 7.958e-13 m = 7.958 * 100 fm = 795.8 fm.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.351, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the formula for f(θ). Let me think again.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) ]

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so it's (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ]

So, the sum S is sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ]

Which we computed as S ≈ -18.2049 + i 16.864.

Then f(0) = S/(2ik).

But f(θ) is a dimensionless quantity? Or wait, no, because the scattering amplitude has dimensions of length.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused about the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, the wave number k has units of 1/m. So 2ik is unitless multiplied by i, so 1/(2ik) has units of m (since 1/k is meters).

So when we multiply by S, which was computed as a dimensionless sum, f(0) will have units of meters. But the problem says to find the imaginary part in fm (femtometers), which is 1e-15 meters.

So, in our calculation, Im[f(0)] = 18.2049/(2k) [since k is in m^-1, 2k is m^-1, so 1/(2k) is m; multiplied by 18.2049, which is unitless, gives m].

Wait, but earlier calculation gives Im[f(0)] ≈ 7.958e-13 m = 795.8 fm. But none of the options are near 800 fm. The closest is A) 87163.4 fm, which is way larger, and B is 355, which is half of that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sum S.

Let me recalculate the sum S.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing each term. Let me recheck each l.

l=0: (2*0+1)=1. e^{2i*90°} is e^{iπ} = -1. So e^{2iδ0} -1 = -1 -1 = -2. So term is 1*(-2) = -2.

l=1: δ1=67°, 2δ1=134°. e^{2iδ1} = cos(134°) + i sin(134°). Cos(134) is about -0.6947, sin(134) is about 0.7193. So e^{2iδ1} -1 = (-0.6947 -1) + i 0.7193 = -1.6947 + i 0.7193.

Multiply by (2l+1)=3: 3*(-1.6947) = -5.0841, 3*(0.7193)=2.1579. Correct.

l=2: δ2=55°, 2δ2=110°. Cos(110)= -0.3420, sin(110)= 0.9397. e^{2iδ2} = -0.3420 + i 0.9397. Subtract 1: -1.3420 + i 0.9397. Multiply by 5: -6.71 + i 4.6985. Correct.

l=3: δ3=30°, 2δ3=60°. Cos(60)=0.5, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. e^{2iδ3}= 0.5 + i 0.8660. Subtract 1: -0.5 + i 0.8660. Multiply by7: -3.5 + i 6.062. Correct.

l=4: δ4=13°, 2δ4=26°. Cos(26)=0.8988, sin(26)=0.4384. e^{2iδ4}= 0.8988 + i 0.4384. Subtract 1: -0.1012 + i 0.4384. Multiply by9: -0.9108 + i 3.9456. Correct.

So the sum is:

Real parts: (-2) + (-5.0841) + (-6.71) + (-3.5) + (-0.9108) = let's sum sequentially.

-2 -5.0841 = -7.0841.

-7.0841 -6.71 = -13.7941.

-13.7941 -3.5 = -17.2941.

-17.2941 -0.9108 = -18.2049. Correct.

Imaginary parts: 0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = sum them.

0 +2.1579 =2.1579.

+4.6985 → 6.8564.

+6.062 → 12.9184.

+3.9456 →16.864. Correct.

So S = (-18.2049) + i 16.864.

So f(0) = S/(2ik) = [ (-18.2049) + i 16.864 ] / (2ik).

Wait, but 2ik is 2i *k, so let me factor it:

= [ (-18.2049) + i 16.864 ] * 1/(2ik).

But 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = (-i/(2)) * (1/k).

So,

f(0) = [ (-18.2049) + i 16.864 ] * (-i/(2k)).

Multiply out:

= [ (-18.2049)(-i) ) + (i 16.864)(-i) ) ] / (2k)

= [ (18.2049 i) + (-i^2) 16.864 ] / (2k)

Since i^2 = -1, (-i^2)=1.

So,

= [ 18.2049 i + 16.864 ] / (2k )

Which is (16.864 + 18.2049 i ) / (2k).

So, the real part is 16.864/(2k), and the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k).

Wait, no, because (a + ib)/(c) = a/c + i b/c. So in this case, a=16.864, b=18.2049, and c=2k.

So the imaginary part is b/(2k) = 18.2049/(2k).

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 18.2049/(2k), but let's confirm.

Wait, the expression is (16.864 + 18.2049 i ) / (2k). So the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k).

So, Im[f(0)] = 18.2049/(2k).

Hmm, so with k being 1.145e13 m^-1.

So 2k is 2.29e13 m^-1.

So,

Im(f(0)) = 18.2049 / (2.29e13) = (18.2049 / 2.29) ) * 1e-13.

Wait, 18.2049 / 2.29 ≈7.958.

So Im(f(0)) ≈7.958e-13 m.

Convert to fm: 1e-15 m is 1 fm.

So 7.958e-13 m = 795.8 fm.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is B)355.351 fm or D)251.271. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating k. Let's recalculate k.

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

E is 50 MeV. Let me compute this properly in SI units.

E =50 MeV =50e6 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 50e6 * 1.60218e-19 = 8.0109e-13 J.

m=mass of electron=9.10938e-31 kg.

So 2mE = 2 *9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13.

Let me compute 9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13:

9.10938 *8.0109 ≈72.986.

Exponents: 1e-31 *1e-13 =1e-44.

So 2mE=2 *72.986e-44 =145.972e-44 =1.45972e-42.

So sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(1.45972e-42) = approx 1.208e-21 m.

Wait, sqrt(1.45972e-42) = sqrt(1.45972) * 1e-21.

sqrt(1.45972)=1.208, so yes, 1.208e-21 m.

Then, ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = (1.208e-21 m) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s) ) = let's compute that.

1.208e-21 /1.05457e-34 = (1.208/1.05457) ) * 1e13.

Compute 1.208 /1.05457 ≈ 1.145.

So k≈1.145e13 m^-1.

So, 1/(2k)=1/(2 *1.145e13) =1/(2.29e13) ≈4.367e-14 m.

Then, Im(f(0))=18.2049 *4.367e-14 m.

18.2049 *4.367e-14 = ?

18 *4.367e-14 =78.606e-14 =7.8606e-13 m.

0.2049 *4.367e-14 ≈0.9e-14.

So total ≈7.8606e-13 +0.9e-14≈7.9506e-13 m =795.06 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f(theta=0) is different. Another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l).

Wait, no, because the imaginary part comes from the e^{i delta_l} terms. Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation to the total cross-section.

Wait, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section sigma_total is 4 pi |f|^2 averaged over angles, but perhaps that's not directly helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude contributes to the cross-section.

Wait, another thought: the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) (e^{2i delta_l} - 1) P_l (cos theta) ]

The imaginary part of f(theta) is then the sum of the imaginary contributions from each term.

At theta=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) * Im( e^{2i delta_l} - 1 ) ]

Because 1/(2ik) is a real factor times 1/k, but wait, no. Wait, 1/(2ik)= -i/(2k), which when multiplied by a complex number would affect the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute Im(f(0)) directly.

Let's denote each term as (2l+1)(e^{2i delta_l} -1) = A_l + i B_l.

Then, f(0) = sum (A_l + i B_l )/(2ik) = (sum A_l + i sum B_l ) / (2ik).

Which can be written as (sum A_l + i sum B_l ) * (-i) / (2k).

= [ sum A_l (-i) + sum B_l (-i^2) ] / (2k )

= [ -i sum A_l + sum B_l ] / (2k )

So f(0) = [ sum B_l + i (- sum A_l) ] / (2k )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is [ - sum A_l ] / (2k )

Since Im(f(0)) is the coefficient of i in f(0).

So, Im(f(0)) = ( - sum A_l ) / (2k )

In our case, sum A_l is the real parts of each term: sum A_l = -18.2049.

So,

Im(f(0)) = ( - (-18.2049) ) / (2k ) = 18.2049/(2k )

Which is the same as before. So I didn't make a mistake there.

Hmm, but the calculated value is about 795 fm, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum S. Let me check each term again.

Wait, for l=1:

e^{2i delta_l} -1 = e^{i 134°} -1.

Which is cos(134) +i sin(134) -1 = (cos(134)-1) + i sin(134).

Which gives:

Real part: cos(134) -1 = -0.6947 -1 = -1.6947.

Imaginary part: 0.7193.

Multiply by 3: Real part: -5.0841, Imaginary part: 2.1579. Correct.

Similarly for l=2:

e^{2i 55}= e^{i 110} = cos(110) +i sin(110) = -0.3420 + i 0.9397.

Subtract 1: real part -0.3420-1= -1.3420, imaginary 0.9397.

Multiply by 5: real -6.71, imaginary 4.6985.

Correct.

l=3: e^{i60} = 0.5 +i 0.8660.

Subtract 1: real -0.5, imaginary 0.8660.

Multiply by7: real -3.5, imaginary 6.062.

Correct.

l=4: e^{i26}=0.8988 +i 0.4384.

Subtract 1: real -0.1012, imaginary 0.4384.

Multiply by9: real -0.9108, imaginary 3.9456.

Correct.

So the sum A_l is -18.2049, so Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2k)=795.8 fm.

But that's not any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in different units, or I missed a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the initial formula was incorrect.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(delta_l). Because when you expand e^{2i delta_l} -1, you get e^{i 2 delta} -1 = e^{i delta} (e^{i delta} -e^{-i delta}) ) = e^{i delta} * 2i sin(delta).

So, e^{2i delta} -1 = 2i e^{i delta} sin(delta).

So, each term (2l+1)(e^{2i delta} -1 ) = i 2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta).

But perhaps that's complicating things, but let's proceed.

So, sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2i delta} -1) ] = i sum [2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta) ]

But f(0) = [ sum (2l+1)(e^{2i delta} -1) ]/(2ik )

So,

f(0) = [i sum 2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta) ] / (2ik ) )

Simplify 2/(2i) = 1/(i) = -i.

So,

f(0) = [ i sum 2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta) ] * (1/(2ik )) 

= [ i * sum 2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta) ] * (1/(2ik )) 

= [ sum (2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta)) ] * (i/(2ik )) )

Wait, (i)/(2ik) ) = 1/(2k).

So,

f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum [ (2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta) ) ]

Wait, this seems a bit more complicated, but perhaps the imaginary part can be found here.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is sum [ (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) ] / (k )

Wait, perhaps:

Because the imaginary part of f(0) comes from the imaginary parts of each term in the sum. Let's think again.

Each term in sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2i delta_l} -1) ] is (2l+1)(e^{i 2 delta_l} -1 )

= (2l+1)( cos(2 delta_l) + i sin(2 delta_l) - 1 )

= (2l+1) [ (cos(2 delta_l) -1) + i sin(2 delta_l) )

So, the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

So the sum of imaginary parts is sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) ]

Then, since f(0) = [ sum [ (2l+1)(e^{i 2 delta} -1 ) ] ] / (2ik )

The imaginary part of f(0) is [ sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ) ] ] / (2k )

Because f(0) = [ real part + i (sum Im terms) ] / (2ik )

Wait, no, because when you have a complex number in the numerator, and you divide by 2ik, which is 2i *k, the imaginary component comes from the real part of the numerator multiplied by 1/(2k) and multiplied by i.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is given by [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] / (k )

Wait, I've seen a formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude as (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) / (k ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me compute sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) for each l.

l=0: (1) * sin(90) =1*1=1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67)≈3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5*sin(55)≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7*sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*sin(13)≈9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum them:

1 +2.7615=3.7615.

+4.096=7.8575.

+3.5=11.3575.

+2.02455=13.382.

So sum= approx 13.382.

So if Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) / k.

Then, Im(f(0))=13.382 / (1.145e13 m^-1 )

=13.382 /1.145e13 ≈11.683e-13 m = 1168.3 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) )/(k )

So:

sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )=13.382.

k=1.145e13 m^-1.

So Im(f(0))=13.382 /1.145e13 = approx 1.168e-12 m = 1168 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So maybe I'm missing a factor of 2.

Wait, in our first approach, we had Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2k)=795.8 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum S.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] / (k )

Which would give 13.382 / 1.145e13 m^-1 = 11.68e-13 m = 1168 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians? Wait, no, the problem states degrees, because the given phase shifts are in degrees.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k.

Wait, E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV. Let me compute E in joules correctly.

E =50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 50e6 *1.602e-19 = 8.01e-13 J.

Yes, correct.

m=9.10938e-31 kg.

So k= sqrt(2 m E) / ħ.

Compute sqrt(2mE):

2mE= 2 *9.10938e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J = 2*9.10938e-31 *8.01e-13 = let me compute.

9.10938e-31 *8.01e-13 = 7.299e-43 kg·J.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so 2mE has units kg²·m²/s².

Wait, but I'm just computing the value.

9.10938e-31 *8.01e-13 = (9.10938 *8.01) * 1e-31-13 =72.987 *1e-44 =7.2987e-43.

Multiply by 2:1.45974e-42.

sqrt(1.45974e-42)=1.208e-21 m.

So k=1.208e-21 / 1.05457e-34 = (1.208 /1.05457 )e13 = approx 1.145e13 m^-1.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Im(f(0)) correctly.

Wait, earlier calculation said Im(f(0))= 18.2049/(2k )=18.2049/(2*1.145e13 )=18.2049/(2.29e13 )=7.958e-13 m=795.8 fm.

But the options are:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum S. Let me re-calculate S.

Wait, for l=0: (2l+1)=1, e^{2i 90}=-1. So term is 1*(-2)= -2.

For l=1: e^{i 134} -1: let me compute e^{i 134} as cos(134)= -0.6947, sin(134)=0.7193.

So e^{i 134} = -0.6947 + i 0.7193.

Subtract 1: (-1.6947) +i 0.7193.

Multiply by 3: -5.0841 +i 2.1579.

l=2: e^{i 110}=cos(110)= -0.3420, sin=0.9397.

e^{i 110} -1= (-1.3420) +i 0.9397.

Multiply by5: -6.71 +i 4.6985.

l=3: e^{i60}=0.5 +i 0.8660.

Subtract1: (-0.5) +i 0.8660.

Multiply by7: -3.5 +i 6.062.

l=4: e^{i26}=0.8988 +i 0.4384.

Subtract1: (-0.1012) +i 0.4384.

Multiply by9: (-0.9108) +i 3.9456.

Now sum all real and imaginary parts.

Real parts:

-2 (l0) + (-5.0841) (l1) = -7.0841.

-7.0841 + (-6.71) (l2) = -13.7941.

-13.7941 + (-3.5) (l3) = -17.2941.

-17.2941 + (-0.9108) (l4) = -18.2049.

Imaginary parts:

0 (l0) +2.1579 (l1)=2.1579.

+4.6985 (l2)=6.8564.

+6.062 (l3)=12.9184.

+3.9456 (l4)=16.864.

So sum is S= -18.2049 +i 16.864.

Then, f(0)=S/(2ik)= (-18.2049 + i 16.864)/(2ik).

Which is [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * 1/(2ik).

Expressed as:

= [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * (1/(2i k)).

= [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * (-i/(2k)).

Because 1/i = -i.

So,

= (-18.2049)(-i/(2k)) + (i 16.864)(-i/(2k)).

= (18.2049 i)/(2k) + (-i^2 16.864)/(2k).

Since i^2 =-1, this becomes:

= (18.2049 i)/(2k) + (16.864)/(2k).

So, f(0) = [16.864/(2k)] + i [18.2049/(2k)].

So the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k) =9.10245/k.

Wait, 18.2049/2 =9.10245.

So Im(f(0))=9.10245/k.

k is 1.145e13 m^-1.

So,

Im(f(0))=9.10245 / 1.145e13 = approx 7.958e-13 m =795.8 fm.

Hmm, same as before. So if the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the imaginary part in a different way. Let me think about the scattering amplitude formula again.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes is:

Im(f(theta=0)) = ( sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) / (k )

But earlier, sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )=13.382.

So,

Im(f(0))=13.382 / (1.145e13 )=1.168e-12 m =1168 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ), because the term in the amplitude's sum is e^{2i delta_l} -1.

So, perhaps the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) / (2k )

Wait, compute sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ):

l=0:1 * sin(180) =0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3*0.6947 ≈2.0841.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.0841=2.0841 +4.6985=6.7826 +6.062=12.8446 +3.9456=16.7902.

So sum=16.7902.

Then, Im(f(0))= sum / (2k )=16.7902/(2*1.145e13 )=16.7902/(2.29e13 )=7.332e-13 m=733.2 fm.

Still not matching options.

Alternative approach: perhaps the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) / (k )

Which is 13.382 /1.145e13= approx 1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

Hmm, but the only option that's somewhat close is option A, 87163.4 fm, but that's way bigger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me re-calculate the sum for Im(f(0)).

Wait, in the first approach, the sum of the real parts was -18.2049 and the imaginary parts sum was 16.864.

So when we compute f(0)= S/(2ik ), which is (-18.2049 +i 16.864 )/(2ik )

Which is [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * (1/(2ik )).

Expressing 1/(2ik ) as (-i)/(2k ), then:

f(0)= [ (-18.2049) (-i) + i 16.864 (-i) ] / (2k )

= [ 18.2049 i + 16.864 ] / (2k )

So, the real part is 16.864/(2k ), and the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k ).

So Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2k )=9.10245/k.

k=1.145e13 m^-1.

So Im(f(0))=9.10245 /1.145e13 =approx 7.958e-13 m=795.8 fm.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a miscalculation in k.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for the wave number. Because 50 MeV is a significant energy for electrons, which are light particles, so perhaps relativistic effects are important.

In relativistic terms, the energy E is related to the momentum p by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, we have E ≈ p²/(2m ), leading to k = p / ħ = sqrt(2mE)/ ħ.

But at 50 MeV, the electron's rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger, so relativistic effects are significant. So perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for k.

Let me compute p using relativistic formula.

E=50 MeV.

m c²=0.511 MeV.

So, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (p c)^2 = E² - (m c² )^2.

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 -0.261)≈ sqrt(2499.739)≈49.997 MeV.

So, p c ≈49.997 MeV.

So, p=49.997 MeV /c.

But p = ħ k, so k = p / ħ.

But p is in units where c is considered. Let me compute k in m^-1.

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607e-34 J·s. ħ = h/(2π) ≈1.05457e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, p =49.997 MeV /c.

MeV/c = (1e6 eV ) / (c).

But we need to convert p into kg·m/s.

1 eV =1.602e-19 J.

So, p =49.997e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV ) / c.

=49.997e6 *1.602e-19 / (3e8) kg·m/s.

Compute numerator:49.997e6 *1.602e-19 =49.997 *1e6 *1.602e-19 =49.997 *1.602e-13 ≈7.999e-12.

Denominator:3e8.

So p≈7.999e-12 /3e8 ≈2.666e-20 kg·m/s.

Then, k= p/ħ = (2.666e-20 kg·m/s )/(1.05457e-34 J·s )

But J=kg·m²/s², so kg·m/s divided by J·s is (kg·m/s )/(kg·m²/s² ·s ) )= s / m.

So,

k=2.666e-20 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.528e14 m^-1.

Ah, that's a much larger k than before. Earlier, non-relativistic gave k=1.145e13 m^-1, but relativistic gives k≈2.528e14 m^-1.

So, this would change the calculation.

So, using the relativistic k:

Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2 *2.528e14 )=18.2049/(5.056e14 )=3.6e-14 m =36 fm.

Wait, 3.6e-14 m is 36 fm, but that's not an option either. Hmm.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p.

Wait, let me compute p correctly.

E=50 MeV.

m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So, (p c )^2 = E^2 - (m c² )^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 =2500 -0.261=2499.739 (MeV)^2.

So, p c = sqrt(2499.739 ) MeV ≈49.997 MeV.

So, p=49.997 MeV /c.

Now, convert p to kg·m/s.

1 MeV/c = (1e6 eV )/(c) = (1e6 *1.602e-19 J )/c.

So, 1 MeV/c = 1.602e-13 J / (3e8 m/s )= 1.602e-13 /3e8 ≈5.34e-22 kg·m/s.

So, p=49.997 MeV/c =49.997 *5.34e-22 kg·m/s ≈2.668e-20 kg·m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ =2.668e-20 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.53e14 m^-1.

So, Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2k )=18.2049/(5.06e14 )≈3.59e-14 m =35.9 fm.

Which is close to option C:177.675 fm. No, not quite. So perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, wait, no. Because when using the relativistic approach, I get Im(f(0))=35.9 fm, which is not in the options. So perhaps the correct approach is the non-relativistic one, but then why isn't the value matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again about the formula.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i delta_l} - 1 ] P_l (cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So, f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{2i delta_l} -1 )

= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} - sum (2l+1) ]

The sum of (2l+1) from l=0 to 4 is 1+3+5+7+9=25.

So,

f(0)= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} -25 ]

So, the imaginary part Im(f(0)) will involve the imaginary parts of sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} and the real part of 25.

But 25 is real, so subtracting 25 will contribute to the real part of f(0), not the imaginary part.

So, the imaginary part comes from the imaginary parts of sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l}.

Which is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

Wait, because e^{2i delta}=cos(2 delta)+i sin(2 delta), so the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

So, Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) ] * [1/(2k) ]

Because f(0)= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) (cos(2 delta) +i sin(2 delta )) -25 ]

So,

f(0)= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) cos(2 delta) + i sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta ) -25 ]

= [ sum real parts + i sum imaginary parts -25 ] / (2ik )

= [ (sum real parts -25 ) + i sum imaginary parts ] / (2ik )

= [ (sum real parts -25 )/(2ik) ) ] + [ i sum imaginary parts/(2ik) ) ]

The first term is real over (2ik ), and the second term is imaginary.

So, f(0) = [ (sum real parts -25 ) * (-i)/(2k) ) ] + [ sum imaginary parts/(2k) ) ]

Because 1/(2ik )= -i/(2k )

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is sum imaginary parts/(2k )

Thus, Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) ] / (2k )

Now, compute sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ):

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134° )=3*0.6947≈2.0841.

l=2:5 * sin(110° )=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60° )=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26° )=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum=0 +2.0841=2.0841 +4.6985=6.7826 +6.062=12.8446 +3.9456≈16.7902.

So sum=16.7902.

Then, Im(f(0))=16.7902/(2k )

Using the non-relativistic k=1.145e13 m^-1:

Im(f(0))=16.7902/(2 *1.145e13 )=16.7902/(2.29e13 )=approx7.33e-13 m=733 fm.

Still not matching the options.

But I think I'm going in circles here. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the non-relativistic k and the sum S as before, leading to Im(f(0))=795.8 fm, which isn't among the options. But the closest option is B) 355.351 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the relativistic k, which gave me Im(f(0))≈35.9 fm, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the sum S. Let me double-check each term.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum S correctly.

Another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is given by (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) / (k )

Which would give:

sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )=1 +2.7615 +4.096 +3.5 +2.02455=13.382.

Then Im(f(0))=13.382/(k )

k=1.145e13 m^-1.

So Im(f(0))=13.382/(1.145e13 )=1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) / (2k )

Which would give 13.382/(2*1.145e13 )=13.382/(2.29e13 )=5.83e-13 m=583 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) / (k )

Which would be 13.382/(1.145e13 )=1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) * (1/(k )).

Which gives the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l ), which is 13.382, but then I'm not sure about the formula.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the intended approach is to use the formula Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) / (k )

Which would give 13.382 / 1.145e13 m^-1 =1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

But again, it's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but given that, perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, another approach: considering that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross-section.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part as sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) multiplied by a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) * (1/k )

Which would give 13.382/k =13.382/(1.145e13 )=1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

Hmm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct calculation is 795.8 fm, which isn't an option, but the closest option is B)355.351 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k in a different way.

E=50 MeV.

Using relativistic formula:

k = p / ħ.

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈49.997 MeV.

So, p=49.997 MeV /c.

1 MeV/c is 5.344e-28 kg·m/s.

So, p=49.997 *5.344e-28 kg·m/s ≈2.67e-26 kg·m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ =2.67e-26 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.53e8 m^-1.

Wait, that's different. So k=2.53e8 m^-1.

Then, Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2*2.53e8 )=18.2049/(5.06e8 )=3.59e-8 m=3.59e-5 fm=0.0000359 fm.

No, that can't be right. Something's wrong with the units here.

I'm getting more confused. I think I'll have to proceed with the initial calculation.

Based on the non-relativistic approach, Im(f(0))=795.8 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct option is B)355.351 fm. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute f(0) correctly.

Another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) / (k )

Which would be 13.382/(1.145e13 )=1168 fm.

But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) is:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 sin(13)=9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.382.

Yes, that's correct. So sum is 13.382.

So if Im(f(0))= sum/(k )=13.382/(1.145e13 )=1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the question says degrees. Let me check.

If I convert the phase shifts to radians:

δ0=90°=pi/2=1.5708 rad.

δ1=67°=1.16937 rad.

δ2=55°=0.95993 rad.

δ3=30°=0.523598 rad.

δ4=13°=0.226893 rad.

But I used degrees in calculations earlier. Perhaps we should compute using radians.

But the calculation of sin(delta) would be the same whether in degrees or radians, as long as the functions are computed correctly.

Wait, no, because in programming, math functions use radians, but in this case, I've used degrees correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the sum with the phase shifts in radians.

Wait, let me compute the sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) using radians.

l=0:1 * sin(pi )=0.

l=1:3 * sin(2*1.16937 )=3 * sin(2.33874 rad )=3 *0.7317=2.195.

l=2:5 * sin(2*0.95993 )=5 sin(1.91986 )=5 *0.9440=4.720.

l=3:7 * sin(2*0.523598 )=7 * sin(1.047196 )=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(2*0.226893 )=9 sin(0.453786 )=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum=0+2.195=2.195+4.720=6.915+6.062=12.977+3.9456=16.9226.

So sum=16.9226.

Then, Im(f(0))=16.9226/(2k )=16.9226/(2*1.145e13 )=16.9226/(2.29e13 )=7.38e-13 m=738 fm.

Still not matching any options.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with the initial calculation of 795.8 fm, which isn't an option, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the real part. But the question asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum differently.

Wait, perhaps I should sum the real parts and the imaginary parts correctly.

Wait, earlier sum of (2l+1)(e^{2i delta} -1 ) is S= (-18.2049) +i (16.864 ).

So f(0)= S/(2ik )= [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ]/(2ik )

Which can be written as [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * (1/(2ik )).

Expressed as [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * ( -i/(2k) )

Which becomes:

(-18.2049)(-i) + (i 16.864)(-i) ) / (2k )

= (18.2049 i ) + (16.864 ) ) / (2k )

So f(0)= (16.864 +18.2049 i )/(2k )

Imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k )=9.10245/k.

k=1.145e13 m^-1.

So 9.10245 /1.145e13=7.958e-13 m=795.8 fm.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B)355.351 fm.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is given by k= sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but E should be in joules.

E=50 MeV=50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

m=9.10938e-31 kg.

So, sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(2 *9.10938e-31 *8.01e-13 )=sqrt(1.4597e-42 )=1.208e-21 m.

So k=1.208e-21 /1.05457e-34=1.145e13 m^-1.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct value is approximately 795 fm, which isn't among the options. Perhaps the intended answer is option B)355.351 fm, which is closest to half of 795, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum S.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate each term.

Let me re-calculate each term:

For l=0: (1)(e^{i180} -1 )=1*(-2)= -2.

l=1: 3*(e^{i134} -1 )

e^{i134}=cos(134)= -0.6947, sin=0.7193. So e^{i134} -1= (-1.6947) +i0.7193. Multiply by3: -5.0841 +i2.1579.

l=2:5*(e^{i110}-1 )

e^{i110}=cos(110)= -0.3420, sin=0.9397. So e^{i110}-1= (-1.3420) +i0.9397. Multiply by5: -6.71 +i4.6985.

l=3:7*(e^{i60} -1 )

e^{i60}=0.5 +i0.8660. e^{i60} -1= (-0.5) +i0.8660. Multiply by7: -3.5 +i6.062.

l=4:9*(e^{i26} -1 )

e^{i26}=0.8988 +i0.4384. e^{i26} -1= (-0.1012) +i0.4384. Multiply by9: -0.9108 +i3.9456.

Sum real parts: -2 -5.0841= -7.0841 -6.71= -13.7941 -3.5= -17.2941 -0.9108= -18.2049.

Imaginary parts:0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So sum S is correct.

Thus, the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k ), which is 795.8 fm.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B)355.351 fm.

Wait, perhaps the initial question uses the real part instead of the imaginary part. But the question clearly asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic k. If I do that, as earlier, k=2.53e14 m^-1.

Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2*2.53e14 )=18.2049/(5.06e14 )=3.59e-14 m=35.9 fm.

But that's not an option either.

I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm. But I can't see where that comes from.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) * 1000 fm.

Sum is 13.382 *1000=13382 fm, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) multiplied by 1e-15 m.

13.382 *1e-15 m=13.382 fm, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l ), multiply by 2, and then find the value.

13.382 *2=26.764, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option B)355.351 fm, which is roughly 355 fm.

But I'm not sure how to get to that value. Maybe I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) in radians.

Using radians:

sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

delta0=90°=pi/2=1.5708 rad: sin=1.

delta1=67°=1.16937 rad: sin=0.9205.

delta2=55°=0.95993 rad: sin=0.8192.

delta3=30°=0.523598 rad: sin=0.5.

delta4=13°=0.226893 rad: sin=0.22495.

So,

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495=2.02455.

Sum=1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.02455=13.382.

Same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option B)355.351 fm, but I can't see how to arrive at that value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( f(0) \), for elastic electron scattering at 50 MeV, given phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The scattering amplitude is expressed using the partial wave expansion:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \left( e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \right),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, given by \( k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar \). The imaginary part of \( f(0) \), \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \), is derived from the imaginary contributions of the terms in the sum.

### Key Steps:
1. **Partial Wave Expansion**: Each term in the sum is computed as \( (2l+1)(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1) \). The imaginary part of this term is \( (2l+1)\sin(2\delta_l) \). The total imaginary contribution is the sum of these terms divided by \( 2k \).

2. **Sum of Imaginary Contributions**:
   - \( l=0 \): \( 1 \cdot \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( 3 \cdot \sin(134^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.6947 = 2.0841 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( 5 \cdot \sin(110^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.9397 = 4.6985 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( 7 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot 0.8660 = 6.062 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( 9 \cdot \sin(26^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.4384 = 3.9456 \).

   Summing these contributions gives:
   \[
   \text{Total Imaginary Contribution} = 0 + 2.0841 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.7902.
   \]

3. **Wave Number Calculation**: Using the non-relativistic formula \( k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), \( m \) is the electron mass, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant:
   - \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} = 8.01 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \),
   - \( k = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.10938 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-13}} / 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \approx 1.145 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1} \).

4. **Imaginary Part of \( f(0) \)**:
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{\text{Total Imaginary Contribution}}{2k} = \frac{16.7902}{2 \cdot 1.145 \times 10^{13}} \approx 7.33 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m} = 733 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (87163.4 fm)**: This is far too large compared to the computed value.
- **Option B (355.351 fm)**: This is significantly smaller than the computed value of \( 733 \, \text{fm} \), but it is the closest to the expected order of magnitude.
- **Option C (177.675 fm)** and **Option D (251.271 fm)**: These are also much smaller than the computed value.

### Conclusion:
The computed value of \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \) is approximately \( 733 \, \text{fm} \), but since this is not among the options, the closest match is **Option B (355.351 fm)**. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts δ0 to δ4 as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. The electrons have an energy of 50 MeV. I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, especially for particles like electrons, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the optical theorem or partial wave expansion comes into play here.

Hmm, the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by the partial wave expansion. The general formula for f(θ) when expressed in terms of phase shifts δ_l is:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) / ( (1 - e^{-2i δ_l}) ) * ... Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, no, another approach. The scattering amplitude can be written as a sum over angular momentum states. Each partial wave contributes, and the amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) )

But I'm trying to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. That would be θ=0°, because that's the direction of the incident beam.

Wait, but when θ=0°, cosθ is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for l=0, and zero for l>0 because P_l(1) = 1 for l=0, and for higher l, it's zero? No, wait, the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) equals 1 for any l. No, wait, no—Legendre polynomials of even and odd orders behave differently at 1. Wait, no, actually, P_l(1) is always 1, because when x=1, P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Wait, no, that's correct. Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So for θ=0°, all the terms contribute.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum. So when θ=0°, each term contributes. But in our case, the phase shifts given are δ0 to δ4, so l goes up to 4.

The problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so we include l=0 to l=4.

But the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0°, so let's compute Im[f(0)].

So the formula for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) )

At θ=0°, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So each term becomes (2l +1)(e^{2i δ_l} - 1) * 1.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l +1)(e^{2i δ_l} - 1) )

We need the imaginary part of this. Let's break it down.

First, let's compute each term (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1), then sum them, then multiply by (1/(2ik)), and then find the imaginary part.

Wait, but k is the wave number. k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But E is 50 MeV. I need to compute k in appropriate units.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to compute Im[f(0)] without knowing k, but let's see.

Wait, the options are given in fm (femtometers), which is 1e-15 meters. So the units must come from the calculation involving k.

But perhaps there's a simpler way. Let me think again about the expression for f(θ).

Wait, another approach. The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the optical theorem, which says that Im[f(θ)] is proportional to the total cross-section. But wait, no, the optical theorem relates the integral of |f|² to the total cross-section. Alternatively, for small angles, maybe we can use certain approximations, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the imaginary part of f(0) directly from the partial wave expansion.

So, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) ), for l=0 to 4.

Let me compute each term (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} - 1), then sum them, then multiply by 1/(2ik), and take the imaginary part.

So first, let's compute each term:

For l=0: δ0 =90°, which is π/2 radians.
e^{2i δ0} = e^{i π} = cos(π) + i sin(π) = -1 + 0i. So e^{2i δ0} -1 = (-1) -1 = -2.

So term for l=0: (2*0+1)*(e^{2i δ0} -1 ) = 1*(-2) = -2.

l=1: δ1=67°, which is about 1.169 radians.
Compute e^{2i δ1} = cos(2δ1) + i sin(2δ1)
2δ1 is 134°, which is approximately 2.340 radians.

cos(134°) ≈ -0.6947, sin(134°) ≈ 0.7193.

So e^{2i δ1} = (-0.6947) + i (0.7193).
So e^{2i δ1} -1 = (-0.6947 -1) + i (0.7193) = (-1.6947) + i (0.7193).

Multiply by (2*1 +1)=3: 3*(-1.6947 + i 0.7193) = -5.0841 + i 2.1579.

l=2: δ2=55°, 1.95 radians.
2δ2=110°, which is 1.919 radians.
cos(110°) ≈ -0.3420, sin(110°)≈ 0.9397.

e^{2i δ2} = (-0.3420) + i 0.9397.
e^{2i δ2} -1 = (-1.3420) + i 0.9397.

Multiply by (2*2+1)=5: 5*(-1.3420 + i 0.9397) = -6.71 + i 4.6985.

l=3: δ3=30°, which is 0.5236 radians.
2δ3=60°, 1.0472 radians.
cos(60°)=0.5, sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660.

e^{2i δ3} = 0.5 +i 0.8660.
e^{2i δ3} -1 = (-0.5) + i 0.8660.

Multiply by (2*3+1)=7: 7*(-0.5 +i 0.8660) = -3.5 + i 6.062.

l=4: δ4=13°, which is approximately 0.2269 radians.
2δ4=26°, about 0.4538 radians.
cos(26°)=0.8988, sin(26°)=0.4384.

e^{2i δ4}=0.8988 + i 0.4384.
e^{2i δ4} -1 = (0.8988-1) + i 0.4384 = (-0.1012) + i 0.4384.

Multiply by (2*4+1)=9: 9*(-0.1012 + i 0.4384) = -0.9108 + i 3.9456.

Now, summing all these terms:

Let's collect the real and imaginary parts:

l=0:
Real: -2
Imag: 0

l=1:
Real: -5.0841
Imag: 2.1579

l=2:
Real: -6.71
Imag:4.6985

l=3:
Real: -3.5
Imag:6.062

l=4:
Real: -0.9108
Imag:3.9456

Summing all real parts:

-2 -5.0841 = -7.0841
-7.0841 -6.71 = -13.7941
-13.7941 -3.5 = -17.2941
-17.2941 -0.9108 = -18.2049

Summing all imaginary parts:

0 + 2.1579 = 2.1579
2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564
6.8564 +6.062=12.9184
12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So the sum S is ( -18.2049 ) + i (16.864 )

Then, f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * S.

We need to compute Im[f(0)].

So let me factor this expression:

f(0) = [ (-18.2049) + i (16.864) ] / (2ik) = [ (-18.2049) + i (16.864) ] * (1/(2ik)).

Expressed as a complex number, 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = (-i/(2)) * (1/k).

So,

f(0) = [ (-18.2049) + i (16.864) ] * ( -i/(2k) )

Multiplying this out:

First, multiply each term:

= [ (-18.2049) * (-i) ) / (2k) ) ] + [ (i 16.864) * (-i) ) / (2k) ) ]

Simplify each part:

First term: (18.2049 * i ) / (2k)

Second term: [ i * (-i) * 16.864 ] / (2k ) = [ (-i²) 16.864 ] / (2k) ) = [ (16.864) ] / (2k) because i² =-1, so -i² =1.

So,

f(0) = [ (18.2049 i) + 16.864 ] / (2k )

Which can be written as:

f(0) = (16.864) / (2k) + i (18.2049)/(2k )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (18.2049)/(2k).

Wait, because when you have a complex number a + ib, the imaginary part is b.

So, Im[f(0)] = (18.2049) / (2k )

Hmm, and what is k?

k is the wave number, given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. But I need to make sure about the units.

Wait, E is given in MeV. Let's convert that to joules. 1 eV = 1.60218e-19 J. So 50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.60218e-19 J = 8.0109e-13 J.

But m is the mass of the electron, which is 9.10938e-31 kg.

So,

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ

But ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

2mE = 2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.0109e-13 J = let's compute that.

Wait, E is in joules. Let me compute 2mE:

2*(9.10938e-31 kg) * (8.0109e-13 J) = 2 *9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13.

Compute 9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13 = 7.2990e-43.

Multiply by 2: 1.4598e-43.

So sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(1.4598e-43) = sqrt(1.4598) * 1e-21.5 ≈ 1.208 * 1e-21.5? Wait, no. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1e-43 is (1e-21.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-43) is 1e-21.5, which is 3.1623e-22 m.

Wait, 1e-21.5 is 1e-21 * sqrt(10) ≈ 3.1623e-22.

So sqrt(1.4598e-43) = sqrt(1.4598) * 1e-21.5 ≈ 1.208 * 3.1623e-22 ≈ 3.826e-22 m.

Wait, but let me compute it exactly:

2mE = 2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 8.0109e-13 J.

Compute 9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13:

9.10938 *8.0109 ≈ 72.987, and 1e-31 *1e-13=1e-44. So 72.987e-44 = 7.2987e-43.

Multiply by 2: 14.5974e-43 = 1.45974e-42.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2 *9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13 = 2 * (9.10938 *8.0109) * 1e-31-13) = 2 *72.987 *1e-44 = 145.974e-44 = 1.45974e-42.

So sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(1.45974e-42) = sqrt(1.45974) * 1e-21 = approx 1.208 * 1e-21 = 1.208e-21 m.

Then, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ = (1.208e-21 m) / (1.05457e-34 J·s) ) 

Let me compute the division:

1.208e-21 / 1.05457e-34 = (1.208 / 1.05457) * 1e13 ≈ (1.145) * 1e13 ≈ 1.145e13 m^-1.

Wait, because 1e-21 / 1e-34 = 1e13.

So k ≈ 1.145e13 m^-1.

Wait, but we can be more precise with the calculation. Let me compute 1.208 / 1.05457:

1.208 / 1.05457 ≈ 1.145 approximately.

So k ≈1.145e13 m^-1.

Now, back to Im[f(0)] = (18.2049)/(2k).

k is 1.145e13 m^-1, so 2k is 2.29e13 m^-1.

So,

Im[f(0)] = 18.2049 / (2.29e13) ≈ (18.2049 / 2.29) ) * 1e-13.

18.2049 / 2.29 ≈ 7.958.

So Im[f(0)]≈7.958e-13 m.

But wait, the options are in femtometers (fm), which is 1e-15 m. So we need to convert 7.958e-13 m to fm.

1e-13 m = 100 fm. So 7.958e-13 m = 7.958 * 100 fm = 795.8 fm.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.351, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the formula for f(θ). Let me think again.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) P_l(cosθ) ]

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so it's (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ]

So, the sum S is sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) ]

Which we computed as S ≈ -18.2049 + i 16.864.

Then f(0) = S/(2ik).

But f(θ) is a dimensionless quantity? Or wait, no, because the scattering amplitude has dimensions of length.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused about the units. Let me double-check.

Wait, the wave number k has units of 1/m. So 2ik is unitless multiplied by i, so 1/(2ik) has units of m (since 1/k is meters).

So when we multiply by S, which was computed as a dimensionless sum, f(0) will have units of meters. But the problem says to find the imaginary part in fm (femtometers), which is 1e-15 meters.

So, in our calculation, Im[f(0)] = 18.2049/(2k) [since k is in m^-1, 2k is m^-1, so 1/(2k) is m; multiplied by 18.2049, which is unitless, gives m].

Wait, but earlier calculation gives Im[f(0)] ≈ 7.958e-13 m = 795.8 fm. But none of the options are near 800 fm. The closest is A) 87163.4 fm, which is way larger, and B is 355, which is half of that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sum S.

Let me recalculate the sum S.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing each term. Let me recheck each l.

l=0: (2*0+1)=1. e^{2i*90°} is e^{iπ} = -1. So e^{2iδ0} -1 = -1 -1 = -2. So term is 1*(-2) = -2.

l=1: δ1=67°, 2δ1=134°. e^{2iδ1} = cos(134°) + i sin(134°). Cos(134) is about -0.6947, sin(134) is about 0.7193. So e^{2iδ1} -1 = (-0.6947 -1) + i 0.7193 = -1.6947 + i 0.7193.

Multiply by (2l+1)=3: 3*(-1.6947) = -5.0841, 3*(0.7193)=2.1579. Correct.

l=2: δ2=55°, 2δ2=110°. Cos(110)= -0.3420, sin(110)= 0.9397. e^{2iδ2} = -0.3420 + i 0.9397. Subtract 1: -1.3420 + i 0.9397. Multiply by 5: -6.71 + i 4.6985. Correct.

l=3: δ3=30°, 2δ3=60°. Cos(60)=0.5, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. e^{2iδ3}= 0.5 + i 0.8660. Subtract 1: -0.5 + i 0.8660. Multiply by7: -3.5 + i 6.062. Correct.

l=4: δ4=13°, 2δ4=26°. Cos(26)=0.8988, sin(26)=0.4384. e^{2iδ4}= 0.8988 + i 0.4384. Subtract 1: -0.1012 + i 0.4384. Multiply by9: -0.9108 + i 3.9456. Correct.

So the sum is:

Real parts: (-2) + (-5.0841) + (-6.71) + (-3.5) + (-0.9108) = let's sum sequentially.

-2 -5.0841 = -7.0841.

-7.0841 -6.71 = -13.7941.

-13.7941 -3.5 = -17.2941.

-17.2941 -0.9108 = -18.2049. Correct.

Imaginary parts: 0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = sum them.

0 +2.1579 =2.1579.

+4.6985 → 6.8564.

+6.062 → 12.9184.

+3.9456 →16.864. Correct.

So S = (-18.2049) + i 16.864.

So f(0) = S/(2ik) = [ (-18.2049) + i 16.864 ] / (2ik).

Wait, but 2ik is 2i *k, so let me factor it:

= [ (-18.2049) + i 16.864 ] * 1/(2ik).

But 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = (-i/(2)) * (1/k).

So,

f(0) = [ (-18.2049) + i 16.864 ] * (-i/(2k)).

Multiply out:

= [ (-18.2049)(-i) ) + (i 16.864)(-i) ) ] / (2k)

= [ (18.2049 i) + (-i^2) 16.864 ] / (2k)

Since i^2 = -1, (-i^2)=1.

So,

= [ 18.2049 i + 16.864 ] / (2k )

Which is (16.864 + 18.2049 i ) / (2k).

So, the real part is 16.864/(2k), and the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k).

Wait, no, because (a + ib)/(c) = a/c + i b/c. So in this case, a=16.864, b=18.2049, and c=2k.

So the imaginary part is b/(2k) = 18.2049/(2k).

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 18.2049/(2k), but let's confirm.

Wait, the expression is (16.864 + 18.2049 i ) / (2k). So the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k).

So, Im[f(0)] = 18.2049/(2k).

Hmm, so with k being 1.145e13 m^-1.

So 2k is 2.29e13 m^-1.

So,

Im(f(0)) = 18.2049 / (2.29e13) = (18.2049 / 2.29) ) * 1e-13.

Wait, 18.2049 / 2.29 ≈7.958.

So Im(f(0)) ≈7.958e-13 m.

Convert to fm: 1e-15 m is 1 fm.

So 7.958e-13 m = 795.8 fm.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is B)355.351 fm or D)251.271. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculating k. Let's recalculate k.

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

E is 50 MeV. Let me compute this properly in SI units.

E =50 MeV =50e6 eV * 1.60218e-19 J/eV = 50e6 * 1.60218e-19 = 8.0109e-13 J.

m=mass of electron=9.10938e-31 kg.

So 2mE = 2 *9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13.

Let me compute 9.10938e-31 *8.0109e-13:

9.10938 *8.0109 ≈72.986.

Exponents: 1e-31 *1e-13 =1e-44.

So 2mE=2 *72.986e-44 =145.972e-44 =1.45972e-42.

So sqrt(2mE) = sqrt(1.45972e-42) = approx 1.208e-21 m.

Wait, sqrt(1.45972e-42) = sqrt(1.45972) * 1e-21.

sqrt(1.45972)=1.208, so yes, 1.208e-21 m.

Then, ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = (1.208e-21 m) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s) ) = let's compute that.

1.208e-21 /1.05457e-34 = (1.208/1.05457) ) * 1e13.

Compute 1.208 /1.05457 ≈ 1.145.

So k≈1.145e13 m^-1.

So, 1/(2k)=1/(2 *1.145e13) =1/(2.29e13) ≈4.367e-14 m.

Then, Im(f(0))=18.2049 *4.367e-14 m.

18.2049 *4.367e-14 = ?

18 *4.367e-14 =78.606e-14 =7.8606e-13 m.

0.2049 *4.367e-14 ≈0.9e-14.

So total ≈7.8606e-13 +0.9e-14≈7.9506e-13 m =795.06 fm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f(theta=0) is different. Another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l).

Wait, no, because the imaginary part comes from the e^{i delta_l} terms. Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation to the total cross-section.

Wait, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section sigma_total is 4 pi |f|^2 averaged over angles, but perhaps that's not directly helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the partial wave amplitude contributes to the cross-section.

Wait, another thought: the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) (e^{2i delta_l} - 1) P_l (cos theta) ]

The imaginary part of f(theta) is then the sum of the imaginary contributions from each term.

At theta=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im[f(0)] = (1/(2k)) sum [ (2l+1) * Im( e^{2i delta_l} - 1 ) ]

Because 1/(2ik) is a real factor times 1/k, but wait, no. Wait, 1/(2ik)= -i/(2k), which when multiplied by a complex number would affect the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute Im(f(0)) directly.

Let's denote each term as (2l+1)(e^{2i delta_l} -1) = A_l + i B_l.

Then, f(0) = sum (A_l + i B_l )/(2ik) = (sum A_l + i sum B_l ) / (2ik).

Which can be written as (sum A_l + i sum B_l ) * (-i) / (2k).

= [ sum A_l (-i) + sum B_l (-i^2) ] / (2k )

= [ -i sum A_l + sum B_l ] / (2k )

So f(0) = [ sum B_l + i (- sum A_l) ] / (2k )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is [ - sum A_l ] / (2k )

Since Im(f(0)) is the coefficient of i in f(0).

So, Im(f(0)) = ( - sum A_l ) / (2k )

In our case, sum A_l is the real parts of each term: sum A_l = -18.2049.

So,

Im(f(0)) = ( - (-18.2049) ) / (2k ) = 18.2049/(2k )

Which is the same as before. So I didn't make a mistake there.

Hmm, but the calculated value is about 795 fm, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum S. Let me check each term again.

Wait, for l=1:

e^{2i delta_l} -1 = e^{i 134°} -1.

Which is cos(134) +i sin(134) -1 = (cos(134)-1) + i sin(134).

Which gives:

Real part: cos(134) -1 = -0.6947 -1 = -1.6947.

Imaginary part: 0.7193.

Multiply by 3: Real part: -5.0841, Imaginary part: 2.1579. Correct.

Similarly for l=2:

e^{2i 55}= e^{i 110} = cos(110) +i sin(110) = -0.3420 + i 0.9397.

Subtract 1: real part -0.3420-1= -1.3420, imaginary 0.9397.

Multiply by 5: real -6.71, imaginary 4.6985.

Correct.

l=3: e^{i60} = 0.5 +i 0.8660.

Subtract 1: real -0.5, imaginary 0.8660.

Multiply by7: real -3.5, imaginary 6.062.

Correct.

l=4: e^{i26}=0.8988 +i 0.4384.

Subtract 1: real -0.1012, imaginary 0.4384.

Multiply by9: real -0.9108, imaginary 3.9456.

Correct.

So the sum A_l is -18.2049, so Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2k)=795.8 fm.

But that's not any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in different units, or I missed a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the initial formula was incorrect.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(delta_l). Because when you expand e^{2i delta_l} -1, you get e^{i 2 delta} -1 = e^{i delta} (e^{i delta} -e^{-i delta}) ) = e^{i delta} * 2i sin(delta).

So, e^{2i delta} -1 = 2i e^{i delta} sin(delta).

So, each term (2l+1)(e^{2i delta} -1 ) = i 2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta).

But perhaps that's complicating things, but let's proceed.

So, sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2i delta} -1) ] = i sum [2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta) ]

But f(0) = [ sum (2l+1)(e^{2i delta} -1) ]/(2ik )

So,

f(0) = [i sum 2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta) ] / (2ik ) )

Simplify 2/(2i) = 1/(i) = -i.

So,

f(0) = [ i sum 2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta) ] * (1/(2ik )) 

= [ i * sum 2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta) ] * (1/(2ik )) 

= [ sum (2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta)) ] * (i/(2ik )) )

Wait, (i)/(2ik) ) = 1/(2k).

So,

f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum [ (2 (2l+1) e^{i delta} sin(delta) ) ]

Wait, this seems a bit more complicated, but perhaps the imaginary part can be found here.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is sum [ (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) ] / (k )

Wait, perhaps:

Because the imaginary part of f(0) comes from the imaginary parts of each term in the sum. Let's think again.

Each term in sum [ (2l+1)(e^{2i delta_l} -1) ] is (2l+1)(e^{i 2 delta_l} -1 )

= (2l+1)( cos(2 delta_l) + i sin(2 delta_l) - 1 )

= (2l+1) [ (cos(2 delta_l) -1) + i sin(2 delta_l) )

So, the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

So the sum of imaginary parts is sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) ]

Then, since f(0) = [ sum [ (2l+1)(e^{i 2 delta} -1 ) ] ] / (2ik )

The imaginary part of f(0) is [ sum [ (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l) ) ] ] / (2k )

Because f(0) = [ real part + i (sum Im terms) ] / (2ik )

Wait, no, because when you have a complex number in the numerator, and you divide by 2ik, which is 2i *k, the imaginary component comes from the real part of the numerator multiplied by 1/(2k) and multiplied by i.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part is given by [ sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] / (k )

Wait, I've seen a formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude as (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) / (k ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me compute sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) for each l.

l=0: (1) * sin(90) =1*1=1.

l=1: 3 * sin(67)≈3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5*sin(55)≈5*0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7*sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*sin(13)≈9*0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum them:

1 +2.7615=3.7615.

+4.096=7.8575.

+3.5=11.3575.

+2.02455=13.382.

So sum= approx 13.382.

So if Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) / k.

Then, Im(f(0))=13.382 / (1.145e13 m^-1 )

=13.382 /1.145e13 ≈11.683e-13 m = 1168.3 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) )/(k )

So:

sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )=13.382.

k=1.145e13 m^-1.

So Im(f(0))=13.382 /1.145e13 = approx 1.168e-12 m = 1168 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, but the options don't have this. So maybe I'm missing a factor of 2.

Wait, in our first approach, we had Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2k)=795.8 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum S.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ] / (k )

Which would give 13.382 / 1.145e13 m^-1 = 11.68e-13 m = 1168 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians? Wait, no, the problem states degrees, because the given phase shifts are in degrees.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing k.

Wait, E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV. Let me compute E in joules correctly.

E =50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 50e6 *1.602e-19 = 8.01e-13 J.

Yes, correct.

m=9.10938e-31 kg.

So k= sqrt(2 m E) / ħ.

Compute sqrt(2mE):

2mE= 2 *9.10938e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J = 2*9.10938e-31 *8.01e-13 = let me compute.

9.10938e-31 *8.01e-13 = 7.299e-43 kg·J.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so 2mE has units kg²·m²/s².

Wait, but I'm just computing the value.

9.10938e-31 *8.01e-13 = (9.10938 *8.01) * 1e-31-13 =72.987 *1e-44 =7.2987e-43.

Multiply by 2:1.45974e-42.

sqrt(1.45974e-42)=1.208e-21 m.

So k=1.208e-21 / 1.05457e-34 = (1.208 /1.05457 )e13 = approx 1.145e13 m^-1.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Im(f(0)) correctly.

Wait, earlier calculation said Im(f(0))= 18.2049/(2k )=18.2049/(2*1.145e13 )=18.2049/(2.29e13 )=7.958e-13 m=795.8 fm.

But the options are:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum S. Let me re-calculate S.

Wait, for l=0: (2l+1)=1, e^{2i 90}=-1. So term is 1*(-2)= -2.

For l=1: e^{i 134} -1: let me compute e^{i 134} as cos(134)= -0.6947, sin(134)=0.7193.

So e^{i 134} = -0.6947 + i 0.7193.

Subtract 1: (-1.6947) +i 0.7193.

Multiply by 3: -5.0841 +i 2.1579.

l=2: e^{i 110}=cos(110)= -0.3420, sin=0.9397.

e^{i 110} -1= (-1.3420) +i 0.9397.

Multiply by5: -6.71 +i 4.6985.

l=3: e^{i60}=0.5 +i 0.8660.

Subtract1: (-0.5) +i 0.8660.

Multiply by7: -3.5 +i 6.062.

l=4: e^{i26}=0.8988 +i 0.4384.

Subtract1: (-0.1012) +i 0.4384.

Multiply by9: (-0.9108) +i 3.9456.

Now sum all real and imaginary parts.

Real parts:

-2 (l0) + (-5.0841) (l1) = -7.0841.

-7.0841 + (-6.71) (l2) = -13.7941.

-13.7941 + (-3.5) (l3) = -17.2941.

-17.2941 + (-0.9108) (l4) = -18.2049.

Imaginary parts:

0 (l0) +2.1579 (l1)=2.1579.

+4.6985 (l2)=6.8564.

+6.062 (l3)=12.9184.

+3.9456 (l4)=16.864.

So sum is S= -18.2049 +i 16.864.

Then, f(0)=S/(2ik)= (-18.2049 + i 16.864)/(2ik).

Which is [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * 1/(2ik).

Expressed as:

= [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * (1/(2i k)).

= [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * (-i/(2k)).

Because 1/i = -i.

So,

= (-18.2049)(-i/(2k)) + (i 16.864)(-i/(2k)).

= (18.2049 i)/(2k) + (-i^2 16.864)/(2k).

Since i^2 =-1, this becomes:

= (18.2049 i)/(2k) + (16.864)/(2k).

So, f(0) = [16.864/(2k)] + i [18.2049/(2k)].

So the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k) =9.10245/k.

Wait, 18.2049/2 =9.10245.

So Im(f(0))=9.10245/k.

k is 1.145e13 m^-1.

So,

Im(f(0))=9.10245 / 1.145e13 = approx 7.958e-13 m =795.8 fm.

Hmm, same as before. So if the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should calculate the imaginary part in a different way. Let me think about the scattering amplitude formula again.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes is:

Im(f(theta=0)) = ( sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l) ) / (k )

But earlier, sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )=13.382.

So,

Im(f(0))=13.382 / (1.145e13 )=1.168e-12 m =1168 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ), because the term in the amplitude's sum is e^{2i delta_l} -1.

So, perhaps the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) / (2k )

Wait, compute sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ):

l=0:1 * sin(180) =0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3*0.6947 ≈2.0841.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7*sin(60)=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.0841=2.0841 +4.6985=6.7826 +6.062=12.8446 +3.9456=16.7902.

So sum=16.7902.

Then, Im(f(0))= sum / (2k )=16.7902/(2*1.145e13 )=16.7902/(2.29e13 )=7.332e-13 m=733.2 fm.

Still not matching options.

Alternative approach: perhaps the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) / (k )

Which is 13.382 /1.145e13= approx 1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

Hmm, but the only option that's somewhat close is option A, 87163.4 fm, but that's way bigger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum. Let me re-calculate the sum for Im(f(0)).

Wait, in the first approach, the sum of the real parts was -18.2049 and the imaginary parts sum was 16.864.

So when we compute f(0)= S/(2ik ), which is (-18.2049 +i 16.864 )/(2ik )

Which is [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * (1/(2ik )).

Expressing 1/(2ik ) as (-i)/(2k ), then:

f(0)= [ (-18.2049) (-i) + i 16.864 (-i) ] / (2k )

= [ 18.2049 i + 16.864 ] / (2k )

So, the real part is 16.864/(2k ), and the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k ).

So Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2k )=9.10245/k.

k=1.145e13 m^-1.

So Im(f(0))=9.10245 /1.145e13 =approx 7.958e-13 m=795.8 fm.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a miscalculation in k.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for the wave number. Because 50 MeV is a significant energy for electrons, which are light particles, so perhaps relativistic effects are important.

In relativistic terms, the energy E is related to the momentum p by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, we have E ≈ p²/(2m ), leading to k = p / ħ = sqrt(2mE)/ ħ.

But at 50 MeV, the electron's rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger, so relativistic effects are significant. So perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for k.

Let me compute p using relativistic formula.

E=50 MeV.

m c²=0.511 MeV.

So, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, (p c)^2 = E² - (m c² )^2.

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2500 -0.261)≈ sqrt(2499.739)≈49.997 MeV.

So, p c ≈49.997 MeV.

So, p=49.997 MeV /c.

But p = ħ k, so k = p / ħ.

But p is in units where c is considered. Let me compute k in m^-1.

h is Planck's constant, 6.62607e-34 J·s. ħ = h/(2π) ≈1.05457e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, p =49.997 MeV /c.

MeV/c = (1e6 eV ) / (c).

But we need to convert p into kg·m/s.

1 eV =1.602e-19 J.

So, p =49.997e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV ) / c.

=49.997e6 *1.602e-19 / (3e8) kg·m/s.

Compute numerator:49.997e6 *1.602e-19 =49.997 *1e6 *1.602e-19 =49.997 *1.602e-13 ≈7.999e-12.

Denominator:3e8.

So p≈7.999e-12 /3e8 ≈2.666e-20 kg·m/s.

Then, k= p/ħ = (2.666e-20 kg·m/s )/(1.05457e-34 J·s )

But J=kg·m²/s², so kg·m/s divided by J·s is (kg·m/s )/(kg·m²/s² ·s ) )= s / m.

So,

k=2.666e-20 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.528e14 m^-1.

Ah, that's a much larger k than before. Earlier, non-relativistic gave k=1.145e13 m^-1, but relativistic gives k≈2.528e14 m^-1.

So, this would change the calculation.

So, using the relativistic k:

Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2 *2.528e14 )=18.2049/(5.056e14 )=3.6e-14 m =36 fm.

Wait, 3.6e-14 m is 36 fm, but that's not an option either. Hmm.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p.

Wait, let me compute p correctly.

E=50 MeV.

m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So, (p c )^2 = E^2 - (m c² )^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 =2500 -0.261=2499.739 (MeV)^2.

So, p c = sqrt(2499.739 ) MeV ≈49.997 MeV.

So, p=49.997 MeV /c.

Now, convert p to kg·m/s.

1 MeV/c = (1e6 eV )/(c) = (1e6 *1.602e-19 J )/c.

So, 1 MeV/c = 1.602e-13 J / (3e8 m/s )= 1.602e-13 /3e8 ≈5.34e-22 kg·m/s.

So, p=49.997 MeV/c =49.997 *5.34e-22 kg·m/s ≈2.668e-20 kg·m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ =2.668e-20 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.53e14 m^-1.

So, Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2k )=18.2049/(5.06e14 )≈3.59e-14 m =35.9 fm.

Which is close to option C:177.675 fm. No, not quite. So perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, wait, no. Because when using the relativistic approach, I get Im(f(0))=35.9 fm, which is not in the options. So perhaps the correct approach is the non-relativistic one, but then why isn't the value matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again about the formula.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i delta_l} - 1 ] P_l (cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So, f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{2i delta_l} -1 )

= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} - sum (2l+1) ]

The sum of (2l+1) from l=0 to 4 is 1+3+5+7+9=25.

So,

f(0)= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} -25 ]

So, the imaginary part Im(f(0)) will involve the imaginary parts of sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l} and the real part of 25.

But 25 is real, so subtracting 25 will contribute to the real part of f(0), not the imaginary part.

So, the imaginary part comes from the imaginary parts of sum (2l+1) e^{2i delta_l}.

Which is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

Wait, because e^{2i delta}=cos(2 delta)+i sin(2 delta), so the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l )

So, Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) ] * [1/(2k) ]

Because f(0)= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) (cos(2 delta) +i sin(2 delta )) -25 ]

So,

f(0)= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) cos(2 delta) + i sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta ) -25 ]

= [ sum real parts + i sum imaginary parts -25 ] / (2ik )

= [ (sum real parts -25 ) + i sum imaginary parts ] / (2ik )

= [ (sum real parts -25 )/(2ik) ) ] + [ i sum imaginary parts/(2ik) ) ]

The first term is real over (2ik ), and the second term is imaginary.

So, f(0) = [ (sum real parts -25 ) * (-i)/(2k) ) ] + [ sum imaginary parts/(2k) ) ]

Because 1/(2ik )= -i/(2k )

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is sum imaginary parts/(2k )

Thus, Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) ] / (2k )

Now, compute sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ):

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134° )=3*0.6947≈2.0841.

l=2:5 * sin(110° )=5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60° )=7*0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26° )=9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum=0 +2.0841=2.0841 +4.6985=6.7826 +6.062=12.8446 +3.9456≈16.7902.

So sum=16.7902.

Then, Im(f(0))=16.7902/(2k )

Using the non-relativistic k=1.145e13 m^-1:

Im(f(0))=16.7902/(2 *1.145e13 )=16.7902/(2.29e13 )=approx7.33e-13 m=733 fm.

Still not matching the options.

But I think I'm going in circles here. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the non-relativistic k and the sum S as before, leading to Im(f(0))=795.8 fm, which isn't among the options. But the closest option is B) 355.351 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the relativistic k, which gave me Im(f(0))≈35.9 fm, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the sum S. Let me double-check each term.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum S correctly.

Another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is given by (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) / (k )

Which would give:

sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )=1 +2.7615 +4.096 +3.5 +2.02455=13.382.

Then Im(f(0))=13.382/(k )

k=1.145e13 m^-1.

So Im(f(0))=13.382/(1.145e13 )=1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) / (2k )

Which would give 13.382/(2*1.145e13 )=13.382/(2.29e13 )=5.83e-13 m=583 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) / (k )

Which would be 13.382/(1.145e13 )=1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) * (1/(k )).

Which gives the same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l ), which is 13.382, but then I'm not sure about the formula.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the intended approach is to use the formula Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) / (k )

Which would give 13.382 / 1.145e13 m^-1 =1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

But again, it's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but given that, perhaps the intended approach is different.

Wait, another approach: considering that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross-section.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the imaginary part as sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) multiplied by a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) * (1/k )

Which would give 13.382/k =13.382/(1.145e13 )=1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

Hmm.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct calculation is 795.8 fm, which isn't an option, but the closest option is B)355.351 fm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k in a different way.

E=50 MeV.

Using relativistic formula:

k = p / ħ.

p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈49.997 MeV.

So, p=49.997 MeV /c.

1 MeV/c is 5.344e-28 kg·m/s.

So, p=49.997 *5.344e-28 kg·m/s ≈2.67e-26 kg·m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ =2.67e-26 /1.05457e-34 ≈2.53e8 m^-1.

Wait, that's different. So k=2.53e8 m^-1.

Then, Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2*2.53e8 )=18.2049/(5.06e8 )=3.59e-8 m=3.59e-5 fm=0.0000359 fm.

No, that can't be right. Something's wrong with the units here.

I'm getting more confused. I think I'll have to proceed with the initial calculation.

Based on the non-relativistic approach, Im(f(0))=795.8 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct option is B)355.351 fm. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute f(0) correctly.

Another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) / (k )

Which would be 13.382/(1.145e13 )=1168 fm.

But that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) is:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 sin(55)=5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 sin(13)=9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum:1+2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.02455=13.382.

Yes, that's correct. So sum is 13.382.

So if Im(f(0))= sum/(k )=13.382/(1.145e13 )=1.168e-12 m=1168 fm.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But the options don't have this, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but the question says degrees. Let me check.

If I convert the phase shifts to radians:

δ0=90°=pi/2=1.5708 rad.

δ1=67°=1.16937 rad.

δ2=55°=0.95993 rad.

δ3=30°=0.523598 rad.

δ4=13°=0.226893 rad.

But I used degrees in calculations earlier. Perhaps we should compute using radians.

But the calculation of sin(delta) would be the same whether in degrees or radians, as long as the functions are computed correctly.

Wait, no, because in programming, math functions use radians, but in this case, I've used degrees correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the sum with the phase shifts in radians.

Wait, let me compute the sum (2l+1) sin(2 delta_l ) using radians.

l=0:1 * sin(pi )=0.

l=1:3 * sin(2*1.16937 )=3 * sin(2.33874 rad )=3 *0.7317=2.195.

l=2:5 * sin(2*0.95993 )=5 sin(1.91986 )=5 *0.9440=4.720.

l=3:7 * sin(2*0.523598 )=7 * sin(1.047196 )=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(2*0.226893 )=9 sin(0.453786 )=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum=0+2.195=2.195+4.720=6.915+6.062=12.977+3.9456=16.9226.

So sum=16.9226.

Then, Im(f(0))=16.9226/(2k )=16.9226/(2*1.145e13 )=16.9226/(2.29e13 )=7.38e-13 m=738 fm.

Still not matching any options.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with the initial calculation of 795.8 fm, which isn't an option, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the real part. But the question asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum differently.

Wait, perhaps I should sum the real parts and the imaginary parts correctly.

Wait, earlier sum of (2l+1)(e^{2i delta} -1 ) is S= (-18.2049) +i (16.864 ).

So f(0)= S/(2ik )= [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ]/(2ik )

Which can be written as [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * (1/(2ik )).

Expressed as [ (-18.2049) +i 16.864 ] * ( -i/(2k) )

Which becomes:

(-18.2049)(-i) + (i 16.864)(-i) ) / (2k )

= (18.2049 i ) + (16.864 ) ) / (2k )

So f(0)= (16.864 +18.2049 i )/(2k )

Imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k )=9.10245/k.

k=1.145e13 m^-1.

So 9.10245 /1.145e13=7.958e-13 m=795.8 fm.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B)355.351 fm.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is given by k= sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but E should be in joules.

E=50 MeV=50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

m=9.10938e-31 kg.

So, sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(2 *9.10938e-31 *8.01e-13 )=sqrt(1.4597e-42 )=1.208e-21 m.

So k=1.208e-21 /1.05457e-34=1.145e13 m^-1.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct value is approximately 795 fm, which isn't among the options. Perhaps the intended answer is option B)355.351 fm, which is closest to half of 795, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum S.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate each term.

Let me re-calculate each term:

For l=0: (1)(e^{i180} -1 )=1*(-2)= -2.

l=1: 3*(e^{i134} -1 )

e^{i134}=cos(134)= -0.6947, sin=0.7193. So e^{i134} -1= (-1.6947) +i0.7193. Multiply by3: -5.0841 +i2.1579.

l=2:5*(e^{i110}-1 )

e^{i110}=cos(110)= -0.3420, sin=0.9397. So e^{i110}-1= (-1.3420) +i0.9397. Multiply by5: -6.71 +i4.6985.

l=3:7*(e^{i60} -1 )

e^{i60}=0.5 +i0.8660. e^{i60} -1= (-0.5) +i0.8660. Multiply by7: -3.5 +i6.062.

l=4:9*(e^{i26} -1 )

e^{i26}=0.8988 +i0.4384. e^{i26} -1= (-0.1012) +i0.4384. Multiply by9: -0.9108 +i3.9456.

Sum real parts: -2 -5.0841= -7.0841 -6.71= -13.7941 -3.5= -17.2941 -0.9108= -18.2049.

Imaginary parts:0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So sum S is correct.

Thus, the imaginary part is 18.2049/(2k ), which is 795.8 fm.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option B)355.351 fm.

Wait, perhaps the initial question uses the real part instead of the imaginary part. But the question clearly asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic k. If I do that, as earlier, k=2.53e14 m^-1.

Im(f(0))=18.2049/(2*2.53e14 )=18.2049/(5.06e14 )=3.59e-14 m=35.9 fm.

But that's not an option either.

I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm. But I can't see where that comes from.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )) * 1000 fm.

Sum is 13.382 *1000=13382 fm, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) multiplied by 1e-15 m.

13.382 *1e-15 m=13.382 fm, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l ), multiply by 2, and then find the value.

13.382 *2=26.764, but that's not an option.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is option B)355.351 fm, which is roughly 355 fm.

But I'm not sure how to get to that value. Maybe I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(delta_l ) in radians.

Using radians:

sum (2l+1) sin(delta_l )

delta0=90°=pi/2=1.5708 rad: sin=1.

delta1=67°=1.16937 rad: sin=0.9205.

delta2=55°=0.95993 rad: sin=0.8192.

delta3=30°=0.523598 rad: sin=0.5.

delta4=13°=0.226893 rad: sin=0.22495.

So,

l=0:1 *1=1.

l=1:3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 *0.22495=2.02455.

Sum=1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.02455=13.382.

Same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option B)355.351 fm, but I can't see how to arrive at that value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( f(0) \), for elastic electron scattering at 50 MeV, given phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The scattering amplitude is expressed using the partial wave expansion:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \left( e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \right),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, given by \( k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar \). The imaginary part of \( f(0) \), \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \), is derived from the imaginary contributions of the terms in the sum.

### Key Steps:
1. **Partial Wave Expansion**: Each term in the sum is computed as \( (2l+1)(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1) \). The imaginary part of this term is \( (2l+1)\sin(2\delta_l) \). The total imaginary contribution is the sum of these terms divided by \( 2k \).

2. **Sum of Imaginary Contributions**:
   - \( l=0 \): \( 1 \cdot \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( 3 \cdot \sin(134^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot 0.6947 = 2.0841 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( 5 \cdot \sin(110^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot 0.9397 = 4.6985 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( 7 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot 0.8660 = 6.062 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( 9 \cdot \sin(26^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot 0.4384 = 3.9456 \).

   Summing these contributions gives:
   \[
   \text{Total Imaginary Contribution} = 0 + 2.0841 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 = 16.7902.
   \]

3. **Wave Number Calculation**: Using the non-relativistic formula \( k = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \), \( m \) is the electron mass, and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant:
   - \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} = 8.01 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J} \),
   - \( k = \sqrt{2 \cdot 9.10938 \times 10^{-31} \cdot 8.01 \times 10^{-13}} / 1.05457 \times 10^{-34} \approx 1.145 \times 10^{13} \, \text{m}^{-1} \).

4. **Imaginary Part of \( f(0) \)**:
   \[
   \text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{\text{Total Imaginary Contribution}}{2k} = \frac{16.7902}{2 \cdot 1.145 \times 10^{13}} \approx 7.33 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{m} = 733 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (87163.4 fm)**: This is far too large compared to the computed value.
- **Option B (355.351 fm)**: This is significantly smaller than the computed value of \( 733 \, \text{fm} \), but it is the closest to the expected order of magnitude.
- **Option C (177.675 fm)** and **Option D (251.271 fm)**: These are also much smaller than the computed value.

### Conclusion:
The computed value of \( \text{Im}[f(0)] \) is approximately \( 733 \, \text{fm} \), but since this is not among the options, the closest match is **Option B (355.351 fm)**. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.
