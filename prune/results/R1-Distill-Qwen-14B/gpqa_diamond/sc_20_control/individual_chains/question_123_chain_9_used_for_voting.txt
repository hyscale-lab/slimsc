Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center. But in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta. Since both are inertial frames, we need to consider relative motion and maybe use special relativity here.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think. The problem states that both are inertial frames. So, it's a matter of relative velocity and time dilation perhaps? Because when you switch frames, time might not be the same.

So, the key here is to find the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame over some time. But the given time is in the ejecta's frame. So, I probably need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame that corresponds to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, then multiply by the velocity to get the distance.

Wait, but first, what's the velocity between the two frames? The problem says in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. That means in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the relative velocity between the frames is 60,000 km/s. So v = 60,000 km/s.

But wait, wait. Let me get the frames clear. In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at v = 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta (opposite direction) at the same speed. But when considering relative velocities, in relativity, you have to be careful because velocities don't just add linearly when switching frames. Wait, but wait, the problem says both are inertial frames, so perhaps it's a straightforward Lorentz transformation.

Wait, but the problem says that both are inertial, so the frames are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. So the velocity between them is v = 6e4 km/s. That's a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is about 0.2 times c. Hmm, so relativistic effects might be significant, but perhaps not extreme.

The problem gives a time in the ejecta's frame, dt' =50 seconds. We need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v =6e4 km/s. The time it takes for the ejecta to travel that distance is t. But how does the time measured in the ejecta's frame relate to the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, the proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (departure and arrival) happen at the same place. But in this case, the events are the front of the ejecta leaving and arriving at some point. But perhaps it's easier to use the Lorentz transformation.

The time dilation formula says that dt = gamma * dt', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, but wait, in which direction? Because the motion is along the x-axis, and the time measured in the moving frame (ejecta) is dt', and the stationary frame (Galaxy) measures dt.

Wait, no, the time in the moving frame (ejecta) is dt', and the time in the stationary frame (Galaxy) would be longer, because moving clocks run slower. So if an event occurs over 50 seconds in the moving frame, in the stationary frame it would take longer. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of events.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance in the Galaxy's frame can be found using the velocity and the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, so the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But we have the time in the ejecta's frame, t' =50 seconds. So we need to relate t and t' using time dilation and length contraction.

Wait, let's think. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at speed v. The time between two events (say, the ejecta starting to move and then stopping) is t' =50 seconds. But in the Galaxy's frame, the same events are happening. So the time between the events is longer due to time dilation.

So t = gamma * t' ?

Yes, because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the ejecta's proper time (dt') is shorter than the Galaxy's time (dt). So t = gamma * t'.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Let me compute v first. v is 6e4 km/s. Let's express that in terms of c. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So v = 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2 c.

So v = 0.2 c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.98 ≈ 1.0204.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

sqrt(0.96) is the square root of 96/100 = 24/10 * sqrt(1/4) = 24/10 * 0.5? Wait no, wait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

Because 0.9798^2 = approx 0.96.

So 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma ≈ 1.0206.

So t = gamma * t' ≈ 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t.

v is 6e4 km/s.

So distance = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 6e4 *51.03.

Wait, 6e4 is 60,000. 60,000 *51.03 = let's compute:

60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 * 1.03 = 60,000 *1 +60,000 *0.03 = 60,000 + 1,800=61,800.

So total is 3,000,000 +61,800=3,061,800 km.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let's look at the options:

Option D is 3,060,000 km. Hmm, my calculation is 3,061,800, but that's close. Did I make a mistake in the approximation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me do that.

Wait, v = 60,000 km/s.

t = gamma * t' = (1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2 )) * t' .

v is 6e4 km/s, c is 3e5 km/s.

(v/c)^2 = (6e4 /3e5)^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.

So sqrt(1 -0.04) = sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.979795897.

So gamma = 1/0.979795897 ≈ 1.02062.

t = 50 * 1.02062 ≈ 51.031 seconds.

Then, distance =6e4 * 51.031 = ?

6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 *51.031 = ?

Compute 60,000 *50 =3,000,000.

60,000 *1.031 = 60,000 *1 =60,000; 60,000 *0.031=1,860.

So 60,000 +1,860=61,860.

Total distance is 3,000,000 +61,860=3,061,860 km.

Hmm, the options don't have that. The closest is option D:3,060,000 km. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact value of gamma. Let me compute it more precisely.

Compute sqrt(0.96). Let me be precise.

0.96 is 96/100, so sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10.

sqrt(96) = sqrt(16*6) )=4*sqrt(6) ≈4*2.449489743 =9.79795897.

So sqrt(0.96)=0.979795897.

Thus, gamma=1/0.979795897=1.020620723.

t=50 * 1.020620723≈51.03103615 seconds.

So, 60,000 km/s *51.03103615 s = 60,000 *51.03103615.

Let me compute 60,000 *51.03103615.

51.03103615=51+0.03103615.

So 60,000 *51=3,060,000.

60,000 *0.03103615= approx 60,000 *0.031 = 1,860.

Wait, 0.03103615 is approximately 0.031036.

So 60,000 * 0.031036 = 60,000 *0.03 =1,800.

60,000 *0.001036= 62.16.

So 1,800+62.16=1,862.16.

So total distance is 3,060,000 +1,862.16≈3,061,862.16 km.

So ~3,061,862 km.

Looking at the options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

So the closest is D) 3,060,000 km, but our answer is ~3,061,862 km. Hmm, that's 1,862 km over 3 million. So about 0.062% difference.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the problem doesn't require considering time dilation because the velocity is stated as 60,000 km/s, but perhaps the problem expects a classical approach, ignoring relativity. Because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is non-negligible for relativity, but maybe the problem is intended to use a simpler approach.

Wait, the problem states that both are inertial frames. So relativistic effects apply.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of length contraction. Let me think again.

In the Galaxy's frame, the distance is L, and the ejecta is moving at velocity v, so the time taken is t = L/(v). But from the ejecta's frame, the distance is contracted.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to not require relativity, but just consider the relative velocity.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether to apply length contraction or time dilation.

Wait, the problem gives the time in the ejecta's frame. So t' is 50 seconds. We need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, which is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But how is t related to t'? Because in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the time between events (departure and arrival) is longer than in the ejecta's frame (if the events are at the same place in the ejecta's frame). Wait, but if the events are the start and end of the travel, which are at the same point in the ejecta's frame, then in the Galaxy's frame, these events are at different places. So time dilation applies.

So, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the moving object (ejecta), so t' is the proper time. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t'.

So, using that, then t = gamma * t'.

Thus, the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t= v * gamma * t'.

So, let me compute that.

v =6e4 km/s.

t' =50 s.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 -v²/c²) =1/sqrt(1 - (6e4/3e5)^2 )=1/sqrt(1 -0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96)=1.020620723.

So distance= 6e4 *1.020620723 *50.

Wait, 6e4 *1.020620723 =60,000 *1.020620723=61,237.2434.

Then multiply by 50: 61,237.2434 *50 =3,061,862.17 km.

Which as before, is about 3,061,862 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the frame of reference. Because from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but in reality, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. So the frames are moving at 60,000 km/s relative to each other.

Wait, but in that case, when the ejecta measures the time, how does that translate to the Galaxy's frame?

Another approach: Let me consider the two events as the emission and reception of light, but perhaps that's complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the simple velocity multiplied by time, but without considering relativistic effects.

If we ignore relativity, then time t in Galaxy's frame is same as t' in ejecta's frame. So t=50 s.

Then, distance =6e4 *50= 3,000,000 km. Which is option B.

But that would be incorrect because the problem states that both are inertial frames, so relativity applies, and the time would be longer. So then the distance should be longer than 3e6 km, which would make option D correct.

But the options don't have 3,061,862, but D is 3,060,000. So perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation, or perhaps the intended approach is to not use relativity and just multiply v and t'.

Wait, but the question says to assume both are inertial frames, which suggests that relativity is involved.

But why is the option D 3,060,000, which is exactly 6e4 *51 s.

Wait, because 6e4 km/s *51 seconds =3,060,000 km.

Hmm, but according to our calculation, it's 50 *gamma=50 *1.02062≈51.031 s.

So, 6e4 *51.031=3,061,862 km.

But the option D is 3,060,000, which is 6e4 *51.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses an approximate gamma.

Wait, let me compute 1.0206 approximately.

If gamma is approximated as 1.02, then t=50 *1.02=51 s.

Then, 6e4 *51=3,060,000 km.

So that's option D.

So perhaps the problem expects us to use an approximate gamma of 1.02, leading to 51 seconds, and hence 3,060,000 km.

Given that, the correct answer is D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a velocity \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c \) is the speed of light). The time measured in the ejecta's frame is \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \). Since both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, relativistic effects must be considered.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Time in the Two Frames**:  
   The time dilation formula in special relativity states:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   t = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Calculating the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t \approx 51.03 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,862 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Comparing with the Options**:  
   The calculated distance is approximately \( 3,061,862 \, \text{km} \), but the closest option provided is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). This slight discrepancy likely arises from rounding \( \gamma \) to \( 1.02 \) (instead of the more precise \( 1.0206 \)) in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer, based on the given options and the approximations used, is **D) 3,060,000 km**.
