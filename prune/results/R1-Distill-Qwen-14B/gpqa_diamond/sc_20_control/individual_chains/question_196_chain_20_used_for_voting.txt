Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A to D, and the speed of light is c.

Wait, wait. So in a harmonic oscillator, whether classical or quantum, the maximum speed occurs when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium position, right? Because that's where all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

But wait, this is relativistic. Oh right, because in classical mechanics, the speed could approach infinity, but relativity imposes a speed limit, c. So for a relativistic oscillator, the speed can't reach c, but how does that affect the maximum velocity?

In the classical case, the maximum speed v_max is given by sqrt(kA²/m). But that's non-relativistic. When you include relativity, the energy equations change because kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy in the relativistic harmonic oscillator would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Wait no, wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)mv²_max, but in reality, when it's at maximum displacement A, all energy is potential. So in the classical harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So the maximum speed comes when all potential is converted to kinetic.

So in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but when x = A, the potential is (1/2)kA². Then, at the equilibrium point, that's all converted into kinetic energy, which in relativity is (gamma - 1)mc².

So setting (1/2)kA² equal to (gamma - 1)mc². Let's write that equation down.

(1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1)mc².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So substituting:

(1/2)kA² = ( (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) mc².

Hmm, solving for v_max. Let me rearrange this equation. Let me denote gamma as γ for simplicity.

(1/2) k A² = (γ - 1) m c².

Let me solve for γ:

γ - 1 = (k A²) / (2 m c² )

Wait, wait a second, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the units. The left side is energy, the right side is (k A²)/(2 m c²) times m c², so units would be correct. Because (kA²) has units of energy, and the right side is (gamma-1) times mc², which is energy.

Wait so, let me write:

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c² )

But wait, gamma must be greater than 1 because kinetic energy is positive. So yes, that makes sense.

Now, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but I need to solve for v. Let's square both sides to get rid of the square root.

gamma squared would be [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)] squared. But wait, wait, no. Wait, gamma = 1 + x, so gamma squared is (1 + x)^2, but maybe we can find 1 - v²/c² in terms of x.

Wait, let's think differently. Let me denote x = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then, gamma = 1 + x.

So gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) ) = 1 + x.

So, 1/(sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)) = 1 + x.

Taking reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1/(1 + x).

Squaring both sides:

1 - (v²/c²) = 1/(1 + x)^2.

So, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + x)^2 ].

Hmm, let me compute that:

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + x)^2.

Wait, 1 - [1/(1 + x)^2] can be written as [ (1 + x)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + x)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2x + x² - 1) = 2x + x².

So, v^2/c^2 = (2x + x²) / (1 + x)^2.

But x is (k A²)/(2 m c²), which is probably a small term if the system isn't ultra-relativistic. But since we don't know, we have to keep it symbolic.

Wait, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator. Let me write:

Numerator: x (2 + x )

Denominator: (1 + x)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [x (2 + x)] / (1 + x)^2.

Take square root:

v/c = sqrt( [x (2 + x)] ) / (1 + x).

Hmm, but maybe I can express this in terms of x. Let me see:

Wait, x is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute that back in.

x = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [x (2 + x)] / (1 + x)^2.

Taking square root:

v = c * sqrt( [x (2 + x)] ) / (1 + x).

Hmm, but perhaps we can simplify this expression.

Wait, let me compute the numerator inside the square root:

x (2 + x) = x * 2 + x^2.

So,

sqrt( x (2 + x) ) = sqrt( 2x + x² ).

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x + x²) ) / (1 + x).

Hmm, perhaps factor x from the numerator inside the square root:

sqrt( x (2 + x) ) = sqrt(x) * sqrt(2 + x).

But I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe we can write this as:

[2x + x² ] = x^2 + 2x = x(x + 2) = (x + 1)^2 -1.

Wait, because (x+1)^2 = x² + 2x +1. So x² +2x = (x+1)^2 -1.

So,

sqrt(2x + x²) = sqrt( (x+1)^2 - 1 ) = sqrt( (1 + x)^2 - 1 ).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate, but the problem doesn't suggest that. So perhaps we should proceed to write v_max in terms of x.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps we can manipulate the expression to match one of the options.

Let me re-express v:

v_max = c * sqrt( x (2 + x) ) / (1 + x )

Let me compute the expression inside the square root:

sqrt( x(2 + x) ) squared is x(2 + x). So, the numerator is x(2 +x ), denominator is (1 +x ) squared.

Wait, another approach. Let me express x in terms of the denominator.

From earlier:

gamma = 1 + x.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, but maybe another approach. Let me think about v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, when x is much less than 1, since x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), if kA²/(2 m c²) is small, then x <<1.

In that case, gamma ≈1 + x, and sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈1 - x/2.

Because 1/(1 + x) ≈ 1 - x for x<<1.

So,

v^2/c^2 ≈ 1 - (1 - x )^2 = 1 - (1 - 2x + x²) ≈ 2x.

So, v ≈ sqrt( 2x ) c = sqrt( (k A²)/(m) ) c ?

Wait, no, because x = (k A²)/(2 m c² ), so 2x = (k A²)/(m c² ), so sqrt(2x )= sqrt(k A²/(m c^2 )) )= (A sqrt( k/(m c^2 ) ) ).

Wait, but the non-relativistic v_max is sqrt( k A² / m ), which is sqrt(k/m ) A. So in relativity, when x is small, v_max is approximately sqrt( k A² / m ) * (1/sqrt(1 + ... ))? Hmm, perhaps not, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one aligns with the expression I have for v_max.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, that doesn't seem to match.

Option B: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c² )) )

Hmm, not matching.

Option C: sqrt( kA²/m ), which is the non-relativistic case.

Option D: c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let's see. Let me compute 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ], where y is (kA²)/(2 m c^2 ).

Wait, from earlier, v^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ]

So,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + y )^2 ] )

But that's exactly what option D is, except y is (kA²)/(2 m c² ).

Wait, let me check option D.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Wait, because y = (kA²)/(2 m c² ), so 1 + y is in the denominator of the square term.

So, from our derivation, v_max is c times sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] ), where y is (kA²)/(2 m c² ). Which matches option D.

So, the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to look at it is:

We found that 1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + y )^2, where y = (kA²)/(2 m c² ).

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - [ 1/(1 + y )^2 ]

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] )

Which is exactly what option D says.

So the correct answer is option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we start by considering the energy conservation principle. The total energy of the system is the sum of the potential energy at maximum displacement and the rest mass energy. At the equilibrium position, all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

The potential energy at maximum displacement is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the relativistic kinetic energy is \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Setting these equal gives:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}},
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in option D. The other options either do not align with the relativistic energy conservation principle or reduce to incorrect forms when compared to the derived result.
