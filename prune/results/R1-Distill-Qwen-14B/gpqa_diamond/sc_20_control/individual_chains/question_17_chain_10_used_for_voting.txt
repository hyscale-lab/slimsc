Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is a 1:1 complex because it's stochiometric. So the formula would be something like CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA part.

The formation constant, Kf, also known as K_Ca-EDTA here, is given as 5e10. Wait, formation constant tells us how much the metal and EDTA bind, right? So Kf is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (if I remember correctly). Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: the reaction would be Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaY^2-. The Kf is [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

In this problem, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 M. Because EDTA is in excess, but wait, in this case, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, which I think implies that the amounts of Ca^2+ and EDTA are just enough to form the complex without any excess. So maybe EDTA is all tied up with Ca, or perhaps they're in stoichiometric proportions. Hmm, but wait, when you have a solution with the complex, the concentrations of free Ca^2+ and free EDTA^4- would be very low, because Kf is large, meaning the complex is stable.

Wait, wait, if Kf is 5e10, that's a big number, which means the complex is very stable. So the majority of the EDTA and calcium would be in the complex form, and only a tiny bit remains as free ions.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But, how does that relate to the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-?

Wait, another approach. Let me write the equilibrium expression. The complex dissociates as:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

The formation constant Kf is equal to [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) =5e10.

But wait, the dissociation equilibrium would have K = 1/Kf, right? Because K for the dissociation is Kd = [Ca^2+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-] = 1/(Kf).

So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the concentration of the complex, [CaY^2-], is 0.02 M.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates. So at equilibrium, [CaY^2-] is 0.02 - x, but because Kd is very small (2e-11), x would be very small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02.

So the expression becomes:

Kd ≈ (x * x) / 0.02 = x² /0.02 = 2e-11.

Solving for x: x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13. So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, but wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2? Let me compute the square root.

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root is 2 x 10^(-13/2) = 2 x 10^-6.5. Which is approximately 2e-6.5 ≈ 2 * 3.16e-7 = around 6.3e-7.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

That means [Ca^2+] is about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. The calculation gives [Ca^2+] as approximately 6.3e-7 M. So that makes sense. Because with a large Kf, the complex doesn't dissociate much, so [Ca^2+] is very low.

So the correct answer should be C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]\) is approximately 0.02 M (since \( K_d \) is very small, the dissociation is minimal). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) at equilibrium. The equilibrium expression becomes:

\[
K_d = \frac{[ \text{Ca}^{2+} ][ \text{Y}^{4-} ]}{[ \text{CaY}^{2-} ]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \times 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
