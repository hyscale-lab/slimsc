Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that a chemist performs two reactions using (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The question is about what the chemist would observe in each chromatogram.

Wait, first I need to think about what mCPBA does in each case. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are typically used for epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, does the configuration of the starting alkene affect the epoxide formation?

Oh right! The reaction of mCPBA with alkenes forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic mechanism. For trans alkenes (like (E)-oct-4-ene), the epoxide forms with the oxygen atoms on opposite sides because the starting alkene is trans. Wait, no, maybe I have that backwards. Wait, mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond, and the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, so (E) and (Z) alkenes would form different epoxides. Let me get this straight. The (E) isomer would form an trans epoxide, and the (Z) would form a cis epoxide? Or is it the other way around? Or maybe not. Let me think about the mechanism. The peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face, leading to a cis addition. Wait, no, the epoxidation reaction is a concerted process, so the geometry of the alkene determines the epoxide's structure.

Wait, let me visualize. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5, and the substituents (methyl groups, perhaps?) are opposite each other. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen bridges would form opposite each other. So the epoxide would have the substituents on opposite sides, making it a trans epoxide.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are on the same side. So the epoxide would form with the oxygen atoms on the same side, making a cis epoxide.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the configuration. The (E) and (Z) alkenes have different geometries. So when epoxidized, the resulting epoxides will have different configurations. So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide. Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide.

Then, both are treated with aqueous acid. Oh, wait! Epoxides under acidic conditions undergo ring-opening. So what happens when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid?

For acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides, the mechanism typically involves protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the ring opens with a nucleophilic attack. The nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized (like in the case of carbocation formation).

Wait, but in the case of oct-4-ene-derived epoxide, the structure would be an epoxide on four and five carbons. So, the epoxide would be between C4 and C5. When opened under acidic conditions, the water would attack the more substituted carbon, which is C4 (if the substituents on either side are similar, perhaps both are CH2 groups, but in octene, each end is CH2CH2, so maybe it's symmetrical? Hmm, wait no. Let me think: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but no, wait oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait more accurately, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3 but with the double bond between C4 and C5. So the epoxide is between C4 and C5.

But when the epoxide is opened, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon. In this case, each carbon of the epoxide is attached to two CH2 groups and two more carbons. Wait, perhaps the structure is symmetric, so the attack could happen equally on either carbon. But depending on the stereochemistry of the epoxide, the opening might lead to different diastereomers.

Wait no, when the epoxide is symmetric, the ring opening under acid conditions would lead to a racemic mixture of the diol because the nucleophile can attack from either side. But wait, no, wait. If the epoxide is symmetric, then regardless of which side the attack happens, the product would be the same. Or would it? Wait, no, because the epoxide's stereochemistry affects the approach of the nucleophile.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to break it down for each case.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide. Since the starting alkene is E, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So the epoxide formed would have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides (trans epoxide).

Then, under acidic conditions, this trans-epoxide would open. The acid protonates an oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The ring opens, and the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric (like between two CH2 groups), then each carbon in the epoxide is equally substituted. So the attack can occur on either carbon. But the stereochemistry of the epoxide would influence the outcome. Let's think about the trans epoxide first.

In the trans epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. So when the epoxide ring opens, the nucleophile (water) can attack from either the front or the back. But because the epoxide is symmetric, the product will be a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, but wait, no. Wait, because the epoxide is symmetric, both attack directions would lead to the same product. Wait, maybe it's not. Let me imagine the structure.

Wait, the trans epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms opposite each other. When the epoxide opens, the attack could happen from either face. But since the molecule is symmetric, the product would have two possible configurations, but in reality, would they be the same or different?

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide opening leads to a diol with a specific stereochemistry. Let me think: for the trans epoxide, the attack would result in the diol with the OH groups on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the mechanism. In a trans epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. So when the epoxide opens, the nucleophile can attack either carbon. Let's model it: imagine the epoxide as O and O across the ring, in a trans configuration. So when the epoxide opens, the water attacks one carbon, and the leaving group (the other O) departs. The attack can happen from either face.

Wait, but for a symmetrical epoxide (like from (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be symmetrical), the attack from either face would lead to the same product, but in reality, perhaps it leads to a diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the ring opening under acidic conditions leads to a single product, as both attack positions are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for a simpler approach.

Epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene gives a trans epoxide, which under acidic conditions would form a diol. The same with (Z)-oct-4-ene giving a cis epoxide, which upon acid treatment would give another diol.

Wait, but how many diastereomers or enantiomers would each reaction produce?

Wait, for each epoxide, when treated with aqueous acid, it would form a diol. Now, the diastereomerism depends on the starting epoxide's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the (E)-epoxide leads to a diol with a certain configuration, and the (Z)-epoxide leads to a different diol configuration.

Alternatively, maybe each epoxide leads to two diastereomers when opened.

Wait, but perhaps each reaction produces a diol with two stereocenters. Let me imagine the structure: after epoxidation and opening, the diol would have two adjacent OH groups on C4 and C5.

So for each epoxide (cis and trans), the opening would create a diol with either both OHs on the same side (syn addition) or opposite sides (anti addition). Hmm, but under acidic conditions, the ring opening is typically via a protonated epoxide, leading to a planar transition state, so the attack could be from either side, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, I'm confusing with SN1 vs SN2 mechanisms.

Wait, the epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions is more of an SN2 mechanism for less substituted epoxides, but for more substituted, maybe SN1-like. Hmm, for symmetric epoxides, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture.

Wait, maybe I should think of the specific products.

So for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → acid → diol.

The trans-epoxide would open to form a diol. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the attack can happen equally on either carbon, but the attack from either side would lead to either R or S configuration at each OH.

Wait, but in the case of a symmetric epoxide, like the trans one, the diol would have two stereocenters. Wait, no, because if the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would also be symmetric, so the stereocenters would be either both R, both S, or one R and one S, but perhaps they are the same.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think with a concrete example. Take (E)-2-pentene as an example. Epoxidation would give a trans-epoxide, and upon acid treatment, the diol formed would have two OH groups on adjacent carbons, each with their own configuration.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide leads to a pair of enantiomers, but when you have a symmetric epoxide, the diol could be a meso compound.

Ah, wait. If the diol ends up having two stereocenters but is a meso compound, then it would be a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

So for the trans-epoxide, perhaps the diol is a meso compound, meaning it's achiral because of an internal plane of symmetry. That would make sense because the epoxide is symmetric. So Reaction 1's product would be a single diol, a meso compound.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → acid → diol.

In this case, would the diol have two stereocenters that are either the same or different?

Wait, the cis-epoxide is not symmetric because the substituents on the epoxide are arranged on the same side. No, wait, in oct-4-ene, the substituents are CH2CH2 groups on either end of the double bond. So the cis-epoxide would have both oxygen atoms on the same side.

When this cis-epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, the nucleophile (water) can attack either of the two carbons (but since it's symmetric, perhaps the product is a meso compound as well? Or perhaps not.)

Wait, no. Let me think again. The cis-epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on the same side. So when the ring opens, the attack could happen from either side, but because the molecule is symmetric, would the product be a meso compound?

Hmm, maybe not. Because in the case of the cis epoxide, the diol might not be a meso compound. Wait, let's think about it: if the epoxide is cis, the diol could have the two OH groups on adjacent carbons, but their configurations would depend on the attack direction.

Wait, perhaps for the cis-epoxide, the diol formed would have both OH groups on the same side, leading to a meso compound. Or perhaps it would form a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about specific examples. For example, epoxidation of (E)-but-2-ene with mCPBA gives trans-epoxide, which upon acid hydrolysis gives a diol. If the diol is a meso compound, then it's a single compound.

Similarly, the (Z)-but-2-ene would give a cis-epoxide, which upon acid treatment would give a diol. But if the diol is asymmetric, it could be a pair of enantiomers or a meso compound.

Wait, but in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans and symmetric. So when it opens, the diol would have two stereocenters but be a meso compound, meaning it's a single compound, not a pair.

But wait, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is cis but symmetric as well. So when it opens, would the diol also be a meso compound?

Wait, maybe no. Because in the cis-epoxide, the attack could happen from the same face, leading to both OHs on the same side, which would make the diol a meso compound. Or perhaps, because the epoxide is symmetric, the attack from either face leads to a single product.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this from another angle.

Each of the two reactions produces an epoxide that, upon acid treatment, becomes a diol. For each starting material (E and Z), the diol formed could be a single compound (meso) or a pair of enantiomers.

So Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol (meso).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → diol (meso or not?).

Wait, if the diol from the cis-epoxide is not a meso compound, then it would have two stereocenters but be chiral, leading to two enantiomers.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would also be a meso compound, regardless of whether the epoxide was cis or trans.

Wait, no. The symmetry of the epoxide would transfer to the diol. So for both (E) and (Z) cases, the diol would be a meso compound, each being a single compound because of internal symmetry.

Wait, that can't be right because (E) and (Z) would lead to diols with different structures.

Wait, but let me think about the actual structures.

(E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol: the two OH groups would be on opposite sides, but because the molecule is symmetric, it would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

(Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → diol: the two OH groups would be on the same side. But wait, in this case, the molecule is symmetric, so the diol would also have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, but that would mean that both reactions produce the same diol as a meso compound, which can't be correct because the products are different.

Wait, maybe not. Let me imagine the structures.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol would have the OH groups on opposite sides of the C4-C5 bond. Because the molecule is symmetric, this would create a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So Reaction 1 gives a single meso diol.

For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the diol would have the OH groups on the same side. But again, the molecule is symmetric, so the diol would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound as well. So Reaction 2 also gives a single meso diol.

Wait, but that would mean that both reactions produce the same product, which doesn't make sense because they started with different alkenes.

Wait, no. Wait, because the starting alkenes are E and Z, their epoxide products are different. So when they open, the diols would also be different.

Wait, perhaps for Reaction 1, the diol is a meso compound with OHs on opposite sides, and for Reaction 2, the diol is a meso compound with OHs on the same side, but since the molecule is symmetric, both are meso.

Wait, but that would imply that both diols are meso and thus achiral. But that can't be right because the starting materials are different.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the products. Let me imagine the actual structures.

Let's say the starting material is (E)-oct-4-ene. The structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3 but with the double bond between C4 and C5, and the substituents on either side (CH2CH2) opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, it forms the trans epoxide. When this epoxide is opened, the diol would have the OHs on opposite sides. Because the molecule is symmetric, this would result in a meso compound.

Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a cis epoxide. When opened under acid, the diol would have OHs on the same side. Again, because the molecule is symmetric, this would be a meso compound as well.

Wait, but that would mean that both reactions produce the same meso diol, but that's not possible because the starting materials are different. Wait, no, because the diol from (E) and (Z) would actually have their OHs in different configurations. Wait, but if both are meso, perhaps they are the same compound.

No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps each epoxide leads to a different diol, each being a meso compound but having different structures. For example, one diol has the OHs on opposite sides, the other on the same, but because of symmetry, each is a meso compound.

Wait, but if the diols are different, then when combined, there would be two different diols, each being meso and thus achiral.

So, in the combined products, there are two diastereomers, each of which is a meso compound, hence achiral.

Wait, but if they're diastereomers, they would have different physical properties.

So, when the products are run on a standard HPLC (achiral), each diastereomer would elute as a separate peak. So two peaks in total.

But if we run them on a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, but since each diastereomer is itself achiral (meso), the chiral HPLC would also see them as single compounds, so two peaks.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options given. So perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that each reaction gives a single meso diol.

Wait, maybe each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, not a meso compound. Let me reconsider.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide. When opened under acidic conditions, the attack can occur from either face, leading to two possible diastereomers. Wait, but the molecule is symmetric, so maybe it's a single meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from the trans-epoxide is a pair of enantiomers, but in reality, when the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to find another approach. Maybe looking at the diol products.

In the case where the epoxide is symmetric (like from (E)-oct-4-ene), the diol formed will have two stereocenters. If the diol is a meso compound, it's achiral. So, in the standard HPLC (achiral), it would be a single peak. On a chiral HPLC, a meso compound would also elute as a single peak because it's not chiral. So for each reaction, if the product is a meso diol, the HPLC would show one peak.

But in the question, the chemist combines the products of both reactions. So if each reaction gives one meso diol, then combining them would result in two different diols, each being a meso compound. So in the combined product mixture, there are two different diols, each achiral.

When run on a standard HPLC, which is achiral, each diol would elute as a single peak, so two peaks total. On a chiral HPLC, which can resolve enantiomers, each diol (being a meso compound, not having enantiomers) would also elute as a single peak. So again, two peaks in total.

But looking at the options, option C says 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC. That would fit this scenario.

But wait, the question is about the products. Let me consider the possibility that each epoxide leads to two different diastereomers.

Wait, no, because for each epoxide (symmetric), the diol is a single meso compound, so only one product per reaction.

So, when combining the two reactions, the products would be two diastereomers, each a meso compound. So in the mixture, two diastereomers.

On standard HPLC (achiral), diastereomers would elute as separate peaks, so two peaks. On chiral HPLC, since each is a meso compound, they are not resolved; each is one peak. So two peaks in both cases.

Which matches option C.

But wait, what if each reaction produces two diastereomers? For example, maybe the epoxide opening leads to two possible diastereomers.

Wait, no. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound, so only one product per reaction.

So the combined products would be two different meso diols.

So when run on standard HPLC, two peaks. On chiral, each is a single peak, so two peaks.

So the correct answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

But let me think again. Suppose Reaction 1 produces a meso diol, and Reaction 2 produces another meso diol. These would be two different diastereomers, each being a single compound. So in the mixture, two compounds. So in any HPLC, they would show as two peaks.

Therefore, in both HPLC columns, two peaks.

So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves the reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and the subsequent analysis of the combined products using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   - mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene determines the configuration of the epoxide.  
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the trans-alkene forms a trans-epoxide. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the cis-alkene forms a cis-epoxide.  
   - Under acidic conditions, epoxides undergo nucleophilic ring-opening with water. The stereochemistry of the epoxide dictates the stereochemistry of the resulting diol.

2. **Products of Each Reaction**:  
   - **Reaction 1**: The trans-epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene opens to form a diol. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the product is a meso compound (a single achiral compound).  
   - **Reaction 2**: The cis-epoxide formed from (Z)-oct-4-ene also opens to form a diol. Similarly, due to the symmetry of the molecule, the product is another meso compound (a single achiral compound).  

   Thus, the two reactions produce two distinct meso diols, each being achiral.

3. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers are separated on achiral columns. Since the two meso diols are diastereomers, they will elute as two distinct peaks.  
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral columns resolve enantiomers. However, since both products are meso compounds (achiral), they will not be separated into enantiomers and will each elute as a single peak.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - On the standard HPLC, two peaks are observed (one for each diastereomeric meso compound).  
   - On the chiral HPLC, two peaks are also observed (one for each achiral meso compound).  

Thus, the chemist observes 2 peaks in both the standard and chiral HPLC columns.
