Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Those are called enantiomers. So, the question is asking which of the given moieties show this kind of isomerism.

The options are four different compounds. Let me go through each one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected at position 1. The substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. So are there any chiral centers here? Let me think. The biphenyl itself can have a plane of symmetry or not. If the substituents on each benzene ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then maybe there's a possibility of stereoisomerism. Let's see, the substituents are at 2 and 2' for the dicarboxylate, and 6 and 6' for the dinitro groups. Wait, if the substituents are on opposite positions, but each ring has symmetrical substituents. Wait no, the rings are connected 1,1'. So each ring has a substituent at 2 and 6. Let me visualize. The first ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting point at 1. Wait, 2 is para to 6 on the benzene? No, wait: on a benzene ring, position 1 is connected to another ring. So positions 2 and 6 are on the same side, are they? Or opposite? Hmm, maybe the substituents are on the same side, leading to a possibility of cis and trans arrangements. Wait, but in a biphenyl structure, the two benzene rings can rotate around the single bond connecting them. Oh wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that their arrangement causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, then it can have enantiomers. Alternatively, if the molecule has a center of chirality or a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6', then the molecule might have planes of symmetry. Let me think: the positions 2 and 6 on each ring are across from each other. If each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other, then each ring is symmetric. So each ring has two substituents opposite each other, making each ring symmetrical. Then, the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, perhaps through the central C-C bond, leading to no optical isomerism because it's symmetrical. So compound 1 might not show optical isomerism. But wait, sometimes when the substituents are on adjacent positions, but in this case, they are on 2 and 6, which are opposite each other on the benzene. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The structure is OMe-O-C-O-C-(CH2CH3?) Wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but more accurately, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- methyl ester. Wait, no: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so the structure would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO- as the anion. So in the ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, in that structure, is there a chiral center? The central carbon (the one attached to the OH and the two CH2 groups) is connected to what? Let's see: the carbon chain is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (second carbon) has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH? Wait, no: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me get the structure right. "2-hydroxypropanoate" would have the hydroxy group on the second carbon of propanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is (CH2)2COOCH3, but with an OH on the second carbon. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to: CH3 (from the first carbon), OH, COOCH3, and another CH2? Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let's write the structure as:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

HO-CH2-CH2-COO-

But wait, in the structure, each position:

Carbon 1: COO-
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH2-OH

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the three carbons are CH2, CH2, COO-.

Wait, perhaps another way. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the propanoate ion is CH2CH2COO-.

So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. That would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon (the CH2 where the OH is attached) is connected to:

- One H,
- One OH,
- One CH2COOCH3,
- And another CH2 group?

Wait, no. Let me see: the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH
- CH2-
- COOCH3
- And another CH2 from the first carbon.

Wait, actually, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so the second carbon is CH2.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-CH2-COOCH3? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which would have the groups on the central carbon as: OH, CH2COOCH3, two CH2 groups? Wait, no, the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2- group (connecting to another CH2),
- COOCH3 group (from the adjacent carbon),
- and a hydrogen? No, wait, maybe.

Wait, regardless, the key point is whether there's a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon attached to four different groups.

In methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The hydroxy is on the second carbon. So the second carbon is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me structure it as:

Carbons: 1, 2, 3.

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH(OH)

Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is like:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (one on either side: one CH2 from the first carbon, another CH2 leading to the COOCH3 group),
- and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, perhaps carbon 2 is connected to:

- OH,
- CH2- (from carbon 1, which is perhaps just a methyl group?), wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

But wait, that would be three carbons: the first is CH2OH, second is CH2, third is COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the CH2) is connected to:

- CH2OH on one side,
- CH2COOCH3 on the other.

Wait, no. Let me try to number the carbons again. The propanoate part is three carbons: the COOCH3 is on carbon 3, the hydroxy on carbon 2, and carbon 1 is CH2.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this molecule, the second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (because it's connected to CH2(OH) and CH2COOCH3),
- and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if it's CH2(OH) connected to CH2, which is connected to COOCH3, then the central CH2 is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (one from each side),
- OH,
- and COOCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be. I think I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should draw this out.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate, right? Because the hydroxy is on the second carbon (middle of the three carbons). So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Ah, that makes more sense. So the three carbons are:

1: CH3,

2: CH(OH),

3: COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, wait, no. The second carbon is connected to four groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the third carbon (which is COOCH3's carbon? Or perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Wait, in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (carbon 1),

- OH,

- COOCH3 (carbon 3),

- and the next carbon (carbon 3) is part of the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, the COOCH3 is the third carbon, so the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and what else? Oh wait, it's connected to four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent CH from the CH3 group? No, perhaps I'm getting tangled up.

Wait, the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- A methyl group (CH3),

- An OH,

- A carbonyl group (C=O),

- And another CH2 group leading to the COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

1. CH3 (carbon 1),

2. OH,

3. COOCH3 (carbon 3),

4. And the next carbon is attached to the COOCH3. Wait, but each carbon in a chain is connected to the next. So the central carbon is connected to:

- One CH3,

- One OH,

- One COOCH3,

- And another CH (from the next carbon, which is part of the COOCH3 group). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Actually, each carbon in a chain has two bonds to adjacent carbons. So, the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),

- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),

- OH,

- And a hydrogen? Or is it connected to another group? Wait, no, CH(OH) would have the structure CH2(OH) if it's a branch, but perhaps in this case, it's CH(OH) connected to two other carbons.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3 → the second carbon has four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH (from the next carbon). Wait, but that's not four different groups. Let me count:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (which is the same as the CH3's CH? No, perhaps it's a single bond to the next carbon. So, the substituents would be:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. and a CH2 group leading to the COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's getting me confused. Maybe I should think in terms of whether the second carbon has four different groups attached. Let's see: the substituents on the central carbon would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group that's connected to the COOCH3.

Wait, no, maybe the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a hydrogen. No, wait, that can't be because the central carbon is part of a chain, so it's connected to the previous and next carbons.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for whether this molecule has a chiral center. If the central carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups, then it is a chiral center, so the molecule would have optical isomers.

In this case, the substituents would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group leading to something else? No, perhaps the substituents are:

Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon in the chain). Wait, but that's not four different groups. Because the adjacent carbon (third) is connected to COOCH3, which is a larger group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the central carbon are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a hydrogen? No, that doesn't make sense because the central carbon is part of a chain.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as:

(CH3)(OH)(COOCH3)(something else). Wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and a CH2 group connected to the COOCH3.

No, that can't be. Maybe I should consider that the central carbon is connected to four distinct groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. and a CH2 group that's part of the COOCH3.

Hmm, I'm not getting it right. Maybe I should think about the molecule's structure again. Another approach: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as methyl 2-hydroxybutyrate? Wait, no, propanoate is three carbons. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to:

- CH2OH,

- CH2COOCH3,

- two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the second carbon in this case is CH2. So it would be:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, in this case, the second carbon is CH2. So it's connected to:

- CH2(OH),

- COOCH3,

- and two H's.

Then it's not a chiral center because it's attached to two H's and two other groups (CH2OH and COOCH3). So, four substituents would be: two H's, CH2OH, and COOCH3. So, no, it's not a chiral center because two substituents are the same (two H's). So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but that can't be right because I might be making a mistake here.

Wait, another approach: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH2OH)CH2COOH. Its structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this molecule, the central carbon (the second carbon) is CH2. So it's attached to:

- CH2OH,

- COOCH3,

- and two H's.

So, two H's, CH2OH, and COOCH3. So that's four substituents, but two are H's, so it's not a chiral center because it's attached to two same groups. So, no optical isomerism here. So 2 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the 2-hydroxypropanoate could have a chiral center if the structure is different. Let me think again. Suppose the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Then the second carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (from the next carbon). But in that case, the substituents would be:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH which is part of the COOCH3 group, so it's connected to that.

Wait, but that would mean the central carbon is connected to four different groups:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. and the adjacent CH, which is part of the COOCH3. Hmm, no, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (but that's part of the same group as COOCH3, so not different).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Another possibility is that the hydroxy is on a carbon adjacent to the ester group, making it a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is structured as:

CH3-C(OH)H-CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's a different structure. No, that would be four carbons, which is butanoate, not propanoate.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)COOCH2CH3, which would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure, which is making this difficult.

But perhaps a better approach is to think that if the molecule has a chiral center, it's possible to have optical isomerism. So, does methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate have a chiral center?

Wait, the formula for a chiral center: four different substituents attached to a carbon.

Looking at 2-hydroxypropanoate: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The second carbon is CH2, so it's not a chiral center because it's attached to two H's. So, no optical isomerism here. So option 2 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's conflicting with some of my initial thoughts. Maybe I should think again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the hydroxy is on a different carbon, making the central carbon a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

3. benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. The structure is two benzene rings connected to a ketone group (C=O). The central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the ketone). Wait, no: the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar, where Ar is aryl (benzene). So the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings, one oxygen (double bond), and another oxygen (as part of the ketone). So the central carbon is C=O, but that's a double bond, so it's not a chiral center. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure (CH2) groups, but wait, no. Fumarate is the cis diastereomer of maleic acid. So the structure of fumarate is CH2=CH(COO-)2 in the cis configuration. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, with both COOCH3 groups on the same side of the double bond.

In this structure, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same carbon adjacent to the double bond. So, looking at the molecule, does it have any stereogenic centers? No, because the double bond is between the two carbons, each bearing two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, each of those carbons has two COOCH3 groups attached?

Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side. The dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)(COOCH3). So the structure is CH2-CH(COOCH3)2 with a double bond between the two CH groups. The two COOCH3 groups are on the same carbon, so the central carbon (the one with the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Wait, dimethyl fumarate's structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is MeOOC-CH2CH2-COOme? No, wait, fumarate is the cis version. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no, the structure of fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
    ||           |
    O           O

Wait, no. Alternatively, fumarate is trans, but wait, no. Fumarate is the cis isomer. So, the structure is HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH in the cis configuration. Wait, but that's not correct. Fumarate is actually the cis isomer, so the two COOH groups are on the same side of the double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate would be:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that structure would have the two COOCH3 groups on the same carbon. So, each of the two carbons in the double bond has one COOCH3 group attached.

Ah, so the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, no, let's get this right. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid. Maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. Fumarate is the cis version, so the two COOH groups are on the same side of the double bond.

So, the dimethyl ester would have the structure: CH2=C(COOCH3)(COOCH3). So each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. Wait, no, that can't be because that would require each carbon to have two COOCH3 groups, which is not possible. Alternatively, each of the two carbons in the double bond has one COOCH3 group.

So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that can't be right because each carbon in the double bond can only have three substituents. Wait, wait, no: each carbon in the double bond (CH2 and CH) would have two groups attached.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
    ||           |
    O           O

But that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is:

OOCC(Me)O
   \C=C/
    O

No, perhaps I should think in terms of the molecule's symmetry. Dimethyl fumarate is the cis ester, so the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond. If the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. Wait, but wait: if the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it might have optical isomerism.

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or a chiral axis, but in the case of fumarate, it's a diastereomer of maleate. So, dimethyl fumarate itself is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. Wait, but wait: can a molecule with geometric isomerism also exhibit optical isomerism? Hmm, perhaps not necessarily.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Optical isomerism arises from chirality, which requires the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have a non-superimposable mirror image. So, if a molecule has a chiral center, it can show optical isomerism. Alternatively, if it has a plane of symmetry, it won't.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that can't be because each carbon in the double bond has two substituents. Wait, maybe each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group. So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. The structure would be:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme with the double bond between the two CH2? No, wait, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. But that would mean each carbon has two COOCH3 groups, which isn't possible because each carbon in the double bond can only have three substituents (the double bond takes up two). So, each carbon would have one COOCH3 group and two CH2 groups. So, the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
CH2=CH2
|
COOCH3

No, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
    ||           |
    O           O

But again, this might not be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't have optical isomerism. For example, if the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond, then the molecule may be symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond.

But if the substituents are on the same side, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate, being the cis isomer, would have the two COOCH3 groups on the same side. So, the molecule would be symmetrical across the double bond, meaning it's not chiral, and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure: if the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry through the double bond. Thus, it's not chiral.

But wait, another possibility: If the substituents are on opposite sides, then the molecule could be chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are on the same side (cis), so it's not chiral. So, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait again. Another approach: the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents (COOCH3 groups) are on the same side, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if they're on opposite sides, then the molecule is chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is the cis (Z) isomer. So the substituents are on the same side. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait! I think I'm making a mistake here. Because, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (Z)-1,2-dimethylbut-2-enedioate. Or something like that. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Hmm, in that structure, each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached. So both COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond, making the molecule symmetrical. So, it's not chiral, hence no optical isomerism.

But wait, no, another possibility: if the substituents are on both sides, the molecule would be chiral. But for fumarate, the substituents are on the same side, making it not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but in reality, fumaric acid is not chiral. I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, but both are not chiral because they have a plane of symmetry. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomers.

Wait, but wait, another point: some sources say that maleic acid is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry, but when you esterify it, does it become chiral?

No, because the esters would retain the same symmetry. So, dimethyl fumarate is achiral, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Because in reality, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Wait, let me think about this more carefully.

The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-butenedioate dimethyl ester. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
    ||           |
    O           O

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think of the structure as CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group attached. So, the substituents on each carbon are:

- For the left carbon: CH3 (from the methyl ester), COOCH3, and the double bond.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
    ||           |
    O           O

But this doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But that's not correct because it's a double bond.

Wait, I'm clearly not getting the structure right, so perhaps I should refer back to what I know about fumarate. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleate. So, in the case of fumarate, the two substituents (the ester groups) are on the same side of the double bond, which would make the molecule symmetrical. Thus, it's not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and dimethyl fumarate is chiral. Let me think of another approach: does the molecule have a center of chirality?

If the molecule is symmetrical, then no. If it's asymmetrical, then yes.

Wait, if the two substituents are on the same side, the molecule is symmetrical. If they're on opposite sides, it's asymmetrical and chiral. So dimethyl fumarate, being the cis isomer, is symmetrical and thus not chiral. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Symmetrical, so no.

2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. No chiral center, so no.

3: benzophenone. No chiral center, so no.

4: dimethyl fumarate. Symmetrical (cis), so no.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake about any of these?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 2, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon). So, the substituents are four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and CH (from the adjacent carbon, which is connected to COOCH3). So, that would make it a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the structure was CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. So which one is correct?

Wait, maybe the structural formula of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH (the next carbon in the chain). But wait, the next carbon is the COOCH3 group. So, the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH (which is part of the same group as COOCH3?), making them not all different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent carbon (which is the COOCH3's carbon). So, the substituents are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH (which is part of the same group). So, that would make four different groups, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is connected to the COOCH3 group, which is a larger substituent. So, the substituents on the central carbon are:

1. CH3,

2. OH,

3. COOCH3,

4. and the adjacent CH (which is part of the COOCH3 group). Wait, but that's not a different group from COOCH3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3, which would mean the central carbon is CH2. In that case, it's not a chiral center.

But if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is CH(OH), which is connected to four different groups. So, it would have a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

So, which is correct? Let me look up the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, I can't look it up, but from what I remember, 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as (R)- or (S)-2-hydroxypropanoate, which suggests that it is chiral.

So, assuming the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, which has a chiral center, then option 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, now, let's go back to the options.

Which of the given moieties show optical isomerism?

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: No (symmetrical).

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Yes (chiral center).

3. benzophenone: No (no chiral centers).

4. dimethyl fumarate: No (symmetrical, as it's cis).

So, the options are 2 and 4? Or wait, wait, I thought 4 didn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake regarding option 4. Let me think again. Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers or a plane of symmetry?

If the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, then it has two identical groups on each carbon of the double bond. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, from the four options, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, the question asks which of the following show optical isomerism. So, looking at the options:

Option A: 1, 2, and 4. But 1 and 4 don't.

Option B: 3 and 4. No.

Option C: 2 and 3. No.

Option D: 1 and 2. No, because 1 doesn't.

Wait, that can't be right because only option 2 would have it, but the options don't have an option with only 2.

Wait, looking back: the options are A to D. Let me recheck the options.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

But according to my analysis, only option 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing option 1.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 2,2' for the dicarboxylate and 6,6' for the dinitro groups.

Let me imagine the biphenyl rings connected at position 1. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, the substituents are arranged symmetrically. So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a methyl ester group at 2.

Wait, but wait: if the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are opposite each other, then each ring is symmetric. So, the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, from the options, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't include an option with only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 4. Let's think again about dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, then each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. But wait, each carbon can only have three substituents. So, each carbon in the double bond must have two substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, no: each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two other groups. So, the structure would be:

COOCH3
|
CH2=CH2
|
COOCH3

No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has one COOCH3 group and two CH3 groups. No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-CH2-CH2-C-O
    ||           |
    O           O

But that's not a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. But each carbon in the double bond can only have three substituents. So, each would have a COOCH3 group and two H's. So, the structure would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but that would imply each carbon has two COOCH3 groups, which is impossible.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, which is making it hard to determine chirality. Perhaps I should think of dimethyl fumarate as having a plane of symmetry. If it does, then no optical isomerism. If not, then yes.

But I'm not confident about this. Another approach: which of these compounds have a plane of symmetry? If a compound has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (option 2) has a chiral center, so it shows optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate (option 4) is the cis isomer, which is symmetrical along the double bond, making it achiral.

So, among the options, only option 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options again:

Options:

A) 1,2,4 → No, because 1 and 4 don't.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → No, because 3 doesn't.

D) 1 and 2 → No, because 1 doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 4. Let me think again: perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

If the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2, then each of the two carbons in the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry because the substituents are the same on each end. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is asymmetric, making it chiral. I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing diastereomers with optical isomers. Fumarate is the cis diastereomer of maleate. But whether dimethyl fumarate is chiral depends on whether it has a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. Because each of the carbons in the double bond has two identical substituents (COOCH3 groups), so no chiral centers.

Wait, but if each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents, then each is not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

So, to summarize:

1: No.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

Thus, only option 2 shows optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of the options have only option 2. The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → No.

B) 3 and 4 → No.

C) 2 and 3 → No.

D) 1 and 2 → No.

Wait, so perhaps I'm wrong about option 2.

Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. Let's think again.

The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and the adjacent carbon (CH in COOCH3).

So, that's four different groups, making it a chiral center. So, yes, option 2 has optical isomerism.

But according to the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and D.

Wait, the user's options are:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, if only option 2 shows optical isomerism, but none of the options include only 2, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about each option.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Because 2 and 6 are para positions on the benzene ring, the substituents are opposite each other. So, each ring has two substituents, para to each other, leading to a symmetrical structure. Thus, the entire molecule is symmetrical and not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

Option 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. As discussed, it has a chiral center, so yes.

Option 3: benzophenone. No chiral centers, no.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate. No chiral centers, no.

Thus, only option 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option with only 2. So perhaps I missed another compound that also shows optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate has the structure (Z)-1,2-dimethylbut-2-enedioate. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Each of the two carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, each carbon is connected to two identical groups, which are COOCH3. So, each carbon isn't a chiral center because they have two identical substituents.

Wait, but what if the structure is such that the substituents on each carbon are different? For example, if one carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH3, and the other has a COOCH3 and a different group. But in the case of dimethyl fumarate, both substituents on each carbon are COOCH3, making them identical. So no chiral centers.

Thus, only option 2 is correct.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of another option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that option 4 does show optical isomerism.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, which is maleate. But no, fumarate is the cis isomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the double bond are different, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2=C-(COOCH3)-(COOCH3)

Wait, but that would mean each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, making them identical, so no chiral center.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are on different carbons, leading to a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of other chiral centers in the molecule.

If the substituents are on the same side of the double bond, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. But if the substituents are on different sides, it might be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond, it would be:

COOCH3
|
CH2=CH2
|
COOCH3

But that would have each substituent on a different carbon, and each substituent being the same (COOCH3), so the molecule would still be symmetrical.

Thus, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, going back to the options, the only correct answer is option 2. But since the options don't have an option that includes only 2, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck option 4. Another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, but in reality, it doesn't.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite ends, but in the cis configuration, making the molecule symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical, so it's chiral. But I'm not certain.

Given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1, 2, and 4.

But based on my analysis, option 2 is the only correct one, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about option 1. Let me think again.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents are at 2,2' for the carboxylate groups and 6,6' for the nitro groups. So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Are these positions para to each other? On a benzene ring, position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. So, in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other, not para. Para positions are 1 and 4, 2 and 6 are meta.

Wait, no, wait. In a benzene ring, position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. Position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. So, position 2 and 6 are para to each other on the benzene ring. Because in a benzene ring, each position is across from the position four away. So, position 1 is across from 4, 2 across from 5, 3 across from 6.

Wait, no. Let me number a benzene ring: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, position 1 is opposite 4, 2 opposite 5, 3 opposite 6.

So, in option 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are meta to each other, not para. So, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are meta, leading to no symmetry on the individual rings. Thus, the entire molecule may not be symmetrical, leading to the possibility of chirality.

Wait, so in option 1, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6, which are meta. Thus, each ring has two substituents at meta positions, making each ring asymmetrical. But the two rings are connected at position 1. So, the entire molecule may have a plane of symmetry or not.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that creates asymmetry, the molecule could be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

For example, if the substituents are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule would be chiral.

In this case, each ring has two substituents (nitro and carboxylate) at meta positions. So, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality.

Therefore, option 1 could exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to recap, which options have optical isomerism:

1: Yes.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

So, the correct options are 1 and 2.

Looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

Thus, the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which arises when a molecule has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or lacks a plane of symmetry.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at position 1, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) are at meta positions (2 and 6) on each benzene ring. Since the substituents are not symmetrically arranged, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. This makes the molecule chiral, and thus it exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon in the chain. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where two benzene rings are connected to a ketone group. The central carbon is bonded to two identical benzene rings and two oxygen atoms (one double-bonded to the carbon). Since the central carbon is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral and incapable of optical isomerism.

4. **dimethyl fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid, with the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)2. In this structure, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond. The molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
From the analysis, only **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate (1)** and **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (2)** exhibit optical isomerism. The correct option is:

**Answer: D**
