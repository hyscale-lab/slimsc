Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. 

Wait, the matrix S has its first row as (0 -i) and the second row as (i 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin matrices are often represented as Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]
Which matches what S is here. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y.

And the operator A_y is given by c multiplied by sigma_y. So Ay = c * sigma_y. Since c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

The problem states that Ay satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ the eigenfunction. So we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving (Ay - a I)φ = 0. But since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, maybe it's easier to compute the characteristic equation.

Wait, but since S is the Pauli Y matrix, I remember that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So if Ay = c S, then the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. So S has eigenvalues ±1, so Ay has eigenvalues ±c.

Wait, c is h/(4π). So c = h/(4π) → so eigenvalues a are ±h/(4π). Oh, but wait, the options don't mention that exactly. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary part of eigenvalues are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues can't have both real and imaginary parts unless the matrix is not Hermitian. Wait, but the angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. So Ay must be Hermitian, so a must be real.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: Is S Hermitian? Let's check. The matrix S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

The conjugate transpose (Hermitian conjugate) would be:

[ 0   i ]
[ -i  0 ]

Which is the same as S because the original matrix is equal to its conjugate transpose. So S is Hermitian, which means Ay = c S is also Hermitian (since c is real). Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay must be real.

Looking at the options, option B says eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So option B is incorrect because it's talking about imaginary parts.

Option A's eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be true. So both A and B are out. Now, options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum. For spin-1/2 particles, A² has eigenvalues (s(s+1)ħ²). But wait, for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, so s=1/2.

So A² = ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) * ħ² * I, where I is the identity matrix. So any eigenfunction of A² is an eigenstate of Ay as well, because A² commutes with all components (including Ay and Az). Wait, but does Ay commute with Az? No, because angular momentum components don't commute. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az unless it's in a simultaneous eigenstate, which requires the state to have definite m (like in the basis where all three are diagonal, which only happens for states with definite m, but that's only for angular momentum in a particular direction).

Wait, but the question is whether the eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A².

Since A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, any vector is an eigenfunction of A². So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's automatically an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue ( (1/2)(3/2) ) * ħ². But wait, let me think about the units. Wait, the operator A is the angular momentum operator, which has units of ħ. So A² would be ħ² times the Casimir operator.

Wait, but the question says A is the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum. So A² would be (Ay)^2. Oh wait, no, the total angular momentum operator J squared is Jx² + Jy² + Jz², but that's for orbital angular momentum. Wait, but in this case, the operator is spin angular momentum, so S² is the square of the spin operator, which for a spin-½ particle is (3/4) ħ² I.

Wait, but in the problem statement, A is a component of the angular momentum, so A² would be (Ay)^2. But the total spin squared is S², which is (Sx² + Sy² + Sz²). So S² is a 2x2 matrix for spin ½. So in the case of S², the eigenvalues are (3/4) ħ².

But in any case, the question is about whether the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is (Ay)^2, which is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Wait, let's compute (Ay)^2.

Ay = c S, so (Ay)^2 = c² S². S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is part of the spin matrices. The square of the Pauli matrices is identity. So S² = I. Therefore, (Ay)^2 = c² I.

So any vector is an eigenfunction of A². Therefore, if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it is also an eigenfunction of A², with eigenvalue c². So option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². So that's correct. So option C is correct? Wait, but the option says "can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." Hmm. So if the state is an eigenstate of Ay, then it can't be an eigenstate of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So yes, that part is correct. So option C is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose the eigenfunctions of Ay are |+y> and |-y> states. These are eigenstates of Ay. Now, can these states also be eigenstates of A²? Since A² is (Ay)^2, and we've just seen that (Ay)^2 is c² I, which is the same as (ħ/2)^2 * I, because c is h/(4π) = ħ/(2), since h=2πħ. So (c)^2 = (ħ^2)/(4), and A² = (c)^2 I = (ħ²/4) I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue ħ²/4. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² as well. So option C's first part is correct.

The second part of option C says that the eigenfunctions cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute (they are different components), a state can't be an eigenstate of both unless it's a state of definite total angular momentum, which for spin-½ is possible only in specific cases. But in general, if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it won't be an eigenstate of Az. So option C is correct.

Now, what about option D? It says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. Basis functions are typically the eigenvectors of the operator. So if Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. So any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors. So the eigenvectors of Ay would form a basis. So D's statement is correct as well.

Wait, but the options are to choose which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct. But wait, that's not possible because the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, let me re-read option D. It says: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. Well, the operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors should form a basis for the space. So yes, that's correct. So option D is also correct.

Wait, but this is a multiple-choice question where only one option is correct. So I need to figure out which of the options is correct.

Wait, let's think again. Let's compute the eigenvalues of Ay.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix. The eigenvalues of S are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay are (h/(4π)) * (±1) → ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π). So looking at the options:

Option A: Im(a) is ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But a must be real, so this is wrong.

Option B: Im(a) is ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's also wrong because a is real and ± h/(4π), which is approximately 0.04ħ, but h=2πħ, so h/(4π) = ħ/(2). So a is ± ħ/2. So eigenvalues are real and ± ħ/2. So options A and B are wrong.

So only options C and D are possibilities.

Earlier analysis suggests both C and D could be correct. But let's look more closely.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As discussed, since A² is a multiple of identity, any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A². So yes, that part is correct. But the second part, about not being eigenfunctions of Az, is correct as well. So C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space, which is the domain of the operator (since it's a 2x2 matrix), then yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one option is correct, but in reality, the options are designed to have only one correct choice.

Wait, let me check the statements again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the eigenvectors form the basis, so D is correct. So which options are correct?

Hmm, perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, perhaps the only correct statement is C and D.

Wait, the question says "you are asked to calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct?"

So during the calculation, which statement is correct.

If the eigenfunctions are the basis, that's correct. So D says that, which is correct.

Wait, but let me think: the eigenfunctions are either the eigenvectors, which form a basis. So, the statement in D is correct.

But why is option C correct as well? Because the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². So perhaps both C and D are correct.

But the options are given as four options, each a statement. So perhaps in the options, only C and D are correct, but the question is looking for which is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So both C and D are correct. But the question is giving four options, each a statement that is correct or not. So perhaps the correct answers are both C and D.

But in the problem, only one option is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, let's compute A². Since A is Ay = c S, then A² = c² S². And S is the Pauli Y matrix, S² = I (identity matrix). So A² = c² I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue c². So if a vector is an eigenstate of Ay, it is automatically an eigenstate of A². So option C's first part is correct.

The second part of C says that the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenstates are not the same, so yes, an eigenstate of Ay can't be an eigenstate of Az. So C is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements. But since the multiple-choice options are given and only one can be correct, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the operator. Ay = c S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. So the eigenfunctions will form an orthonormal basis because the matrix is Hermitian. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, which is correct.

Hmm, but all the options may not be correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D. But in the given options, only one is correct. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, let me re-examine option D. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space on which Ay acts. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the vector space is two-dimensional, and the two eigenvectors (which are orthogonal) form a basis. So yes, D is correct.

But wait, perhaps the operator is a 2x2 matrix, which is defined in a two-dimensional space, so all vectors can be expressed in terms of its eigenfunctions. So indeed, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. So D is correct.

So now, both C and D seem correct, but perhaps the question allows only one correct choice. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are to choose all that apply. But in reality, this is a multiple-choice question with four options, each a statement, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in option D. The statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So perhaps the eigenvectors are the basis for the operator's matrix representation, which is correct because any 2x2 matrix can be represented in terms of its eigenvectors, but only if it's diagonalizable. Since S is diagonalizable (as it's a Pauli matrix), then yes, D is correct.

But in reality, all eigenfunctions of Ay (which are the |+y> and |-y> states) form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

But then, what about the other options. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the options are phrased. Let me read option C again: "The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az."

Wait, A² is (Ay)^2, so any vector is an eigenfunction of A², so the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct.

But the second part says they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. Which is correct because Ay and Az don't commute. So a state cannot be an eigenstate of both Ay and Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which only occurs for states with definite m (eigenstates of Sz), but for spin-½, you can have eigenstates of either Sx, Sy, or Sz, but not two of them unless you have a state that's a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't possible unless the state is a product state, which it isn't in this case. So C is correct.

So now both C and D are correct.

Wait, but the problem lists four options, each a statement, and we're to choose which is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option C and D, but that's not an option here. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look at option D again. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

But in this question, only one option is correct. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the eigenfunctions form the basis of the operator's matrix. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, we can say that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, so D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis functions of the operator. Wait, the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions would form a basis, but the basis used to represent the operator may not be the same as the eigenvectors. But no, the eigenfunctions themselves form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here, but based on the analysis, both C and D seem correct. However, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

Let me compute Ay. Since S is the Pauli Y matrix, Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - a I is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a    (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i         (h/(4π))*0 - a ]

Which is:

[ -a       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) (i h/(4π)) ) ]

= a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

= a² - [ (i^2 is -1) * (-1) ) * (h^2/(16 π²)) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is a² - (1) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) = 0.

Thus, a² = h^2/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

Which matches what I thought earlier. So eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are incorrect.

So, moving to options C and D.

Now, the eigenfunctions. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors will form a basis. So D is correct.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is true, because A² is (h²/(16 π²)) I, so any vector is an eigenfunction. And they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So C is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But the options are:

A, B, C, D.

I must have made a mistake because it's impossible for two options to be correct in a multiple-choice question. Wait, perhaps in the question, option C says "can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az."

Wait, A² is (Ay)^2. So what about if Ay and A² share eigenfunctions? Yes, because A² is a scalar multiple of the identity, so any vector is an eigenfunction of A². But the question is whether the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A².

Yes, because if a vector is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². So C's first part is correct.

The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D's statement is also correct. So perhaps the options are structured such that only C is correct, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not confident. Wait, perhaps I should think about the statement in option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, so yes, D is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements, but this is not reflected in the options. However, the problem gives only four options.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option C. Let me think again.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of the spin components (like Ay) are the eigenstates of that component. These states are not eigenstates of the other components (like Az), which aligns with option C. So C is correct.

But I'm still a bit confused because D also seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. So I'll go with option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues are found to be \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real because \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), and the imaginary parts are zero.

2. **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of the Z-component \( A_z \). This is correct because:
   - \( A^2 = (A_y)^2 = c^2 S^2 \), and since \( S^2 = I \) (the identity matrix), \( A^2 \) is a multiple of the identity matrix. Thus, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenfunction of \( A_y \) cannot be an eigenfunction of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the two-dimensional space in which \( A_y \) operates.

### Conclusion:

Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question requires selecting only one correct statement, **option C** is the most relevant because it directly addresses the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is central to the problem.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. 

Wait, the matrix S has its first row as (0 -i) and the second row as (i 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin matrices are often represented as Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]
Which matches what S is here. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y.

And the operator A_y is given by c multiplied by sigma_y. So Ay = c * sigma_y. Since c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

The problem states that Ay satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ the eigenfunction. So we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving (Ay - a I)φ = 0. But since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, maybe it's easier to compute the characteristic equation.

Wait, but since S is the Pauli Y matrix, I remember that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So if Ay = c S, then the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. So S has eigenvalues ±1, so Ay has eigenvalues ±c.

Wait, c is h/(4π). So c = h/(4π) → so eigenvalues a are ±h/(4π). Oh, but wait, the options don't mention that exactly. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary part of eigenvalues are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues can't have both real and imaginary parts unless the matrix is not Hermitian. Wait, but the angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. So Ay must be Hermitian, so a must be real.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: Is S Hermitian? Let's check. The matrix S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

The conjugate transpose (Hermitian conjugate) would be:

[ 0   i ]
[ -i  0 ]

Which is the same as S because the original matrix is equal to its conjugate transpose. So S is Hermitian, which means Ay = c S is also Hermitian (since c is real). Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay must be real.

Looking at the options, option B says eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So option B is incorrect because it's talking about imaginary parts.

Option A's eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be true. So both A and B are out. Now, options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Wait, A² is the square of the angular momentum. For spin-1/2 particles, A² has eigenvalues (s(s+1)ħ²). But wait, for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, so s=1/2.

So A² = ( (1/2)(1/2 +1) ) * ħ² * I, where I is the identity matrix. So any eigenfunction of A² is an eigenstate of Ay as well, because A² commutes with all components (including Ay and Az). Wait, but does Ay commute with Az? No, because angular momentum components don't commute. So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az unless it's in a simultaneous eigenstate, which requires the state to have definite m (like in the basis where all three are diagonal, which only happens for states with definite m, but that's only for angular momentum in a particular direction).

Wait, but the question is whether the eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A².

Since A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, any vector is an eigenfunction of A². So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's automatically an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue ( (1/2)(3/2) ) * ħ². But wait, let me think about the units. Wait, the operator A is the angular momentum operator, which has units of ħ. So A² would be ħ² times the Casimir operator.

Wait, but the question says A is the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum. So A² would be (Ay)^2. Oh wait, no, the total angular momentum operator J squared is Jx² + Jy² + Jz², but that's for orbital angular momentum. Wait, but in this case, the operator is spin angular momentum, so S² is the square of the spin operator, which for a spin-½ particle is (3/4) ħ² I.

Wait, but in the problem statement, A is a component of the angular momentum, so A² would be (Ay)^2. But the total spin squared is S², which is (Sx² + Sy² + Sz²). So S² is a 2x2 matrix for spin ½. So in the case of S², the eigenvalues are (3/4) ħ².

But in any case, the question is about whether the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is (Ay)^2, which is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Wait, let's compute (Ay)^2.

Ay = c S, so (Ay)^2 = c² S². S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is part of the spin matrices. The square of the Pauli matrices is identity. So S² = I. Therefore, (Ay)^2 = c² I.

So any vector is an eigenfunction of A². Therefore, if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it is also an eigenfunction of A², with eigenvalue c². So option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A². So that's correct. So option C is correct? Wait, but the option says "can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." Hmm. So if the state is an eigenstate of Ay, then it can't be an eigenstate of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So yes, that part is correct. So option C is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose the eigenfunctions of Ay are |+y> and |-y> states. These are eigenstates of Ay. Now, can these states also be eigenstates of A²? Since A² is (Ay)^2, and we've just seen that (Ay)^2 is c² I, which is the same as (ħ/2)^2 * I, because c is h/(4π) = ħ/(2), since h=2πħ. So (c)^2 = (ħ^2)/(4), and A² = (c)^2 I = (ħ²/4) I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue ħ²/4. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² as well. So option C's first part is correct.

The second part of option C says that the eigenfunctions cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute (they are different components), a state can't be an eigenstate of both unless it's a state of definite total angular momentum, which for spin-½ is possible only in specific cases. But in general, if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it won't be an eigenstate of Az. So option C is correct.

Now, what about option D? It says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm. Basis functions are typically the eigenvectors of the operator. So if Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. So any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors. So the eigenvectors of Ay would form a basis. So D's statement is correct as well.

Wait, but the options are to choose which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D could be correct. But wait, that's not possible because the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, let me re-read option D. It says: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. Well, the operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors should form a basis for the space. So yes, that's correct. So option D is also correct.

Wait, but this is a multiple-choice question where only one option is correct. So I need to figure out which of the options is correct.

Wait, let's think again. Let's compute the eigenvalues of Ay.

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix. The eigenvalues of S are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay are (h/(4π)) * (±1) → ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π). So looking at the options:

Option A: Im(a) is ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But a must be real, so this is wrong.

Option B: Im(a) is ±1/2, real parts ±1. That's also wrong because a is real and ± h/(4π), which is approximately 0.04ħ, but h=2πħ, so h/(4π) = ħ/(2). So a is ± ħ/2. So eigenvalues are real and ± ħ/2. So options A and B are wrong.

So only options C and D are possibilities.

Earlier analysis suggests both C and D could be correct. But let's look more closely.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As discussed, since A² is a multiple of identity, any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A². So yes, that part is correct. But the second part, about not being eigenfunctions of Az, is correct as well. So C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Since the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space, which is the domain of the operator (since it's a 2x2 matrix), then yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one option is correct, but in reality, the options are designed to have only one correct choice.

Wait, let me check the statements again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the eigenvectors form the basis, so D is correct. So which options are correct?

Hmm, perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, perhaps the only correct statement is C and D.

Wait, the question says "you are asked to calculate the eigenvalue and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. During the calculation, which statement below will you consider to be correct?"

So during the calculation, which statement is correct.

If the eigenfunctions are the basis, that's correct. So D says that, which is correct.

Wait, but let me think: the eigenfunctions are either the eigenvectors, which form a basis. So, the statement in D is correct.

But why is option C correct as well? Because the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². So perhaps both C and D are correct.

But the options are given as four options, each a statement. So perhaps in the options, only C and D are correct, but the question is looking for which is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So both C and D are correct. But the question is giving four options, each a statement that is correct or not. So perhaps the correct answers are both C and D.

But in the problem, only one option is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, let's compute A². Since A is Ay = c S, then A² = c² S². And S is the Pauli Y matrix, S² = I (identity matrix). So A² = c² I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue c². So if a vector is an eigenstate of Ay, it is automatically an eigenstate of A². So option C's first part is correct.

The second part of C says that the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az. Since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenstates are not the same, so yes, an eigenstate of Ay can't be an eigenstate of Az. So C is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements. But since the multiple-choice options are given and only one can be correct, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the operator. Ay = c S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. So the eigenfunctions will form an orthonormal basis because the matrix is Hermitian. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay, which is correct.

Hmm, but all the options may not be correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D. But in the given options, only one is correct. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, let me re-examine option D. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space on which Ay acts. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the vector space is two-dimensional, and the two eigenvectors (which are orthogonal) form a basis. So yes, D is correct.

But wait, perhaps the operator is a 2x2 matrix, which is defined in a two-dimensional space, so all vectors can be expressed in terms of its eigenfunctions. So indeed, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator. So D is correct.

So now, both C and D seem correct, but perhaps the question allows only one correct choice. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are to choose all that apply. But in reality, this is a multiple-choice question with four options, each a statement, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in option D. The statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So perhaps the eigenvectors are the basis for the operator's matrix representation, which is correct because any 2x2 matrix can be represented in terms of its eigenvectors, but only if it's diagonalizable. Since S is diagonalizable (as it's a Pauli matrix), then yes, D is correct.

But in reality, all eigenfunctions of Ay (which are the |+y> and |-y> states) form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

But then, what about the other options. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the options are phrased. Let me read option C again: "The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az."

Wait, A² is (Ay)^2, so any vector is an eigenfunction of A², so the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct.

But the second part says they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. Which is correct because Ay and Az don't commute. So a state cannot be an eigenstate of both Ay and Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which only occurs for states with definite m (eigenstates of Sz), but for spin-½, you can have eigenstates of either Sx, Sy, or Sz, but not two of them unless you have a state that's a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't possible unless the state is a product state, which it isn't in this case. So C is correct.

So now both C and D are correct.

Wait, but the problem lists four options, each a statement, and we're to choose which is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option C and D, but that's not an option here. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look at option D again. It says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

But in this question, only one option is correct. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the eigenfunctions form the basis of the operator's matrix. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps during the calculation, we can say that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, so D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis functions of the operator. Wait, the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions would form a basis, but the basis used to represent the operator may not be the same as the eigenvectors. But no, the eigenfunctions themselves form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here, but based on the analysis, both C and D seem correct. However, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another approach: let's compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

Let me compute Ay. Since S is the Pauli Y matrix, Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - a I is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 - a    (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i         (h/(4π))*0 - a ]

Which is:

[ -a       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π) ) (i h/(4π)) ) ]

= a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

= a² - [ (i^2 is -1) * (-1) ) * (h^2/(16 π²)) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant is a² - (1) * (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) = 0.

Thus, a² = h^2/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

Which matches what I thought earlier. So eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, so options A and B are incorrect.

So, moving to options C and D.

Now, the eigenfunctions. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors will form a basis. So D is correct.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is true, because A² is (h²/(16 π²)) I, so any vector is an eigenfunction. And they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So C is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But the options are:

A, B, C, D.

I must have made a mistake because it's impossible for two options to be correct in a multiple-choice question. Wait, perhaps in the question, option C says "can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az."

Wait, A² is (Ay)^2. So what about if Ay and A² share eigenfunctions? Yes, because A² is a scalar multiple of the identity, so any vector is an eigenfunction of A². But the question is whether the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A².

Yes, because if a vector is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². So C's first part is correct.

The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is correct because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D's statement is also correct. So perhaps the options are structured such that only C is correct, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not confident. Wait, perhaps I should think about the statement in option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Well, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, so yes, D is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct statements, but this is not reflected in the options. However, the problem gives only four options.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option C. Let me think again.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of the spin components (like Ay) are the eigenstates of that component. These states are not eigenstates of the other components (like Az), which aligns with option C. So C is correct.

But I'm still a bit confused because D also seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. So I'll go with option C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon, which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues are found to be \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real because \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)), and the imaginary parts are zero.

2. **Option B**: Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of the Z-component \( A_z \). This is correct because:
   - \( A^2 = (A_y)^2 = c^2 S^2 \), and since \( S^2 = I \) (the identity matrix), \( A^2 \) is a multiple of the identity matrix. Thus, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenfunction of \( A_y \) cannot be an eigenfunction of \( A_z \).

4. **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the two-dimensional space in which \( A_y \) operates.

### Conclusion:

Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question requires selecting only one correct statement, **option C** is the most relevant because it directly addresses the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is central to the problem.
