Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's think through this step by step.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a line element in two dimensions, so probably a 2D surface. Hmm, pseudosphere... I remember that in general relativity, a pseudosphere is a type of solution to Einstein's equations, but I'm not entirely sure about its properties. Oh wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Right, like a saddle shape.

Wait, the question is about the area. So I need to find the area of this pseudosphere with radius 2. But wait, how do I find the area from the metric? Oh right, I think I need to compute the area integral over the surface using the given metric.

First, perhaps I should express the metric in a more standard form. The line element given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So if I rewrite this, it's ds² = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j, where the metric tensor is diagonal with components g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So in this case, the area element dA would be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. Because it's a 2D metric, the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, wait. The metric is diagonal, so det(g) is the product of the diagonal elements. So det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So sqrt(det(g)) would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)).

So the area element dA is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. Hmm, wait, but that's if we're in 2D. Wait, no, the area in 2D would be the integral over x and y with the square root of the determinant, which in this case is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] (dx dy), where r² = x² + y².

Wait, but let's think about the domain of this metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so to have a positive denominator, 4 - x² - y² >0. So x² + y² <4. That means r < 2. Oh, okay, so this metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, but wait, a pseudosphere is a surface, not a disk. Hmm, maybe this is a coordinate representation of a pseudosphere.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere... I remember that for a surface of constant negative curvature, the total area is infinite. Because as you go further out, the area keeps increasing. But wait, in this case, the metric only covers a certain region. Because x² + y² <4. So maybe this is just a portion of the pseudosphere, not the entire thing.

Wait, but the question says the radius is 2. So the pseudosphere radius is r=2. I think the radius in this context refers to the curvature. Oh wait, the radius of curvature for a pseudosphere is related to its Gaussian curvature. For a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative, K = -1/(r^2), where r is the radius of the pseudosphere. Or wait, maybe K is negative and the radius is related differently. Let me think. For a sphere, the Gaussian curvature is positive and K = 1/(r^2), where r is the radius. So for a pseudosphere, I think K = -1/(r^2), so radius r would be the same as the sphere case but with negative curvature.

But how does that tie into the metric given here? Let's see. The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, perhaps this is conformally flat. Because it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²), which is the Euclidean metric. So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²), where r is sqrt(x² + y²).

Wait, what's the Gaussian curvature for a conformally flat metric? I think the formula is K = - (1/(2)) * [ ( (ln f)'' ) + ( (ln f)'^2 ) ] ), where f is the conformal factor. Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric. But maybe that's more complicated than I need.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the area. Let's compute the area using the metric. So the area A is the integral over the region where the metric is defined of dA. The region is x² + y² <4, because the denominator must be positive. So the area would be the integral over x and y with x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy, where r² = x² + y².

But integrating this might be tricky. Let me switch to polar coordinates because the integrand is radially symmetric. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. So the area becomes the integral from r=0 to r=2, and θ=0 to 2π, of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me factor out the constants: 32 * ∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr dθ.

The integral over θ is just 2π. So the area becomes 32 * 2π * ∫(r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Wait, let me compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So ( - du/2 ) = r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] = ∫ ( - du/2 ) / u = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2: u =4 -4=0. Wait, that's a problem. As r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So the integral becomes ∫ from 0 to 2 of r/(4 - r²) dr = [ ( -1/2 ln(4 - r²) ) ] evaluated from 0 to 2.

At r approaching 2: 4 - r² approaches 0, so ln approaches negative infinity. So the upper limit gives (-1/2)(-infty) which is +infty. The lower limit is at r=0: 4-0=4, so ln(4). So the integral is [ ( -1/2 ln(0^+) ) - ( -1/2 ln(4) ) ) ].

But ln(0^+) is negative infinity, so (-1/2)(-infty) is +infty. So the integral diverges to infinity. Hence, the area A is 32 * 2π * (infinite) = infinite.

Wait, but wait. The integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2. Let me compute it more carefully. Let me make substitution u=4 - r². Then du= -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

Then the integral becomes ∫ [r dr/(4 - r²)] = ∫ [ (-1/2) du / u ].

Limits: when r=0, u=4. When r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0.

So the integral is (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) du/u → (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

Which is (-1/2) [ ln 0 - ln4 ] = (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-1/2)(-infty) → which is +infty. So the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So since the area is infinite, the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options:
A) 0
B) 4π(x² + y²)
C) 4π(x² - y²)
D) +infty

So D is the correct answer.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. The task is to compute the area of the pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \). 

### Step 1: Understanding the Metric
The metric is conformally flat, meaning it is a multiple of the Euclidean metric \( dx^2 + dy^2 \), with the conformal factor \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The region of definition is \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) must remain positive.

### Step 2: Area Element
The area element \( dA \) for a 2D metric is given by \( \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy \). Since the metric is diagonal, \( \det(g) = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \), and thus \( \sqrt{\det(g)} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). Therefore, the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

### Step 3: Switching to Polar Coordinates
To simplify the integration, switch to polar coordinates where \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \). The area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

### Step 4: Evaluating the Integral
Factor out constants:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( -\frac{1}{2} du = r \, dr \). The limits of integration change as follows:
- When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \).
- When \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \).

The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| \), so:

\[
-\frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0^+)\right].
\]

As \( \ln(0^+) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Thus, the area \( A \) is infinite.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The area of the pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite due to the divergence of the integral over the region \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
