Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, right, when we talk about the speed of light in a medium, it's generally c divided by the index of refraction. So in the glass, the speed should be c/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the observed speed of the light?

I remember something about the principle of relativity. Oh wait, because the speed of light is constant in any inertial frame, right? But wait, that's in a vacuum. What about in a medium? Because the glass has an index of refraction, so the speed is c/n in the glass's rest frame. But when the glass is moving, does that change the speed as observed from the lab?

Wait, no. Because according to the theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But here, the light is in a medium. Does the medium's motion affect the light's speed in the lab frame?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. If the glass is moving, then in the lab frame, the speed of light inside the glass would depend on how the medium's motion interacts with the light's velocity in that medium.

Wait, maybe I should model it using velocity addition. So in the glass's rest frame, the light speed is v_light = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So what would the lab observer see?

Wait, velocity addition in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, that's when adding velocities. But in this case, the light's velocity in the glass is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the lab frame would see the light's velocity as u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. So substituting, u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n * v)/c² ) 

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c).

So u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let's compute this step by step. Denominator is 1 + (v (c/n)) / c^2 = 1 + v/(n c).

Wait, no, wait: The denominator is 1 + (u v)/(c²). So u is c/n. So it's 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + v/(n c).

So, putting it all together:

u' = (c/n + v) / [1 + v/(n c) ]

Let me factor out 1/(n c) from numerator and denominator. Wait, let's see. Let's write the numerator as (c + n v)/n. The denominator is [n c + v ]/(n c) ].

So,

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify, the n in the denominator cancels with n in numerator: so

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, wait, let's compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (c + n v) * c = c² + n v c

Denominator: n c + v = v + n c

So,

u' = (c² + n v c) / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator: 

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: (n c + v )

So, u' = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but c² is much larger than n v c, unless v is a significant fraction of c. Wait, but the problem says to take c=1, so let's substitute c=1.

Then, u' becomes:

[ 1 * (1 + n v) ] / (n * 1 + v )

Which is (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

So that's the expression for the speed.

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Option B is 1, which is c, but that's only in vacuum. Since it's in glass, and the glass is moving, the speed would be (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that's option A.

Wait, but I thought the speed of light in the medium should be c/n, but that's in the medium's rest frame. When the medium is moving, from the lab frame, the light would have a different speed. So according to this calculation, it's (1 +n v)/(n +v), which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity addition formula. Let me check the formula again. Oh wait, velocity addition in relativity is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame. Wait no, wait: the formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u is the velocity in the lab frame (rest frame), and u' is the velocity in the moving frame (the glass's frame).

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. So u' = c/n. So the formula is u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ] => same as before.

Wait, if I set c=1, then u' is 1/n. So,

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u = (1 +n v)/(n + v )

Which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is given by \( v_{\text{light}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass and \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum. Since the glass is moving at velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( u \) is the speed of light in the glass as observed in the laboratory frame. Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} v}{1}}
\]

Simplifying the denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify further:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \)**

Wait, but u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame, which is c/n. So substituting, u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n * v)/c² ) 

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c).

So u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Wait, let's compute this step by step. Denominator is 1 + (v (c/n)) / c^2 = 1 + v/(n c).

Wait, no, wait: The denominator is 1 + (u v)/(c²). So u is c/n. So it's 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² = 1 + v/(n c).

So, putting it all together:

u' = (c/n + v) / [1 + v/(n c) ]

Let me factor out 1/(n c) from numerator and denominator. Wait, let's see. Let's write the numerator as (c + n v)/n. The denominator is [n c + v ]/(n c) ].

So,

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is [ (c + n v ) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Simplify, the n in the denominator cancels with n in numerator: so

(c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, wait, let's compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (c + n v) * c = c² + n v c

Denominator: n c + v = v + n c

So,

u' = (c² + n v c) / (n c + v )

Factor numerator and denominator: 

Numerator: c (c + n v )

Denominator: (n c + v )

So, u' = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but c² is much larger than n v c, unless v is a significant fraction of c. Wait, but the problem says to take c=1, so let's substitute c=1.

Then, u' becomes:

[ 1 * (1 + n v) ] / (n * 1 + v )

Which is (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

So that's the expression for the speed.

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Option B is 1, which is c, but that's only in vacuum. Since it's in glass, and the glass is moving, the speed would be (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that's option A.

Wait, but I thought the speed of light in the medium should be c/n, but that's in the medium's rest frame. When the medium is moving, from the lab frame, the light would have a different speed. So according to this calculation, it's (1 +n v)/(n +v), which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the velocity addition formula. Let me check the formula again. Oh wait, velocity addition in relativity is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame. Wait no, wait: the formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u is the velocity in the lab frame (rest frame), and u' is the velocity in the moving frame (the glass's frame).

Wait, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. So u' = c/n. So the formula is u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ] => same as before.

Wait, if I set c=1, then u' is 1/n. So,

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u = (1 +n v)/(n + v )

Which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.
