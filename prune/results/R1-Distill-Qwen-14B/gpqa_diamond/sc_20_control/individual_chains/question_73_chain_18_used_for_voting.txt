Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between the astronauts and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so maybe I can figure out each part step by step.

First, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I think I need to compute the relative speed between them and the total energy, which probably involves their relativistic energies.

Wait, wait, to find the relative speed between them, I can't just subtract their speeds normally because they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. Oh right, I remember there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Let me recall: the formula is v = (u + v') / (1 + (u v') / c²), where u and v' are the speeds of the two objects in the same frame.

Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So, I think the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by something. Wait, no, that's just the classical approach, but since they're moving at a significant fraction of c, I need to apply the relativistic addition formula.

So, let me think: The relative velocity would be (u - v') / (1 - (u v') / c²). Wait, since astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, B's speed is u' = 0.5c. So the relative speed of B with respect to A would be (u' - 0) [Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the velocity of B relative to A].

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the relative velocity of B as seen from A. So, when you're in A's frame, how fast is B moving? Because both are moving in the same direction, but B is slower.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, they are moving in the same x-direction. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then the relative speed of B with respect to A would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that's ( -0.1c ) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/c²) → (-0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) → (-0.1c) / 0.7 → approximately -0.1428c. But speed can't be negative, so the magnitude would be 0.1428c. Wait, but the problem says 'relative speed', so maybe the direction doesn't matter, just the magnitude. So 0.14c, which is about 0.1428c.

Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's one part down.

Now the second part is the total energy of the system. So, I need to compute the relativistic energies for each astronaut and sum them.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) → sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower. So the correct total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

So putting it together: relative speed is ~0.14c and total energy ~5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C matches both.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds of \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). The relativistic formula for relative velocity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v'}{1 - \frac{u v'}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v' = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the relative motion is in the opposite direction, but the magnitude of the relative speed is \( 0.1428c \), which approximates to \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:
