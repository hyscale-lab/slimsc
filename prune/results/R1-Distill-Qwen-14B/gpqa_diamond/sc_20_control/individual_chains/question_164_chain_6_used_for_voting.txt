Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems and figuring out which one is more massive. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my binary star dynamics, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question says there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, I remember that the orbital period is the time it takes for the stars to orbit each other. So system_1 has a longer period than system_2.

Then, the spectroscopic observations give radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have variations of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Oh, right, radial velocity amplitude is the maximum speed at which the stars move towards or away from us. 

I think the radial velocity method is used to find the masses of the stars. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's less affected by the gravitational pull of the other star. So the mass is inversely proportional to the velocity. Like, if one star has a higher velocity, it's less massive.

But wait, how do I get from the velocities to the masses? Oh, right, Kepler's third law probably comes into play here. The formula I'm trying to recall is something like (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars, and P is the orbital period. But I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with binary stars, I think the more precise formula relates the velocities and the masses. I remember that in a binary system, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the masses. So v1/v2 = M2/M1. Because if one star is more massive, it doesn't move as much.

So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So the mass ratio M1/M2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2 in system_1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because if M1 is more massive, then v1 should be smaller. So in system_1, if v1 is 10 and v2 is 5, that means M1 is less than M2? No, wait. Because M1 is the more massive star, it would have a smaller velocity. Oh wait, no, wait. If M1 is larger, then M2 is smaller, so the smaller mass would have a higher velocity. So in system_1, v1 is larger than v2, so M1 is smaller than M2? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, maybe I should think of the mass function. There's this formula where the mass function is (v1² * P) / (2πG) = (M2³ sin³i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) . But without knowing the inclination angle i, which is usually not given, I'm not sure. Wait, but in eclipsing binaries, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is 1. So that simplifies things.

Alternatively, if both stars are in a binary, the mass ratio q = M2/M1. And from the velocities, the velocity ratio is v2/v1 = q. Because the more massive star moves slower. So q = v2 / v1.

Wait, let me get that straight. The less massive star is pulled more, so it has a higher velocity. So the star with higher velocity is the less massive one.

So in system_1: v1 = 10, v2 =5. So v2 is half of v1. So the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = v2/v1 = 0.5. So M2 is half of M1. So total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 0.5 M1 = 1.5 M1.

Similarly for system_2: v1 =15, v2=10. So q = v2/v1 = (10)/(15) = 2/3. So M2/M1 = 2/3, so M2 = (2/3) M1. So total mass is M1 + (2/3 M1) = (5/3) M1.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, which star is which? System_2 has 15 and 10 as their velocities. Let me think, which velocity is which. Oh, wait, in the problem statement, the first number is for the first star, but I'm not sure if in each system the first star is the more massive or not. Wait, the problem says "the two stars display sinusoidal variations of radial velocities with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s." So in system 1, one star has 10, the other 5. So star 1 has higher velocity, so it's less massive than star 2.

So mass ratio is M1/M2 = v2/v1. So for system_1: M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 = 0.5 M2. So the total mass for system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait but we need to find the mass of each system relative to each other. So the question is, what's the mass of system_1 compared to system_2.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me write down each system.

System_1:

- Period P1 = 2 years
- Velocity amplitudes: v1 =10, v2=5
- So v1 is star 1's velocity, which is larger, so star 1 is less massive than star 2.
- The mass ratio q = M2/M1 = v1/v2 =10/5=2. So M2 = 2 M1.
- So total mass of system_1: M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Wait wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mass function. Alternatively, using Kepler's third law in the form that relates velocity to mass.

Wait, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (2π G ) / (P c^3) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

But since i is 90 degrees (eclipsing binaries), sin i is 1.

But without knowing the actual masses, perhaps I can find the mass ratio.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that the mass ratio M1/M2 is equal to the inverse of the velocity ratio, because M1 * v1 = M2 * v2, due to conservation of momentum. Since the system is isolated, the center of mass is stationary, so M1 v1 = M2 v2.

Yes! That makes sense. Because in the center of mass frame, the momentum of each star must balance. So M1 v1 = M2 v2.

So for each system, the product M1 v1 = M2 v2.

So, the mass ratio M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So in system_1:

v1 =10, v2=5.

So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5.

So M2 is twice as massive as M1.

Total mass of system_1: M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

But wait, the problem is asking for the mass of the system, which is the sum. So system_1's mass is 3 M1, and system_2's mass is ... let's compute for system_2.

System_2:

v1=15, v2=10.

So M1/M2 = v2/v1 =10/15=2/3.

So M2 = (3/2) M1.

Total mass system_2: M1 + M2 = M1 + (3/2 M1) = (5/2) M1.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So which is which?

Wait, M1 in system_2 is the first star, with v1=15, so M1 is less massive than M2 in system_2 because it has a higher velocity.

So M1 (system_2) / M2 (system_2) = (v2 (system_2)) / (v1 (system_2)) = 10/15 = 2/3.

So M2 (system_2) = (3/2) M1 (system_2).

So the total mass is:

M1 + M2 = M1 + (3/2) M1 = (5/2) M1.

But wait, in system_1, the total mass is 3 M1, but what is M1 in that context? I think I'm getting confused with the notation.

Wait, let me clarify. Let me denote the variables more precisely.

In system_1:

Let M1_1 and M2_1 be the masses of the two stars.

M1_1 * v1_1 = M2_1 * v2_1.

v1_1 =10, v2_1=5.

So M1_1 / M2_1 = v2_1 / v1_1 =5/10=0.5.

So M1_1 = 0.5 M2_1.

Total mass system_1: M1_1 + M2_1 = 0.5 M2_1 + M2_1 = 1.5 M2_1.

In system_2:

M1_2 * v1_2 = M2_2 * v2_2.

v1_2=15, v2_2=10.

So M1_2 / M2_2 = v2_2 / v1_2 =10/15=2/3.

So M1_2 = (2/3) M2_2.

Total mass system_2: M1_2 + M2_2 = (2/3 M2_2) + M2_2 = (5/3) M2_2.

Now, to compare the total masses.

But wait, how do I relate the periods to the masses? Because the periods are different.

Kepler's third law for binary systems: ( (M1 + M2) ) * P² = (4 π² a³ ) / (G) )

But I don't know a (the separation), but perhaps I can relate the periods and the masses.

Another approach: from the velocities, I can relate the masses and the period.

We know that the velocity amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion and the period.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (2 π G )^(1/3) * ( (M2) sin i ) / ( ( (M1 + M2) )^(2/3) * (P/(2π)) )^(1/3) )

But since sin i is 1 for eclipsing binaries, it's easier.

Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2 π c³) )^(1/3) * ( M2 sin i ) / ( (M1 + M2) )^(1/3) )

But perhaps an easier way is to consider the following: the mass function for each star.

The mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P )/(2 π G )

But since the inclination is 90 degrees, the mass function equals (M2³ ) / ( (M1 + M2 )² )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since for each system, the product M1 v1 = M2 v2, and the period is known, perhaps I can find a way to relate the mass to the period and the velocity.

Wait, the orbital speed v is related to the period and the circumference. The orbital speed is v = 2 π a / P, where a is the radius of the orbit.

But each star orbits the common center of mass. So the separation between the two stars is a = a1 + a2, where a1 is the orbit of star 1 and a2 is the orbit of star 2.

From the center of mass condition: M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So a1 = (M2 / M1) a2.

And a = a1 + a2 = a2 ( M2 / M1 + 1 ) = a2 ( (M1 + M2)/ M1 )

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right path. Maybe I need to relate the velocities and the period to find the mass function.

Wait, each star's orbital velocity is v = 2 π a_i / P, where a_i is the radius of the orbit of star i.

So v1 = 2 π a1 / P, v2=2 π a2 / P.

And from the center of mass: M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So a2 = (M1 / M2) a1.

Substituting into v2:

v2 = 2 π ( (M1 / M2) a1 ) / P.

But v1 = 2 π a1 / P.

So v2 = (M1 / M2) v1.

Which brings us back to M1/M2 = v2 / v1, as before.

So that's consistent.

Now, Kepler's third law in terms of the masses and period is:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² ) )

But a is the sum of a1 and a2.

a = a1 + a2 = a1 + (M1 / M2) a1 = a1 ( 1 + M1 / M2 )

So a = a1 ( (M2 + M1 ) / M2 )

But a1 = (v1 P) / (2 π )

So substituting,

a = (v1 P) / (2 π ) * ( (M1 + M2) ) / M2 )

Now, plug this into Kepler's equation:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

Substituting a:

= (4 π² [ (v1 P)/(2 π) * ( (M1 + M2) ) / M2 ) ]^3 ) / ( G P^2 )

Simplify this expression. Let me compute the cube:

[ v1 P (M1 + M2) ) / (2 π M2) ]^3

So,

(4 π²) * [ v1^3 P^3 (M1 + M2)^3 ) / (8 π^3 M2^3) ) ] / ( G P^2 )

Multiply the numerators and denominators:

= 4 π² * v1^3 P^3 (M1 + M2)^3 / (8 π^3 M2^3 G P^2 )

Simplify:

4/8 = 1/2

π² / π^3 = 1/π

P^3 / P^2 = P.

So,

(1/2) ( v1^3 P (M1 + M2)^3 ) / ( π M2^3 G )

Set this equal to (M1 + M2):

(1/2) ( v1^3 P (M1 + M2)^3 ) / ( π M2^3 G ) ) = (M1 + M2 )

Divide both sides by (M1 + M2):

(1/2) ( v1^3 P (M1 + M2)^2 ) / ( π M2^3 G ) ) = 1

Multiply both sides by 2 π M2^3 G / (v1^3 P ):

(M1 + M2)^2 = (2 π M2^3 G ) / (v1^3 P )

Take square roots:

M1 + M2 = sqrt( 2 π M2^3 G / (v1^3 P ) )

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, let me think about the mass function. The mass function for a binary system is given by:

f(M) = ( (K^3 P) ) / (2 π G )

Where K is the velocity semi-amplitude, P is the period, and G is the gravitational constant.

But for a spectroscopic binary, we can only measure the velocity of one star, assuming the other is much more massive. But in an eclipsing binary, both velocities are often measured. So here, we have both K1 and K2.

Wait, but how does this help me find the total mass?

Alternatively, since each star's velocity is related to the other's mass, perhaps I can find the total mass in terms of the velocities and the period.

Wait, from the mass ratio, since M1/M2 = v2/v1, the total mass is M1 + M2 = M2 (v2/(v1) + 1 ) = M2 ( (v2 + v1) / v1 )

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for the mass function and apply it to both stars.

The mass function for the first star (measured in system_1) can be written as:

f(M1) = (K1^3 P )/(2 π G )

Which equals (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

Similarly, for the second star:

f(M2) = (K2^3 P )/(2 π G ) = (M1^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

But since i=90 degrees, sin i=1.

So,

K1^3 P / (2 π G ) = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

Similarly,

K2^3 P / (2 π G ) = M1^3 / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

Dividing the two equations:

(K1^3 P ) / (K2^3 P ) ) = ( M2^3 ) / ( M1^3 )

Simplify:

(K1/K2)^3 = ( M2 / M1 )^3

Which implies K1/K2 = M2/M1.

Which again brings us back to the same ratio.

So, perhaps using the mass function for each star, but I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, but since I have two masses and the period, perhaps I can write the mass function for each star and set them in terms of the total mass.

Let me denote M = M1 + M2.

Then, for system_1:

f(M1) = (10^3 * 2 )/(2 π G ) = M2^3 / M^2

f(M2) = (5^3 * 2 )/(2 π G ) = M1^3 / M^2

So,

(1000 * 2 )/(2 π G ) = M2^3 / M^2

Which simplifies to:

(1000 )/( π G ) = M2^3 / M^2 --> equation 1

Similarly,

(125 * 2 )/(2 π G ) = M1^3 / M^2

Which is:

(125)/( π G ) = M1^3 / M^2 --> equation 2

Divide equation 1 by equation 2:

(1000/(π G )) / (125/( π G )) ) = (M2^3 / M^2) / ( M1^3 / M^2 )

Simplify:

(1000 /125 ) = ( M2^3 / M1^3 )

8 = (M2/M1)^3

So, M2/M1 = 2.

Which is consistent with what we found earlier since M2 = 2 M1.

So, M = M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

Now, from equation 2:

125/( π G ) = ( M1^3 ) / ( (3 M1)^2 )

Simplify denominator: (9 M1² )

So,

125/(π G ) = M1^3 / (9 M1² )

= M1 /9

Multiply both sides by 9:

(125 *9 )/( π G ) = M1

So,

M1 = 1125 / ( π G )

Similarly, in system_2:

The velocities are 15 and 10.

So, for system_2, f(M1') = K1'^3 P'/(2 π G ) = (15^3 * 1 )/(2 π G ) = (3375 )/( 2 π G )

And f(M1') = M2'^3 / (M'^2 ), where M' is the total mass.

Similarly, f(M2') = (10^3 * 1 )/(2 π G ) = 1000/(2 π G ) = M1'^3 / (M'^2 )

So, the same approach:

From f(M1') / f(M2') = (3375/(2 π G )) ) / ( 1000/(2 π G )) ) = (M2'^3 / M'^2 ) / ( M1'^3 / M'^2 )

Simplify:

3375/1000 = (M2'/M1')^3

3.375 = (M2'/M1')^3

Cube root of 3.375 is 1.5.

So, M2' = 1.5 M1'

So, M' = M1' + M2' = M1' + 1.5 M1' = 2.5 M1'

Now, from f(M2'):

1000/(2 π G ) = M1'^3 / ( (2.5 M1')^2 )

Simplify denominator: 6.25 M1'^2

So,

1/(2 π G ) * 1000 = M1'^3 / (6.25 M1'^2 )

Multiply both sides by 6.25 M1'^2:

(1000 * 6.25 M1'^2 )/( 2 π G ) ) = M1'^3

Simplify:

(6250 M1'^2 )/( 2 π G ) ) = M1'^3

Divide both sides by M1'^2:

6250/(2 π G ) = M1'

So,

M1' = 3125/( π G )

Wait, so M1' is 3125/( π G )

Earlier, in system_1, M1 was 1125/( π G )

So the total mass of system_1 is:

M = 3 M1 = 3 * (1125/( π G )) )= 3375/( π G )

And the total mass of system_2 is:

M' = 2.5 M1' = 2.5 * (3125/( π G )) ) = 7812.5/( π G )

Wait, no, wait. Wait, M1' is the mass of the first star in system_2, which is less massive. The total mass is 2.5 M1'.

So, system_1's mass is 3375/( π G ), system_2's mass is 7812.5/( π G )

So the mass ratio is system_1's mass divided by system_2's mass.

So,

(3375/( π G )) / (7812.5/( π G )) ) = 3375 / 7812.5

Calculate that:

3375 ÷ 7812.5

Hmm, let me compute that.

3375 ÷ 7812.5 = (3375 * 16 ) / (7812.5 *16 ) = 54,000 / 125,000 = 0.432.

So approximately 0.432.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B is ~0.6. So 0.432 is closer to 0.4 than 0.6.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculations for the masses.

Wait, in system_1:

M1 = 1125/( π G )

M = 3 M1 = 3375/( π G )

In system_2:

M1' =3125/( π G )

M' =2.5 * 3125/( π G ) = 7812.5/( π G )

So the ratio is 3375/7812.5.

Let me compute 3375 ÷ 7812.5.

Well, 3375 is 3.375e3, 7812.5 is 7.8125e3.

3.375e3 / 7.8125e3 = 3.375 /7.8125.

3.375 ÷7.8125.

Well, 7.8125 * 0.43 = 3.36125, which is close to 3.375.

Wait, 0.43 *7.8125 = ?

7 *0.43=3.01; 0.8125 *0.43= approx 0.349. So total 3.01 +0.349=3.359.

Which is very close to 3.375.

So 0.43 *7.8125 =3.359, which is under 3.375 by 0.016.

So 0.43 *7.8125=3.359, so 3.375-3.359=0.016.

So 0.016 /7.8125 = approx 0.002 approx.

So 0.43 +0.002=0.432.

So the mass ratio is approximately 0.432, which is ~0.43.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: ~0.4.

But wait, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

So the correct answer would be approximately 0.43, which rounds to 0.4. So the answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationships between radial velocity amplitudes, mass ratios, and orbital periods.

### Key Observations:
1. **System_1**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( v_{1,1} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_{2,1} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - From the center of mass condition, \( M_{1,1} v_{1,1} = M_{2,1} v_{2,1} \), the mass ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{M_{1,1}}{M_{2,1}} = \frac{v_{2,1}}{v_{1,1}} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5
     \]
     Thus, \( M_{1,1} = 0.5 M_{2,1} \), and the total mass of system_1 is:
     \[
     M_{\text{total,1}} = M_{1,1} + M_{2,1} = 0.5 M_{2,1} + M_{2,1} = 1.5 M_{2,1}
     \]

2. **System_2**:
   - Orbital period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( v_{1,2} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_{2,2} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - From the center of mass condition, \( M_{1,2} v_{1,2} = M_{2,2} v_{2,2} \), the mass ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{M_{1,2}}{M_{2,2}} = \frac{v_{2,2}}{v_{1,2}} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
     \]
     Thus, \( M_{1,2} = \frac{2}{3} M_{2,2} \), and the total mass of system_2 is:
     \[
     M_{\text{total,2}} = M_{1,2} + M_{2,2} = \frac{2}{3} M_{2,2} + M_{2,2} = \frac{5}{3} M_{2,2}
     \]

3. **Mass Ratio**:
   To compare the total masses of the two systems, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{1.5 M_{2,1}}{\frac{5}{3} M_{2,2}}
   \]
   Using the relationship between the masses derived from the velocity amplitudes, the ratio simplifies to approximately \( 0.43 \).

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately **0.4 times more massive** than system_2. The closest option is **A) ~0.4**.

Answer: A
