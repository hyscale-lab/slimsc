Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The chemist has provided a mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me look at the mass spec data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight of the compound. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, I remember that molecular ions can sometimes be accompanied by isotopic peaks. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35, and its main isotope is 35Cl (about 75%) and 37Cl (about 25%). So, if the molecular formula includes a chlorine atom, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one at the lower mass (for 35Cl) and another 2 mass units higher (37Cl).

Wait, let me calculate. If the molecular weight is 156, but the other peak is at 158, that's a difference of 2. So that suggests the presence of a chlorine atom because each Cl contributes about 2 mass units when considering the isotopes. So the molecular formula probably includes one Cl.

So, the molecular weight is 156, with a Cl in the molecule. Let me check the options for their molecular weights.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's compute its formula. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. But if it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, then the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me compute the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Oh wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake with the calculation because sometimes in mass spec, the molecular ion is shown as the integer mass, so perhaps it's 156.5 but they're showing it as 156. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl, that's C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: C=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Sum is 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Again, similar to option A. So molecular weight is about 156.5, which when rounded is 156. So the molecular ion at 156 makes sense.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Chloroformate is OClCO2, but wait, phenyl chloroformate would be ClCO2C6H5. Let's compute: C=6*12 + 2 (from CO2) + Cl=35.5, O from CO2 is 2*16=32. So 6*12=72, 2 C is 24, O2 is 32, Cl 35.5. Total: 72+24=96, +32=128, +35.5=163.5. But the molecular ion is at 156, so this would not match. So option C is probably not the answer.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Its formula is same as B, C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight same as B, 156.5. So the molecular ion is at 156, and the other peak is 158, which would be the Cl isotope.

So in the mass spec, the molecular ion is 156 (100%) and 158 (32%). Since the Cl has about 25% abundance, the 32% for 158 is about that. So the presence of Cl is confirmed.

Next, looking at the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carbonyl (C=O) peaks are around 1700-1800 cm^-1. A strong sharp peak at 1720 suggests maybe a carboxylic acid (which has a strong O-H stretch as well) or an ester, but let's see.

Wait, a carboxylic acid has a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but wait, the IR here shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. Hmm, that's a very broad region. Also, the 1720 could be a carbonyl, like from a carboxylic acid (which has a strong absorption around 1700, but sometimes a bit higher). Alternatively, an ester has a carbonyl around 1720-1750. But wait, if this is a carboxylic acid, then the O-H would be a broad peak. Also, benzoic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1680-1720. So 1720 seems a bit high for a carboxylic acid, but maybe it's possible.

Another point: 3500-2700 is a wide range. Maybe it's an O-H stretch plus some other groups. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde's O-H, but aldehydes have a sharp peak around 2820 and 2720 for the C-H stretch, but the broad peak could be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenolic O-H. Phenols have broad O-H stretches around 3500-2800, which could fit.

Wait, looking at the options, options A, B, D are all chlorinated aromatic compounds with substituents. Let me think about each.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So structure is a benzaldehyde ring with a Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2. So structure is Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde at position 1 (since numbering starts with aldehyde as position 1). Wait no, wait, the numbering would be such that the aldehyde is at position 1. So substituents are at 2 and 3.

In this case, the IR would show a broad O-H for the phenolic group, and the aldehyde's C=O. Wait, but the aldehyde's C=O is usually around 1700, but could be a bit higher. Also, the aldehyde protons have sharp peaks in the NMR around 9-10 ppm. But let's look at the NMR.

The 1H NMR data:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H) - that's probably an aldehyde proton (but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. 11 is a bit high, but possible if in a conjugated system. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually around 10-12 ppm. The broad peak in IR could be the O-H of a carboxylic acid.

Wait, in the NMR, there's a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which is integrating to 1H. In a carboxylic acid, the OH proton is usually a broad peak, but in D2O, it might exchange and appear as a broad singlet. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the proton is around 9-10 ppm, but 11 is a bit higher. So maybe that's a carboxylic acid.

Then, the other signals are at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, you get two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H.

Wait, let me think about each option's structure.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The substituents are aldehyde (position 1?), Cl at position 3, OH at position 2. So the ring would have substituents in positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). Wait, that's a 1,2,3-substituted ring, which would complicate the NMR. So the aromatic protons would not be in a para arrangement. That might lead to more complex splitting, perhaps a triplet or more. So the NMR in the problem has two doublets, each 2H, which suggests a para-substituted ring with two substituents. Because in a para substitution, you have two equivalent protons on each adjacent carbon, giving two doublets.

So that points more towards a para-substituted ring. Let me look at options B and D.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and COOH at position 1. So the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4 (para to each other). The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. In such a case, the protons at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 are equivalent. So in the NMR, you would see two doublets: one from the protons ortho to the COOH and Cl, and the other from the meta protons. Alternatively, wait, benzoic acid has the COOH at position 1. So when Cl is at position 4, the ring is 1-(COOH) and 4-Cl.

Wait, the substituents are para to each other. So the aromatic protons would be at 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH and Cl, but wait, no, because COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. So the protons at 2 and 6 are meta to Cl and ortho to COOH. The protons at 3 and 5 are para to Cl and meta to COOH.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this mentally. Let's imagine the benzene ring with COOH at position 1 (top), and Cl at position 4 (bottom). Then the protons would be at positions 2 (top-right), 3 (bottom-right), 5 (bottom-left), and 6 (top-left). The protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The protons at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl.

In such a case, the coupling would lead to two sets of doublets. For example, the protons next to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and as a result, appear downfield. Similarly, the protons next to Cl (3 and 5) would also be deshielded. So each of these protons would couple with their adjacent protons, leading to doublets.

So in the NMR, we would see two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that matches the data: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So that fits.

Additionally, the 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which would be the COOH proton. But wait, in the case of benzoic acid derivatives, the COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but in DMSO or other solvents, it can be a singlet. Also, in some cases, with deuterated solvents, it might appear as a sharp peak. Alternatively, if the solution is in CDCl3, the COOH proton could be broad, but in the question, it's a singlet. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the other options. Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 2. That would make the ring have ortho substituents. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. Protons 3 and 5 would be adjacent to Cl and COOH. Protons 4 and 6 would be meta to both. Wait, but if substituents are at 1 and 2, then the ring's protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. But that's a bit more complex; the coupling could lead to more splitting than just two doublets. It might not result in two doublets each of 2H. So perhaps option D is less likely.

Option A's NMR: If it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, then the structure would have substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the ring would have substituents in adjacent positions, leading to more complex splitting. The aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6. But I think this would result in more than two doublets, perhaps a triplet or more, but the NMR shows only two doublets. So maybe option A is not the right fit.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The structure would be ClCO-O-C6H5. Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the substituents on the ring would be OCOCl. Wait, no, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the ring is attached to the oxygen of the carbonyl, which is connected to Cl and another O. The ring would have an OCOCl group attached. So the substituent is at one position, making the ring monosubstituted. The aromatic protons would be in ortho, meta, and para positions relative to the substituent. For a monosubstituted benzene, you get three sets of signals: ortho, meta, para. But if the substituent is deactivating and meta-directing, the ring's protons would split into a couple of peaks. However, in the NMR, we have two doublets, each 2H, which suggests para substitution with two substituents. So perhaps option C isn't the right choice.

So, moving back. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl from a carboxylic acid. The broad peak from 3500-2700 could be the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. The 1H NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm, which would be the COOH proton. The other doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents.

Looking at the options, options B and D are benzoic acid derivatives. Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is para, while D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid (ortho).

In the case of 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. That would lead to two sets of aromatic protons: the two ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) and the two ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Each of these sets would be equivalent and couple with each other, leading to two doublets in the NMR. So positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Positions 3 and 5 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH.

In terms of chemical shifts, the protons ortho to COOH are usually more deshielded and appear downfield. So their δ would be higher. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, so the protons ortho to Cl would be deshielded as well, but perhaps less so than those next to COOH.

So in the NMR, the two doublets would correspond to these two sets. The higher chemical shift (8.02 ppm) would be the protons ortho to COOH, and the lower (7.72 ppm) would be the protons ortho to Cl.

That fits the data. So the protons at 8.02 are the two H ortho to COOH, and 7.72 are the two H ortho to Cl.

Putting it all together, the molecular ion is 156, with a Cl. The IR shows a strong carbonyl and O-H. The NMR shows a carboxylic acid proton as a singlet and two doublets indicating a para-substituted ring with COOH and Cl.

So the correct option is B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** suggest a molecular weight of approximately 156 and the presence of a chlorine atom (due to the 2 mass unit difference corresponding to the isotopes of chlorine, ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl). The IR spectrum shows a **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes a **singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H)**, likely corresponding to a carboxylic acid proton, and two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)**, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains a benzaldehyde ring with a chlorine atom at position 3 and a hydroxyl group at position 2. The IR spectrum could explain the O-H stretch and carbonyl absorption, but the NMR data does not match. The aromatic protons in this structure would not produce two doublets due to the complex splitting caused by the adjacent substituents. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound features a benzene ring with a chlorine atom at position 4 and a carboxylic acid group at position 1 (para-substitution). The IR spectrum matches, as the broad O-H stretch corresponds to the carboxylic acid, and the carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid. The NMR data also aligns: the singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons ortho to the carboxylic acid and chlorine, respectively. This option fits all the spectral data.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This compound contains a benzene ring attached to a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-). The molecular weight of this compound is approximately 163.5, which does not match the molecular ion peak at 156. Additionally, the NMR data does not support this structure, as it would not produce two doublets for the aromatic protons. This option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound features a benzene ring with a chlorine atom at position 2 and a carboxylic acid group at position 1 (ortho-substitution). The aromatic protons in this structure would produce more complex splitting patterns than the two doublets observed in the NMR spectrum. Thus, this option is unlikely.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular weight, IR peaks, and NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern of this compound explains the two doublets in the NMR spectrum, and the presence of a carboxylic acid group accounts for the IR and NMR features.

**Answer: B**
