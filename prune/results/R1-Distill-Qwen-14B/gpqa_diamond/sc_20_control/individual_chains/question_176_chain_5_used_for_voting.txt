Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about measuring two observables P and Q in sequence and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes. 

So, the system's state at time t is a column vector with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a three-dimensional vector. So it's in a three-level system, maybe like a qutrit or something. 

The operators for P and Q are given as 3x3 matrices. Let's see what they look like. 

First, the operator P's matrix. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). Hmm, that looks symmetric. I'm guessing P might have some eigenvalues and eigenvectors we can find. 

Then, the operator Q has a matrix where the first row is (1, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0, 0, -1). Oh, that's a diagonal matrix. So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, and -1. So measuring Q would give these values. 

The question is about measuring P first and then Q, or wait, wait. Wait, the question says measuring Q just after P. So the order is first measure P, then measure Q. But wait, the probability is of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses, and then measuring Q gives -1. 

Wait, but wait another thing. Or is the order that P is measured first, and then Q? Because the wording says 'if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P'. So first P, then Q.

But the probabilities might be dependent on the state after each measurement. So I think the way to approach this is: 

1. Find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P. Because when you measure P, the system collapses into an eigenvector of P. 

2. For each possible eigenvalue of P, calculate the probability of collapsing into that eigenvector. 

3. If the measurement of P gives 0, then the state becomes the corresponding eigenvector. 

4. Then, given that state, calculate the probability of measuring Q and getting -1. 

So, first step: find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Matrix P is:

[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]

Hmm, let's calculate the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix P-λI is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. 

The determinant would be:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, let me compute it step by step. Maybe expanding along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * something.

So:

-λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] + 0.

Simplify:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2)(λ/√2 )

Which becomes:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) ) + (λ (1/2) )

Wait, because (1/√2)*(λ/√2) = λ/(2).

So, the expression becomes:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2 ) = -λ^3 + λ.

So, setting the determinant to zero:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ( -λ² +1 ) = 0 → λ ( 1 - λ² ) = 0 → λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, but wait. Let's check that. So the equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ (λ² -1 ) = 0? Because:

-λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ (-λ² +1 ) =0 → λ (1 - λ² )=0 → so yes, eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

Hmm, okay. So P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. Which suggests that when you measure P, you can get 0, 1, or -1 with certain probabilities.

Now, the initial state is the column vector (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute the normalization first. The state vector's squared magnitude should sum to 1 if it's a valid quantum state. Wait, but (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the state is not normalized. So I think the actual state is the vector divided by sqrt(6). Because in quantum mechanics, the state is a unit vector.

So the state vector ψ is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Okay, now, for each eigenvalue of P, we need to find the corresponding eigenvectors and then compute the probability that the state collapses into that eigenvector upon measuring P.

Wait, but let's think: when measuring P, the outcome is one of its eigenvalues (0,1,-1). The probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to that eigenvalue in the state ψ.

But first, let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue of P.

Starting with eigenvalue λ=0.

We have (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the equations are:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0

(1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v1 = -v3

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 =0, which is already known.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is of the form (v1, 0, -v1) → which can be written as v1 (1, 0, -1). So any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1) is the eigenvector for λ=0.

So, the eigenvector can be written as (1,0,-1) up to normalization.

But let me confirm. Let me write the equations again:

Equation 1: v2 =0.

Equation 2: (1/√2)(v1 + v3) =0 → v1 +v3=0 → v3= -v1.

Equation 3: same as equation 1, which is v2=0.

So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). So the normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ), because 1² + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2, so sqrt(2) in denominator.

Wait, sqrt( (1)^2 +0 + (-1)^2 ) = sqrt(2). So yes, normalize by 1/sqrt(2).

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Next, let's find the eigenvectors for λ=1.

So (P - I) v =0.

Matrix P-I is:

[ -1, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -1, 1/√2 ]

[0, 1/√2, -1 ]

So equations:

- v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 → v1 = (1/√2) v2.

(1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0.

v2 - v3 =0 → v2 =v3.

So from first equation: v1 = (1/√2) v2.

From third equation: v3 = v2.

Substituting into the second equation:

(1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0.

v1 = (1/√2) v2, v3 =v2.

So:

(1/√2)( (1/√2) v2 ) - v2 + (1/√2) v2 =0.

Compute each term:

(1/√2)(1/√2) v2 = (1/2) v2.

So the equation becomes:

(1/2) v2 - v2 + (1/√2) v2 =0.

Combine terms:

[ (1/2) -1 + (1/√2) ] v2 =0.

So ( -1/2 + 1/√2 ) v2 =0.

Hmm, so to find non-trivial solutions, the coefficient must be zero. So, -1/2 + 1/√2 =0 → 1/√2 =1/2 → √2=2 → which is not true.

Wait, that's a problem. It implies that there's no solution unless v2=0.

But that would lead to v1=0 and v3=0, which is trivial. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should do this more carefully.

Let me write the equations again.

Equation 1: -v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 → v1 = (1/√2) v2.

Equation 2: (1/√2) v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0.

Equation 3: v2 - v3 =0 → v3 =v2.

Substitute v1 and v3 into equation 2.

Equation 2 becomes:

(1/√2)( (1/√2) v2 ) - v2 + (1/√2)(v2) =0.

Calculating each term:

(1/√2)(1/√2) v2 = (1/2) v2.

So,

(1/2 v2 ) - v2 + (1/√2) v2 =0.

Combine the terms:

( (1/2) -1 + (1/√2) ) v2 =0.

Compute the coefficients:

1/2 -1 = -1/2. So,

(-1/2 + 1/√2) v2 =0.

Hmm, this is non-zero unless v2=0.

Wait, but that would mean that the only solution is v2=0, leading to v1=0 and v3=0, which is trivial. That can't be correct because P should have an eigenvector for λ=1.

Ah, maybe I made a mistake in the matrix.

Wait, let me recheck the matrix for P - I.

P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]

[0, 1/√2, 0 ]

Subtracting I (which is identity matrix with 1s on diagonal), so P-I is:

[ -1, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -1, 1/√2 ]

[ 0, 1/√2, -1 ]

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps another approach. Let me set v2 to a parameter, say v2 = a.

Then from equation 1, v1 = (1/√2) a.

From equation 3, v3 = a.

Substituting into equation 2:

(1/√2) * v1 - v2 + (1/√2) v3 = (1/√2)( (1/√2) a ) - a + (1/√2)(a ) = (1/2) a -a + (a/√2) = [ (1/2 -1 ) a ] + (a/√2 ) → (-1/2 a) + (a/√2 )

So, (-1/2 + 1/√2 ) a =0.

Which requires either a=0 or (-1/2 + 1/√2 )=0.

But 1/√2 is approximately 0.707, so 1/2 is 0.5. So (-0.5 +0.707 )=0.207, which is not zero. So the only solution is a=0, which gives v1=0, v2=0, v3=0. That can't be right because it's a trivial solution. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should check the matrix again. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvector is not unique. But for a 3x3 matrix, each eigenvalue should have a corresponding eigenvector, unless the matrix is defective, which is unlikely here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in forming the equations. Let me try a different approach. Let me assume that the eigenvector is along a certain direction.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try to find the eigenvector by other means. Let me think: for λ=1, P acting on the eigenvector v should give v multiplied by 1.

So P v = v.

So writing the components:

(1/√2) v2 = v1 → equation 1.

(1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = v2 → equation 2.

(1/√2) v2 = v3 → equation 3.

So from equation 1: v1 = (1/√2) v2.

From equation 3: v3 = (1/√2) v2.

Substitute into equation 2:

(1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = v2.

Substituting v1 and v3:

(1/√2)( (1/√2) v2 ) + (1/√2)( (1/√2) v2 ) = v2.

Each term is (1/2) v2, so adding them gives (1/2 + 1/2) v2 = v2 → v2 = v2. Which is always true. So the system is consistent, and the eigenvectors are determined by v2 being a free parameter.

So the eigenvectors for λ=1 are of the form:

v1 = (1/√2) v2,

v3 = (1/√2) v2.

So let me choose v2 = sqrt(2) to make it simple. Then,

v1 = (1/√2) * sqrt(2) ) = 1.

v2 = sqrt(2).

v3 = (1/√2) * sqrt(2) )= 1.

So the eigenvector is (1, sqrt(2), 1). But we need to check if this is normalized.

Compute the squared magnitude: 1^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 +1^2 = 1 +2 +1=4. So the norm is 2. Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2 ).

Wait, but wait another approach: perhaps the eigenvector is (1, sqrt(2), 1), as I have above. Let me verify.

Alternatively, perhaps a more symmetric approach. Let me think, perhaps the eigenvector for λ=1 is (1, something,1). Hmm, but this approach is getting a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the initial method, even if it's a bit involved. 

But perhaps I should proceed. So, the eigenvectors for λ=1 are of the form ( (1/√2) a, a, (1/√2) a ), where a is any scalar.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)) divided by the norm.

Wait, let's compute the norm:

(1/sqrt(2))^2 + (1)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 = (1/2) +1 + (1/2) = 2. So the norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) )) → which is (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2).

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly. The vector is (1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)). The norm squared is (1/2) + 1 + (1/2) = 2. So the norm is sqrt(2), so each component is divided by sqrt(2).

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ). Wait, because 1/sqrt(2) divided by sqrt(2) is 1/(2). So yeah.

Wait, no. Wait, the vector is (1/sqrt(2), 1, 1/sqrt(2)). To normalize, we divide each component by sqrt(2), which is the norm.

So the normalized eigenvector becomes (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)), 1/sqrt(2), 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) ) → which is (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2).

Wait, but 1/sqrt(2) divided by sqrt(2) is 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)) = 1/2.

So the normalized eigenvector is (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ).

Hmm, but perhaps I should proceed with this.

Now, the eigenvector for λ=1 is (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ), and for λ=-1, perhaps a similar approach would work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of eigenvalues for P is equal to the trace of the matrix. The trace of P is 0 +0 +0 =0. The sum of the eigenvalues (0 +1 + (-1)) is 0, which matches. So that's correct.

Now, moving on to the eigenvectors for λ=-1.

So (P - (-1)I ) v =0 → (P +I) v=0.

So the matrix is:

[1, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, 1, 1/√2 ]

[0, 1/√2,1 ]

So the equations are:

v1 + (1/√2) v2 =0 → equation 1.

(1/√2) v1 + v2 + (1/√2) v3 =0 → equation 2.

(1/√2) v2 + v3 =0 → equation 3.

From equation 1: v1 = -(1/√2) v2.

From equation 3: v3 = -(1/√2) v2.

Substituting into equation 2:

(1/√2)( - (1/√2) v2 ) + v2 + (1/√2)( - (1/√2) v2 ) =0.

Compute each term:

(1/√2)( -1/√2 v2 ) = - (1/2) v2.

Similarly, the third term is (1/√2)( -1/√2 v2 ) = - (1/2) v2.

So equation 2 becomes:

- (1/2) v2 + v2 - (1/2) v2 =0.

Combine terms:

[ (-1/2 -1/2 ) v2 ] + v2 = [ (-v2) ] +v2 = 0 → 0=0.

So equation 2 is always satisfied. Thus, the eigenvectors are determined by v2 as a parameter.

So v1 = -(1/√2) v2,

v3 = -(1/√2) v2,

so the eigenvector can be written as ( -(1/√2) v2, v2, -(1/√2) v2 ).

Let me set v2 =1 for simplicity, then the eigenvector is ( -1/√2, 1, -1/√2 ).

Normalizing this vector: the squared magnitude is ( (1/2) ) +1 + (1/2) )= (1/2 +1 +1/2 )= 2. So the norm is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/(√2 * sqrt(2)), 1/sqrt(2), -1/(√2 * sqrt(2)) ) → which simplifies to (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ).

Wait, because 1/(√2 * sqrt(2)) =1/(2). So yeah, the normalized eigenvector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ).

Hmm. So now, the three eigenvectors for P are:

λ=0: (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

λ=1: (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ).

λ=-1: ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ).

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the eigenvectors for λ=1 and λ=-1.

Wait, for λ=1, the eigenvector I found was (1/2, 1/sqrt(2), 1/2 ). For λ=-1, the eigenvector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ). Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

Now, the initial state is ψ = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

We can write ψ as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of P.

So ψ = a |0> + b |1> + c |-1>,

where |0>, |1>, |-1> are the normalized eigenvectors for P with eigenvalues 0,1,-1.

We need to find the coefficients a, b, c. Then, the probability of measuring 0 is |a|^2.

Once we have that, perhaps we can find the state after measuring P=0, which would be |0>, and then calculate the probability of measuring Q=-1.

So first, let's compute a, b, c.

Wait, the eigenvectors are orthonormal. So the coefficients can be found by taking the inner product of ψ with each eigenvector.

So a = <0 | ψ >.

Similarly for b and c.

So, compute a.

Eigenvector |0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So a = [1/sqrt(2)]*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + [ -1/sqrt(2) ]*(1/sqrt(6)).

Compute each term:

(1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/( sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) )= (-1)/(sqrt(12))= (-1)/(2 * sqrt(3)).

Similarly, the third term is (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) = (-1)/(sqrt(12))= (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So a = [ (-1)/(2√3) ) ] + [ (-1)/(2√3) ) ] = (-2)/(2√3 )= -1/√3.

So |a|^2 is (1/√3)^2 =1/3.

Wait, but wait, let me check again.

Wait, the eigenvectors should be orthonormal, so the inner product should be calculated correctly.

Wait, |0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

ψ is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ).

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(6)).

Which is:

[ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= (-1/(sqrt(12))) + (-1/(sqrt(12)) )

= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = (-1)/sqrt(3).

So a = (-1)/sqrt(3).

Thus, |a|^2 is 1/3. So the probability of measuring 0 for P is 1/3.

So if we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to |0>.

Now, we need to compute the probability of measuring Q=-1 in this new state.

But wait, let's see. The state after P is measured as 0 is |0>, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, operator Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the eigenstates of Q are the standard basis vectors:

For Q=1: |1> = (1,0,0).

For Q=0: |0> = (0,1,0).

For Q=-1: |-1> = (0,0,1).

Wait, but wait, the eigenstates of Q are the standard basis vectors, so when you measure Q, you get 1, 0, or -1.

So to find the probability that Q=-1, we need to compute the inner product between |0> (the state after P=0) and the eigenvector of Q corresponding to -1, which is (0,0,1).

Wait, no: because the state after measuring P=0 is |0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So, the inner product with the eigenvector of Q for -1 is:

(1/sqrt(2)) * 0 + 0 *0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) *1 = -1/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/2).

Wait, but that would mean the probability is 1/2. But let me think again.

Wait, the state after P=0 is |0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The eigenvectors of Q are the standard basis vectors.

So for Q=-1, the eigenvector is (0,0,1).

The inner product between |0> and (0,0,1) is the third component of |0>, which is (-1/sqrt(2)).

So the amplitude is (-1/sqrt(2)).

The probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/2.

Now, the overall probability of first measuring P=0 and then Q=-1 is the product of the probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

So the answer should be D) 1/6.

The problem involves a quantum system with a given state vector and two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to calculate the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in sequence.

### Key Steps:

1. **System State and Normalization**:  
   The initial state vector is given as \((-1, 2, 1)\). Since the squared magnitude of the vector is \( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6 \), the normalized state is:  
   \[
   \psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)**:  
   The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:  
   \[
   P = \begin{pmatrix} 
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
   0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   Solving for the eigenvalues of \( P \), we find \(\lambda_P = 0, 1, -1\). The corresponding normalized eigenvectors are:  
   - For \(\lambda_P = 0\):  
     \[
     |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]  
   - For \(\lambda_P = 1\):  
     \[
     |1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]  
   - For \(\lambda_P = -1\):  
     \[
     |-1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ \sqrt{2} \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]

3. **Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)**:  
   The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the squared amplitude of the eigenvector \( |0\rangle \) in the state \( \psi \). The inner product is:  
   \[
   \langle 0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
   \]  
   The probability is:  
   \[
   P(P=0) = |\langle 0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]

4. **State After Measuring \( P = 0 \)**:  
   If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the system collapses to the eigenvector \( |0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \).

5. **Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \)**:  
   The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:  
   \[
   Q = \begin{pmatrix} 
   1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & -1 
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]  
   The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors:  
   - For \( Q = -1 \):  
     \[
     |-1\rangle_Q = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
     \]  
   The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the squared amplitude of \( |-1\rangle_Q \) in the state \( |0\rangle \). The inner product is:  
   \[
   \langle -1 | 0 \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]  
   The probability is:  
   \[
   P(Q=-1) = |\langle -1 | 0 \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]

6. **Overall Probability**:  
   The overall probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:  
   \[
   P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is **1/6**.  
Answer: D
