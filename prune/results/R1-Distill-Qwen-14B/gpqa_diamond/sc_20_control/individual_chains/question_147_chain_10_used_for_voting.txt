Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me read it again. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, p is a proton and p̄ is an antiproton. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with various velocities.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy isn't that high. Oh wait, but in annihilation processes, the mass is converted into other particles. So the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. Let me think about their rest masses. The proton and antiproton have the same mass, right? Because the antiproton is just the opposite in charge and spin.

The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². But wait, the problem states that m_A c² is 300 MeV. So each A particle has a mass of 300 MeV. Since two A+ and two A- are produced, that's four A particles in total.

Wait, but in the reaction, the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. So let's calculate the rest mass energy on each side. On the left, it's a proton and antiproton, so their combined rest mass is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. On the right, we have four A particles each of 300 MeV, so 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Wait, that's a big difference. So the total rest mass on the right is less than the left. That can't be right because in annihilation, conservation of energy and mass must hold. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, but wait. The antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial kinetic energy must be considered. So maybe the initial system's total energy is the sum of the rest energy of the proton and the total energy of the antiproton, which includes its kinetic energy because it's moving.

Wait, but the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So perhaps the initial total energy is approximately 2 * m_p c², but maybe a little more because the antiproton is moving. Alternatively, maybe it's considering that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe its speed is low, so its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass. Therefore, the initial energy is just the rest energy of both particles plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. But since it's moving slowly, K is much smaller than m_p c², so maybe the total energy is approximately 2 * 938 MeV plus a small amount. Hmm, but that would affect the final particles' energies.

But the problem says the mass of A is 300 MeV, so each A has less mass than the proton. So in the annihilation process, the initial rest mass is higher than the final. Wait, but that's a problem because in annihilation, the total energy must be conserved. So perhaps the initial energy is higher than the rest mass of the products because the antiproton is moving.

Wait, maybe the initial system's total energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy (which is rest mass plus kinetic). So E_initial = m_p c² + (m_p c² + K_p), where K_p is the kinetic energy of the antiproton.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so K_p << m_p c². So E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c². But the products are four A particles, each of mass 300 MeV, so their combined rest mass is 1200 MeV. So 2 * 938 is about 1876 MeV, which is larger than 1200. So the initial energy is 1876 MeV, and the products have a rest energy of 1200, so the remaining 676 MeV must go into their kinetic energy.

But wait, in reality, when particles annihilate, they produce other particles. So perhaps the initial rest mass (proton and antiproton) plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton equals the total energy of the products, which is their rest mass plus their kinetic energy.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving, but the problem doesn't specify the direction, perhaps we can assume that it's moving along a certain axis, and the products are moving in such a way that momentum is conserved.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the velocity of particle A. So perhaps each A particle has the same velocity, or maybe they are all moving together. Alternatively, maybe all the A particles are moving in the same direction with the same velocity, so we can model this as a four-body system moving with a certain velocity.

Wait, but considering four particles moving in the same direction might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the system is symmetric, so the A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions but with the same speed, but that might not necessarily be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps after the annihilation, the products are moving with some velocity v, and we can apply conservation of energy and momentum to find v.

Wait, the initial system: the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p (slow, so v_p << c). The total initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton, which is gamma_p m_p v_p, where gamma_p is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton.

The total energy initial is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

Wait, but the proton is at rest, so its energy is just m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma_p m_p c². So E_initial = (1 + gamma_p) m_p c².

The final system has four A particles, each of mass m_A = 300 MeV/c².

Assuming that all four A particles are moving with the same velocity v in the same direction, which might not be the case, but perhaps it's a simplifying assumption.

Wait, but that might not hold. Alternatively, perhaps the two A+ and two A- are moving symmetrically, so that their momenta cancel out. But that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. So the total momentum of the final system would be the sum of the momenta of all four A particles.

Wait, but the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton, which is moving along a certain direction. So the final total momentum must equal that.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can make some approximations. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p ≈ 0, so gamma_p ≈ 1. Therefore, E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

The rest mass of the products is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV, which is less than 1876 MeV, so the products have kinetic energy.

Wait, but let's consider the center of momentum frame. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the problem in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly.

Wait, in the lab frame, the initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton, which is gamma_p m_p v_p. Since v_p is small, gamma_p is approximately 1 + (v_p²)/(2 c²), so the momentum is roughly m_p v_p.

The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the four A particles. If all four are moving in the same direction, their momenta would add. But perhaps the system is symmetric, so maybe two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite. But in that case, their momenta might cancel each other in pairs, leading to a net zero. But that can't be because the initial momentum is non-zero.

Hmm, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction, so their momenta add up. Alternatively, perhaps two are moving forward and two backward, but each with the same speed. Wait, but that would result in a net momentum of zero if they're symmetrically placed, which can't be the case here because the initial system has momentum from the antiproton.

Wait, but this is getting a bit too complicated. Maybe I should think about energy and momentum conservation.

Let me denote the velocity of each A particle as v. Since there are four of them, their momentum would be 4 gamma_A m_A v, assuming they're all moving in the same direction. But that's a big assumption, but perhaps it's valid for simplifying the problem, especially since the antiproton is moving slowly, so the products might all move in the same direction.

So the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p. Since v_p is small, gamma_p ≈ 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

The final momentum is p_final = 4 gamma_A m_A v.

So, from momentum conservation: m_p v_p = 4 gamma_A m_A v.

Now, for energy conservation. The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c² = (1 + gamma_p) m_p c².

The final energy is E_final = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Since v_p is small, gamma_p ≈ 1, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

Setting E_initial = E_final: 2 m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Dividing both sides by c²: 2 m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Simplify: gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A).

Wait, m_p is about 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So plug in the numbers: gamma_A = (938) / (2 * 300) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.

So gamma_A ≈ 1.5633.

We know that gamma = 1/√(1 - (v²/c²)), so:

gamma^2 = 1/(1 - v²/c²) → 1/gamma² = 1 - v²/c² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma².

Compute 1/gamma²: 1/(1.5633)^2 ≈ 1/(2.443) ≈ 0.409.

So v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.409 = 0.591 → v/c ≈ sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.769. So v ≈ 0.769 c.

But wait, the options given are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

So 0.769 is close to option A, 0.77c. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but wait a minute, I made an approximation by assuming that all four A particles are moving in the same direction. But perhaps that's not the case. Maybe the A particles are moving in different directions, which would affect the momentum calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in pairs, leading to a different calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the total momentum is carried by the four A particles, but their velocities might be different, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up, but perhaps I made a mistake in the energy and momentum equations.

Wait, another thought: When the antiproton is moving slowly, the initial kinetic energy is small, so maybe the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c². The products' rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200, which is less than 1876, so they must have kinetic energy. But in the calculation, I took the final energy as 4 gamma_A m_A c². So:

E_initial = 2 m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Wait, that's because gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for each A, which depends on their speed. So I solved for gamma_A as (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) ) = m_p/(2 m_A) ), which is 938/(2*300) = 938/600 ≈ 1.5633.

But wait, wait, 2 m_p is 1876 MeV, and 4 m_A is 1200 MeV. So 1876 ≈ 4 gamma_A * 300.

So 4 gamma_A * 300 = 1876 → gamma_A = 1876/(4*300) = 1876/(1200) ≈ 1.5633.

So that's correct.

Then, v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A^2)).

Compute gamma_A^2: (1.5633)^2 ≈ 2.443.

1/gamma_A^2 ≈ 0.409.

So 1 - 0.409 = 0.591 → sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.769. So 0.769 c, which is about 0.77c. So the answer is option A.

But wait, I think I might have made an error in the initial momentum calculation. Because if all four A particles are moving in the same direction, their momentum would add, but in reality, perhaps only two are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, and the others in the opposite direction. Or perhaps the problem is symmetric, leading to a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, leading to the A particles moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, so the momentum conservation applies as I did.

Alternatively, perhaps each A particle has the same velocity, and the total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v.

But maybe I should re-examine the initial setup. Another approach: consider the problem in the center of mass frame. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the center of mass frame is close to the proton's rest frame.

Wait, but perhaps that complicates things further. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using non-relativistic considerations, but given that the velocities are a significant fraction of c, that may not be the case.

Wait, another way to think about it: since the antiproton is moving at low speed, its kinetic energy is small. So the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c². The rest mass of the products is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV, which is less than 1876 MeV. Therefore, the products have kinetic energy.

But each A particle would have some kinetic energy and some rest mass energy. So their total energy per particle is gamma_A m_A c².

So 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = m_p/(2 m_A) → 938 / (600) ≈ 1.5633.

Same as before. So v is approximately 0.77c, which matches option A.

Wait, but why isn't any of the other options matching? The options given are A) 0.77, which is our answer, and others higher. So the correct answer should be A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \), where the antiproton is moving slowly. The rest mass energy of the proton (and antiproton) is \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \), and the rest mass energy of each \( A \) particle is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to find the velocity of the \( A \)-particles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is at rest, so its energy is \( m_p c^2 \).
   - The antiproton is moving slowly, so its total energy is approximately \( \gamma_p m_p c^2 \), where \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \) (since \( v_p \ll c \)).
   - Total initial energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma_p m_p c^2 \approx 2 m_p c^2 = 2(938) \, \text{MeV} = 1876 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]
   - Total initial momentum:  
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_p m_p v_p \approx m_p v_p.
     \]

2. **Final Energy and Momentum**:
   - Four \( A \)-particles are produced, each with rest mass \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - Total rest energy of the final system:  
     \[
     E_{\text{rest, final}} = 4 m_A c^2 = 4(300) \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]
   - The remaining energy is kinetic energy, so the total energy of the final system is:  
     \[
     E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2,
     \]
     where \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor for the \( A \)-particles.

3. **Energy Conservation**:
   - Equating initial and final energies:  
     \[
     2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
     \]
   - Simplify to solve for \( \gamma_A \):  
     \[
     \gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A} = \frac{938}{2(300)} \approx 1.5633.
     \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma_A \) to Velocity**:
   - Using the relation \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), solve for \( v \):  
     \[
     \gamma_A^2 = \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} \implies 1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}.
     \]
   - Compute \( \gamma_A^2 \):  
     \[
     \gamma_A^2 \approx (1.5633)^2 \approx 2.443.
     \]
   - Then:  
     \[
     v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{2.443} \approx 1 - 0.409 = 0.591.
     \]
   - Finally:  
     \[
     v/c = \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.769 \implies v \approx 0.769c.
     \]

5. **Matching the Options**:
   - The calculated velocity \( v \approx 0.769c \) is closest to option **A) 0.77c**.

### Conclusion:
The velocity of the \( A \)-particles is approximately \( 0.77c \).
