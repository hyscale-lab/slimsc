Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits, discovered using the TTV method. Oh right, TTV stands for transit timing variation, which is a method used to detect planets by looking at the variations in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But I don't think that part is super relevant here. 

The key part is that the planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet's period increases according to that ratio. Since they're in resonance, their orbital periods are in a specific ratio, which usually relates to their distances from the star.

The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, which is the measure of how much light that hits the planet is reflected. Albedo affects temperature because a higher albedo means the planet reflects more light and absorbs less, leading to cooler temperatures. Since their albedos are the same, I don't think that factor will influence the ratio; the main factors will be their distances from the star.

Equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, meaning it absorbs as much energy from its star as it emits. The formula I remember for the equilibrium temperature is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The basic equation is:

T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) 

Wait, or is it another formula? Oh right, the equilibrium temperature can also be calculated using the formula:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( (L_star / (16 * π * σ * a²) ) ) 

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of flux. The flux from the star at a distance a is given by F = L_star / (4πa²), where L_star is the star's luminosity. The planet absorbs this flux, but with an albedo factor. The absorbed power is F*(1 - A) * π r², where r is the planet's radius. But for equilibrium, the planet emits this energy as thermal radiation, so using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the emitted power is 4π r² σ T^4. Setting these equal, I get:

F*(1-A) * π r² = 4 π r² σ T^4

Simplify this. The π r² cancels out from both sides. So,

F*(1-A)/4 = σ T^4

But F is L/(4π a²), so substituting:

(L/(4π a²)) * (1-A)/4 = σ T^4

Wait, let me do it more carefully. 

The absorbed power is (1-A) * F * π R_p², where R_p is the planet's radius. The emitted power is 4 π R_p² σ T^4. Setting them equal:

(1-A) * F * π R_p² = 4 π R_p² σ T^4

Divide both sides by π R_p²:

(1-A) F = 4 σ T^4

So,

T^4 = F (1 - A) / (4 σ )

But F is the stellar flux, which is L/(4 π a²). So,

T^4 = (L/(4 π a²)) (1 - A) / (4 σ )

Simplify this: 

T^4 = L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a² )

Hmm, another way to write this is T = T_eff * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature. Because the star's luminosity is L = 4 π R_star² σ T_eff^4.

Let me substitute that into the equation. So,

T^4 = (4 π R_star^2 σ T_eff^4) * (1 - A) / (16 π σ a² )

Simplify the terms:

The σ cancels out, 4 π in numerator and 16 π denominator gives 1/4, so:

T^4 = (R_star^2 T_eff^4 (1 - A)) / (4 a² )

Take the fourth root of both sides:

T = T_eff * (R_star) / ( (4 a² )^{1/4} ) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4}

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux received by a planet is proportional to 1/a². Since the equilibrium temperature depends on the fourth root of the flux, the temperature should be proportional to 1/sqrt(a). Because T is proportional to flux^{1/4}, and flux is 1/a², so T is proportional to (1/a²)^{1/4} = 1/(a^(1/2)).

So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So, if a planet is farther away, it has a lower temperature. 

But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance, so their orbital periods are in ratios. I remember that for planets in the same star system, the period is related to the semi-major axis (a) by Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a^3. So a = (P^2 / K )^{1/3}, where K is some constant depending on the star's mass. But since all planets are around the same star, the same K applies, so a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, if I can find the ratio of a4 to a2, then I can find the ratio of their temperatures.

Given the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2 is 2 P1, Planet_3 is 2.5 P1, Planet_4 is 3.5 P1, and Planet_5 is 5 P1.

So, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So, a ratio for a4 /a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5 / 2)^(2/3).

Wait, wait, since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then a4 = K * (P4)^(2/3), and a2 = K * (P2)^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So, P4 is 3.5 * P1, P2 is 2 * P1. So the ratio P4/P2 is (3.5 / 2) = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3).

But since the temperature is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), T4 / T2 = [ (a2) / (a4) ]^(1/2) ) 

Wait, let me clarify. Because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), then T4 = T2 * (a2 / a4)^(1/2).

So the ratio T4 / T2 is (a2/a4)^{1/2} = [ (a2 / a4) ]^{1/2}.

But a4/a2 is (1.75)^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (1/1.75)^(2/3) = (0.571428... )^(2/3).

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4. Let me compute 7/4 = 1.75.

So (7/4)^(2/3) is the same as ( (7/4)^(1/3) ) squared.

Alternatively, another approach: a4 = (3.5 P1)^(2/3), a2 = (2 P1)^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3) = ( (7/4)^(1/3) ) squared.

So to compute (7/4)^(2/3), I can calculate it numerically.

7/4 is 1.75.

1.75^(1/3): cube root of 1.75. Let's see, 1.75 is between 1 (1^3) and 8 (2^3), so the cube root is about 1.2 (since 1.2^3 is 1.728). Let me compute 1.2^3: 1.2 * 1.2 =1.44, times 1.2 is 1.728. So 1.2^3 = 1.728, which is very close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2 + (0.022)/(3*(1.2)^2) ). Let me see, using linear approximation.

Let me compute f(x) = x^(1/3). The derivative f’(x) is (1/3) x^(-2/3).

We know f(1.728) = 1.2. Let x =1.728, delta_x=0.022. So delta_f ≈ f’(x) * delta_x.

f'(1.728) = 1/(3*(1.728)^(2/3) )) = 1/(3*(1.44)) )= 1/(4.32) ≈ 0.2315.

delta_f ≈ 0.2315 * 0.022 ≈ 0.00509.

So f(1.75) ≈ 1.2 + 0.00509 ≈ 1.20509.

So (7/4)^(1/3) ≈ 1.205. Then, (7/4)^(2/3) is [1.205]^2 ≈ 1.452.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452.

So a2/a4 is 1 / 1.452 ≈ 0.689.

So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(0.689) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.689). Let's see: 0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.83^2 is 0.6889. Wow, that's spot on. So sqrt(0.6889) is 0.83. So T4/T2 = 0.83.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, so that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the steps.

1. The planets are in resonance, their periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_4 has a period P4 =3.5 * P1, Planet_2 has P2=2 * P1.

2. Using Kepler's third law, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3).

3. Calculating (7/4)^(2/3):

Compute 7/4=1.75.

Cube root of 1.75 is approx 1.205.

Square that is approx 1.452.

So a4/a2 =1.452.

Thus, a2/a4 =1/1.452≈0.689.

4. Temperature ratio T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.689)≈0.83.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be C) ~0.83.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis, \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to the square of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Given the orbital period ratios \( P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5 \), we find \( P_4 = 3.5 \, P_1 \) and \( P_2 = 2 \, P_1 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(1.75\right)^{2/3}.
\]

To compute \( (1.75)^{2/3} \), we first approximate the cube root of 1.75. Since \( 1.2^3 = 1.728 \), the cube root of 1.75 is approximately \( 1.205 \). Squaring this gives:

\[
(1.75)^{2/3} \approx 1.452.
\]

Thus, \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.452 \), and the inverse ratio is:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} \approx \frac{1}{1.452} \approx 0.689.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is then:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{0.689}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{0.689} \), we find \( \sqrt{0.689} \approx 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) ~0.83**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits, discovered using the TTV method. Oh right, TTV stands for transit timing variation, which is a method used to detect planets by looking at the variations in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But I don't think that part is super relevant here. 

The key part is that the planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet's period increases according to that ratio. Since they're in resonance, their orbital periods are in a specific ratio, which usually relates to their distances from the star.

The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, which is the measure of how much light that hits the planet is reflected. Albedo affects temperature because a higher albedo means the planet reflects more light and absorbs less, leading to cooler temperatures. Since their albedos are the same, I don't think that factor will influence the ratio; the main factors will be their distances from the star.

Equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, meaning it absorbs as much energy from its star as it emits. The formula I remember for the equilibrium temperature is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The basic equation is:

T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) 

Wait, or is it another formula? Oh right, the equilibrium temperature can also be calculated using the formula:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( (L_star / (16 * π * σ * a²) ) ) 

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of flux. The flux from the star at a distance a is given by F = L_star / (4πa²), where L_star is the star's luminosity. The planet absorbs this flux, but with an albedo factor. The absorbed power is F*(1 - A) * π r², where r is the planet's radius. But for equilibrium, the planet emits this energy as thermal radiation, so using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the emitted power is 4π r² σ T^4. Setting these equal, I get:

F*(1-A) * π r² = 4 π r² σ T^4

Simplify this. The π r² cancels out from both sides. So,

F*(1-A)/4 = σ T^4

But F is L/(4π a²), so substituting:

(L/(4π a²)) * (1-A)/4 = σ T^4

Wait, let me do it more carefully. 

The absorbed power is (1-A) * F * π R_p², where R_p is the planet's radius. The emitted power is 4 π R_p² σ T^4. Setting them equal:

(1-A) * F * π R_p² = 4 π R_p² σ T^4

Divide both sides by π R_p²:

(1-A) F = 4 σ T^4

So,

T^4 = F (1 - A) / (4 σ )

But F is the stellar flux, which is L/(4 π a²). So,

T^4 = (L/(4 π a²)) (1 - A) / (4 σ )

Simplify this: 

T^4 = L (1 - A) / (16 π σ a² )

Hmm, another way to write this is T = T_eff * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature. Because the star's luminosity is L = 4 π R_star² σ T_eff^4.

Let me substitute that into the equation. So,

T^4 = (4 π R_star^2 σ T_eff^4) * (1 - A) / (16 π σ a² )

Simplify the terms:

The σ cancels out, 4 π in numerator and 16 π denominator gives 1/4, so:

T^4 = (R_star^2 T_eff^4 (1 - A)) / (4 a² )

Take the fourth root of both sides:

T = T_eff * (R_star) / ( (4 a² )^{1/4} ) ) * ( (1 - A) )^{1/4}

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux received by a planet is proportional to 1/a². Since the equilibrium temperature depends on the fourth root of the flux, the temperature should be proportional to 1/sqrt(a). Because T is proportional to flux^{1/4}, and flux is 1/a², so T is proportional to (1/a²)^{1/4} = 1/(a^(1/2)).

So, T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So, if a planet is farther away, it has a lower temperature. 

But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance, so their orbital periods are in ratios. I remember that for planets in the same star system, the period is related to the semi-major axis (a) by Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a^3. So a = (P^2 / K )^{1/3}, where K is some constant depending on the star's mass. But since all planets are around the same star, the same K applies, so a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, if I can find the ratio of a4 to a2, then I can find the ratio of their temperatures.

Given the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2 is 2 P1, Planet_3 is 2.5 P1, Planet_4 is 3.5 P1, and Planet_5 is 5 P1.

So, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So, a ratio for a4 /a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5 / 2)^(2/3).

Wait, wait, since a is proportional to P^(2/3), then a4 = K * (P4)^(2/3), and a2 = K * (P2)^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So, P4 is 3.5 * P1, P2 is 2 * P1. So the ratio P4/P2 is (3.5 / 2) = 1.75.

So a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3).

But since the temperature is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), T4 / T2 = [ (a2) / (a4) ]^(1/2) ) 

Wait, let me clarify. Because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), then T4 = T2 * (a2 / a4)^(1/2).

So the ratio T4 / T2 is (a2/a4)^{1/2} = [ (a2 / a4) ]^{1/2}.

But a4/a2 is (1.75)^(2/3). So a2/a4 = (1/1.75)^(2/3) = (0.571428... )^(2/3).

Wait, 1.75 is 7/4. Let me compute 7/4 = 1.75.

So (7/4)^(2/3) is the same as ( (7/4)^(1/3) ) squared.

Alternatively, another approach: a4 = (3.5 P1)^(2/3), a2 = (2 P1)^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3) = ( (7/4)^(1/3) ) squared.

So to compute (7/4)^(2/3), I can calculate it numerically.

7/4 is 1.75.

1.75^(1/3): cube root of 1.75. Let's see, 1.75 is between 1 (1^3) and 8 (2^3), so the cube root is about 1.2 (since 1.2^3 is 1.728). Let me compute 1.2^3: 1.2 * 1.2 =1.44, times 1.2 is 1.728. So 1.2^3 = 1.728, which is very close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2 + (0.022)/(3*(1.2)^2) ). Let me see, using linear approximation.

Let me compute f(x) = x^(1/3). The derivative f’(x) is (1/3) x^(-2/3).

We know f(1.728) = 1.2. Let x =1.728, delta_x=0.022. So delta_f ≈ f’(x) * delta_x.

f'(1.728) = 1/(3*(1.728)^(2/3) )) = 1/(3*(1.44)) )= 1/(4.32) ≈ 0.2315.

delta_f ≈ 0.2315 * 0.022 ≈ 0.00509.

So f(1.75) ≈ 1.2 + 0.00509 ≈ 1.20509.

So (7/4)^(1/3) ≈ 1.205. Then, (7/4)^(2/3) is [1.205]^2 ≈ 1.452.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452.

So a2/a4 is 1 / 1.452 ≈ 0.689.

So T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(0.689) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.689). Let's see: 0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.83^2 is 0.6889. Wow, that's spot on. So sqrt(0.6889) is 0.83. So T4/T2 = 0.83.

So the ratio is approximately 0.83. Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, so that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the steps.

1. The planets are in resonance, their periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_4 has a period P4 =3.5 * P1, Planet_2 has P2=2 * P1.

2. Using Kepler's third law, a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3).

3. Calculating (7/4)^(2/3):

Compute 7/4=1.75.

Cube root of 1.75 is approx 1.205.

Square that is approx 1.452.

So a4/a2 =1.452.

Thus, a2/a4 =1/1.452≈0.689.

4. Temperature ratio T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.689)≈0.83.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be C) ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis, \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to the square of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). Therefore, the ratio of semi-major axes between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Given the orbital period ratios \( P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5 \), we find \( P_4 = 3.5 \, P_1 \) and \( P_2 = 2 \, P_1 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(1.75\right)^{2/3}.
\]

To compute \( (1.75)^{2/3} \), we first approximate the cube root of 1.75. Since \( 1.2^3 = 1.728 \), the cube root of 1.75 is approximately \( 1.205 \). Squaring this gives:

\[
(1.75)^{2/3} \approx 1.452.
\]

Thus, \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.452 \), and the inverse ratio is:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} \approx \frac{1}{1.452} \approx 0.689.
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is then:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{0.689}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{0.689} \), we find \( \sqrt{0.689} \approx 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) ~0.83**

Answer: C
