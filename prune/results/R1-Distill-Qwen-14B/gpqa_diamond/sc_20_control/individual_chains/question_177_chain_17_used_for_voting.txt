Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. But wait, mass might not be directly relevant here. The question is about luminosity, which I remember depends on radius and temperature. Oh, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power, L = 4πσR²T⁴. So maybe mass isn't needed for this part.

The next part says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember Wien's Law, which states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature? Because they emit the same peak wavelength. So their temperatures are equal. That's a key point.

Now, the problem also mentions the radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, but in terms of observed wavelength, the Doppler effect could shift the peak wavelength. But wait, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same for both, but the intrinsic λ_max (before Doppler shift) might be different? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no. The question states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max is the same. Let me think about this. For Star_2, because it's moving, its emission would be Doppler shifted. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelengths would be blueshifted, making λ_max smaller. Conversely, if moving away, redshifted, λ_max larger.

Wait, the radial velocity given is 700 km/s for Star_2. But the problem doesn't specify the direction (recession or approach). So how does that affect the observed wavelength?

Alternatively, maybe the peak wavelengths they appear are the same as emitted, but that can't be right because Star_2 is moving. Hmm, perhaps the question is simplified, and we're to ignore the Doppler effect when considering the temperatures, but that might not be the case. Or maybe the Doppler effect is small compared to other factors, so it's negligible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let me think again. If the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, then we can calculate their intrinsic temperatures using Wien's law, but considering any Doppler shifts.

Let me model this. Let's say λ_obs is the same for both stars. For Star_1, since radial velocity is zero, its λ_emit = λ_obs. For Star_2, because it's moving, its λ_emit is shifted. Let's assume radial velocity is away, so redshifted. So λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), approximately, using the relativistic Doppler shift formula. But for v much smaller than c, this can be approximated as (1 + v/c). Wait, but whether v is towards or away matters. Let's say Star_2 is moving away (so positive velocity), so λ_obs = λ_emit_2 * (1 + v/c)^(1/3). Wait, no, wait, the Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And in terms of velocity, z ≈ v/c for small v. So z = v/c. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write down the Doppler formula properly. For a source moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. The formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). Similarly, when moving towards, it's λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 - v/c). Since v is 700 km/s, which is about 0.00233c (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So (v/c) is about 0.00233, which is small. So for approximation, we can use λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v/c) for redshift, or (1 - v/c) for blueshift.

But the problem states that both stars have the same observed λ_max. Let me denote λ1 as the observed λ for Star_1, which is same as emitted λ1 because radial velocity is zero. So λ1_emit = λ1_obs.

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away (so redshifted). Then, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c). But since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, we have λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c).

But wait, from the earlier analysis, since both stars have the same observed λ_max, and λ_emit_1 = λ1_obs, and λ_emit_2 = λ2_obs / (1 + v/c) [if moving away], or λ2_obs * (1 - v/c) [if moving towards].

Wait, but let me think about the temperature. Since λ_max is inversely proportional to T, if Star_2 is redshifted, its T would be lower than Star_1's T. Because λ_emit_2 = λ_emit_1 * (1 + v/c) / (1 + v/c) ? Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Alternatively, let me think that the observed λ_max for both is the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But the intrinsic λ_max for each star is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T.

So, λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2.

But for Star_2, its observed λ_max is λ2_obs = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

So, λ1_obs = λ2_obs => λ1_emit = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

Wait, no: Star_1's λ1_obs is λ1_emit, because it has no radial velocity. Star_2's λ2_obs is λ2_emit multiplied by the Doppler shift factor.

So, since λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

But the Doppler factor depends on whether Star_2 is moving towards or away. Let's compute it.

If Star_2 is moving away at velocity v, then the Doppler shift factor is 1 + v/c ≈ 1.00233.

So, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c).

So from λ1_obs = λ2_obs,

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c).

But λ1_emit is (b / T1), and λ2_emit is (b / T2).

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c).

Divide both sides by b:

1/(T1) = (1/(T2)) * (1 + v/c).

So,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) / 1.

Which is T2 = T1 * (1 + 0.00233) ≈ 1.00233 * T1.

So, T2 is a bit higher than T1. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. If Star_2 is moving away, which would make its observed λ longer, so the observed λ_max is same as Star_1, which has no shift. So Star_2's emitted λ must be shorter (to make up for the redshift, so that when it's redshifted, it matches Star_1's λ). So Star_2 is intrinsically hotter?

Wait, let me re-examine. Suppose Star_2 is moving away, so its emitted light is redshifted. So λ2_emit would be smaller than λ2_obs. But since λ2_obs equals λ1_obs, which equals λ1_emit, then:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v/c) => λ2_emit = λ1_emit / (1 + v/c).

Since λ_max = b / T,

T2 = b / λ2_emit = b * (1 + v/c) / λ1_emit.

And T1 = b / λ1_emit.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

Which means T2 is higher than T1.

But wait, that would make Star_2 hotter, which seems odd because it's moving away. Alternatively, perhaps I got the Doppler effect direction wrong.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted, so the observed λ is longer. So when we calculate λ2_emit, it would be λ_obs / (1 + v/c). Because λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) => λ_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c).

So, since λ1_emit = λ_obs (because no Doppler shift), λ2_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c) = λ1_emit / (1 + v/c).

So T1 = b / λ1_emit.

T2 = b / λ2_emit = b * (1 + v/c) / λ1_emit = (1 + v/c) * (b / λ1_emit) = (1 + v/c) T1.

So T2 is (1 + v/c) times higher than T1. So T2 ≈ 1.00233 T1.

So, Star_2 is slightly hotter than Star_1.

Wait, but that's a very small increase in temperature. So now, with T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).

But wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value.

v is 700 km/s.

c is approximately 299,792 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 299792 ≈ 0.002336.

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.002336.

So, T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002336.

So, T2 is about 0.2336% higher than T1.

But since the problem is about luminosity, let's compute L1 and L2.

Luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

But since we're looking for the ratio L1/L2, the constants (4π σ) will cancel out.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

From the problem, R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5.

So R1² / R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Now, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c) ≈ T1 * 1.002336.

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.002336 ≈ 0.997674.

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.997674)^4.

Let me calculate that.

First, 0.997674 ≈ 1 - 0.002326.

The fourth power:

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x^3 +x^4.

But x is 0.002326, which is small, so higher terms can be neglected.

So, approximately,

(0.997674)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*0.002326 = 1 - 0.009304 = 0.990696.

Wait, but that's an approximation. To get a more accurate value, perhaps compute it directly.

Let me compute 0.997674^4.

Let me compute 0.997674^2 first:

0.997674 * 0.997674.

Hmm, 0.997674 * 0.997674 = (1 - 0.002326)^2 = 1 - 2*0.002326 + (0.002326)^2 ≈ 0.995344 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.995349.

Then, square that result to get the fourth power:

0.995349^2.

Compute 0.995349 * 0.995349.

Hmm, let's approximate:

(1 - 0.004651)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.004651 + (0.004651)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009302 + 0.0000216 ≈ 0.9907196.

So, approximately 0.9907.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

Putting it all together,

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Let me compute that: 2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275, 2.25 * 0.9907:

= 2.25 * (0.99 + 0.0007) = 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

Approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

Wait, but wait a minute. Oh, no, wait. Because T2 is higher than T1, so (T1/T2) is less than 1. So (T1/T2)^4 is less than 1, which makes L1/L2 less than 2.25. So, 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

But wait, the options include 2.23 as an option (option D). Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So, our calculation gives approximately 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the Doppler shift calculation?

Another approach: perhaps the Doppler shift isn't affecting the temperature as much, but let's see. Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't consider the Doppler effect and simply says the intrinsic peak wavelengths are same, hence same T.

Wait, the question states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same.

If the stars are moving, their emitted wavelengths are different from the observed. So the observed λ_max is same, but emitted λ_max would be different.

Wait, another way to think: For Star_1, no Doppler shift, so λ_max1_obs = λ_max1_emit.

For Star_2, moving at velocity v, so λ_max2_obs = λ_max2_emit * (1 + v/c) if moving away, or (1 - v/c) if moving towards.

But the observed λ_max for both stars is same, so λ_max1_obs = λ_max2_obs.

Which implies λ_max1_emit = λ_max2_emit * (1 + v/c) if Star_2 is moving away.

But using Wien's law, λ_max = b / T => T = b / λ_max.

So,

T1 = b / λ_max1_emit.

T2 = b / λ_max2_emit.

So,

λ_max2_emit = λ_max1_emit / (1 + v/c).

Thus,

T2 = b / (λ_max1_emit / (1 + v/c)) ) = (b * (1 + v/c)) ) / λ_max1_emit.

But T1 = b / λ_max1_emit.

So,

T2 = (1 + v/c) * T1.

So again, T2 is higher than T1, as before.

So, back to the L calculation.

L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * ( (T1 / T2)^4 ).

Since T2 = (1 + v/c) T1,

(T1 / T2) = 1/(1 + v/c) ≈ 0.997674.

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

Which is approximately 2.23, so option D.

But wait, the problem states that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. So the ratio L1/L2 is >1. 2.23 is the factor by which L1 is greater than L2. So the correct option is D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the options have a choice at 2.25 (option A), which is R1² (since R1 is 1.5 R2). So if temperature were same, L1 would be 2.25 times L2. But because T2 is a bit higher, L1/L2 is a bit less than 2.25, which brings it down to ~2.23.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the Doppler shift. Let me recheck the direction.

If Star_2 is moving away, then its observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So, λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c).

Since both stars have same λ_obs,

λ_1_emit = λ_obs.

λ_2_emit = λ_obs / (1 + v/c).

So, λ_2_emit < λ_1_emit.

Since λ is inversely proportional to T, λ_2_emit < λ_1_emit implies T_2 > T_1.

So, T_2 = (1 + v/c) T_1.

So, T_2 is higher than T_1 by a small amount.

Thus, when calculating L1/L2,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * (1/(1 + v/c))^4.

Which is 2.25 * (approx 0.9907) = ~2.23.

So the correct answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio \( L_1 / L_2 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
From the problem, \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law, \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \), the intrinsic peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max, emit}} \)) of the stars are related to their temperatures. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted due to its radial velocity \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For small \( v/c \), this can be approximated as:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \) is the same for both stars, we equate the intrinsic wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{1, \text{emit}} = \lambda_{2, \text{emit}} \cdot (1 + v/c)
\]

Using \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto 1/T \), the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{\lambda_{2, \text{emit}}}{\lambda_{1, \text{emit}}} = \frac{1}{1 + v/c}
\]

Substituting \( v/c = 700 / 299792 \approx 0.002336 \):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{1.002336} \approx 0.997674
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4 \approx (0.997674)^4
\]

Using the binomial expansion for small \( x \), \( (1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x \), where \( x = 1 - 0.997674 = 0.002326 \):

\[
(0.997674)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.002326) = 1 - 0.009304 = 0.990696
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4} = 2.25 \cdot 0.990696 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2. Therefore, the correct option is:
