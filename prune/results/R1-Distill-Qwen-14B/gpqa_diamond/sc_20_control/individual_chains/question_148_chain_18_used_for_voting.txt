Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. Hmm, binary compounds are made of two elements, so in this case, Y and F. So Y must be some element that forms multiple fluorides.

Then there are substances A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. Let's parse the information given for each.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature, 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the reaction might look like A1 → A2 + F2 when heated. Wait, no, because it's decomposing into A2 and F2. So perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower one plus F2. For example, maybe A1 is YF3 and it decomposes into YF (if that's possible) and F2? Not sure yet.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so maybe it's acting as a reducing agent here. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps A1 is a source of F+ ions that oxidize Xe. Wait, but fluorine is already a strong oxidizer. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a fluoride that can be oxidized by Xe? Or perhaps A1 is a fluorinating agent.

Then, A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So maybe A3 is YF, the simplest fluoride. If Y is something like Cl, then YF would be ClF, but I'm not sure. Wait, but Y is the other element in the binary compounds.

Moving on, adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. So perhaps A4 is some kind of fluoride solution. When Y is added, it reacts to form A5. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. Maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction.

So trying to figure out what Y could be. Since there are five binary compounds with fluorine, Y must form multiple fluorides. Let me think of elements that form several fluorides. For example, chlorine forms several: ClF, ClF3, ClF5, maybe others. Or perhaps another element like iodine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is another halogen.

Wait, but perhaps Y is oxygen? No, because oxygen doesn't form that many fluorides. Alternatively, maybe Y is sulfur, but sulfur forms SF4 and SF6, but that's only two. Wait, but the question says five binary compounds. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let's think of elements with multiple possible oxidation states that can form multiple fluorides. For example, nitrogen forms NF3, but that's only one. Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps Y is nitrogen? Because I know that nitrogen can form NF3, but I'm not sure if it can form more. Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus, which can form PF3, PF5, etc.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A1. If A1 is a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower one plus F2. Let's think about what compounds could do that. For example, ClF3 decomposes into ClF and F2 when heated. Because ClF3 → ClF + F2. So that would fit. So maybe A1 is ClF3, which on decomposition gives ClF (A2) and F2.

But wait, the question says A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So that would be ClF3 → A2 + F2. If A2 is ClF, then that makes sense. So A2 is ClF. Then, the oF (I assume that's the oxidation state of F) in A2 is 1, because ClF has F in -1 oxidation state. So that's correct because the oF is given as 31.96%, but wait, that can't be. Oh wait, perhaps the oF is the degree of fluorination or something else? Or maybe oF refers to the oxidation state?

Wait, wait. The question says "ɷF=31,96%". Hmm, perhaps that's the oxidation state of fluorine. Because 31.96 is close to the atomic weight of fluorine, which is about 19. So that might not make sense. Or perhaps it's the percentage abundance of a certain isotope? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's the oxidation state, but 31.96% of the fluorine atoms are in a certain state.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating that part. Let's move on.

A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so under normal conditions, being oxidized would mean that Xe is acting as a reducing agent. So perhaps A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent, so that makes sense.

So, if Y is chlorine, then A1 is ClF3, A2 is ClF. Then, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, which is Cl. So ClF is A3. Wait, but earlier I thought A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. Then A3 would be ClF. But earlier, A2 is ClF. Hmm, that can't be. Maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, perhaps A3 is a different compound. Let me re-read that part.

"A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y with fluorine."

So, fluorinating Y with F2 gives A3. If Y is Cl, then Cl + F2 → ClF? Or perhaps ClF3? Wait, no, because ClF3 would require more F. Wait, ClF is formed when Cl2 reacts with excess F2 under certain conditions, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen? No, because oxygen doesn't form many fluorides. Let's try another approach.

Wait, perhaps Y is oxygen. Let's see. The problem says there are five binary fluorides. Oxygens can form OF2 and O2F2, but that's only two. Not five. So probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is nitrogen. Nitrogen can form NF3, maybe others. But again, not five.

Wait, maybe Y is another halogen. Let's think... Oh! Wait, perhaps Y is chlorine, but that's what I was thinking earlier. Wait, but chlorine has several fluorides: ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7? Wait, ClF7 is not stable. So maybe ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7 (though unstable), and perhaps some others? Wait, but I'm not sure about five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen. No, not enough.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the other parts. The part about A4 and A5.

When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, it gives A5. Then A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Hmm. So perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5 or YF4 or something. Let's think. If Y is Cl, then A4 could be ClF5, but I'm not sure about its properties.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of a chloride. Wait, but the question is about fluorides. So perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4 or another fluoride.

Wait, when Y is added to A4, perhaps it's a precipitation reaction. For example, adding Y metal to a solution of its own fluoride might not make sense. Or perhaps A4 is a solution of a higher fluoride, and adding Y would cause a displacement.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of YF4, and adding Y metal would form YF2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of YF3, and adding Y would form YF.

But wait, the ratio is 1:1 molar. So perhaps Y (element) is being added as Y metal, and reacting with a solution of YF5 or some other fluoride.

Wait, perhaps Y is sodium? No, because sodium forms only one fluoride: NaF. So that's not five compounds. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is another element, like sulfur. Sulfur forms SF4 and SF6. But that's only two. Not enough.

Wait, maybe Y is carbon. Carbon forms CF4. Only one, I think. Not enough.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is a fluoride, then when it decomposes in water, maybe it forms Y and HF. So for example, if A5 is YF, then YF + H2O → Y(OH) + HF or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex reaction.

Wait, perhaps A5 is YF3. When YF3 is dissolved in water, it might hydrolyze. YF3 + 3H2O → Y(OH)3 + 3HF. So that produces two substances: Y(OH)3 and HF. That fits the description.

So if A5 is YF3, then A4 must be some fluoride that when Y is added in a 1:1 ratio, it forms YF3. So what reaction would that be?

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF5. Adding Y metal (1:1 molar) would produce YF3 and perhaps another fluoride. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF4. Adding Y metal could reduce the fluoride. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF2. Adding Y metal... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about A4 being a solution of YF5. When Y is added, perhaps it reacts to form YF3 and HF. So the reaction would be YF5 + Y → 2YF3 + F2↑? Or something else. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF3, but that might not make sense. Wait, perhaps when Y is added to a solution of YF5, it reacts to form YF3 and releases F2 gas. So the reaction could be YF5 + Y → 2YF3 + (1/2) F2↑. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the molecular weight of A4. The options are:

A) 140-160

B) 220-240

C) 160-180

D) 110-130

So the molecular weight of A4 is somewhere in one of these ranges.

If Y is chlorine, for example, let's see: what would A4 be?

If A4 is ClF5, its molecular weight would be Cl (35.5) + 5*19=95 → 130.5. So that's in option D (110-130). But then, when Cl (Y) is added to ClF5 in a 1:1 ratio, what happens? The reaction could be ClF5 + Cl → 2ClF3 + F2↑. Let's see: ClF5 has Cl in +5 oxidation state. When Cl (0) is added, it gets oxidized to +3. So each Cl atom goes from 0 to +3, losing 3 electrons. The F in ClF5 is -1. Each F would gain an electron if it's acting as oxidizing agent. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, let's say A4 is ClF3. Its molecular weight would be 35.5 + 3*19=35.5 +57=92.5. That's in option D as 92.5, which is within 110-130? No, 92.5 is below 110. So option D starts at 110.

Wait, perhaps I should find A4's molecular weight based on the information.

Wait, another approach: the problem states that there are five binary fluorides of Y. Let's think of elements with several fluorides. Chlorine can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7 (though ClF7 is unstable), but that's four, maybe five if you count others. Alternatively, maybe Y is another element.

Wait, sulfur forms SF4, SF6. That's two. Maybe not enough.

Wait, phosphorus forms PF3, PF5. Two.

Wait, perhaps Y is fluorine itself? No, because the compounds would be binary, so F and F, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen. But I don't think O has five fluorides.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is carbon. But carbon forms only CF4. So no.

Wait, maybe Y is a noble gas. No, noble gases form very few fluorides, like XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. So that's three. But the question says five binary compounds.

Wait, maybe Y is nitrogen. NF3 is one, maybe others. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element that I'm not thinking of. Let me think of the possible fluorides.

Wait, perhaps Y is iodine. I can form IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. That's four, but maybe another one exists. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on Y. Let's try another approach. Let's think about A1, which decomposes into A2 and F2. So A1 is a higher fluoride which when heated releases F2 and forms a lower fluoride.

For example, ClF3 → ClF + F2. So A1 is ClF3, A2 is ClF.

So in that case, Y is chlorine.

So let's proceed with Y as chlorine.

Then, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Cl) with fluorine. So Cl + F2 → ClF. So A3 is ClF.

A3 can interact with xenon. Xenon is a noble gas. So ClF might react with Xe under certain conditions. ClF is a strong fluorinating agent, I think.

Then, A4 is another fluoride. When Y (Cl) is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated solution of A4, it forms A5. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

So, what could A4 be? Let's consider possibilities.

If A4 is ClF5, and adding Cl (as metal?) would produce ClF3 and F2. Wait, but Cl isn't a metal; it's a non-metal. So perhaps not. Or maybe it's a solution of ClF5, and adding Cl2 gas? No, the question says adding Y in a 1:1 ratio. Y is Cl, so perhaps adding Cl metal, but Cl doesn't exist in its metallic form. Oh wait, wait. Chlorine is a diatomic molecule (Cl2), so maybe adding Cl2 gas.

Wait, but the problem says Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio. So if A4 is ClF5, then adding Cl (as Cl2) in a 1:1 ratio. But I'm not exactly sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF5, and when Cl2 is added, it reacts to form ClF3 and ClF or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A5 in water. If A5 is ClF3, then when it reacts with water, it would produce HCl and HF, perhaps. Because ClF3 + 3 H2O → 3 HF + HClO3. Hmm, but that's a decomposition into two substances. So that's possible.

So if A5 is ClF3, then A4 must be a solution of ClF5. Adding Cl would cause a reduction, perhaps.

Wait, so the reaction would be ClF5 + Cl2 → 2 ClF3 + F2↑? Let's check the stoichiometry.

ClF5 has Cl in +5 oxidation state. Cl2 is in 0. So each Cl in ClF5 is reduced to +3 in ClF3, gaining 2 electrons per Cl. Each Cl atom in Cl2 (0) is oxidized to +3 in ClF3, losing 3 electrons per atom.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

ClF5 + Cl → 2 ClF3 + F2.

Let me balance that. ClF5 has one Cl, and adding Cl (Cl2?), so perhaps:

ClF5 + Cl2 → 2 ClF3 + F2.

But let's check the Cl atoms: left side is 1 (from ClF5) + 2 (from Cl2) = 3 Cl. Right side: 2 * 2 Cl (from ClF3) = 4 Cl. So that doesn't balance. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is ClF5 + Cl → 2 ClF3. Let's check Cl: 1 +1 = 2 on the left. On the right, 2*2=4? No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe the reaction is 2 ClF5 + Cl2 → 2 ClF3 + 2 F2.

Cl on left: 2*1 (from ClF5) + 2 (from Cl2) = 4 Cl.

Cl on right: 2*2 (from ClF3) =4 Cl. F: left is 2*5=10 F from ClF5. Right: 2*3=6 F in ClF3, plus 2*2=4 F in F2. So 6 +8=14 F. Left has 10 F, so not balanced. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting the stoichiometry right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is ClF5 + Cl → 2 ClF3. Let's count atoms:

Cl:1 +1 =2 on left.

Cl on right: 2 *2=4. Doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's think about what A4 would be. Since A5 is ClF3, and when Y (Cl) is added to A4 in 1:1 ratio, perhaps the reaction is:

A4 + Y → A5.

If A4 is ClF5, and adding Cl in the form of Cl2, then:

ClF5 + Cl2 → 2 ClF3 + F2.

Let me balance this:

Cl: 1 (from ClF5) + 2 (from Cl2) = 3.

On the right: 2 * 2 (from ClF3) =4. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF3, but that would lead to A5 being ClF, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the molecular weight of A4.

If Y is Cl, and A4 is ClF5, then molecular weight is Cl (35.5) + 5 * 19 = 35.5 + 95 = 130.5. So that's around 130.5, which falls into option D (110-130).

Alternatively, if A4 is ClF4, molecular weight is 35.5 + 4*19 =35.5 +76=111.5, which is also in option D.

So perhaps the molecular weight of A4 is around 111.5 (if it's ClF4) or 130.5 (if it's ClF5). Both fall into option D.

So the molecular weight of A4 would be in the range of 110-130, which is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y, which forms five such compounds. The substances A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 are described with specific interactions and reactions. The goal is to determine the molecular weight range of A4.

### Key Analysis:
1. **A1 Decomposition**: A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. This suggests A1 is a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower fluoride and F₂. For example, if A1 is ClF₃, it could decompose into ClF (A2) and F₂.

2. **A1 and Xenon Interaction**: A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent. ClF₃ fits this description, as it is known to oxidize noble gases like xenon.

3. **A3 Formation**: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y with fluorine. If Y is chlorine, A3 could be ClF, a simple fluoride.

4. **A4 and A5 Reaction**: Adding Y (in a 1:1 molar ratio) to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. If A4 is ClF₅, adding chlorine (Y) could reduce it to ClF₃ (A5), which then decomposes in water to form HF and HClO₃.

5. **Molecular Weight of A4**: If A4 is ClF₅, its molecular weight is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Molecular weight of ClF₅} = 35.5 + 5 \times 19 = 130.5 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]
   If A4 is ClF₄, its molecular weight is:
   \[
   \text{Molecular weight of ClF₄} = 35.5 + 4 \times 19 = 111.5 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]
   Both values fall within the range of 110–130, corresponding to option D.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the molecular weight of A4 falls within the range of 110–130.
