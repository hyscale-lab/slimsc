Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about a synchrocyclotron and how many revolutions a proton makes. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles.

The problem states that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T≈0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data are Φ0=π/4 and U0=190 kV. The options are four numbers, so I need to calculate how many times the proton revolves around the synchrocyclotron.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty. Let me think. In cyclotrons, particles move in a magnetic field and are accelerated by an electric field. The frequency of the electric field must match the particle's cyclotron frequency for effective acceleration. But wait, synchrocyclotrons are a bit different because they have a varying magnetic field to keep the cyclotron frequency in sync with the accelerating frequency. Oh right, so the magnetic field increases as the particle gains energy, allowing it to keep up with the accelerating electric field.

So the key here might be to relate the kinetic energy gained with the number of revolutions. The proton starts with T≈0 and ends at 950 MeV. Each revolution, I think, the proton gains some energy from the electric field. So I need to find how many such energy increments are needed to reach 950 MeV.

Wait, but the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(2πν α t + Φ0). I'm not sure what ν(α) is. Oh, probably the frequency, which depends on the angle α. But maybe I can proceed without knowing it explicitly.

I think the energy gained each time the proton passes through the electric field is related to the voltage. Since the voltage is applied alternately, each half-cycle might contribute to acceleration. So the energy gained per revolution would be the voltage times some factor.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, each time the particle goes through the gap between the dees, it gains kinetic energy equal to the voltage applied. So each time, the proton gains about q*U0, where q is the charge. But wait, the voltage here is U(t) = U0 cos(...), so the maximum voltage is U0, but the average or the effective voltage over a cycle would be different?

Wait, wait. The potential difference a proton experiences each time it crosses the gap would be the peak voltage, perhaps. So each time the proton goes through the gap, it gains energy equal to U0 multiplied by the charge. Since the charge of a proton is e, the energy gained per acceleration would be e * U0.

But wait, the voltage given is the time-varying one. So maybe each time the proton passes the gap (every half-period of the voltage?), it gets a kick of energy e*U0. But wait, the voltage is applied as a cosine, so the maximum is U0, but probably the effective is that each acceleration step gives e*U0. So the total number of steps or revolutions needed would be the total energy divided by the energy per step.

Wait, but the energy gained is e * U_max times the number of times the potential is applied. So the total kinetic energy T is approximately e * U0 * N, where N is the number of steps or revolutions.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The kinetic energy T is 950 MeV. The charge of a proton is e=1.6e-19 C, but in terms of energy, 1 eV is e multiplied by 1 V. So 1 eV = e * 1 V. Therefore, for each volt, the energy is e * 1 V.

So, the energy per step is U0 (in volts) multiplied by e. But wait, since the voltage is applied as a cosine, maybe the effective voltage is U0 * (something). Wait, but the potential difference the proton actually experiences is the maximum of the cosine function, which is U0. So each time the proton moves through the gap, it gains e*U0.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is related to the frequency. The cyclotron frequency is f = qB/(2πm). But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field isn't constant, but for each step, the magnetic field increases so that the cyclotron frequency remains in sync with the accelerating frequency.

Wait, but the question is about the number of revolutions, not the time taken. So perhaps the key is that each revolution corresponds to a certain energy gain, and the total number is the total energy divided by energy per revolution.

Wait, but each time the proton goes around once, it gains a certain amount of energy. So the number of revolutions N would be T/(e*U0) ?

But wait, T is 950 MeV. Let me compute that.

First, e*U0 in eV. U0 is 190 kV = 190,000 V. e*U0 = 190,000 eV = 190 keV.

So the energy per revolution is 190 keV. The total energy needed is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV.

So N = 950,000 keV / 190 keV per revolution = 950,000 / 190 = let's compute that.

Calculate 950,000 divided by 190. Hmm, 190 * 5000 is 950,000. So 950,000 / 190 = 5000, right?

Wait, but the options are A) 1864, B)5300, etc. So B is 5300, which is close but not exactly 5000. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I didn't account for something. Oh wait, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is 950 MeV. But the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Wait, two accelerations? So to reach T1=950 MeV, it's accelerated twice per revolution.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. In a cyclotron, each time the particle passes through the gap, it's accelerated once per revolution. So each revolution, it gains e*U0. Therefore, the number of revolutions would be T_total / (e U0) as I thought.

But wait, maybe the voltage is applied such that the particle is accelerated twice per revolution. Because each revolution has two gaps, top and bottom, so the particle is accelerated twice. So maybe each revolution gives 2 * e U0.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the dees are two, so for each full revolution, the proton passes through the potential twice. So the energy per revolution would be 2 * e U0.

So in that case, the number of revolutions N would be T_total / (2 e U0).

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let me redo.

T_total is 950 MeV = 950,000 keV.

Energy per revolution is 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV.

So N = 950,000 / 380 ≈ let's compute.

Divide 950,000 by 380.

Well, 380 * 2500 is 950,000, because 380 * 2000 =760,000. 380 * 2500 = 380 * (2000+500) = 760,000 + 190,000 =950,000.

Wait, so 950,000 / 380 =2500.

But wait, the options include D) 2500.

Wait, but the initial calculation without considering two accelerations per revolution gave 5000, which was close to option B)5300, but that's not matching. But now, with two accelerations, the calculation gives 2500, which is option D.

But wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So does that mean each step (each acceleration) is a half-revolution or per full revolution?

Wait, perhaps the question says that the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 =950 MeV. So perhaps each acceleration contributes a certain amount.

Wait, but the question says it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. So each acceleration gives a certain energy.

Wait, but perhaps each time the particle passes the gap, it's accelerated once. So if it makes N revolutions, it passes the gap N times, so gains N * e U0.

Wait, but in that case, N would be 950,000 keV / 190 keV per step = about 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. The closest is B)5300.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor here. Also, the initial velocity is low, so maybe relativistic effects are considered, but the problem says T ≈0, so non-relativistic.

Wait, but the energy per revolution is e U0, so 190 keV per revolution. So 950 MeV is 950,000 keV. So 950,000 / 190 = 5000.

But the options don't have 5000. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, the voltage is given with a phase shift Φ0 = π/4. Does that affect the number of revolutions?

Wait, phase shift might affect the timing of the acceleration but not the total number of accelerations needed. So probably not.

Wait, perhaps the frequency of the electric field affects the cyclotron frequency. Oh right, in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the electric field must match the cyclotron frequency, which changes as the proton gains energy because the magnetic field is adjusted. Wait, but I'm not sure how that affects the number of revolutions needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is the same as the number of times the electric field accelerates the proton. Because each time the field is in the right phase, the proton gains energy.

Wait, the electric field is applied with a frequency ν(α). Hmm, but I'm not sure how to relate that to the number of revolutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is equal to the total number of times the electric field has accelerated the proton.

Wait, but according to the data, U(t) is given, but perhaps the acceleration occurs each time the electric field's phase is correct. So the number of times the field accelerates the proton would be N, and each acceleration gives e U0.

So, if the proton's total energy is e U0 * N = 950 MeV, so N = 950e3 / 190 ≈5000.

But the options don't have 5000. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, looking back, the options are A) 1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, 950,000 / 190 is 5000, but that's not an option. But wait, perhaps the voltage is 190 kV peak, but average is lower. Or perhaps I have to consider something else.

Wait, another approach: the energy gained per revolution is e U0, but perhaps the actual energy per revolution is e U0 multiplied by some factor.

Wait, no. Because the voltage is U(t)=U0 cos(...). So the maximum voltage is U0, but the average over a full cycle is zero. So each time the particle crosses the gap when the voltage is maximum, it gains e U0. But how often does that happen?

Wait, that depends on the frequency of the voltage and the cyclotron frequency. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases so that the cyclotron frequency matches the accelerating frequency. So each time the proton completes a revolution, the voltage is at the right phase to accelerate it again.

Wait, but in a normal cyclotron, the number of revolutions is given by the total energy divided by the energy per revolution.

Wait, but perhaps I need to consider the time aspect. Let's think about the frequency. The magnetic field changes, but the cyclotron frequency ν is related to the magnetic field as ν = qB/(2πm). In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is adjusted to keep ν matching the electric field's frequency ν_e.

So, the electric field's frequency is ν_e, and the cyclotron frequency is ν. So for each revolution, a certain time passes, and the frequency ν_e is matched to ν.

Wait, but perhaps the number of revolutions is the time taken to reach T1 divided by the revolution period. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the number of revolutions is the total energy divided by the energy per revolution, as before.

Wait, but the initial approach gave 5000, which isn't an option. Maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 because each revolution gives two accelerations. So per revolution, the proton is accelerated twice, so N = T_total/(2 e U0) = 950e3 keV / (2 *190 keV) = 950e3 / 380 ≈2500. So that gives 2500, which is option D.

But why would each revolution give two accelerations? Because in a cyclotron, the dees are two, so each revolution might provide two acceleration opportunities. So each time the proton passes through the gap, which happens twice per revolution, it gains energy. Therefore, the number of revolutions would be N = (total energy) / (energy per revolution * 2).

Wait, but that would mean each revolution gives two energy gains. So N = T/(2 e U0).

In that case, N= 950,000 keV / (2 *190 keV) )= 950,000 / 380 ≈2500.

Which is option D.

But in the question, it says the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps that's why: two accelerations per revolution.

Wait, the question states that the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps each acceleration brings it to a higher energy. Wait, but what determines the number of accelerations needed to reach the target energy?

If each acceleration gives e U0, then the number of accelerations N is T_total/(e U0). So N= 950e3 / 190 ≈5000.

But the question says it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Hmm, maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that the voltage is applied twice per revolution, so each revolution provides two acceleration events.

So, perhaps the number of revolutions is N = (950e3 keV) / (2 * 190 keV) )= 2500.

Which is option D.

But the problem statement says that the proton undergoes two accelerations. So perhaps it's two per revolution.

I think the correct approach is that each revolution gives two accelerations, each adding e U0 to the energy. So the number of revolutions is T_total/(2 * e U0) = 950e3 keV / (2 *190 keV) )=2500.

So the answer would be D)2500.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gained by the proton and the energy provided per revolution. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and is accelerated to a final kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The voltage applied in the accelerator is given as \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), with \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain Per Revolution**:  
   Each time the proton passes through the electric field, it gains energy equal to the peak voltage multiplied by the proton charge (\(e\)). Since the voltage is \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\), the energy gained per acceleration is:  
   \[
   \Delta E = e \cdot U_0 = 190 \, \text{keV}.
   \]  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton is accelerated twice per revolution (once per gap between the dees). Therefore, the energy gained per revolution is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rev}} = 2 \cdot \Delta E = 2 \cdot 190 \, \text{keV} = 380 \, \text{keV}.
   \]

2. **Total Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total kinetic energy to be gained is \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV}\). The number of revolutions \(N\) is the total energy divided by the energy gained per revolution:  
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{\Delta E_{\text{rev}}} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{380 \, \text{keV}} = 2500.
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:  
   The calculated number of revolutions matches option D, which is \(2500\).

### Conclusion:
The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron to reach the kinetic energy of \(950 \, \text{MeV}\).
