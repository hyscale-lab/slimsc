Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my accelerator physics, but let's try to think through this.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is about 0. It goes through two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. I need to find how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, wait. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron where the magnetic field is varied to keep the particles in resonance as they gain energy. Oh right, in a normal cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency changes so the particles can keep up with the accelerating voltage.

The key here is probably the phase factor and the way the voltage is applied. Since the proton starts with negligible energy, maybe I can model its kinetic energy gain over time.

The voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(...), so each time the voltage peaks, the proton gets a little kick. But since the voltage is alternating, it only accelerates the proton when the cosine is positive, right? Wait, but in practice, the particles are accelerated each half-cycle. So maybe each half-period, the proton gains some energy.

But wait, the problem mentions two accelerations. Hmm, maybe it's a two-step process? Or perhaps the proton undergoes multiple bunching and accelerating cycles.

I remember that in cyclotrons, the time a particle takes to complete a revolution is its cyclotron period, which is T = (2π m)/(q B), where m is mass, q charge, B magnetic field. But since it's a synchrocyclotron, the B field changes over time to keep the resonance condition. So the frequency ν(α) probably changes as the proton gains energy.

Wait, the accelerating voltage is a function of time, but I think the key equation here is the energy gain. For a single bunching and acceleration cycle, the proton gains energy from the voltage. So each time it goes through the gap, it gets a certain amount of energy.

But wait, the voltage is a function of time and phase. The phase is Φ0 = π/4, so the initial phase is 45 degrees. How does this affect the acceleration?

The energy gain per revolution might depend on the voltage U0 and some function of the phase. Alternatively, since the voltage is sinusoidal, maybe the maximum energy transfer occurs when the voltage is at its peak, which happens at specific times.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the proton completes a half-period of the voltage, it gains a certain amount of energy. But let me think about the energy gained in an accelerating cycle.

Wait, in an ideal case, the energy gained per revolution is the peak voltage times some factor. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the energy is given by the integral of the voltage over time, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, let's think about the time it takes. The proton starts with almost zero energy, so its initial velocity is negligible, but each time it goes around, it gains some energy. The number of revolutions needed to reach 950 MeV would be the total energy divided by the energy gained per revolution.

But wait, how much energy does it gain per revolution? Let's think about the energy transfer. In a cyclotron, each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains energy equal to the voltage applied times the charge. But since it's a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is varying, so perhaps the energy per revolution isn't constant? Or maybe it is, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the voltage here is U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0]. Since the proton's motion is synchronized with the voltage, each time the voltage is at its maximum (like when the phase is such that the cosine is 1), the proton gets a maximum energy kick.

But the initial phase is π/4, so the first peak might not be at t=0. So the first maximum occurs when the argument is 0, which would be when 2π ν(α) t + Φ0 = 2π n, where n is integer. So the first time is when 2π ν t + π/4 = 2π, so 2π ν t = 7π/4 → t = (7π/4)/(2π ν) )= (7)/(8 ν). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the particle completes a revolution, it gains energy equal to U0. But wait, U0 is 190 kV, so each revolution gives 190 kV of energy. But the proton's charge is e, so the energy gained per revolution would be e * U0.

Wait, no. The energy gain per revolution would be e multiplied by the voltage applied during that revolution. But the voltage is oscillating, so each time the particle passes through the gap, the voltage might be at a positive peak, so the maximum energy gain is e * U0. But wait, the voltage is AC, so perhaps each time the proton goes through the gap, it's accelerated when the voltage is positive, so it gains energy e U0 per revolution.

If that's the case, then the total number of revolutions N is the total energy divided by energy per revolution. So N = T1 / (e U0) ).

Wait, T1 is 950 MeV. Let's compute that:

e U0 = 1.6e-19 C * 190e3 V = 1.6e-19 * 190e3 = (1.6 * 190) * 1e-16 = 304e-16 J. To get energy in eV, since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so:

e U0 (in eV) = (304e-16 J) / (1.6e-19 J/eV) )= (304e-16)/(1.6e-19) ) = (304 / 1.6) * 1e3 = (190) * 1e3 = 190,000 eV = 190 keV.

Wait, no. Wait, e U0 is 190 kV * e. So energy per revolution is 190 keV? So each revolution adds 190 keV to the proton's kinetic energy.

So the total energy needed is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV.

So the number of revolutions N is 950,000 keV / 190 keV per revolution.

N = 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000.

Wait, but the options have 5300 or 3536, etc. Wait, 950,000 / 190 = let's compute that.

950,000 divided by 190. Let me compute 950,000 / 190.

190 * 5000 = 950,000. So exactly 5000 revolutions.

But wait, the options don't have 5000. Let me check the options.

Options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Hmm, none of these is 5000. So maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps each revolution doesn't give a full U0, because of the phase factor.

The initial phase is phi0 = pi/4. So the first time the particle goes through, maybe the voltage isn't at the maximum, so the energy gain is less.

Wait, perhaps each time the particle goes through, the voltage is at a phase that gives a specific energy gain. Maybe the energy per revolution isn't a full U0, but depends on the phase.

Alternatively, the problem might involve the number of half-cycles or something else.

Wait, another approach: the number of revolutions is related to the total energy gained and the energy per revolution. But perhaps the synchrocyclotron's condition requires that the frequency of the voltage matches the revolution frequency as the proton gains energy.

Wait, the resonance condition for a synchrocyclotron is that the frequency of the applied voltage decreases as the proton's momentum increases. The relation is ν = (q B)/(2π m) * (1/(1 + (gamma))), where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But that's probably more complicated than needed.

Wait, but perhaps the energy gain per revolution is e U0, regardless of phase. Because the average energy gain is e U0, but considering the phase, perhaps it's a different number.

Alternatively, given that the initial phase is pi/4, the first time the proton passes through, the voltage may not be at maximum, so the first energy gain is less than U0. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the time it takes to reach the energy. The total energy is 950 MeV, which is much higher than the rest mass of the proton (~938 MeV). So the proton is ultrarelativistic.

In a synchrocyclotron, the time to reach a certain energy is determined by the number of revolutions and the energy per revolution.

But let me think again. If each revolution gives e U0, then 950,000 keV (950 MeV) divided by 190 keV per revolution is 5000 revolutions. But since the options don't include that, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, wait. I'm assuming that each revolution provides 190 keV. But that's the maximum possible. Because the voltage peaks at 190 kV, so if the proton passes through when the voltage is at peak, it gains 190 keV. But if the phase is pi/4, perhaps the first time it's not at the peak.

Wait, the initial phase is phi0 = pi/4. So when the proton makes its first pass, the voltage is cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707. So the voltage is about 190,000 * 0.707 ≈ 134, 000 V. So the energy gain would be e * 134,000 V ≈ 134 keV.

Hmm, that complicates things. So each time the proton goes around, the voltage is at a certain phase, and thus the energy gained varies.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the accelerating voltage is made to match the proton's cyclotron frequency as it gains energy. So the phase is such that each time the proton comes around, the voltage is at the right phase for maximum acceleration. So perhaps the initial phase is adjusted to make this happen, leading to maximum energy gain each time.

Wait, but the initial phase is given as pi/4, so it's fixed. Maybe that affects the first acceleration but not the rest. Or perhaps it's a steady state situation.

Alternatively, maybe the effective energy per revolution is (U0 / sqrt(2)) eV, since the initial phase is pi/4, which gives a maximum at a later time.

Wait, but I'm not sure. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternative approach: The number of revolutions N is the total energy divided by the energy per revolution. But if the initial phase affects the first acceleration, perhaps the first one is at a lower energy than the rest.

But considering that the problem states that the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations. So maybe it's accelerated twice, once per revolution? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, two steps of acceleration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem statement says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Maybe it's a two-stage process. So perhaps each stage contributes a certain number of revolutions.

Alternatively, perhaps each acceleration step occurs once per revolution, and to reach 950 MeV, it has to go through multiple steps.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for a formula or standard approach.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the maximum kinetic energy is given by T_max = (q U0 N) / 2, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the kinetic energy is T = e U0 N, where N is the number of times the proton is accelerated.

Wait, but that's perhaps simplistic. Let's think in terms of each acceleration step. Each time the proton goes through the gap, it gains energy e U0. So for N steps, the energy is N e U0.

So to get 950 MeV, N = 950e3 keV / (e * U0 in keV).

Wait, U0 is 190 kV, so e U0 is 190 keV. So N = 950,000 keV / 190 keV = 5000.

But none of the options are 5000, so perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the synchrocyclotron requires the phase to be matched each time, so the number of revolutions is less because the energy per revolution is higher? Or perhaps the voltage is applied in a way that the energy per revolution is not U0.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per revolution is (e U0) multiplied by the cosine of the phase. But the initial phase is pi/4, so cos(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, so energy per revolution would be about 134 keV. But that would make N = 950,000 / 134 ≈ 7097, which isn't an option either.

Wait, maybe the phase doesn't affect the energy per revolution because the system is designed to have the correct phase each time. So initial phase is just for synchronization, so each revolution provides maximum energy gain.

But then why is the initial phase given? That would suggest it's part of the setup, but the number of revolutions would be 5000, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Two steps? So perhaps each acceleration step contributes N revolutions. So two steps would have 2N revolutions? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. Let's recheck the given data.

Wait, U0 is 190 kV. So e U0 is 190 keV as before. The total energy is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV. So 950,000 / 190 = 5000.

But the options don't have 5000, so perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, wait a second. Let me check the energy per revolution again. Is it indeed e U0?

In a cyclotron, the energy gain per half-revolution is e U0. Because each time the proton passes through one of the gaps, it's accelerated once. So each revolution (two gaps) would give 2 e U0. Or wait, no: in a cyclotron, the alternating voltage is applied such that the proton is accelerated once per revolution. So each revolution provides a single acceleration of e U0.

Wait, no. Let me think. The cyclotron has two D-shaped electrodes. The voltage alternates between positive and negative. So as the proton moves, it passes through the gap once per revolution. So each time it goes through, it gains e U0. So N revolutions would give N e U0.

So in that case, yes, 950,000 keV / 190 keV = 5000.

But again, the options don't have 5000. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the energy is given in a different unit. Let me double-check. U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 V. e U0 is 190,000 eV = 190 keV.

So 950 MeV is 950,000 keV. 950,000 divided by 190 is 5000. So the number of revolutions is 5000. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 5300. That's close but not 5000. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 190 * 5000 = 950,000. Exactly. So why isn't that an option? Did I miss a factor?

Wait, perhaps the problem specifies the voltage is applied as a cosine, which implies that it's varying, so the actual energy per revolution is e U0 multiplied by the average value, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is not the same as the number of accelerations. Wait, if each revolution causes two accelerations (like two gaps), then perhaps the number of revolutions is half the number of accelerations. But the problem says two accelerations, which I'm not sure how that would apply.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is about the number of times the voltage has cycled, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another thought: the formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron is given by N = (gamma - 1) * (m c^2)/(e U0), where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But wait, the kinetic energy T is given, so gamma = (T + m c^2)/m c^2. Hmm, let's compute gamma.

Wait, T is 950 MeV. The rest mass energy of the proton is about 938 MeV. So T = 950 MeV is just a bit higher. So gamma is (950 + 938)/938 ≈ (1888)/938 ≈ 2.013.

So gamma ≈ 2.013.

Then N = (gamma - 1) * (m c^2)/(e U0)

But m c^2 is 938 MeV, e U0 is 190 keV = 0.190 MeV.

So N = (2.013 -1) * (938 MeV) / (0.190 MeV) ) = (1.013) * (938 / 0.190 )

Compute 938 / 0.190 = approx 938 / 0.2 = 4690. But 0.19 is 5/ (1/0.19) is approx 5.263.

Wait, 938 / 0.19 = let me compute:

0.19 * 5000 = 950, so 938 is 12 less. So 5000 - (12/0.19) ≈5000 - 63.16 ≈ 4936.84. But wait, 0.19 * 4936.84 = approx 938.

So 938 / 0.19 ≈ 4936.84.

So N ≈ 1.013 * 4936.84 ≈ about 5000.

Again, same result. So this seems to confirm N is about 5000.

But options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem gives U(t) as U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Phi0]. So the frequency depends on alpha, which I'm not sure about. Maybe alpha is the angle of the phase, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is found using the formula N = (gamma -1) * (m c^2) / (e U0). But using the same numbers, that gives 5000.

Hmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: the total number of revolutions N is given by the integral of dN/dt over time. But that might not help without knowing the time dependence.

Wait, the energy gained per revolution is e U0, so N = T1/(e U0) = 950e3 keV / (190 keV) ≈5000.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the voltage is applied as a function of time, and the number of times the voltage has completed a cycle is the number of revolutions?

Wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν t + Phi0]. So the frequency of the voltage is ν. The number of cycles in time t is ν t. The number of revolutions of the proton is N. The proton's angular frequency is omega = q B/(gamma m), but in a synchrocyclotron, B is changing to keep omega proportional to the driving frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is related to the number of cycles of the voltage.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is 5000, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait, the initial energy is T=0. So the proton starts from rest, but in reality, it's injected with negligible kinetic energy. So perhaps the first acceleration is not a full 190 keV. But after that, each revolution gives 190 keV.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (gamma) * (m c^2)/(e U0). So gamma is about 2, so N = 2 * 938e6 eV / 190,000 eV = 2 * 938 / 190 ≈ 2 * 4.9368 ≈ 9.87. No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase affects the first acceleration so that the first acceleration is just a part, but the rest are full. But I'm not sure how that would change the total number of revolutions.

Wait, perhaps the effective voltage is U0 times cos(phi0), which is sqrt(2)/2, so 0.707. So the first acceleration is e U0 * 0.707. Then the rest are e U0 each.

But then the total energy would be e U0 * 0.707 + (N-1)*e U0 = 950,000 keV.

So 0.707 *190 + 190*(N-1) )=950,000.

Wait, 0.707 *190 ≈134 keV. So 134 + 190 (N-1) = 950,000.

So 190 (N-1) = 950,000 - 134 ≈ 949,866.

N-1 = 949,866 / 190 ≈5000. So N ≈ 5001.

But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions because the system is designed to have the correct phase for each acceleration. So the initial phase may just be for phase locking, and each acceleration gives the full 190 keV.

So the correct answer would be 5000, but none of the options match. Then perhaps the correct option is not present, but since the closest option is B)5300, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait! Did I make a mistake in the energy per revolution? Let me think again.

Wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(...). The energy gained per revolution is e U0 (assuming maximum). But perhaps each time the particle passes through, it only gets a certain fraction due to the phase.

The initial phase is phi0=pi/4, so the first time the particle comes through, the voltage is cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2. So the first acceleration gives e U0 * sqrt(2)/2. Then, the next time, the phase has advanced by 2pi * nu * t. But if it's a synchrocyclotron, the frequency nu is varying to keep the phase in resonance.

Hm, but this is getting too complicated for a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps the number of revolutions is N = (gamma - 1) * (m c^2)/(e U0) * (1/2). Hmm, but why?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (gamma) * (m c^2)/(e U0) / (some factor).

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible options. The options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

If the correct answer is 5000, but it's not present, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, U0 is 190 kV. So e U0 is 190 keV.

The total energy is 950 MeV = 950,000 keV.

So 950,000 / 190 = 5000.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is 5000, but it's not among the options. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the voltage is applied as a function of time, and the number of revolutions is given by (gamma) * something else.

Wait, another approach: in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions is given by N = (gamma) * (m c^2)/(e U0) * (something). Wait, I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should think about the time taken. The time to reach the desired energy would be the number of revolutions divided by the frequency. But without knowing the frequency, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per revolution is not e U0, but e U0 multiplied by some factor due to the varying magnetic field. But without knowing how B changes, I can't compute that.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is 5000, but none of the options have it. So perhaps the correct option is not listed, but given the available choices, the closest higher option is B)5300.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 950,000 / 190 exactly.

950,000 divided by 190.

Computing:

190 × 5000 = 950,000. So exactly 5000.

So the correct number is 5000. Since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option B)5300, considering some approximations or different assumptions.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy per revolution.

Wait, wait another thing: in a synchrocyclotron, the energy gain per revolution is not constant because the magnetic field is varying. So the energy per revolution increases as the proton gains energy.

Wait, but that complicates things a lot. So the initial energy per revolution is lower, and it increases as the proton speeds up.

Hmm, that's a possibility. So each revolution gives more energy than the previous, so the total number of revolutions would be less than the 5000 I initially calculated.

So perhaps the average energy per revolution is (e U0) * (gamma_initial + gamma_final)/2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of revolutions is given by N = (gamma - 1) * (m c^2)/(e U0) ) / (some factor).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Since I don't have the formula, perhaps the intended approach is to calculate N = T1/(e U0) = 950e3 /190 =5000.

But since the options don't have it, perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is 5300.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage is applied for only a fraction of each revolution, but I don't know.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the voltage is applied twice per revolution, so the energy per revolution is 2 * e U0. So then N would be 950,000 / (2 *190 )= 950000/380≈2500. Which is option D.

So 2500 is option D.

But why would the energy per revolution be 2 e U0? Because each time the proton passes through the gap, it gains e U0, and perhaps it passes through twice per revolution.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the particle passes through two gaps per revolution, but only once is it accelerated because the voltage alternates. Wait, no. Each time the particle goes through a gap, it's being accelerated once. So each revolution gives one acceleration. So the initial assumption holds.

Alternatively, perhaps in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions is different.

Wait, but if the correct answer according to the initial approach is 5000, which isn't an option, but option C is 3536. 3536 *190= 671,840, which is less than 950,000. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the number of times the voltage has peaked. The number of peaks is N = T1/(e U0) ) =5000. But the number of peaks occurs every half cycle, so the number of cycles is 5000. So the total time would be t=N/(2 nu). But without knowing nu, I can't proceed.

Ah, maybe the number of peaks is equal to the number of revolutions. But that brings me back to 5000.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should pick the closest option, which is B)5300. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N= m c^2/(e U0) * (gamma -1). So N= (938e3 eV)/(190e3 eV) * (2.013 -1) )= (938/190) *1.013 ≈ 4.936 *1.013≈5.000. Again, same result.

So I think the correct answer is 5000, but since it's not an option, perhaps the problem has a typo. But if forced to choose among the options, perhaps the intended answer is B)5300 because of some rounding or miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated U0. Wait, U0 is 190 kV, so e U0 is 190 keV. But what if the voltage is 190 kV, and each revolution provides 2 * e U0? Then N=950e3/(2 *190e3)= 950/380≈2.5, 2500. Which is option D.

But why would each revolution provide 2*e U0? That's the part I'm not getting.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage is applied twice per revolution, so each revolution gets two kicks. Then each kick is e U0, so 2e U0 per revolution. Then N=950,000/ (380,000) )= 2.5, so 2500 revolutions.

Which is option D. But why would the voltage be applied twice per revolution?

Wait, in a cyclotron, the voltage alternates between the two electrodes, so the particle is accelerated once per revolution. So each revolution provides one acceleration of e U0.

But if the voltage is applied twice per revolution, perhaps each time the particle passes through a gap, it gets a kick. But that would require four gaps, which I don't think is the case.

Hmm. I'm not sure. I'll have to make a choice based on the initial calculation.

Since my initial calculation gives 5000, which is not an option, but the options given don't include it, I might have to reevaluate. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use N= (gamma) * (m c^2)/(e U0) ), which would be 2 * (938e3)/(190e3)= 9.87. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have N= (gamma) * (m c^2)/(e U0) ), which would be gamma * 938e3 /190e3.

Gamma is (950,000 +938e3 )/938e3 )= (1,888e3 )/938e3 ≈ 2.013.

So N= 2.013 * (938e3/190e3 )=2.013 * 4.9368≈10. So that would be about 10 revolutions, but that's not an option either.

I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't figure out where. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Given that my initial approach gives 5000, which is close to option B (5300), but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)3536.

Wait, 3536 * 190 = 671, 840, which is less than 950,000. So no.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by N = (gamma) * (m c^2)/(e U0) ), which would be gamma=2.013, so N=2 * (938e3) /190e3 )= 2 *4.9368≈9.87, which is not an option.

I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option B)5300, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron as it is accelerated from negligible kinetic energy to a final kinetic energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The alternating voltage applied in the accelerator is given by \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), with \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \). The goal is to calculate the number of revolutions \( N \) the proton makes.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain Per Revolution**:  
   The proton gains energy each time it passes through the accelerating gap. Assuming maximum energy transfer, the energy gained per revolution is approximately \( eU_0 \), where \( e \) is the proton's charge and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \). Thus, \( eU_0 = 190 \, \text{keV} \).

2. **Total Energy and Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total energy to be gained is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \). The number of revolutions \( N \) is calculated as:
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{eU_0} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV}} = 5000.
   \]

3. **Mismatch with Options**:  
   The calculated value of \( N = 5000 \) does not match any of the provided options:  
   - \( A) 1864 \)  
   - \( B) 5300 \)  
   - \( C) 3536 \)  
   - \( D) 2500 \).  

4. **Consideration of Initial Phase**:  
   The initial phase \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \) affects the first acceleration, as the voltage at \( t = 0 \) is \( U(0) = U_0 \cos(\Phi_0) = U_0 \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = U_0 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.707U_0 \). This reduces the energy gained in the first revolution to approximately \( 0.707 \cdot 190 \, \text{keV} \approx 134 \, \text{keV} \). Subsequent revolutions are assumed to provide the full \( 190 \, \text{keV} \). Adjusting for this, the total number of revolutions increases slightly, but the result remains close to \( 5000 \).

5. **Revisiting Options**:  
   Since \( 5000 \) is not an option, the closest value is \( B) 5300 \). This discrepancy could arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup, such as variations in the energy gain per revolution or rounding.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most reasonable choice is \( B) 5300 \), as it is the closest to the calculated value of \( 5000 \).
