Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I don't think the masses are directly relevant for this particular question about elemental abundances. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

The given data includes some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a method used to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere. The notation [X/Y]_i refers to the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to Y in star i relative to the Sun.

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, Star_1 has 0.3 dex higher Si/Fe ratio than the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So, Star_2's Mg/Si ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. That means the iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as the Sun's.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Similarly, Star_2's magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio is the same as the Sun's.

We're also given the photospheric composition for the Sun:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. That means nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. Hence, nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting the logs right. The formula is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Oh wait, no. Wait, the notation [X/Y]_i is defined as log10(nX/nY in star i) minus log10(nX/nY in Sun). So [X/Y]_i = log(nX_i / nY_i) - log(nX_sun / nY_sun) = log( (nX_i / nY_i) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) ) ) = log( (nX_i / nY_i) * (nY_sun / nX_sun) ) )

So, [X/Y]_i = log( (nX_i * nY_sun) / (nY_i * nX_sun) )

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of nX/nY in each star relative to the Sun.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so nSi1 / nSi2.

Hmm. Let's think about how to get Si in each star.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which means that in Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So in Star_2, Mg/Si is higher than Sun by 10^0.3. So, nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, but to get nSi1 and nSi2, perhaps I can express them in terms of Fe and Mg, then relate them through Fe and Mg abundances.

Another approach: Let's express the ratios in each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0. So, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Because [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0 → no change.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Wait, but nH is the hydrogen number density. For each star, the scale of nH could be different, but since we're looking at the ratio of Si in each, perhaps the nH cancels out. Because the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 would involve (nSi1/nH1) divided by (nSi2/nH2), but maybe nH1 and nH2 are not the same. Hmm, but I'm not given any other information about the overall density or pressure of the stars. Hmm. Maybe I can assume that the ratio nH1/nH2 is the same as the ratio of their total abundances? Or perhaps we don't need to consider it, because we can express the ratios in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe], etc.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of solar values.

Let me think about each star:

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Let’s denote this ratio as A. So, A = nFe_sun / nH_sun. But wait, from the given data, for the Sun:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → because the Sun's 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, nMg_sun / nH_sun = 1e-5, since 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log is -5 → 1e-5.

So, A = 3.16e-5.

Then, for Star_1, nFe1 = A * nH1.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

nSi_sun/nFe_sun = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * (nH_sun / nFe_sun ) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = ?

Wait, from the Sun's data, 12 + log(nFe/nH) is 7.5, so nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) is 7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But to find nSi_sun/nFe_sun, perhaps I need to know the solar Si abundance.

Wait, the problem doesn't give the solar Si abundance. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe I can compute it using the given solar Mg and Fe abundances.

Wait, but I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun or [Mg/Si]_sun. Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero? But wait, no. Let's see.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → which is log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But for [Mg/Si]_sun, it would be log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) = [Mg/Si]_sun. But we don't have that from the given data. Hmm, so perhaps I need to find the solar [Mg/Si], or perhaps the given data for the stars can be used without it.

Wait, the problem is about [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So, in Star_2, Mg/Si is higher than the solar ratio by 0.3 dex.

But to find nSi2, perhaps I can express it in terms of Mg and then relate to Star_1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express each star's abundance in terms of H, then find the ratio.

Let me tackle Star_1 first.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun).

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So, nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nFe1 is (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

So, nSi1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

= (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 *10^0.3.

So, nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 * 10^0.3.

But nSi_sun is part of the solar atmosphere. Wait, but we don't have nSi_sun given. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps we can find the solar [Mg/Si], which would allow us to express nSi_sun in terms of nMg_sun.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is not given. Wait, the given data for the Sun is [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Mg/Si]. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each star's composition.

Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe abundance is solar. [Si/Fe] is 0.3, so Si is higher than Fe by 10^0.3.

So, for Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than solar by 0.3 dex. So, if in the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is some value, then in Star_1 it's higher by 0.3.

Wait, but without knowing the Sun's [Si/Fe], perhaps I can't proceed. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero? No, that can't be. Because the Sun has elements in a certain ratio.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that [Fe/H]_sun is 0, which is true because the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero by definition. Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → so [Mg/H]_sun =0. So, the given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for the stars are relative to solar.

But I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. So, perhaps I can express each star's [Si/H] and then find the ratio.

Because [X/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to H compared to the Sun.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) =0 → so log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, for Star_1:

nSi1/nH1 = (nSi1/nFe1) * (nFe1/nH1) )

= [ (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 ] * (nFe_sun / nH_sun )

= (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) * 10^0.3.

So, nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

So, nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So, nSi2 = nMg2 / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ]

But nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2.

Substituting into nSi2:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2 ) ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [nMg_sun *nH2 / nH_sun ] / [ (nMg_sun * 10^0.3 ) / (nSi_sun ) ) ]

= [nH2 /nH_sun ] * [nSi_sun / (10^0.3) )

So, nSi2 = (nSi_sun / 10^0.3 ) * (nH2 / nH_sun )

So, now, for nSi1 and nSi2, expressed in terms of nH:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) *10^0.3 * nH1.

Wait, no. Earlier calculation for Star_1:

nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 → so nSi1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 * nH1.

Similarly, nSi2 = (nSi_sun / (10^0.3) ) * (nH2 / nH_sun )

So, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

[ (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 * nH1 ] / [ (nSi_sun / (10^0.3) ) * (nH2 / nH_sun ) ]

Simplify:

= [ (10^0.3) * nH1 ] / [ (1/10^0.3) * (nH2) ) ]

Because the nSi_sun and nH_sun terms cancel out.

So,

= (10^0.3) * nH1 *10^0.3 / nH2

= (10^(0.3 + 0.3 )) * (nH1 /nH2 )

= 10^0.6 * (nH1 /nH2 )

So, 10^0.6 is about 3.98, approximately 4.

So, the ratio is approximately 4 * (nH1 /nH2 )

Hmm. But I don't know nH1 and nH2. Wait, but perhaps the ratio can be expressed in terms of the stars' overall abundances.

Wait, but how else can I relate nH1 and nH2? Because without more data, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the stars have the same hydrogen density as the Sun. But that might not be correct since the stars have different masses and might have different atmospheric compositions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH1/nH2 can be determined from their metallicity or other given data.

Wait, looking back at the data, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, same as the Sun. So, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

But [Fe/H] is the same as the Sun, so it's solar metallicity. Similarly, Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, so nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But I don't think that gives me a relation between nH1 and nH2.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the total number of atoms, but I'm not given any information about the total density or pressure of the stars. So perhaps I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the ratio of H between the stars is the same as the ratio of Fe or Mg? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The ratio nSi1/nSi2 is 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2 ), which is about 3.98 * (nH1/nH2 ).

But without knowing nH1 and nH2, how can I find the ratio?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can relate nH1 and nH2 via their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2.

But I don't have any information about [Fe/Mg] or anything else that would tie nH1 and nH2 together.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the H ratio and assume that the stars' H densities are the same as the Sun's. That is, nH1 =nH_sun, nH2 =nH_sun. Then the ratio would be 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A (~3.9). But wait, let me check the given options.

Wait, the options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

But wait, that would be the case only if nH1 =nH2. But in reality, the stars might have different nH. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I can find a relation between nH1 and nH2 from the other abundances.

Wait, from the given data, I can think about the ratio of [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for the stars. But for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 and for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the ratio of H between the stars is the same as the ratio of their Fe or Mg, but that seems unclear.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the fact that [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0, so the abundances of Fe and Mg are the same as the Sun's in each star, respectively. Then, to find the ratio of Si in each star, perhaps I can express each in terms of Fe and Mg, and then tie them together.

Wait, so for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → Si is 10^0.3 times higher than Fe, which is solar. So, Si_1 = Fe_1 * 10^0.3.

For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → Mg_2 = Si_2 * 10^0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg_2 = H_2 * (Mg/H)_sun.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe_1 = H_1 * (Fe/H)_sun.

So, substituting:

For Star_1: Si_1 = Fe_1 * 10^0.3 = (H_1 * Fe_sun) / H_1? Wait, no.

Wait, Fe_1 = (Fe_sun / H_sun) * H_1.

Similarly, Si_1 = (Si_sun / H_sun) * H_1 * 10^0.3.

Wait, no, because [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (Si_1 / Fe_1) = (Si_sun/Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

So, Si_1 = Fe_1 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

But Fe_1 = (Fe_sun/H_sun) * H1.

So, Si_1 = (Fe_sun/H_sun * H1) * (Si_sun/Fe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

= (Si_sun / H_sun ) * H1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

Mg_2 = (Mg_sun / H_sun ) * H2.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → Mg_2 = Si_2 * (Mg_sun/Si_sun) *10^0.3.

So, substituting Mg_2:

(Mg_sun / H_sun ) * H2 = Si_2 * (Mg_sun / Si_sun ) *10^0.3.

Solving for Si_2:

Si_2 = [ (Mg_sun / H_sun ) * H2 ] / [ (Mg_sun / Si_sun ) *10^0.3 ) ]

= (Mg_sun * H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun / Mg_sun ) / 10^0.3.

Simplify:

= (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun / 10^0.3 )

So, Si_2 = (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun / 10^0.3 )

Now, the ratio of Si_1 to Si_2 is:

[ (Si_sun / H_sun ) * H1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun /10^0.3 ) ]

= [ (H1 / H_sun ) * Si_sun / H_sun * 10^0.3 ] divided by [ (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun / 10^0.3 ) ]

Wait, let's write it step by step.

Numerator: (Si_sun / H_sun ) * H1 *10^0.3.

Denominator: (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun / 10^0.3 )

So, ratio = [ (Si_sun / H_sun ) * H1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun /10^0.3 ) ]

The Si_sun terms cancel.

= [ (1/H_sun ) * H1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (H2 / H_sun ) * (1/10^0.3 ) ]

= [ H1 *10^0.3 / H_sun ] * [ H_sun / (H2 * 10^-0.3 ) ) ]

= [ H1 *10^0.3 * H_sun ] / [ H_sun * H2 *10^-0.3 ]

The H_sun terms cancel.

= (H1 *10^0.3 ) / ( H2 *10^-0.3 )

= (H1 / H2 ) *10^(0.3 + 0.3 )

= (H1/H2) *10^0.6.

Again, same as before. So, the ratio is 10^0.6 * (H1/H2).

But I still don't know H1/H2. Hmm. So, what's the way out?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars. But stars with different masses might not have the same H density. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the H density to another abundance.

Wait, but Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe abundance is same as Sun. Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, Mg same as Sun.

Is there any way to relate H1 and H2 using this information?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the problem expects me to proceed under the assumption that the H densities are the same, leading to a ratio of about 4. But let me think about the options.

Wait, the options are A) ~3.9, which is about 10^0.6. So, if H1=H2, then the ratio is 3.98, which is option A.

But am I allowed to make that assumption? The question doesn't state that the stars have the same H density. So that might be incorrect.

Hmm. So I'm stuck because without knowing H1 and H2, I can't find the ratio. Unless perhaps I'm missing some other way to relate H1 and H2.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same photospheric pressure, so the total number density n_total is same. But that would require knowing more about the stars, like their temperatures and gravities. Since the problem gives only masses, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H ratio cancels out.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is 10^0.6, regardless of H1 and H2. But that can't be unless H1/H2 is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the ratio in terms of [Fe/Mg] or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the problem again.

We need to find the ratio nSi1/nSi2.

We can express nSi1 in terms of Fe and nSi2 in terms of Mg.

Wait, for Star_1, nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

And for Star_2, nSi2 = nMg2 * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) *10^-0.3.

Wait, because [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 → nSi2 = nMg2 * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) *10^-0.3.

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun ) *nH1, and nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2.

So, nSi1 = [ (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1 ] * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Simplifying: nSi1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2 ] * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) *10^-0.3.

Simplifying: nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2 *10^-0.3.

So, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2 *10^-0.3 ].

The (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) terms cancel. So,

= (nH1 /nH2 ) *10^(0.3 +0.3 )

= (nH1/nH2 ) *10^0.6.

So again, same expression.

Hmm. So the ratio depends on nH1/nH2. Without knowing this, I can't determine the exact ratio.

Wait, but perhaps the problem provides another clue. For the Sun, the 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, which is the same as [Fe/H]_sun =0.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun is 0.

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H] is the same as the Sun, so the overall metallicity is same.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as Sun.

But how does this affect the H density?

Wait, perhaps I can think about the ratio of H in each star relative to the Sun.

Wait, the [X/H] is the logarithm of (X/H)_star over (X/H)_sun.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → Fe1 = Fe_sun * (H1/H_sun ), assuming same H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg2 = Mg_sun * (H2/H_sun )

But without more information, I can't relate H1 and H2.

Wait, but perhaps the stars have the same H density as the Sun. That is, nH1 =nH_sun and nH2 =nH_sun. Then nH1/nH2=1.

In that case, the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. The problem doesn't state that the stars have the same H density as the Sun. So perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the stars are main-sequence stars, and their H densities are such that their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are as given. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is only looking for the ratio of [Si/H] for each star, and then the ratio of those would be ( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ) = log( nSi1/nSi2 ), so the ratio is 10^ ( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 )

But how to find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

Let me compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Si/Fe]_1=0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 can be found.

For Star_2:

We have [Mg/H]_2=0 and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 =0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1=0.3, [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 is 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6 in log, so the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So, the ratio of nSi1/nSi2 is about 3.98, which is option A.

Ah! So this is the correct approach. Because:

[Si/H]_i = log(nSi_i /nH_i ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

So, for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3=0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Thus, [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6 → ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So, the ratio of silicon atoms is approximately 3.98, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and apply the following steps:

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: The iron-to-hydrogen ratio is the same as the Sun's.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: The silicon-to-iron ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: The magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio is the same as the Sun's.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: The magnesium-to-silicon ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.

3. **Solar Values**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Compute [Si/H] for Star_1
For Star_1:
- [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3 dex.

This means the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.

#### Step 2: Compute [Si/H] for Star_2
For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 dex.

This means the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is 0.3 dex lower than the Sun's.

#### Step 3: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{\left([{\text{Si/H}}]_1 - [{\text{Si/H}}]_2\right)} = 10^{\left(0.3 - (-0.3)\right)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating \(10^{0.6}\), we find:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.98**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I don't think the masses are directly relevant for this particular question about elemental abundances. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

The given data includes some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a method used to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere. The notation [X/Y]_i refers to the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to Y in star i relative to the Sun.

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, Star_1 has 0.3 dex higher Si/Fe ratio than the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So, Star_2's Mg/Si ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. That means the iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as the Sun's.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Similarly, Star_2's magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio is the same as the Sun's.

We're also given the photospheric composition for the Sun:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. That means nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. Hence, nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting the logs right. The formula is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Oh wait, no. Wait, the notation [X/Y]_i is defined as log10(nX/nY in star i) minus log10(nX/nY in Sun). So [X/Y]_i = log(nX_i / nY_i) - log(nX_sun / nY_sun) = log( (nX_i / nY_i) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) ) ) = log( (nX_i / nY_i) * (nY_sun / nX_sun) ) )

So, [X/Y]_i = log( (nX_i * nY_sun) / (nY_i * nX_sun) )

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of nX/nY in each star relative to the Sun.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so nSi1 / nSi2.

Hmm. Let's think about how to get Si in each star.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So, log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which means that in Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So in Star_2, Mg/Si is higher than Sun by 10^0.3. So, nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, but to get nSi1 and nSi2, perhaps I can express them in terms of Fe and Mg, then relate them through Fe and Mg abundances.

Another approach: Let's express the ratios in each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0. So, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Because [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0 → no change.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Wait, but nH is the hydrogen number density. For each star, the scale of nH could be different, but since we're looking at the ratio of Si in each, perhaps the nH cancels out. Because the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 would involve (nSi1/nH1) divided by (nSi2/nH2), but maybe nH1 and nH2 are not the same. Hmm, but I'm not given any other information about the overall density or pressure of the stars. Hmm. Maybe I can assume that the ratio nH1/nH2 is the same as the ratio of their total abundances? Or perhaps we don't need to consider it, because we can express the ratios in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe], etc.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of solar values.

Let me think about each star:

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. Let’s denote this ratio as A. So, A = nFe_sun / nH_sun. But wait, from the given data, for the Sun:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5) → because the Sun's 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, nMg_sun / nH_sun = 1e-5, since 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log is -5 → 1e-5.

So, A = 3.16e-5.

Then, for Star_1, nFe1 = A * nH1.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) + 0.3.

nSi_sun/nFe_sun = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * (nH_sun / nFe_sun ) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = ?

Wait, from the Sun's data, 12 + log(nFe/nH) is 7.5, so nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) is 7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But to find nSi_sun/nFe_sun, perhaps I need to know the solar Si abundance.

Wait, the problem doesn't give the solar Si abundance. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe I can compute it using the given solar Mg and Fe abundances.

Wait, but I don't have [Si/Fe]_sun or [Mg/Si]_sun. Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero? But wait, no. Let's see.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → which is log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But for [Mg/Si]_sun, it would be log(nMg_sun / nSi_sun) = [Mg/Si]_sun. But we don't have that from the given data. Hmm, so perhaps I need to find the solar [Mg/Si], or perhaps the given data for the stars can be used without it.

Wait, the problem is about [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So, in Star_2, Mg/Si is higher than the solar ratio by 0.3 dex.

But to find nSi2, perhaps I can express it in terms of Mg and then relate to Star_1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express each star's abundance in terms of H, then find the ratio.

Let me tackle Star_1 first.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1 / nH_sun).

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So, nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But nFe1 is (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

So, nSi1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Simplify:

= (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 *10^0.3.

So, nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 * 10^0.3.

But nSi_sun is part of the solar atmosphere. Wait, but we don't have nSi_sun given. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps we can find the solar [Mg/Si], which would allow us to express nSi_sun in terms of nMg_sun.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is not given. Wait, the given data for the Sun is [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Mg/Si]. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each star's composition.

Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe abundance is solar. [Si/Fe] is 0.3, so Si is higher than Fe by 10^0.3.

So, for Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than solar by 0.3 dex. So, if in the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is some value, then in Star_1 it's higher by 0.3.

Wait, but without knowing the Sun's [Si/Fe], perhaps I can't proceed. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero? No, that can't be. Because the Sun has elements in a certain ratio.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that [Fe/H]_sun is 0, which is true because the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero by definition. Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun is given as 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → so [Mg/H]_sun =0. So, the given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for the stars are relative to solar.

But I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2. So, perhaps I can express each star's [Si/H] and then find the ratio.

Because [X/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to H compared to the Sun.

Wait, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) ) =0 → so log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) +0.3.

So, for Star_1:

nSi1/nH1 = (nSi1/nFe1) * (nFe1/nH1) )

= [ (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3 ] * (nFe_sun / nH_sun )

= (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) * 10^0.3.

So, nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) * 10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

So, nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So, nSi2 = nMg2 / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ]

But nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2.

Substituting into nSi2:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2 ) ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [nMg_sun *nH2 / nH_sun ] / [ (nMg_sun * 10^0.3 ) / (nSi_sun ) ) ]

= [nH2 /nH_sun ] * [nSi_sun / (10^0.3) )

So, nSi2 = (nSi_sun / 10^0.3 ) * (nH2 / nH_sun )

So, now, for nSi1 and nSi2, expressed in terms of nH:

nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) *10^0.3 * nH1.

Wait, no. Earlier calculation for Star_1:

nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 → so nSi1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 * nH1.

Similarly, nSi2 = (nSi_sun / (10^0.3) ) * (nH2 / nH_sun )

So, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

[ (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 * nH1 ] / [ (nSi_sun / (10^0.3) ) * (nH2 / nH_sun ) ]

Simplify:

= [ (10^0.3) * nH1 ] / [ (1/10^0.3) * (nH2) ) ]

Because the nSi_sun and nH_sun terms cancel out.

So,

= (10^0.3) * nH1 *10^0.3 / nH2

= (10^(0.3 + 0.3 )) * (nH1 /nH2 )

= 10^0.6 * (nH1 /nH2 )

So, 10^0.6 is about 3.98, approximately 4.

So, the ratio is approximately 4 * (nH1 /nH2 )

Hmm. But I don't know nH1 and nH2. Wait, but perhaps the ratio can be expressed in terms of the stars' overall abundances.

Wait, but how else can I relate nH1 and nH2? Because without more data, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the stars have the same hydrogen density as the Sun. But that might not be correct since the stars have different masses and might have different atmospheric compositions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH1/nH2 can be determined from their metallicity or other given data.

Wait, looking back at the data, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, same as the Sun. So, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

But [Fe/H] is the same as the Sun, so it's solar metallicity. Similarly, Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, so nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But I don't think that gives me a relation between nH1 and nH2.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the total number of atoms, but I'm not given any information about the total density or pressure of the stars. So perhaps I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the ratio of H between the stars is the same as the ratio of Fe or Mg? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The ratio nSi1/nSi2 is 10^0.6 * (nH1/nH2 ), which is about 3.98 * (nH1/nH2 ).

But without knowing nH1 and nH2, how can I find the ratio?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can relate nH1 and nH2 via their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2.

But I don't have any information about [Fe/Mg] or anything else that would tie nH1 and nH2 together.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the H ratio and assume that the stars' H densities are the same as the Sun's. That is, nH1 =nH_sun, nH2 =nH_sun. Then the ratio would be 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A (~3.9). But wait, let me check the given options.

Wait, the options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

But wait, that would be the case only if nH1 =nH2. But in reality, the stars might have different nH. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I can find a relation between nH1 and nH2 from the other abundances.

Wait, from the given data, I can think about the ratio of [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] for the stars. But for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 and for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the ratio of H between the stars is the same as the ratio of their Fe or Mg, but that seems unclear.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the fact that [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0, so the abundances of Fe and Mg are the same as the Sun's in each star, respectively. Then, to find the ratio of Si in each star, perhaps I can express each in terms of Fe and Mg, and then tie them together.

Wait, so for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → Si is 10^0.3 times higher than Fe, which is solar. So, Si_1 = Fe_1 * 10^0.3.

For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → Mg_2 = Si_2 * 10^0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg_2 = H_2 * (Mg/H)_sun.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe_1 = H_1 * (Fe/H)_sun.

So, substituting:

For Star_1: Si_1 = Fe_1 * 10^0.3 = (H_1 * Fe_sun) / H_1? Wait, no.

Wait, Fe_1 = (Fe_sun / H_sun) * H_1.

Similarly, Si_1 = (Si_sun / H_sun) * H_1 * 10^0.3.

Wait, no, because [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (Si_1 / Fe_1) = (Si_sun/Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

So, Si_1 = Fe_1 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

But Fe_1 = (Fe_sun/H_sun) * H1.

So, Si_1 = (Fe_sun/H_sun * H1) * (Si_sun/Fe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Simplify:

= (Si_sun / H_sun ) * H1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

Mg_2 = (Mg_sun / H_sun ) * H2.

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → Mg_2 = Si_2 * (Mg_sun/Si_sun) *10^0.3.

So, substituting Mg_2:

(Mg_sun / H_sun ) * H2 = Si_2 * (Mg_sun / Si_sun ) *10^0.3.

Solving for Si_2:

Si_2 = [ (Mg_sun / H_sun ) * H2 ] / [ (Mg_sun / Si_sun ) *10^0.3 ) ]

= (Mg_sun * H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun / Mg_sun ) / 10^0.3.

Simplify:

= (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun / 10^0.3 )

So, Si_2 = (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun / 10^0.3 )

Now, the ratio of Si_1 to Si_2 is:

[ (Si_sun / H_sun ) * H1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun /10^0.3 ) ]

= [ (H1 / H_sun ) * Si_sun / H_sun * 10^0.3 ] divided by [ (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun / 10^0.3 ) ]

Wait, let's write it step by step.

Numerator: (Si_sun / H_sun ) * H1 *10^0.3.

Denominator: (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun / 10^0.3 )

So, ratio = [ (Si_sun / H_sun ) * H1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (H2 / H_sun ) * (Si_sun /10^0.3 ) ]

The Si_sun terms cancel.

= [ (1/H_sun ) * H1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (H2 / H_sun ) * (1/10^0.3 ) ]

= [ H1 *10^0.3 / H_sun ] * [ H_sun / (H2 * 10^-0.3 ) ) ]

= [ H1 *10^0.3 * H_sun ] / [ H_sun * H2 *10^-0.3 ]

The H_sun terms cancel.

= (H1 *10^0.3 ) / ( H2 *10^-0.3 )

= (H1 / H2 ) *10^(0.3 + 0.3 )

= (H1/H2) *10^0.6.

Again, same as before. So, the ratio is 10^0.6 * (H1/H2).

But I still don't know H1/H2. Hmm. So, what's the way out?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars. But stars with different masses might not have the same H density. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the H density to another abundance.

Wait, but Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so Fe abundance is same as Sun. Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, Mg same as Sun.

Is there any way to relate H1 and H2 using this information?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the problem expects me to proceed under the assumption that the H densities are the same, leading to a ratio of about 4. But let me think about the options.

Wait, the options are A) ~3.9, which is about 10^0.6. So, if H1=H2, then the ratio is 3.98, which is option A.

But am I allowed to make that assumption? The question doesn't state that the stars have the same H density. So that might be incorrect.

Hmm. So I'm stuck because without knowing H1 and H2, I can't find the ratio. Unless perhaps I'm missing some other way to relate H1 and H2.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same photospheric pressure, so the total number density n_total is same. But that would require knowing more about the stars, like their temperatures and gravities. Since the problem gives only masses, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H ratio cancels out.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is 10^0.6, regardless of H1 and H2. But that can't be unless H1/H2 is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the ratio in terms of [Fe/Mg] or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the problem again.

We need to find the ratio nSi1/nSi2.

We can express nSi1 in terms of Fe and nSi2 in terms of Mg.

Wait, for Star_1, nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

And for Star_2, nSi2 = nMg2 * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) *10^-0.3.

Wait, because [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 → nSi2 = nMg2 * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) *10^-0.3.

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun ) *nH1, and nMg2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2.

So, nSi1 = [ (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1 ] * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Simplifying: nSi1 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *nH1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2 ] * (nSi_sun /nMg_sun ) *10^-0.3.

Simplifying: nSi2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *nH2 *10^-0.3.

So, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2 *10^-0.3 ].

The (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) terms cancel. So,

= (nH1 /nH2 ) *10^(0.3 +0.3 )

= (nH1/nH2 ) *10^0.6.

So again, same expression.

Hmm. So the ratio depends on nH1/nH2. Without knowing this, I can't determine the exact ratio.

Wait, but perhaps the problem provides another clue. For the Sun, the 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, which is the same as [Fe/H]_sun =0.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_sun is 0.

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H] is the same as the Sun, so the overall metallicity is same.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → same as Sun.

But how does this affect the H density?

Wait, perhaps I can think about the ratio of H in each star relative to the Sun.

Wait, the [X/H] is the logarithm of (X/H)_star over (X/H)_sun.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → Fe1 = Fe_sun * (H1/H_sun ), assuming same H_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg2 = Mg_sun * (H2/H_sun )

But without more information, I can't relate H1 and H2.

Wait, but perhaps the stars have the same H density as the Sun. That is, nH1 =nH_sun and nH2 =nH_sun. Then nH1/nH2=1.

In that case, the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. The problem doesn't state that the stars have the same H density as the Sun. So perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the stars are main-sequence stars, and their H densities are such that their [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are as given. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is only looking for the ratio of [Si/H] for each star, and then the ratio of those would be ( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ) = log( nSi1/nSi2 ), so the ratio is 10^ ( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 )

But how to find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

Let me compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Si/Fe]_1=0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 can be found.

For Star_2:

We have [Mg/H]_2=0 and [Mg/Si]_2=0.3.

[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 =0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1=0.3, [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

So, the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 is 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6 in log, so the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So, the ratio of nSi1/nSi2 is about 3.98, which is option A.

Ah! So this is the correct approach. Because:

[Si/H]_i = log(nSi_i /nH_i ) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun )

So, for Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3=0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 =-0.3.

Thus, [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = 0.3 - (-0.3) =0.6 → ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So, the ratio of silicon atoms is approximately 3.98, which is option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and apply the following steps:

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: The iron-to-hydrogen ratio is the same as the Sun's.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: The silicon-to-iron ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: The magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio is the same as the Sun's.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: The magnesium-to-silicon ratio is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.

3. **Solar Values**:
   - 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
   - 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

### Analysis:
#### Step 1: Compute [Si/H] for Star_1
For Star_1:
- [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3 dex.

This means the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun's.

#### Step 2: Compute [Si/H] for Star_2
For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 dex.

This means the silicon-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is 0.3 dex lower than the Sun's.

#### Step 3: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{\left([{\text{Si/H}}]_1 - [{\text{Si/H}}]_2\right)} = 10^{\left(0.3 - (-0.3)\right)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Approximating \(10^{0.6}\), we find:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.98**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
