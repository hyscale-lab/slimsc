Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit light across the electromagnetic spectrum, and their observed features can tell us something about the universe's expansion and structure.

The question says that the quasar has a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, I think this peak is related to the Lyman-alpha emission line, but wait, no, Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm. Oh wait, maybe it's another line. Or perhaps it's something to do with the redshift. Oh, right! If the observed wavelength is longer than emitted, that's due to redshift. So the peak at 790 nm must be the rest wavelength in the quasar's frame, or perhaps the emitted wavelength is shorter and this is the observed.

Wait, let me think. If the quasar is moving away from us, the observed wavelength is longer. So if the emitted wavelength is say, near UV, but we observe it in near IR, it's been redshifted. So 790 nm is in the near infrared, which is longer than visible. So the quasar is probably at a high redshift.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance. Comoving distance depends on the universe's geometry and the expansion history. The parameters given are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ωk=0). 

Comoving distance is given by the integral from a=0 to a=1 (since it's for a=1) of 1/(a² H) da, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the comoving distance to a source at redshift z is given by (c/H0) * some function involving Ωm and Ωλ, integrated over the expansion history.

Wait, but how do I connect this to the quasar's observed wavelength? Oh! The peak at 790 nm could be from a specific emission line. For example, the Lyman-alpha line emitted at 121.6 nm. If the quasar's emitted wavelength is 121.6 nm, but we observe it at 790 nm, the redshift z would be (observed - emitted)/emitted. So z=(790-121.6)/121.6 ≈ 668.4/121.6 ≈ 5.5, so z≈5.5.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the Balmer series. Wait, hydrogen's Balmer-alpha is about 656 nm in the rest frame. So if the observed is 790, then z=(790-656)/656 ≈ 134/656 ≈ 0.204. But that would be a much lower redshift. Hmm, but 790 is in the near infrared, which is longer than 700 nm. So if the rest wavelength is, say, around 400 nm (violet), then observed at 790 would be (790/400)= ~1.975, so z=0.975. But that's a lower redshift.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the possibility that the peak is the Lyman-alpha line. So Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. If it's observed at 790, that's a redshift of (790 - 121.6)/121.6 = 668.4/121.6 ≈ 5.5. So z≈5.5.

But wait, another possibility is that the peak is from the Lyman break. The Lyman break is the transition from the Lyman series, so it's around 91 nm (the ionization edge of hydrogen). But if the quasar's spectrum shows a peak beyond the Lyman break, that suggests a high redshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the 790 nm peak is the rest wavelength of a certain emission line, so let's say it's emitted at 790 nm. But then, why would flux drop below that? Maybe it's a characteristic of the quasar's emission, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the 21 cm line, but that's in radio waves. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the peak is the Lyman limit. The Lyman limit is about 91 nm, so if the quasar is at a high redshift, the observed wavelength would be longer. So if the peak is at 790, that would be (790/91) ≈ 8.68 times longer. So z≈7.68? Because (1 + z) = observed / emitted. So z= (790/91) -1 ≈ 8.68 -1 = 7.68.

Wait that's a high redshift. But how does that help me find the comoving distance?

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a more prominent emission line. For example, the Lyman-alpha line is the most prominent in quasars. So if the quasar's Lyman-alpha is observed at 790 nm, then z = (790 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 6.5. So z≈6.5.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think differently. The question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is given by c/H0 multiplied by an integral that depends on the cosmological parameters. The formula is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) dz' / E(z')

Where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm(1+z)^3 + Ωλ(1+z)^{3(1+w)}), but dark energy is usually modeled with a constant w=-1, so (1+z)^3(1-1)= (1+z)^0=1. So E(z) = sqrt(Ωm (1+z)^3 + Ωλ).

Alternatively, integrating 1/E(z') from 0 to z, then multiplied by c/H0.

So for a given z, the comoving distance is D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ)] dz'

Hmm, so I need to calculate this integral for a given z to find D_C.

But I don't have the exact value of z. So the key is to figure out the redshift of the quasar based on the given peak.

Wait, another thought: the peak at 790 nm is in the near-infrared, and the flux drops below that. Maybe the peak is due to the 912 Angstrom (91.2 nm) Lyman limit. Because the Lyman limit is 91.2 nm, and if the quasar is at a redshift where the Lyman limit is observed at 790 nm, then (1 + z) = 790 / 91.2 ≈ 8.66. So z ≈7.66.

So the redshift z is about 7.66.

Now, using this z, I can compute the comoving distance.

But wait, I'm not sure if the peak is the Lyman limit or another line. If it's the Lyman limit, then the calculation is as above. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is observed to be at 790 nm. Then, z = (790 - 121.6)/121.6 ≈ 5.5.

But then, with z=5.5, what's the comoving distance?

I think I'll need to proceed under the assumption that the quasar has a redshift corresponding to this peak. So assuming that the peak is from the Lyman-alpha line at 790 nm, so z≈5.5. Alternatively, if it's the Lyman limit, z≈7.66.

But I think the Lyman-alpha line is more commonly used in such observations. So perhaps z≈5.5.

Now, the comoving distance for a given z in a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

The integral for D_C is (c/H0) * ∫0^z dz' / sqrt(Ωm(1+z')^3 + Ωλ).

But this integral doesn't have a simple analytic solution, so I might need to approximate it or use a table or remember some approximate values for D_C at certain redshifts.

Wait, I remember that for high redshifts, the comoving distance increases, but the exact value depends on the matter and dark energy content.

Alternatively, I can try to compute the integral numerically, but that's time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall some approximate comoving distances for certain redshifts. For example, at z=1, the comoving distance is about 1.5 Gpc. At z=2, it's about 2.9 Gpc. At z=5, it might be around 10 Gpc or more.

Wait, let me think about that. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c is about 3e5 km/s. So c/H0 = (3e5) / 70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc. So about 4.285 Gpc.

But the integral part depends on E(z). For small z, E(z) ≈ sqrt(Ωm (1 + 3z) + Ωλ). For higher z, the matter term dominates early on, and dark energy later.

So for z=5.5, the integral is ∫0^5.5 dz' / sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

Hmm, to compute this, perhaps I can approximate the integral by breaking it into parts, but this might take a while.

Alternatively, I can use a cosmology calculator or lookup table, but since I don't have that, I'll have to estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a matter-dominated universe, but since dark energy is also present, it complicates things.

Wait, for Ωm=0.3, the universe is dark energy dominated at z < about 0.5, and matter dominated at higher z. So for z=5.5, matter dominates.

In a matter-only universe (Ωm=1, Ωλ=0), the comoving distance is 2c/H0 * (1/(sqrt(Ωm))) * sinh^{-1}( (z+1) * sqrt(Ωm) / 2 ) / sqrt(Ωm) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the comoving distance in a matter-only universe is (c/H0) * (2/(sqrt(Ωm))) * sinh^{-1}(sqrt(Ωm) (1+z)/2 ) )

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The integral for matter-only is ∫0^z dz' / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 )

= ∫0^z dz' / sqrt(Ωm) (1+z')^1.5 )

= 1/sqrt(Ωm) ∫0^z (1+z')^{-1.5} dz'

= 1/sqrt(Ωm) [ 2/(1 + z) ) ]_0^z

= 2/( sqrt(Ωm) ) * (1/(1+z) - 1 )

Wait, at high redshift, (1/(1+z) -1 ) ≈ -1, so that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the integral.

Wait, the integral ∫ (1 + z')^{-1.5} dz' is [ -2/(1 + z')^{0.5} ) ] + C.

So evaluating from 0 to z gives [ -2/(1 + z)^0.5 + 2/(1 + 0) ] = 2 (1 - 1/(sqrt(1+z)) )

So the integral becomes (1/sqrt(Ωm)) * 2(1 - 1/sqrt(1+z)) )

Then, D_C = (c/H0) * (1/sqrt(Ωm)) * 2 (1 - 1/sqrt(1+z) )

Ah, that makes sense.

But wait, in our case, the universe has both matter and dark energy.

So, perhaps I can approximate the integral for z=5.5. Let's compute the integral ∫0^5.5 dz' / sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7 )

Hmm, let's compute this numerically. Let me think about how to approximate this.

We can approximate the integral by breaking it into a few intervals and using the midpoint rule or trapezoidal rule.

But perhaps a better approach is to use software, but since I can't, I'll have to make some rough estimates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a known approximation. For a flat universe with Ωm=0.3 and Ωλ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5.5 should be around 10 Gpc or so.

Wait, let's think about H0 =70, so c/H0 is about 4.28 Gpc. But the integral is the factor by which this is multiplied.

In a matter-only universe, the integral at z=5.5 would be 2/(sqrt(0.3)) [1 - 1/sqrt(1+5.5) ].

sqrt(0.3) is approximately 0.5477.

So 2/(0.5477)= approx 3.65.

sqrt(1+5.5)=sqrt(6.5)=approx 2.55.

So 1 - 1/2.55 ≈ 0.61.

So 3.65 * 0.61 ≈ 2.23.

So in a matter-only universe, D_C = 4.28 Gpc * 2.23 ≈ 9.57 Gpc.

But our universe has dark energy, which accelerates expansion, so the comoving distance should be a bit less than the matter-only case because dark energy causes expansion to accelerate, making the universe younger and the comoving distance shorter for a given z.

Wait, but wait: at high z, matter dominated, so the presence of dark energy doesn't affect as much as at lower z. So maybe the comoving distance is just a bit less than 9.57 Gpc.

But wait, in our case, the dark energy is 70% so perhaps the integral is a little less than the matter-only case. Because dark energy contributes positively to the expansion, making the universe expand faster, which would make the integral (which is a sort of time integral) smaller. Because if expansion is faster, the scale factor a increases more quickly, so the same redshift is achieved in less time, leading to a smaller integral.

Wait, perhaps. So for a higher expansion rate (with dark energy), the denominator in the integrand is larger, so each dz' contributes less, making the integral smaller.

So in our case, for the same z, D_C would be smaller than in the matter-only case.

So for the matter-only case, it's ~9.5 Gpc. With dark energy, it would be less than that, perhaps around 8 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc and C is 9 Gpc. But wait, the question gives the comoving distance for a=1. Wait, no: the question says "comoving distance (for scale factor a=1) of this quasar from the Earth". Wait, but scale factor a=1 is the present time, so the comoving distance is the same as the distance at current time.

Wait, but wait, comoving distance is a=1. Hmm, but wait, the comoving distance is a fixed value at a=1, which is the same as our current scale factor. So maybe I was correct earlier.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the peak isn't from Lyman-alpha but from another line, leading to a lower z.

Wait, another approach: the peak at 790 nm is in the near-infrared. Quasars have broad emission lines, so perhaps the peak is from a higher-order Balmer line. For example, H-alpha is about 656 nm, H-beta about 486 nm. So if H-alpha is observed at 790 nm, z=(790-656)/656 ≈ 134/656≈0.204.

But 0.204 is a low redshift. The comoving distance for z=0.2 would be roughly (c/H0) * (1+z) * something. Wait, for small z, the comoving distance is approximately (c/H0) * (1 + (1 + q0)/2 z) ), but q0 is the deceleration parameter, which for our universe is negative because of dark energy. Hmm, maybe I shouldn't go that way.

Alternatively, for small z, the comoving distance can be approximated as D_C ≈ (c/H0) * [ (2/(1 + sqrt(Ωm)) ) * (1 + (1 - sqrt(Ωm))/2 z ) ) ].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to recall that at z=0.2, the comoving distance is about (c/H0) * (1+z) / H0 * some factor, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a better way. Let me think about the standard ruler.

Wait, the peak at 790 nm is the Lyman-alpha emission line, which is about 121.6 nm in rest frame. So 790/121.6 is about 6.5, so z≈5.5.

So using z=5.5 and the cosmological parameters, what's the comoving distance?

I found earlier that in a matter-only universe, D_C would be about 9.5 Gpc. But with dark energy, it's less.

But looking for an approximate value, perhaps around 8 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc.

But wait, another way: I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

The comoving distance is:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z dz' / sqrt( Ωm (1 + z')^3 + Ωλ )

Let me approximate the integral for z=5.5 numerically.

I can break the integral into intervals and use the trapezoidal rule.

Let's choose intervals of 0.5 in z.

So z goes from 0 to 5.5, in steps of 0.5: 0, 0.5, 1.0, ...,5.5.

Compute E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7) for each step.

Compute the integral using the trapezoidal rule.

The function to integrate is 1/E(z) for each z.

So the integral is the sum over each interval of (Δz/2) * [f(z_i) + f(z_{i+1})] ]

Let me compute f(z) = 1/sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 +0.7 ) for each z from 0 to 5.5 in steps of 0.5.

z=0:

E(0) = sqrt(0.3*(1)^3 + 0.7) = sqrt(0.3 +0.7)=1. So f(0)=1.

z=0.5:

E(0.5)= sqrt(0.3*(1.5)^3 +0.7 )= 0.3*3.375=1.0125 +0.7=1.7125 → sqrt≈1.3086 → f=1/1.3086≈0.764.

z=1: E(1)= sqrt(0.3*(2)^3 +0.7 )=0.3*8=2.4 +0.7=3.1 → sqrt≈1.760 → f≈0.568.

z=1.5: (1+1.5)=2.5^3=15.625. 0.3*15.625=4.6875 +0.7=5.3875 → sqrt≈2.321 → f≈0.431.

z=2: (1+2)=3^3=27. 0.3*27=8.1 +0.7=8.8 → sqrt≈2.966 → f≈0.337.

z=2.5: (3.5)^3=42.875. 0.3*42.875=12.8625 +0.7=13.5625 → sqrt≈3.682 → f≈0.272.

z=3: (4)^3=64. 0.3*64=19.2 +0.7=19.9 → sqrt≈4.461 → f≈0.224.

z=3.5: (4.5)^3=91.125. 0.3*91.125=27.3375 +0.7=28.0375 → sqrt≈5.295 → f≈0.189.

z=4: (5)^3=125. 0.3*125=37.5 +0.7=38.2 → sqrt≈6.18 → f≈0.162.

z=4.5: (5.5)^3=166.375. 0.3*166.375=49.9125 +0.7=50.6125 → sqrt≈7.114 → f≈0.1406.

z=5: (6)^3=216. 0.3*216=64.8 +0.7=65.5 → sqrt≈8.093 → f≈0.1236.

z=5.5: (6.5)^3=274.625. 0.3*274.625=82.3875 +0.7=83.0875 → sqrt≈9.115 → f≈0.1097.

Now, the trapezoidal rule for each interval:

Δz =0.5.

Compute the sum:

Between z=0 and 0.5:

(0.5/2) * (1 + 0.764 ) = 0.25 * 1.764 = 0.441.

Between 0.5 and 1.0:

0.25*(0.764 +0.568 )=0.25*(1.332)=0.333.

1.0-1.5:

0.25*(0.568 +0.431 )=0.25*(0.999)≈0.2498.

1.5-2.0:

0.25*(0.431+0.337)=0.25*(0.768)=0.192.

2.0-2.5:

0.25*(0.337+0.272)=0.25*(0.609)=0.152.

2.5-3.0:

0.25*(0.272+0.224)=0.25*(0.496)=0.124.

3.0-3.5:

0.25*(0.224+0.189)=0.25*(0.413)=0.103.

3.5-4.0:

0.25*(0.189+0.162)=0.25*(0.351)=0.08775.

4.0-4.5:

0.25*(0.162 +0.1406)=0.25*(0.3026)=0.07565.

4.5-5.0:

0.25*(0.1406 +0.1236)=0.25*(0.2642)=0.06605.

5.0-5.5:

0.25*(0.1236 +0.1097)=0.25*(0.2333)=0.058325.

Now sum all these contributions:

0.441 +0.333 =0.774

+0.2498=1.0238

+0.192=1.2158

+0.152=1.3678

+0.124=1.4918

+0.103=1.5948

+0.08775=1.68255

+0.07565=1.7582

+0.06605=1.82425

+0.058325=1.882575.

So the integral is approximately 1.882575.

Wait, but the trapezoidal rule is an approximation. The exact integral would be a bit different, but this gives us an estimate.

So the integral is approximately 1.8826.

Now, D_C = (c / H0) * integral.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0 = (3e5) /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc ≈4.2857 Gpc.

So D_C = 4.2857 Gpc * 1.8826 ≈ 8.13 Gpc.

So approximately 8.1 Gpc, which would round to about 8 Gpc.

Looking at the options, option B is 8 Gpc.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the comoving distance of the quasar from the Earth, we analyze the given observations and cosmological parameters. The quasar exhibits a peak at a wavelength of 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, with flux dropping significantly below this wavelength. This suggests the peak is due to a high-redshift phenomenon, likely associated with the Lyman-alpha emission line of hydrogen, which has a rest wavelength of 121.6 nm. The redshift \( z \) is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\text{observed wavelength}}{\text{rest wavelength}} - 1 = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 5.5.
\]

With \( z \approx 5.5 \), we use the cosmological parameters provided: \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \), and a flat universe (\( \Omega_k = 0 \)). The comoving distance \( D_C \) is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}},
\]

where \( c \approx 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). The term \( c / H_0 \) is approximately:

\[
\frac{c}{H_0} = \frac{3 \times 10^5}{70} \approx 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc}.
\]

The integral is approximated numerically by breaking it into intervals of \( \Delta z = 0.5 \) and applying the trapezoidal rule. The integrand \( f(z) = 1 / \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z)^3 + \Omega_\lambda} \) is evaluated at each interval, and the contributions are summed. After performing the calculations, the integral is found to be approximately \( 1.8826 \).

Thus, the comoving distance is:

\[
D_C = 4.2857 \, \text{Gpc} \times 1.8826 \approx 8.13 \, \text{Gpc}.
\]

This value rounds to approximately \( 8 \, \text{Gpc} \), which corresponds to option B. The presence of dark energy reduces the comoving distance compared to a matter-only universe, as dark energy accelerates the expansion of the universe.

Answer: B
