Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Planet1 is more massive (7 Earth masses) and has a larger radius (1.7 Earth radii), while Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius of 1.3 Earth radii.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were perfectly balanced between incoming energy and outgoing radiation. The formula I remember is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but wait, albedo is the same for both planets, so that factor (1 - albedo)^(1/4) would cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of Te for Planet1 to Planet2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). So I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets.

How do I find a1 and a2? Oh, the RV method gives the mass and the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital period. But wait, the question gives the shifts in the [OI] line. The shifts are periodic due to the Doppler effect caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star.

The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude K is given by the Doppler shift. The formula for K is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. But I think there's a more precise formula involving the mass of the star and planet, the orbital period, and the inclination angle.

Wait, the formula for RV semi-amplitude is K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ), but since M_p << M_star, we can approximate it as K ≈ ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) * (2π / c), wait maybe I'm mixing up some terms.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^2))^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ), but I might need to think more carefully.

Wait, the Doppler shift (K) is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for K is given by K = (v), where v is the star's velocity. The formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c * (1 - e^2)^(3/2)) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1 / P )^(1/3) ), but since e=0 here (the orbits are circular), so e=0, so denominator becomes 1.

But maybe since the star's mass is much larger than the planet, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, sin i is 1 because the transit method implies that the orbits are edge-on (i=90 degrees), so sin i =1.

So K ≈ [ (27 * pi * G) / (c) ) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi)) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e^2)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps that's not the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(3/2) ) ) )

Since e=0, and sin i=1, this simplifies to K = [ (G * M_p ) / (M_star^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * ( 2 pi / (c) ) ) ? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, since both planets are causing a Doppler shift, their semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) are given. The question states that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. I think these are the RV semi-amplitudes, K1 and K2.

Wait, but the Doppler shift (in wavelength) is given by delta_lambda = (lambda) * (v/c), where v is the velocity. So the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star due to the planet, so delta_lambda = (lambda) * (K / c).

So for each planet, we can find K by rearranging: K = (delta_lambda) * c / lambda.

The given [OI] line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å, so K1 = (0.03 Å) * c / (6300 Å). Similarly, K2 = (0.04) * c / 6300.

But let's compute K1 and K2.

Wait, but maybe I can just take the ratio of K1 to K2, since c and lambda are the same for both, they will cancel out. Let's see:

K1/K2 = (0.03) / (0.04) ) = 3/4 = 0.75.

So K1 = 0.75 * K2.

But K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) — wait, no, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by (from the formula):

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) * (2 pi / P) ) ]^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e^2)) )

But with e=0 and sin i=1, it simplifies to:

K = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/c)^(1/3) )

Hmm, maybe it's easier to take the ratio of K1 and K2, since we can cancel some terms.

Let me write the formula for K1 and K2:

K1 = [ (G * M_p1 sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p1)^(2/3) ) ) * (2 pi / P1) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3) )

Similarly K2 = [ (G * M_p2 sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p2)^(2/3) ) ) * (2 pi / P2) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3) )

Since sin i is 1 for both, and M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So approximating:

K1 ≈ [ (G M_p1 / M_star^(2/3) ) * (2 pi / P1) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3)

K2 ≈ [ (G M_p2 / M_star^(2/3) ) * (2 pi / P2) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3)

Taking the ratio K1/K2:

= [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3)

But we have K1/K2 = 0.75 (since 0.03 / 0.04 = 0.75), so 0.75 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides: (0.75)^3 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1 )

Calculating 0.75^3: 0.421875.

So 0.421875 = (7/5) * (P2 / P1 )

Wait, because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses and M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. So M_p1 / M_p2 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So 0.421875 = (1.4) * (P2/P1 )

So P2/P1 = 0.421875 / 1.4 ≈ 0.3013.

So P2 ≈ 0.3013 * P1.

But the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis (a) via Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 pi² a³)/(G (M_star + M_p) )

Again, since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So P² = (4 pi² a³) / (G M_star )

Thus, a³ = G M_star P²/(4 pi² )

So a is proportional to (M_star * P² )^(1/3 )

But since both planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same for both.

So a1 = [ G M_star P1²/(4 pi² ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G M_star P2²/(4 pi² ) ]^(1/3 )

So a2/a1 = (P2² / P1² )^(1/3 ) = ( (P2/P1 ) )^(2/3 )

We found earlier that P2/P1 ≈ 0.3013.

So (P2/P1 )^(2/3) = (0.3013)^(0.6667) ≈ let me compute that.

0.3013^0.6667 ≈ e^( (ln 0.3013)*0.6667 )

ln(0.3013) ≈ -1.197.

Multiply by 0.6667: -1.197 * 0.6667 ≈ -0.8.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.8) ≈ 0.449.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.449.

Wait, but earlier I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, I think I miscalculated the exponents.

Because a is proportional to P^(2/3), because a^3 is proportional to P².

So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^(2/3).

We know that P2/P1 ≈ 0.3013.

So (0.3013) raised to the 2/3 power.

Let me compute 0.3013^(2/3).

I can compute ln(0.3013) = approx -1.197.

Multiply by 2/3: -0.798.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.798) ≈ 0.451.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.451.

So the ratio of a2 to a1 is approximately 0.451.

Now, going back to equilibrium temperature.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Since albedo is the same for both planets, the (1 - albedo) factor cancels when taking the ratio.

So Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / (R_star/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have a2/a1 ≈ 0.451, so sqrt(0.451) ≈ sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.6708.

So Te1/Te2 ≈ 0.6708.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So when taking the ratio Te1/Te2, the T_star and (1 - A) factors cancel.

So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / (R_star/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Ah, so yes, that's correct.

So sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.451) ≈ 0.671.

Wait, but wait the options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.3, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.

0.67 isn't directly one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's check the earlier steps.

Wait, let's re-express the equilibrium temperature ratio.

Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Because (R_star/(2a1)) divided by (R_star/(2a2)) is (a2/a1).

So sqrt(a2/a1) is sqrt(0.451) ≈ 0.67.

Hmm, but none of the options is near 0.67. The closest option would be C) ~0.53, but that's lower than 0.67. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of a2/a1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in taking the ratio of K's.

Let me go back to the K ratio.

K1 = 0.03 Å, K2 = 0.04 Å.

So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75.

Earlier, I wrote:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, is that correct? Let me re-derive the formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G / (2 pi c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (1 - e^2 )^(3/2) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ]

But with e=0 and sin i=1, and M_p << M_star, it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) * ( 2 pi / c )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express K in terms of M_p and P.

Let me recall the correct formula for K:

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e^2 )^(3/2) ) * (2 pi / P ) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3)

Wait, but perhaps I can find the ratio K1/K2.

Assuming that e=0 for both, sin i=1 for both (since they transit, so edge-on), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Then, K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3 )

Yes, so 0.75 = ( (7/5) * (P2/P1) )^(1/3 )

So cube both sides: 0.421875 = (7/5)(P2/P1 )

So P2/P1 = 0.421875 / (7/5) ) = 0.421875 * (5/7) ≈ (0.421875 *5 ) = 2.109375 / 7 ≈ 0.3013.

So P2 = 0.3013 * P1.

So a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) = (0.3013)^(2/3 )

Let me compute 0.3013^(2/3).

0.3013 is approximately 0.3.

0.3^(2/3) is roughly (0.3^(1/3))^2. 0.3^(1/3) is approx 0.669, so (0.669)^2 ≈ 0.447.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.447.

Thus, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt( 0.447 ) ≈ 0.669.

But the options don't have 0.67. The closest option is C) ~0.53, but that's lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating K1/K2.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

So K1/K2 = [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) ] / [ ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ]

Wait, no, because M_star is same for both, so the ratio is [ (M_p1/M_p2) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ]

So K1/K2 = (7/5) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

And since K1/K2 = 0.75, we have:

0.75 = (7/5) * ( P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So (P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) = 0.75 * (5/7) = (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357.

So (P2/P1 ) = (0.5357 )^3 ≈ 0.153.

Wait, wait a minute, that's very different from before. Did I make a mistake in the exponent?

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it again.

K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (P2 / P1 ) )^(1/3 )

So 0.75 = (7/5) * ( P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So (P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) = (0.75) * (5/7) )= (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357.

Then, (P2/P1 ) = (0.5357 )^3 ≈ 0.5357^3.

Compute 0.5357 cubed:

0.5^3= 0.125. 0.5357 is a bit higher.

Approximate: (0.5357)^3 ≈ let's compute 0.5357 * 0.5357 = approx 0.287.

Then multiply by 0.5357 again: 0.287 * 0.5357 ≈ 0.1539.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.1539.

So a2/a1 = (P2/P1 )^(2/3 ) = (0.1539)^(2/3 )

Compute 0.1539^(1/3 ) first.

Cube root of 0.1539: approx 0.536, since 0.536³ ≈ 0.153.

Then square that: 0.536² ≈ 0.287.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.287.

So now the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

That's about 0.536, which is close to option C) ~0.53.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio, Te1/Te2, is approximately 0.53.

Wait, but why did I get two different results before? Because I think I messed up the exponents in the K ratio step.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p) * (P)^(-1/3).

So K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Earlier I had mistakenly thought it was (P2/P1)^(1/3 ), but in reality, since K is proportional to P^(-1/3 ), so for K1/K2, it's (M_p1/M_p2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So that's where I went wrong earlier. So now, with this correction, the calculation yields Te1/Te2 ≈ 0.53, which is option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_e = T_\text{star} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_\text{star}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the \((1 - \text{albedo})^{1/4}\) factor cancels out when taking the ratio. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\), which is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{(M_\text{star})^{2/3} P^{1/3}}
\]

Given \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) and \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), the ratio \(K_1/K_2 = 0.75\). Using the proportionality:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\):

\[
0.75 = \left(\frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
0.421875 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Solving for \(P_2/P_1\):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{0.421875}{7/5} = 0.3013
\]

Next, using Kepler's third law, \(a \propto P^{2/3}\), so:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Substituting \(P_2/P_1 = 0.3013\):

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (0.3013)^{2/3} \approx 0.447
\]

Finally, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.447} \approx 0.67
\]

However, this result does not match any of the provided options. Reassessing the earlier steps, it was realized that the correct proportionality for \(K\) involves \(P^{-1/3}\), not \(P^{1/3}\). Correcting this, the revised calculation yields:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 0.287
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This matches option **C) ~0.53**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Planet1 is more massive (7 Earth masses) and has a larger radius (1.7 Earth radii), while Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius of 1.3 Earth radii.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were perfectly balanced between incoming energy and outgoing radiation. The formula I remember is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but wait, albedo is the same for both planets, so that factor (1 - albedo)^(1/4) would cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of Te for Planet1 to Planet2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). So I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets.

How do I find a1 and a2? Oh, the RV method gives the mass and the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital period. But wait, the question gives the shifts in the [OI] line. The shifts are periodic due to the Doppler effect caused by the planet's gravitational pull on the star.

The radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude K is given by the Doppler shift. The formula for K is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. But I think there's a more precise formula involving the mass of the star and planet, the orbital period, and the inclination angle.

Wait, the formula for RV semi-amplitude is K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ), but since M_p << M_star, we can approximate it as K ≈ ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) * (2π / c), wait maybe I'm mixing up some terms.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^2))^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ), but I might need to think more carefully.

Wait, the Doppler shift (K) is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The formula for K is given by K = (v), where v is the star's velocity. The formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c * (1 - e^2)^(3/2)) ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * (1 / P )^(1/3) ), but since e=0 here (the orbits are circular), so e=0, so denominator becomes 1.

But maybe since the star's mass is much larger than the planet, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, sin i is 1 because the transit method implies that the orbits are edge-on (i=90 degrees), so sin i =1.

So K ≈ [ (27 * pi * G) / (c) ) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(2 pi)) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e^2)^(3/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (2 pi / P )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps that's not the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(3/2) ) ) )

Since e=0, and sin i=1, this simplifies to K = [ (G * M_p ) / (M_star^2) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) * ( 2 pi / (c) ) ) ? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, since both planets are causing a Doppler shift, their semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) are given. The question states that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. I think these are the RV semi-amplitudes, K1 and K2.

Wait, but the Doppler shift (in wavelength) is given by delta_lambda = (lambda) * (v/c), where v is the velocity. So the RV semi-amplitude K is the velocity of the star due to the planet, so delta_lambda = (lambda) * (K / c).

So for each planet, we can find K by rearranging: K = (delta_lambda) * c / lambda.

The given [OI] line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å, so K1 = (0.03 Å) * c / (6300 Å). Similarly, K2 = (0.04) * c / 6300.

But let's compute K1 and K2.

Wait, but maybe I can just take the ratio of K1 to K2, since c and lambda are the same for both, they will cancel out. Let's see:

K1/K2 = (0.03) / (0.04) ) = 3/4 = 0.75.

So K1 = 0.75 * K2.

But K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) — wait, no, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by (from the formula):

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) * (2 pi / P) ) ]^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

K = (v) = ( (2 pi G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - e^2)) )

But with e=0 and sin i=1, it simplifies to:

K = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) ) * (1/c)^(1/3) )

Hmm, maybe it's easier to take the ratio of K1 and K2, since we can cancel some terms.

Let me write the formula for K1 and K2:

K1 = [ (G * M_p1 sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p1)^(2/3) ) ) * (2 pi / P1) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3) )

Similarly K2 = [ (G * M_p2 sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p2)^(2/3) ) ) * (2 pi / P2) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3) )

Since sin i is 1 for both, and M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So approximating:

K1 ≈ [ (G M_p1 / M_star^(2/3) ) * (2 pi / P1) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3)

K2 ≈ [ (G M_p2 / M_star^(2/3) ) * (2 pi / P2) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3)

Taking the ratio K1/K2:

= [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3)

But we have K1/K2 = 0.75 (since 0.03 / 0.04 = 0.75), so 0.75 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3 )

Cubing both sides: (0.75)^3 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1 )

Calculating 0.75^3: 0.421875.

So 0.421875 = (7/5) * (P2 / P1 )

Wait, because M_p1 is 7 Earth masses and M_p2 is 5 Earth masses. So M_p1 / M_p2 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So 0.421875 = (1.4) * (P2/P1 )

So P2/P1 = 0.421875 / 1.4 ≈ 0.3013.

So P2 ≈ 0.3013 * P1.

But the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis (a) via Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 pi² a³)/(G (M_star + M_p) )

Again, since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So P² = (4 pi² a³) / (G M_star )

Thus, a³ = G M_star P²/(4 pi² )

So a is proportional to (M_star * P² )^(1/3 )

But since both planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same for both.

So a1 = [ G M_star P1²/(4 pi² ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 = [ G M_star P2²/(4 pi² ) ]^(1/3 )

So a2/a1 = (P2² / P1² )^(1/3 ) = ( (P2/P1 ) )^(2/3 )

We found earlier that P2/P1 ≈ 0.3013.

So (P2/P1 )^(2/3) = (0.3013)^(0.6667) ≈ let me compute that.

0.3013^0.6667 ≈ e^( (ln 0.3013)*0.6667 )

ln(0.3013) ≈ -1.197.

Multiply by 0.6667: -1.197 * 0.6667 ≈ -0.8.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.8) ≈ 0.449.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.449.

Wait, but earlier I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, I think I miscalculated the exponents.

Because a is proportional to P^(2/3), because a^3 is proportional to P².

So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^(2/3).

We know that P2/P1 ≈ 0.3013.

So (0.3013) raised to the 2/3 power.

Let me compute 0.3013^(2/3).

I can compute ln(0.3013) = approx -1.197.

Multiply by 2/3: -0.798.

Exponentiate: e^(-0.798) ≈ 0.451.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.451.

So the ratio of a2 to a1 is approximately 0.451.

Now, going back to equilibrium temperature.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Since albedo is the same for both planets, the (1 - albedo) factor cancels when taking the ratio.

So Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / (R_star/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have a2/a1 ≈ 0.451, so sqrt(0.451) ≈ sqrt(0.45) ≈ 0.6708.

So Te1/Te2 ≈ 0.6708.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

So when taking the ratio Te1/Te2, the T_star and (1 - A) factors cancel.

So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / (R_star/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Ah, so yes, that's correct.

So sqrt(a2/a1) = sqrt(0.451) ≈ 0.671.

Wait, but wait the options are A) ~0.98, B) ~1.3, C) ~0.53, D) ~1.05.

0.67 isn't directly one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's check the earlier steps.

Wait, let's re-express the equilibrium temperature ratio.

Te1 / Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Because (R_star/(2a1)) divided by (R_star/(2a2)) is (a2/a1).

So sqrt(a2/a1) is sqrt(0.451) ≈ 0.67.

Hmm, but none of the options is near 0.67. The closest option would be C) ~0.53, but that's lower than 0.67. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of a2/a1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in taking the ratio of K's.

Let me go back to the K ratio.

K1 = 0.03 Å, K2 = 0.04 Å.

So K1/K2 = 0.03/0.04 = 0.75.

Earlier, I wrote:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3 )

Wait, is that correct? Let me re-derive the formula.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G / (2 pi c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (1 - e^2 )^(3/2) ) * (P)^(1/3) ) ]

But with e=0 and sin i=1, and M_p << M_star, it simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) * ( 2 pi / c )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express K in terms of M_p and P.

Let me recall the correct formula for K:

The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 - e^2 )^(3/2) ) * (2 pi / P ) ) ]^(1/3) / c^(1/3)

Wait, but perhaps I can find the ratio K1/K2.

Assuming that e=0 for both, sin i=1 for both (since they transit, so edge-on), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Then, K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / M_p2) * (P2 / P1) ) ]^(1/3 )

Yes, so 0.75 = ( (7/5) * (P2/P1) )^(1/3 )

So cube both sides: 0.421875 = (7/5)(P2/P1 )

So P2/P1 = 0.421875 / (7/5) ) = 0.421875 * (5/7) ≈ (0.421875 *5 ) = 2.109375 / 7 ≈ 0.3013.

So P2 = 0.3013 * P1.

So a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a2/a1 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) = (0.3013)^(2/3 )

Let me compute 0.3013^(2/3).

0.3013 is approximately 0.3.

0.3^(2/3) is roughly (0.3^(1/3))^2. 0.3^(1/3) is approx 0.669, so (0.669)^2 ≈ 0.447.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.447.

Thus, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt( 0.447 ) ≈ 0.669.

But the options don't have 0.67. The closest option is C) ~0.53, but that's lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating K1/K2.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

So K1/K2 = [ ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ) ] / [ ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ]

Wait, no, because M_star is same for both, so the ratio is [ (M_p1/M_p2) * (P2 / P1 )^(1/3) ]

So K1/K2 = (7/5) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

And since K1/K2 = 0.75, we have:

0.75 = (7/5) * ( P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So (P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) = 0.75 * (5/7) = (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357.

So (P2/P1 ) = (0.5357 )^3 ≈ 0.153.

Wait, wait a minute, that's very different from before. Did I make a mistake in the exponent?

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it again.

K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( (P2 / P1 ) )^(1/3 )

So 0.75 = (7/5) * ( P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So (P2/P1 )^(1/3 ) = (0.75) * (5/7) )= (3/4) * (5/7) )= 15/(28) ≈ 0.5357.

Then, (P2/P1 ) = (0.5357 )^3 ≈ 0.5357^3.

Compute 0.5357 cubed:

0.5^3= 0.125. 0.5357 is a bit higher.

Approximate: (0.5357)^3 ≈ let's compute 0.5357 * 0.5357 = approx 0.287.

Then multiply by 0.5357 again: 0.287 * 0.5357 ≈ 0.1539.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.1539.

So a2/a1 = (P2/P1 )^(2/3 ) = (0.1539)^(2/3 )

Compute 0.1539^(1/3 ) first.

Cube root of 0.1539: approx 0.536, since 0.536³ ≈ 0.153.

Then square that: 0.536² ≈ 0.287.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.287.

So now the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

That's about 0.536, which is close to option C) ~0.53.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio, Te1/Te2, is approximately 0.53.

Wait, but why did I get two different results before? Because I think I messed up the exponents in the K ratio step.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p) * (P)^(-1/3).

So K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Earlier I had mistakenly thought it was (P2/P1)^(1/3 ), but in reality, since K is proportional to P^(-1/3 ), so for K1/K2, it's (M_p1/M_p2) * (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So that's where I went wrong earlier. So now, with this correction, the calculation yields Te1/Te2 ≈ 0.53, which is option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_e = T_\text{star} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_\text{star}}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the \((1 - \text{albedo})^{1/4}\) factor cancels out when taking the ratio. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\), which is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{(M_\text{star})^{2/3} P^{1/3}}
\]

Given \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) and \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), the ratio \(K_1/K_2 = 0.75\). Using the proportionality:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Substituting \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\):

\[
0.75 = \left(\frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
0.421875 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Solving for \(P_2/P_1\):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{0.421875}{7/5} = 0.3013
\]

Next, using Kepler's third law, \(a \propto P^{2/3}\), so:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Substituting \(P_2/P_1 = 0.3013\):

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = (0.3013)^{2/3} \approx 0.447
\]

Finally, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.447} \approx 0.67
\]

However, this result does not match any of the provided options. Reassessing the earlier steps, it was realized that the correct proportionality for \(K\) involves \(P^{-1/3}\), not \(P^{1/3}\). Correcting this, the revised calculation yields:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 0.287
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This matches option **C) ~0.53**.

Answer: C
