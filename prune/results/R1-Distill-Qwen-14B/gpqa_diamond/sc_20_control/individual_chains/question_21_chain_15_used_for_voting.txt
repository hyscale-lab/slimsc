Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, and it's asking about tautomerism and optical isomerism in certain compounds. 

The question gives two parts, A and B, each comparing two compounds. Let's break down each part.

First, part A: We need to determine which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Tautomerism is the phenomenon where a compound can tautomerize, meaning it can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, usually in a conjugated system. This is common in structures with adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can move, like in some ketones or quinones.

Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, wait, benzoquinone can be 1,2- (ortho), 1,3- (meta), or 1,4- (para) substituted. Depending on the positions, the possibility of tautomerism might vary. Oh wait, no, actually, quinones are generally not known for tautomerism because the necessary conjugation isn't in place. Wait, I think tautomerism would require adjacent double bonds or something that allows for the shift. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. So, if the two carbonyl groups are adjacent (like in 1,2-benzoquinone), maybe tautomerism is possible. Because the alpha hydrogens (if any) could shift. But wait, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on the benzene ring. For tautomerism to occur, there should be a possibility of hydrogen shifting between two carbonyls. Wait, 1,4-benzoquinone (para) would have the carbonyls opposite each other. Oh, but regardless of the positions, benzoquinone itself is a diketone, so maybe it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism if possible. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize. Let's think about that.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups spaced around the ring. So, it's a cyclic triketone. For tautomerism, you typically need a hydrogen between two carbonyl groups, allowing for a shift. So, if the structure allows for adjacent carbonyl groups with alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is possible.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ketones are at positions 1, 3, and 5. So in the ring, each is separated by a CH2 group. So each ketone is on a carbon adjacent to another CH2, but the next ketone is two carbons away. So, the positions are 1,3,5, meaning that each is opposite each other in the ring. So, each ketone is adjacent to a CH2 group, but the next ketone is across the ring. So, perhaps in this structure, the carbonyl groups are not adjacent, so there's no possibility of a hydrogen shift between two ketones. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione wouldn't have tautomerism because the necessary proximity isn't there.

On the other hand, benzoquinone, depending on the substitution, might allow tautomerism. Let's say benzoquinone is 1,2-dione. Then, the two carbonyls are adjacent, which would allow for hydrogen transfer between the two. That would enable tautomerism, like a keto-enol form. So benzoquinone can tautomerize if it's 1,2-substituted, but if it's 1,4-substituted, maybe it can't. Wait, but the question just says benzoquinone, not specifying the positions. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone is generally para-substituted. Let me think: para-benzoquinone is more common, I think. So in that case, the two ketone groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring, separated by a CH group.

Wait, but in that case, the two ketones are across the ring. So, there's no possibility for a hydrogen to shift between them because they're not adjacent. So, would that mean that para-benzoquinone can't tautomerize?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Tautomerism in benzoquinone: without adjacent carbonyl groups, you can't have the keto-enol shift. Because for a keto-enol tautomer, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl that can shift. So, in a structure where two carbonyl groups are adjacent, like 1,2-diketone, you can have such tautomerism. But if they're not, like 1,3 or 1,4, then maybe not.

So, if the question refers to benzoquinone as the para form, then it can't tautomerize. So the two compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Which one does NOT show tautomerism. Wait, the question says that A is the one that does not show tautomerism. So which of the two can't tautomerize.

If benzoquinone is the para form, it can't. So A would be benzoquinone. Then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't either, because the ketones are spaced apart. Wait, no, wait. Does cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have any alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyls?

Looking at the structure, each carbonyl is on a carbon that's part of the six-membered ring. So, each is connected to two other carbons. For example, the 1,3,5-trione would have carbonyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5, each connected to two CH2 groups? Or perhaps CH2 groups in between.

Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So, 1,3,5-trione would have ketone groups on carbons 1,3,5. Between each ketone would be a CH2 group. So, each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5. Let me imagine the structure: each ketone is two carbons apart. So positions are 1 (CO), 2 (CH2), 3 (CO), 4 (CH2), 5 (CO), 6 (CH2). So, each ketone is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each ketone has alpha hydrogens on the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but the arrangement would be that each CO is on a carbon next to two CH2 groups. So, each CO is on a carbon that's next to CH2 groups, which have hydrogens. So, perhaps tautomerism is possible here. Because those hydrogens could shift, right?

Wait, but for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen that's alpha to two carbonyls. In the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione case, the hydrogen on a CH2 group is between two ketones? No, because the spacing is 1,3,5. So, consider the structure: 1 is CO, 2 is CH2, 3 is CO, 4 is CH2, 5 is CO, 6 is CH2. So, the CH2 groups are between the CO groups. So, each CH2 is between two carbonyls. Wait, no. Wait, 1 is CO, the next is 2 (CH2), then 3 is CO. So the CH2 at 2 is between CO (1) and CO (3). So, the CH2 at 2 is between two CO groups. So, the hydrogen on the CH2 at position 2 is adjacent to two carbonyls.

So, that's a perfect setup for keto-enol tautomerism. Because the hydrogen on the CH2 (position 2) is between two carbonyl groups. So, in that case, tautomerism would be possible. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism, because each CH2 group is between two CO groups.

Wait, but wait. Is that the case? Because in the cyclohexane ring, the 2 position is between 1 and 3. So, the CH2 group at 2 is between two carbonyls. So, the hydrogen on that CH2 can shift between the two CO groups. Thus, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. So, this compound can tautomerize.

Then, benzoquinone. If it's the para form, the two CO groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, each CO is attached to the ring, but across from each other. So, the adjacent hydrogens would be on the benzene ring carbons. Wait, but in that case, the CO groups are not adjacent. So, no alpha hydrogens between two CO groups. So, tautomerism isn't possible because you don't have a hydrogen that's alpha to two carbonyls.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, the carbons with CO groups are each attached to two other ring carbons. So, if two CO groups are para, the adjacent carbons (ortho) to each CO would be different. So, in that case, the hydrogens on the ortho and meta positions are not between two CO groups. So, they can't undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but what if benzoquinone has adjacent CO groups, like in the ortho position? Then the structure would have two CO groups next to each other, and the CH group in between would have a hydrogen. So, that would allow tautomerism. But if the question refers to benzoquinone in the para form, then it can't tautomerize.

So, the two options are: which one does not show tautomerism.

If benzoquinone is in the para form, it can't. Then, the other option is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which can. So, A is the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So, if the correct A is benzoquinone, then the answer for A is benzoquinone. Or if the opposite.

Wait, the question states: "Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)."

So, which one doesn't show it. If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, then it's the other one, benzoquinone, that doesn't. So, A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but earlier I thought that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize because each CH2 group is between two CO groups. So if that's the case, then which one can't. So, then A is benzoquinone, as it can't tautomerize because its CO groups are not adjacent.

So, part A: A is benzoquinone.

Then, part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents around a carbon. Alternatively, if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write the structure. It's an ester: the acid part is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, and the alcohol is methanol. So, the structure would be:

The acid is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH? Or is it CH3-C(OH)H-COOH?

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But as an ester, it's methyl ester: so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but perhaps I should draw it as:

The ester is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that's the structure. So, the molecule is: 

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the CH(OH) group. Let's look at the substituents around that carbon. The groups are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the hydrogen. So, four different groups. Wait, that would make it a chiral center. So, the molecule would have optical isomerism.

But wait, the COOCH3 is a substituent, and the other groups are CH3, OH, and H. So, yes, four different groups around the central carbon. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a diacid, and fumarate is the cis isomer of the diester. So, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
     |
     O

Wait, perhaps better written as:

The structure is O=C-(C-OCH3)-C=C-(C-OCH3)=O. So, both ester groups are on the same side of the double bond. So, the molecule is O=C(OCH3)CH2CH2C(O)OCH3? No, wait, maleic acid is HOOCCHCHCOOH, but as fumarate, it's the cis diastereomer. So, the dimethyl ester would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 and O-C-OCH3 are on the same side of the double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

Wait, perhaps a better way: 

The fumarate ester (cis) would have the two ester groups on the same side. So, structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. Fumarate is derived from maleic acid, which is HO2CCHCHCO2H. When it's esterified with methanol, the two -COOH groups become -COOCH3. Fumarate is the cis isomer, so the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate's structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. But wait, actually, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
     |
     O

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O=C-OCH3
   |
   O

Wait, no, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think: the correct structure of fumarate is that the two ester groups are on the same side, so the double bond is between two carbons each bearing an ester group.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

Wait, but that would mean that each ester group is attached to the double bond carbons, so the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, no, in maleic acid, the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond between them. So, when esterified, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, no, the double bond is between the two carbonyls.

Ah, right. Maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H. No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with a double bond between the two CH groups. So, the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is OCO2CH3 on each end. And in fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

Wait, but that can't be. Because each double bond carbon has two substituents. So, each carbon in the double bond has two groups: an ester group (O-CO-OCH3) and a methyl group or perhaps another group.

Wait, wait, no. The structure of fumarate is the dimethyl ester of maleic acid. So, each of the two COOH groups in maleic acid becomes a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is: CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, but that can't be right either. Let me think again. The correct structure is that the double bond is between the two central carbons, each bearing an ester group.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

But wait, that would imply that each carbon in the double bond has an ester group and a single bond to another ester group, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not right. No, the correct structure is that the two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond. So, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, no, wait. Let me think again.

Actually, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

Wait, but that's not possible because each C in the double bond can only have three substituents. So, perhaps each double bond carbon has two substituents. Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has one substituent (the ester group) and two other bonds. So, the structure would be O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C=O? No, that's not right either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think differently. The important thing is whether the molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry, which would prevent optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate is the cis diastereomer of the diester. The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C=O? No, wait. No, fumarate is the cis isomer of maleate. So, the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, each of the two CH groups in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached.

Wait, so each double bond carbon (the two middle carbons) is connected to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is COOCH3 groups on each of the two central carbons, with a double bond between them. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, wait. Wait, no, the four carbons should be arranged as O=C-OCH3 on one end, connected by double bonds.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that would have two double bonds. No, wait, fumarate is the diester of maleic acid, which has a double bond between the two central carbons. So, the structure is:

Each of the two central carbons has a COOCH3 group attached, and a double bond between them. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the structure is O=C(OCH3)CH2CH2C(O)OCH3, but that's not right because the double bond needs to be between the two central carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3, but that's a single bond between the two CH2 groups, which is incorrect.

Ah, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't have optical isomers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two CH2 groups (the double bond carbons) has two COOCH3 groups attached. Wait, no, each has one COOCH3 and one CH2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a carbon which is double bonded to another carbon, which is also attached to O-C-OCH3.

So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C=O? No, because that's a single bond in the middle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the molecule as having a structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides (trans) or same sides (cis) of the double bond. In fumarate, it's cis. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side, leading to a structure where the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if the two ester groups are on the same side, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, right? Because flipping the molecule over that plane would superimpose it on itself. So, that would mean the molecule is achiral, so it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, let's think about the actual structure. If the two ester groups are on the same side, the molecule is symmetric. So, it has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the double bond. Therefore, it is not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, dimethyl fumarate, being the cis isomer, has a plane of symmetry and thus no optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck. In dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side. So, the structure is symmetric. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. So, it cannot show optical isomerism.

Therefore, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which shows optical isomerism.

So, putting it together, part A is benzoquinone as the one that doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

Option B says: A= benzoquinone, B= methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D: A= benzoquinone, B= dimethyl fumarate.

So, our conclusion is A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, option B says that.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that part A is the one that doesn't show tautomerism, so if benzoquinone can't, then that's A. And part B is which shows optical isomerism, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, option B is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties regarding tautomerism and optical isomerism.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen atom and a lone pair between two atoms, typically in conjugated systems. 

1. **Benzoquinone**:  
   Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. If it is in the para-substituted form (1,4-benzoquinone), the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other on the ring. There are no alpha hydrogens between the carbonyl groups, and the structure lacks the necessary conjugation for tautomerism. Thus, para-benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
   Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each CH₂ group between the ketones is flanked by two carbonyl groups, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or lacks a plane of symmetry.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the cis diester of maleic acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. The two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, giving the molecule a plane of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism).
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, and it's asking about tautomerism and optical isomerism in certain compounds. 

The question gives two parts, A and B, each comparing two compounds. Let's break down each part.

First, part A: We need to determine which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Tautomerism is the phenomenon where a compound can tautomerize, meaning it can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, usually in a conjugated system. This is common in structures with adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can move, like in some ketones or quinones.

Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, wait, benzoquinone can be 1,2- (ortho), 1,3- (meta), or 1,4- (para) substituted. Depending on the positions, the possibility of tautomerism might vary. Oh wait, no, actually, quinones are generally not known for tautomerism because the necessary conjugation isn't in place. Wait, I think tautomerism would require adjacent double bonds or something that allows for the shift. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. So, if the two carbonyl groups are adjacent (like in 1,2-benzoquinone), maybe tautomerism is possible. Because the alpha hydrogens (if any) could shift. But wait, in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is on the benzene ring. For tautomerism to occur, there should be a possibility of hydrogen shifting between two carbonyls. Wait, 1,4-benzoquinone (para) would have the carbonyls opposite each other. Oh, but regardless of the positions, benzoquinone itself is a diketone, so maybe it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism if possible. Alternatively, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't tautomerize. Let's think about that.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups spaced around the ring. So, it's a cyclic triketone. For tautomerism, you typically need a hydrogen between two carbonyl groups, allowing for a shift. So, if the structure allows for adjacent carbonyl groups with alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is possible.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ketones are at positions 1, 3, and 5. So in the ring, each is separated by a CH2 group. So each ketone is on a carbon adjacent to another CH2, but the next ketone is two carbons away. So, the positions are 1,3,5, meaning that each is opposite each other in the ring. So, each ketone is adjacent to a CH2 group, but the next ketone is across the ring. So, perhaps in this structure, the carbonyl groups are not adjacent, so there's no possibility of a hydrogen shift between two ketones. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione wouldn't have tautomerism because the necessary proximity isn't there.

On the other hand, benzoquinone, depending on the substitution, might allow tautomerism. Let's say benzoquinone is 1,2-dione. Then, the two carbonyls are adjacent, which would allow for hydrogen transfer between the two. That would enable tautomerism, like a keto-enol form. So benzoquinone can tautomerize if it's 1,2-substituted, but if it's 1,4-substituted, maybe it can't. Wait, but the question just says benzoquinone, not specifying the positions. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone is generally para-substituted. Let me think: para-benzoquinone is more common, I think. So in that case, the two ketone groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring, separated by a CH group.

Wait, but in that case, the two ketones are across the ring. So, there's no possibility for a hydrogen to shift between them because they're not adjacent. So, would that mean that para-benzoquinone can't tautomerize?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Tautomerism in benzoquinone: without adjacent carbonyl groups, you can't have the keto-enol shift. Because for a keto-enol tautomer, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl that can shift. So, in a structure where two carbonyl groups are adjacent, like 1,2-diketone, you can have such tautomerism. But if they're not, like 1,3 or 1,4, then maybe not.

So, if the question refers to benzoquinone as the para form, then it can't tautomerize. So the two compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Which one does NOT show tautomerism. Wait, the question says that A is the one that does not show tautomerism. So which of the two can't tautomerize.

If benzoquinone is the para form, it can't. So A would be benzoquinone. Then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can't either, because the ketones are spaced apart. Wait, no, wait. Does cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione have any alpha hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyls?

Looking at the structure, each carbonyl is on a carbon that's part of the six-membered ring. So, each is connected to two other carbons. For example, the 1,3,5-trione would have carbonyl groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5, each connected to two CH2 groups? Or perhaps CH2 groups in between.

Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So, 1,3,5-trione would have ketone groups on carbons 1,3,5. Between each ketone would be a CH2 group. So, each carbonyl is at positions 1,3,5. Let me imagine the structure: each ketone is two carbons apart. So positions are 1 (CO), 2 (CH2), 3 (CO), 4 (CH2), 5 (CO), 6 (CH2). So, each ketone is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each ketone has alpha hydrogens on the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but the arrangement would be that each CO is on a carbon next to two CH2 groups. So, each CO is on a carbon that's next to CH2 groups, which have hydrogens. So, perhaps tautomerism is possible here. Because those hydrogens could shift, right?

Wait, but for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen that's alpha to two carbonyls. In the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione case, the hydrogen on a CH2 group is between two ketones? No, because the spacing is 1,3,5. So, consider the structure: 1 is CO, 2 is CH2, 3 is CO, 4 is CH2, 5 is CO, 6 is CH2. So, the CH2 groups are between the CO groups. So, each CH2 is between two carbonyls. Wait, no. Wait, 1 is CO, the next is 2 (CH2), then 3 is CO. So the CH2 at 2 is between CO (1) and CO (3). So, the CH2 at 2 is between two CO groups. So, the hydrogen on the CH2 at position 2 is adjacent to two carbonyls.

So, that's a perfect setup for keto-enol tautomerism. Because the hydrogen on the CH2 (position 2) is between two carbonyl groups. So, in that case, tautomerism would be possible. So, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism, because each CH2 group is between two CO groups.

Wait, but wait. Is that the case? Because in the cyclohexane ring, the 2 position is between 1 and 3. So, the CH2 group at 2 is between two carbonyls. So, the hydrogen on that CH2 can shift between the two CO groups. Thus, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. So, this compound can tautomerize.

Then, benzoquinone. If it's the para form, the two CO groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring. So, each CO is attached to the ring, but across from each other. So, the adjacent hydrogens would be on the benzene ring carbons. Wait, but in that case, the CO groups are not adjacent. So, no alpha hydrogens between two CO groups. So, tautomerism isn't possible because you don't have a hydrogen that's alpha to two carbonyls.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, the carbons with CO groups are each attached to two other ring carbons. So, if two CO groups are para, the adjacent carbons (ortho) to each CO would be different. So, in that case, the hydrogens on the ortho and meta positions are not between two CO groups. So, they can't undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but what if benzoquinone has adjacent CO groups, like in the ortho position? Then the structure would have two CO groups next to each other, and the CH group in between would have a hydrogen. So, that would allow tautomerism. But if the question refers to benzoquinone in the para form, then it can't tautomerize.

So, the two options are: which one does not show tautomerism.

If benzoquinone is in the para form, it can't. Then, the other option is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which can. So, A is the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So, if the correct A is benzoquinone, then the answer for A is benzoquinone. Or if the opposite.

Wait, the question states: "Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A)."

So, which one doesn't show it. If cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize, then it's the other one, benzoquinone, that doesn't. So, A is benzoquinone.

Wait, but earlier I thought that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can tautomerize because each CH2 group is between two CO groups. So if that's the case, then which one can't. So, then A is benzoquinone, as it can't tautomerize because its CO groups are not adjacent.

So, part A: A is benzoquinone.

Then, part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents around a carbon. Alternatively, if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write the structure. It's an ester: the acid part is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, and the alcohol is methanol. So, the structure would be:

The acid is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH? Or is it CH3-C(OH)H-COOH?

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. But as an ester, it's methyl ester: so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but perhaps I should draw it as:

The ester is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that's the structure. So, the molecule is: 

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the CH(OH) group. Let's look at the substituents around that carbon. The groups are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the hydrogen. So, four different groups. Wait, that would make it a chiral center. So, the molecule would have optical isomerism.

But wait, the COOCH3 is a substituent, and the other groups are CH3, OH, and H. So, yes, four different groups around the central carbon. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a diacid, and fumarate is the cis isomer of the diester. So, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
     |
     O

Wait, perhaps better written as:

The structure is O=C-(C-OCH3)-C=C-(C-OCH3)=O. So, both ester groups are on the same side of the double bond. So, the molecule is O=C(OCH3)CH2CH2C(O)OCH3? No, wait, maleic acid is HOOCCHCHCOOH, but as fumarate, it's the cis diastereomer. So, the dimethyl ester would have the structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 and O-C-OCH3 are on the same side of the double bond. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

Wait, perhaps a better way: 

The fumarate ester (cis) would have the two ester groups on the same side. So, structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get this right. Fumarate is derived from maleic acid, which is HO2CCHCHCO2H. When it's esterified with methanol, the two -COOH groups become -COOCH3. Fumarate is the cis isomer, so the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond.

So, dimethyl fumarate's structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. But wait, actually, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O-C-OCH3
     |
     O

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O=C-OCH3
   |
   O

Wait, no, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think: the correct structure of fumarate is that the two ester groups are on the same side, so the double bond is between two carbons each bearing an ester group.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

Wait, but that would mean that each ester group is attached to the double bond carbons, so the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, no, in maleic acid, the two COOH groups are on adjacent carbons with a double bond between them. So, when esterified, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, no, the double bond is between the two carbonyls.

Ah, right. Maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H. No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with a double bond between the two CH groups. So, the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When esterified, each COOH becomes COOCH3, so the structure is OCO2CH3 on each end. And in fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

Wait, but that can't be. Because each double bond carbon has two substituents. So, each carbon in the double bond has two groups: an ester group (O-CO-OCH3) and a methyl group or perhaps another group.

Wait, wait, no. The structure of fumarate is the dimethyl ester of maleic acid. So, each of the two COOH groups in maleic acid becomes a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is: CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

So, CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, but that can't be right either. Let me think again. The correct structure is that the double bond is between the two central carbons, each bearing an ester group.

So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

But wait, that would imply that each carbon in the double bond has an ester group and a single bond to another ester group, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not right. No, the correct structure is that the two carbonyl groups are on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond. So, it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, no, wait. Let me think again.

Actually, the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

Wait, but that's not possible because each C in the double bond can only have three substituents. So, perhaps each double bond carbon has two substituents. Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has one substituent (the ester group) and two other bonds. So, the structure would be O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C=O? No, that's not right either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think differently. The important thing is whether the molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry, which would prevent optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate is the cis diastereomer of the diester. The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C=O? No, wait. No, fumarate is the cis isomer of maleate. So, the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. Wait, each of the two CH groups in the double bond has a COOCH3 group attached.

Wait, so each double bond carbon (the two middle carbons) is connected to a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is COOCH3 groups on each of the two central carbons, with a double bond between them. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, wait. Wait, no, the four carbons should be arranged as O=C-OCH3 on one end, connected by double bonds.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The molecule is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that would have two double bonds. No, wait, fumarate is the diester of maleic acid, which has a double bond between the two central carbons. So, the structure is:

Each of the two central carbons has a COOCH3 group attached, and a double bond between them. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the structure is O=C(OCH3)CH2CH2C(O)OCH3, but that's not right because the double bond needs to be between the two central carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3, but that's a single bond between the two CH2 groups, which is incorrect.

Ah, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't have optical isomers.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond. So, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two CH2 groups (the double bond carbons) has two COOCH3 groups attached. Wait, no, each has one COOCH3 and one CH2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a carbon which is double bonded to another carbon, which is also attached to O-C-OCH3.

So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C=O? No, because that's a single bond in the middle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the molecule as having a structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides (trans) or same sides (cis) of the double bond. In fumarate, it's cis. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side, leading to a structure where the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, if the two ester groups are on the same side, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, right? Because flipping the molecule over that plane would superimpose it on itself. So, that would mean the molecule is achiral, so it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, let's think about the actual structure. If the two ester groups are on the same side, the molecule is symmetric. So, it has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the double bond. Therefore, it is not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, dimethyl fumarate, being the cis isomer, has a plane of symmetry and thus no optical isomerism.

On the other hand, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck. In dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on the same side. So, the structure is symmetric. Therefore, the molecule is achiral. So, it cannot show optical isomerism.

Therefore, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which shows optical isomerism.

So, putting it together, part A is benzoquinone as the one that doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

Option B says: A= benzoquinone, B= methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option D: A= benzoquinone, B= dimethyl fumarate.

So, our conclusion is A is benzoquinone and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, option B says that.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that part A is the one that doesn't show tautomerism, so if benzoquinone can't, then that's A. And part B is which shows optical isomerism, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So, option B is correct.


To solve the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties regarding tautomerism and optical isomerism.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen atom and a lone pair between two atoms, typically in conjugated systems. 

1. **Benzoquinone**:  
   Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. If it is in the para-substituted form (1,4-benzoquinone), the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other on the ring. There are no alpha hydrogens between the carbonyl groups, and the structure lacks the necessary conjugation for tautomerism. Thus, para-benzoquinone does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**:  
   Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each CH₂ group between the ketones is flanked by two carbonyl groups, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

From this analysis, **benzoquinone** is the compound that does not show tautomerism.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or lacks a plane of symmetry.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**:  
   The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**:  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the cis diester of maleic acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. The two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond, giving the molecule a plane of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

From this analysis, **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** is the compound that shows optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism).
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**
