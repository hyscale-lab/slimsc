Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty on IUPAC nomenclature, but let's see what I can remember.

Alright, the problem states that the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Hmm. So, that means each of these three groups is separated by one carbon; so if I imagine a benzene ring, these three groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5, right? Wait, no, meta positions are when substituents are three positions apart. Oh wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so meta would be 1,3,5, but that's actually all adjacent in a way. Wait, actually, meta positions are when substituents are separated by one carbon. So, for example, if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B is at position 3 (two carbons away), and substituent C is at position 5 (two away from B and four away from A). So all three are meta to each other.

But wait, the problem says they're all meta to one another. So each pair is meta. That might place them at positions 1,3,5 because each adjacent, but wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 are also meta. Oh, right, because going the other way around, 1 to 5 is four positions away, which is the same as two in the other direction. So the three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are at 1,3,5.

Wait, but the main substituent is going to be the carboxylic acid because the name starts with benzoic acid. So the numbering would start from there. Wait, the parent chain is the benzoic acid, so the substituents are numbered relative to that.

So the benzoic acid is at position 1. Then, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at positions 3 and 5. Or wait, maybe position 2? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the question also gives more substituents. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, so ortho to benzoic acid (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. So the hydroxyl and dimethylamino are at 2 and 6. Wait, but which is which?

And para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. So para is position 4. So position 4 is methoxy.

Wait, but the problem also says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. Hmm. So the nitrile is another substituent. Let's see, the nitrile is one of the meta substituents along with the carboxylic acid and the carbaldehyde. Wait, no, the problem says it has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. So those three are each meta. So the nitrile (cyano) is at position 3, the carboxylic acid is at 1, the carbaldehyde is at 5. Or maybe another arrangement.

Wait, maybe the positions are arranged such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the other two meta groups (carbaldehyde and cyano) are at positions 3 and 5. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to sketch this out.

Let me imagine the benzene ring with numberings from 1 to 6 in a circle. Let's number position 1 as the position with the carboxylic acid. Then, the meta positions would be 3 and 5. So the carbaldehyde and the cyano group are at 3 and 5. Now, para to the carboxylic acid is position 4. So position 4 is methoxy.

Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. So those have hydroxyl and dimethylamino. So which is which? The problem states that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino. So, position 2 and 6 have OH and N(CH3)2.

Additionally, the methoxy (position 4) and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. Wait, the nitrile is at either 3 or 5.

So let's say the nitrile is at position 3. Then, the substituents ortho to nitrile (position 3) would be positions 2 and 4. So, position 4 is methoxy, which is ortho to nitrile. Position 2 is OH, which is also ortho to nitrile. So that fits: methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (2) are both ortho to the nitrile (3).

Similarly, if the nitrile were at position 5, the ortho positions would be 4 and 6. But position 4 is methoxy, which is already para to position 1 (carboxylic acid). So if the nitrile were at 5, its ortho positions would be 4 and 6. But position 6 is N(CH3)2, which is not a hydroxyl. Because the hydroxyl is at position 2. So that wouldn't fit the condition that the hydroxyl is ortho to the nitrile. So the nitrile must be at position 3, because then both 2 (OH) and 4 (OCH3) are ortho to it.

So the substituents so far:

1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
2: OH (hydroxyl)
3: CN (cyano)
4: OCH3 (methoxy)
5: CHO (carbaldehyde)
6: N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino)

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The problem says that the three substituents (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to each other. So each of these three is meta. So position 1 (COOH), position 3 (CN), position 5 (CHO).

Now, the substituents at positions 2 and 6 are OH and N(CH3)2. Para to COOH is 4: OCH3.

Also, the nitrile is at position 3. So its ortho positions are 2 and 4. So both 2 and 4 are ortho to CN. That matches the problem statement, which says that both methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (2) are ortho to the nitrile.

So now, the substituents are:

Positions:
1: COOH
2: OH
3: CN
4: OCH3
5: CHO
6: N(CH3)2

Wait, but that leaves position 5 as CHO (carbaldehyde). So that would make the substituents on the ring at positions 1 (COOH), 2 (OH), 3 (CN), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CHO), 6 (N(CH3)2).

Now, I need to assign the lowest possible numbers to all substituents when numbering the ring. The parent is benzoic acid, so the numbering starts at the COOH group as position 1.

Now, let's list all substituents and their positions:

1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
2: OH
3: CN
4: OCH3
5: CHO
6: N(CH3)2

Wait, but wait. The question is about the IUPAC name, so I have to list substituents in alphabetical order. The substituents are: CN (cyano), CHO (formyl), COOH (carboxylic acid), OCH3 (methoxy), OH (hydroxyl), and N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino).

The order in the name should be alphabetical. The substituents are:

Carboxylic acid (COOH) is the parent. The other substituents are:

- formyl (CHO)
- cyano (CN)
- methoxy (OCH3)
- hydroxyl (OH)
- dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)

Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, ignoring any prefixes like 'dimethyl' or 'methoxy'. So the order would be based on the substituent's name. Let's list the substituents and their full names:

1. Carboxylic acid (COOH) – main chain, not a substituent in terms of numbering.
2. Cyanide (CN) → cyano group
3. Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) → dimethylamino group
4. Formyl (CHO) → carbaldehyde
5. Hydroxyl (OH) → hydroxy group
6. Methoxy (OCH3) → methoxy group

So, the substituents to list are:

CHO (formyl), CN (cyano), N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino), OH (hydroxy), OCH3 (methoxy).

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are arranged in alphabetical order. So the order would be:

Carboxylic acid is the parent. The substituents are:

- cyano
- dimethylamino
- formyl
- hydroxy
- methoxy

Wait, the alphabetical order is based on the substituent's name. Let's see:

Cyano (C) comes before dimethylamino (D), which comes before formyl (F), then hydroxy (H), then methoxy (M).

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are:

CN → cyano (so 'cyano' starts with C)
CHO → formyl (starts with F)
N(CH3)2 → 'dimethylamino' (starts with D)
OH → hydroxy (H)
OCH3 → methoxy (M)

So the order would be:

1. Cyanide (cyano)
2. Dimethylamino
3. Formyl
4. Hydroxy
5. Methoxy

But wait, in IUPAC, substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So, what's the correct order? Let me think about their prefixes.

The substituents are:

- cyano (C)
- dimethylamino (D)
- formyl (F)
- hydroxy (H)
- methoxy (M)

So the order would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but wait, sometimes substituents like hydroxy and methoxy are considered as 'O' in the prefix. For example, -O- comes after 'C', 'D', etc. Hmm, no, the alphabetical order is based on the substituent's name, not the symbol.

So the substituent names start with:

C (cyano), D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxy), M (methoxy).

So the correct order is:

1. Cyano
2. Dimethylamino
3. Formyl
4. Hydroxy
5. Methoxy

But wait, looking at the options, let me check. The options are:

Option A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

Option B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid

Option C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid

Option D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

Hmm. So each option has a different arrangement.

Wait, but the numbering is based on the substituents' positions relative to the parent. The main parent is the benzoic acid at position 1.

So let's list each substituent's position:

Benzoic acid: position 1.

Formyl (CHO): position 5.

Cyano (CN): position 3.

Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2): position 6.

Hydroxy (OH): position 2.

Methoxy (OCH3): position 4.

Wait, no. Wait, in the earlier analysis, I thought substituent positions are:

1: COOH,

2: OH,

3: CN,

4: OCH3,

5: CHO,

6: N(CH3)2.

Yes, that's correct.

So when writing the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, and their positions are indicated as numbers.

So the substituents are:

CN at 3,

CHO at 5,

N(CH3)2 at 6,

OH at 2,

OCH3 at 4.

Wait, but in the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their numbers are based on their positions relative to the parent (position 1) and lower numbers are preferred. So the substituent with the lowest number comes first in the name.

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, not by their position numbers.

But wait, the order in the name is determined by the alphabetical order of the substituent's name, regardless of their positions on the ring.

So let's arrange the substituents:

1. Cyano (CN) → position 3.

2. Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) → position 6.

3. Formyl (CHO) → position 5.

4. Hydroxy (OH) → position 2.

5. Methoxy (OCH3) → position 4.

But the substituents are to be listed in alphabetical order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So the name should be: (substituents in alphabetical order) at their respective positions.

Wait, but the options list substituents in a certain order. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So substituents in the order:

hydroxy (2), cyano (3), methoxy (4), formyl (5), dimethylamino (6).

But the alphabetical order would be cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

But in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their position numbers. So the order should be cyano, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxy, then methoxy. Wait, but their positions are 3, 6,5, 2,4, respectively.

So the substituents in alphabetical order would be:

1. Cyano (position 3)

2. Dimethylamino (position 6)

3. Formyl (position 5)

4. Hydroxy (position 2)

5. Methoxy (position 4)

Wait, but when writing the name, the substituents are written in alphabetical order, each with their respective position numbers.

So the name should be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which matches option A.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes.

But let me double-check each substituent's position.

CN is at 3 → correct.

dimethylamino is at 6 → yes.

formyl at 5 → correct.

hydroxy at 2 → correct.

methoxy at 4 → correct.

So, substituents in alphabetical order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So the name is:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which is option A.

Wait, but when looking at the substituents in the IUPAC name, the parent is benzoic acid, so the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. Let me think again: the numbering should be such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, the main substituent is the carboxylic acid at position 1. The other substituents are at 2,3,4,5,6.

So the numbering is correct as per the initial assignment. So the substituents are correctly placed.

So the correct option is A.

The problem involves determining the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with multiple substituents. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1, which is the parent functional group. The other substituents are positioned as follows:

- **Carboxylic acid (COOH)**: Position 1 (parent group).
- **Hydroxyl (OH)**: Position 2 (ortho to COOH).
- **Dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂)**: Position 6 (ortho to COOH).
- **Methoxy (OCH₃)**: Position 4 (para to COOH).
- **Cyano (CN)**: Position 3 (meta to COOH).
- **Carbaldehyde (CHO)**: Position 5 (meta to COOH).

The substituents are listed in alphabetical order in the IUPAC name: **cyano (CN)**, **dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂)**, **formyl (CHO)**, **hydroxy (OH)**, and **methoxy (OCH₃)**. Their positions are:

- **Cyano (CN)**: Position 3.
- **Dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂)**: Position 6.
- **Formyl (CHO)**: Position 5.
- **Hydroxy (OH)**: Position 2.
- **Methoxy (OCH₃)**: Position 4.

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**, which matches **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty on IUPAC nomenclature, but let's see what I can remember.

Alright, the problem states that the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Hmm. So, that means each of these three groups is separated by one carbon; so if I imagine a benzene ring, these three groups are at positions 1, 3, and 5, right? Wait, no, meta positions are when substituents are three positions apart. Oh wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so meta would be 1,3,5, but that's actually all adjacent in a way. Wait, actually, meta positions are when substituents are separated by one carbon. So, for example, if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B is at position 3 (two carbons away), and substituent C is at position 5 (two away from B and four away from A). So all three are meta to each other.

But wait, the problem says they're all meta to one another. So each pair is meta. That might place them at positions 1,3,5 because each adjacent, but wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 are also meta. Oh, right, because going the other way around, 1 to 5 is four positions away, which is the same as two in the other direction. So the three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, cyano) are at 1,3,5.

Wait, but the main substituent is going to be the carboxylic acid because the name starts with benzoic acid. So the numbering would start from there. Wait, the parent chain is the benzoic acid, so the substituents are numbered relative to that.

So the benzoic acid is at position 1. Then, the carbaldehyde and cyano groups are at positions 3 and 5. Or wait, maybe position 2? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the question also gives more substituents. Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, so ortho to benzoic acid (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. So the hydroxyl and dimethylamino are at 2 and 6. Wait, but which is which?

And para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. So para is position 4. So position 4 is methoxy.

Wait, but the problem also says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. Hmm. So the nitrile is another substituent. Let's see, the nitrile is one of the meta substituents along with the carboxylic acid and the carbaldehyde. Wait, no, the problem says it has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. So those three are each meta. So the nitrile (cyano) is at position 3, the carboxylic acid is at 1, the carbaldehyde is at 5. Or maybe another arrangement.

Wait, maybe the positions are arranged such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the other two meta groups (carbaldehyde and cyano) are at positions 3 and 5. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to sketch this out.

Let me imagine the benzene ring with numberings from 1 to 6 in a circle. Let's number position 1 as the position with the carboxylic acid. Then, the meta positions would be 3 and 5. So the carbaldehyde and the cyano group are at 3 and 5. Now, para to the carboxylic acid is position 4. So position 4 is methoxy.

Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. So those have hydroxyl and dimethylamino. So which is which? The problem states that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino. So, position 2 and 6 have OH and N(CH3)2.

Additionally, the methoxy (position 4) and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. Wait, the nitrile is at either 3 or 5.

So let's say the nitrile is at position 3. Then, the substituents ortho to nitrile (position 3) would be positions 2 and 4. So, position 4 is methoxy, which is ortho to nitrile. Position 2 is OH, which is also ortho to nitrile. So that fits: methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (2) are both ortho to the nitrile (3).

Similarly, if the nitrile were at position 5, the ortho positions would be 4 and 6. But position 4 is methoxy, which is already para to position 1 (carboxylic acid). So if the nitrile were at 5, its ortho positions would be 4 and 6. But position 6 is N(CH3)2, which is not a hydroxyl. Because the hydroxyl is at position 2. So that wouldn't fit the condition that the hydroxyl is ortho to the nitrile. So the nitrile must be at position 3, because then both 2 (OH) and 4 (OCH3) are ortho to it.

So the substituents so far:

1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
2: OH (hydroxyl)
3: CN (cyano)
4: OCH3 (methoxy)
5: CHO (carbaldehyde)
6: N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino)

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The problem says that the three substituents (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to each other. So each of these three is meta. So position 1 (COOH), position 3 (CN), position 5 (CHO).

Now, the substituents at positions 2 and 6 are OH and N(CH3)2. Para to COOH is 4: OCH3.

Also, the nitrile is at position 3. So its ortho positions are 2 and 4. So both 2 and 4 are ortho to CN. That matches the problem statement, which says that both methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (2) are ortho to the nitrile.

So now, the substituents are:

Positions:
1: COOH
2: OH
3: CN
4: OCH3
5: CHO
6: N(CH3)2

Wait, but that leaves position 5 as CHO (carbaldehyde). So that would make the substituents on the ring at positions 1 (COOH), 2 (OH), 3 (CN), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CHO), 6 (N(CH3)2).

Now, I need to assign the lowest possible numbers to all substituents when numbering the ring. The parent is benzoic acid, so the numbering starts at the COOH group as position 1.

Now, let's list all substituents and their positions:

1: COOH (carboxylic acid)
2: OH
3: CN
4: OCH3
5: CHO
6: N(CH3)2

Wait, but wait. The question is about the IUPAC name, so I have to list substituents in alphabetical order. The substituents are: CN (cyano), CHO (formyl), COOH (carboxylic acid), OCH3 (methoxy), OH (hydroxyl), and N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino).

The order in the name should be alphabetical. The substituents are:

Carboxylic acid (COOH) is the parent. The other substituents are:

- formyl (CHO)
- cyano (CN)
- methoxy (OCH3)
- hydroxyl (OH)
- dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)

Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, ignoring any prefixes like 'dimethyl' or 'methoxy'. So the order would be based on the substituent's name. Let's list the substituents and their full names:

1. Carboxylic acid (COOH) – main chain, not a substituent in terms of numbering.
2. Cyanide (CN) → cyano group
3. Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) → dimethylamino group
4. Formyl (CHO) → carbaldehyde
5. Hydroxyl (OH) → hydroxy group
6. Methoxy (OCH3) → methoxy group

So, the substituents to list are:

CHO (formyl), CN (cyano), N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino), OH (hydroxy), OCH3 (methoxy).

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are arranged in alphabetical order. So the order would be:

Carboxylic acid is the parent. The substituents are:

- cyano
- dimethylamino
- formyl
- hydroxy
- methoxy

Wait, the alphabetical order is based on the substituent's name. Let's see:

Cyano (C) comes before dimethylamino (D), which comes before formyl (F), then hydroxy (H), then methoxy (M).

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are:

CN → cyano (so 'cyano' starts with C)
CHO → formyl (starts with F)
N(CH3)2 → 'dimethylamino' (starts with D)
OH → hydroxy (H)
OCH3 → methoxy (M)

So the order would be:

1. Cyanide (cyano)
2. Dimethylamino
3. Formyl
4. Hydroxy
5. Methoxy

But wait, in IUPAC, substituents are listed in alphabetical order. So, what's the correct order? Let me think about their prefixes.

The substituents are:

- cyano (C)
- dimethylamino (D)
- formyl (F)
- hydroxy (H)
- methoxy (M)

So the order would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but wait, sometimes substituents like hydroxy and methoxy are considered as 'O' in the prefix. For example, -O- comes after 'C', 'D', etc. Hmm, no, the alphabetical order is based on the substituent's name, not the symbol.

So the substituent names start with:

C (cyano), D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxy), M (methoxy).

So the correct order is:

1. Cyano
2. Dimethylamino
3. Formyl
4. Hydroxy
5. Methoxy

But wait, looking at the options, let me check. The options are:

Option A) 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

Option B) 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid

Option C) 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid

Option D) 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

Hmm. So each option has a different arrangement.

Wait, but the numbering is based on the substituents' positions relative to the parent. The main parent is the benzoic acid at position 1.

So let's list each substituent's position:

Benzoic acid: position 1.

Formyl (CHO): position 5.

Cyano (CN): position 3.

Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2): position 6.

Hydroxy (OH): position 2.

Methoxy (OCH3): position 4.

Wait, no. Wait, in the earlier analysis, I thought substituent positions are:

1: COOH,

2: OH,

3: CN,

4: OCH3,

5: CHO,

6: N(CH3)2.

Yes, that's correct.

So when writing the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, and their positions are indicated as numbers.

So the substituents are:

CN at 3,

CHO at 5,

N(CH3)2 at 6,

OH at 2,

OCH3 at 4.

Wait, but in the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their numbers are based on their positions relative to the parent (position 1) and lower numbers are preferred. So the substituent with the lowest number comes first in the name.

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, not by their position numbers.

But wait, the order in the name is determined by the alphabetical order of the substituent's name, regardless of their positions on the ring.

So let's arrange the substituents:

1. Cyano (CN) → position 3.

2. Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) → position 6.

3. Formyl (CHO) → position 5.

4. Hydroxy (OH) → position 2.

5. Methoxy (OCH3) → position 4.

But the substituents are to be listed in alphabetical order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So the name should be: (substituents in alphabetical order) at their respective positions.

Wait, but the options list substituents in a certain order. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So substituents in the order:

hydroxy (2), cyano (3), methoxy (4), formyl (5), dimethylamino (6).

But the alphabetical order would be cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

But in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their position numbers. So the order should be cyano, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxy, then methoxy. Wait, but their positions are 3, 6,5, 2,4, respectively.

So the substituents in alphabetical order would be:

1. Cyano (position 3)

2. Dimethylamino (position 6)

3. Formyl (position 5)

4. Hydroxy (position 2)

5. Methoxy (position 4)

Wait, but when writing the name, the substituents are written in alphabetical order, each with their respective position numbers.

So the name should be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which matches option A.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes.

But let me double-check each substituent's position.

CN is at 3 → correct.

dimethylamino is at 6 → yes.

formyl at 5 → correct.

hydroxy at 2 → correct.

methoxy at 4 → correct.

So, substituents in alphabetical order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So the name is:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which is option A.

Wait, but when looking at the substituents in the IUPAC name, the parent is benzoic acid, so the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. Let me think again: the numbering should be such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, the main substituent is the carboxylic acid at position 1. The other substituents are at 2,3,4,5,6.

So the numbering is correct as per the initial assignment. So the substituents are correctly placed.

So the correct option is A.


The problem involves determining the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with multiple substituents. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1, which is the parent functional group. The other substituents are positioned as follows:

- **Carboxylic acid (COOH)**: Position 1 (parent group).
- **Hydroxyl (OH)**: Position 2 (ortho to COOH).
- **Dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂)**: Position 6 (ortho to COOH).
- **Methoxy (OCH₃)**: Position 4 (para to COOH).
- **Cyano (CN)**: Position 3 (meta to COOH).
- **Carbaldehyde (CHO)**: Position 5 (meta to COOH).

The substituents are listed in alphabetical order in the IUPAC name: **cyano (CN)**, **dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂)**, **formyl (CHO)**, **hydroxy (OH)**, and **methoxy (OCH₃)**. Their positions are:

- **Cyano (CN)**: Position 3.
- **Dimethylamino (N(CH₃)₂)**: Position 6.
- **Formyl (CHO)**: Position 5.
- **Hydroxy (OH)**: Position 2.
- **Methoxy (OCH₃)**: Position 4.

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**, which matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
