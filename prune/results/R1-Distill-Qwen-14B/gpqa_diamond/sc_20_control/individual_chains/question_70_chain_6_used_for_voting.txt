Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what each part is saying. 

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. My goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. 

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, so I should probably start by figuring out what each of these chemicals could be. Let's break down the reactions one by one.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking, what reaction produces a bright red product? I remember that some metal sulfides or maybe metal oxides can be red. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur. Oh, wait, I've heard that when a metal reacts with sulfur, it can form a compound that's bright red. For instance, maybe copper reacting with sulfur? But wait, copper's sulfide is black. Oh, wait, maybe it's lead sulfide, but that's more of a dark color. Oh, wait, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another angle: if A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. Like, maybe B is oxygen or sulfur? Because 8 equivalents is a lot. Let me think about the ratio. If B is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or S8 (which is actually an allotrope of sulfur), but S8 is a solid, not a gas. So maybe B is O2. If A reacts with O2, maybe it's forming a metal oxide. But a bright red oxide... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is chlorine gas? Because Cl2 is a gas. But 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. Wait, if A is something like sodium, the reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. But that's one equivalent of Cl2 to two of Na. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about another reaction. What about the formation of a metal nitride? For example, nitrogen gas reacting with a metal. But I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe B is sulfur, but S8 is solid, so maybe it's S in another form? Alternatively, maybe B is carbon monoxide or something else. Hmm, not clicking yet.

Let me think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is possibly a highly toxic gas like HCl, but that's more of a product. Alternatively, if C is SO3, and D is H2O, but that's not a gas. Wait, but the second reaction has gas D. Let me think. Another possibility is that E is something like SO2, which is a gas and can be hazardous. Or maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN or something else. Hmm.

The third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. So maybe C is a salt that's acidic in water. Wait, but C is a product of A and B; maybe C is a sulfide or some other compound. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Si3N4, but that might not react with water to form acids. Wait, if C is a metal sulfide, like FeS, but that would react with water to form H2S (a weak acid) and Fe(OH)2, which isn't an acid. Hmm, maybe C is a sulfate? Or perhaps a higher oxidation state compound.

Wait, another angle. If C reacts with water to form A and two acids, one strong and one weak. Let's think about a reaction where a salt is formed. For example, suppose C is a nitride, like AlN. If AlN reacts with water, it produces NH3 and Al(OH)3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate. For example, if C is Na2SO3, reacting with water would not produce acids necessarily. Or, if C is something like CaC2O4 (calcium oxalate), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfide, like CuS. If CuS reacts with water, maybe it's not directly reacting. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about each step again.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Second: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous). Third: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). Fourth: D + B → H (solvent).

Fourth reaction: D and B, in a 1:1 ratio, form H, which is a solvent. Solvents like water, ethanol, etc. But D and B are both gases, so their combination is a solvent. Hmm, possible options: maybe D is H2O, but then B would have to be something that reacts with H2O to form a solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O. Let's see: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the ratio is 1:1, so maybe D is H2 and B is O2. Then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, but here the ratio of H2 to O2 is 2:1, so that wouldn't fit a 1:1 ratio. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is something else. Wait, another thought: if B is O2 and D is C (carbon monoxide?), but no, because D is a gas. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, 1:1 reaction: H2 + Cl2 → 2HCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio? Wait, H2 and Cl2 react in a 1:1 molar ratio to form 2 HCl. So that would fit. So D is H2, B is Cl2. Then H is HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then H is HCl, which is not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is C (carbon monoxide), but that's not a common reaction. Alternatively, perhaps B is N2 and D is H2, but that's the Haber process, which makes NH3, a liquid or gas. Hmm, maybe that's it. Let's think: N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But the ratio here is 1:1.5, so not 1:1. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, another solvent: maybe H is ethanol. But how would B and D react to form ethanol? That's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH3COOH? Not sure.

Wait, maybe D is CO and B is H2O? No, because B is a gas. H2O is a liquid at room temp. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is NH3 and D is H2O? But then, they don't react. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O? Not sure. Alternatively, think of H as something like H2O. How would that form? B and D could be O2 and H2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio of H2 to O2 is 2:1, but the problem states a 1:1 ratio. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is another gas? Wait, but B was earlier a gas reacting with A to form C. So perhaps B is H2O, but that's a liquid. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider what E could be, as it's extremely hazardous. Options like HCN, SO2, NO, Cl2, etc. But E is a product of C reacting with D. So, if E is SO2, then C might be a sulfide, and D could be O2. But let's see.

Wait, earlier when C reacts with water, it forms A and two acids. So if C is, say, FeS, then water wouldn't react much. But if C is something like Al(OH)3, no. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: If A is a metal, B is a diatomic gas. Suppose A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2. Then, 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's only 1 equivalent of Cl2. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B, so this doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is H2S and B is O2? No, because A is a solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal, and B is O2. Then, the reaction could be 2 Mo + 3 O2 → 2 MoO3. But I don't know if MoO3 is bright red.

Alternatively, maybe A is Fe and B is S8. But S8 is solid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So the decomposition of C in water gives a metal (A) and two acids. That suggests that C is a salt of the metal, perhaps a sulfate or sulfide.

Wait, if C is a metal sulfide, like PbS (which is bright red, I think), then reacting with water might not produce much. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, which reacts with water to produce NH3 and Mg(OH)2. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, like CuSO4. Then, when CuSO4 reacts with water, it just dissolves, but that doesn't produce an acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2. But that's not giving two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate? No, that would produce CO2 and the metal hydroxide.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, reacting with water might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps C is a higher oxidation state compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Fe and B is O2, then Fe + O2 → FeO or Fe3O4. But would Fe3O4 react with water? Not much. Alternatively, if C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Then, Na2O2 reacts with water to produce O2 and NaOH. But that's a strong base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate? Not sure how that would react with water. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride. For example, if A is Na and B is Cl2, then 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But again, the ratio isn't matching.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me go back to the second reaction: C + 2 D → E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is a gas, perhaps it's SO2, which is dangerous. Then, D could be O2. So C is a sulfide, and when it reacts with O2, it forms SO2.

Wait, but to get SO2, you could have a reaction where a sulfide (C) is oxidized. Suppose C is FeS. FeS + O2 → FeO + SO2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe C is S itself. But S is bright yellow, not red. Hmm.

Wait, in the first reaction, product C is bright red. What's a bright red solid? Maybe mercury(II) oxide is red, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown. Or perhaps it's a sulfide. Wait, another thought: maybe C is a form of chromium(III) oxide, which is green, so that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that's red, but I'm not recalling any. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound of sulfur. For instance, perhaps C is a polymeric form of sulfur, which is bright red. Oh! I think I remember that colloidal sulfur is bright red. So if A is something that reacts with B to produce colloidal sulfur (C), which is bright red.

So, if B is H2S gas, but wait, H2S is a gas, but in the first reaction, B is a gas reacting with solid A to form C. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is S8 gas, but S8 is a solid at room temperature. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and A is a metal that when oxidized forms a red oxide. Wait, perhaps A is copper. Because copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe another form. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another angle: if C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Let's think about E as HCN. HCN is a highly toxic gas. So, if E is HCN, then C would be something that upon reaction with D (which might be a halogen, like Cl2) produces HCN. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, if E is SO2, then D could be O2, and C could be a sulfide.

Wait, let's tie this together. Suppose C is a sulfide, and D is O2. Then, 2 C (sulfide) + 2 O2 → 2 SO2. Wait, but that's an example, but I'm not sure about the actual reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is FeS. Then, FeS + O2 → FeO + SO2. But I'm not sure of the exact stoichiometry.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal carbide, maybe it reacts with O2 to form CO or CO2, which are dangerous. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is a highly toxic gas like Cl2, but that's more of a starting material.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the fourth reaction again: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D and B are gases, their reaction produces a solvent. What solvents are produced from reactions of gases?

Hmm, water is a solvent and is formed from H2 and O2. But H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio to form 2 H2O. So that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, which is a gas but can be a solvent. NH3 is a liquid at certain conditions. So, how would you get NH3 from B and D?

If B is N2 and D is H2, then 1:3 ratio in the Haber process, which doesn't fit 1:1.

Alternatively, if B is NO and D is something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is CH3OH (methanol), but how would that form from two gases? Maybe from CO and H2. But the stoichiometry for that would be different. Alternatively, maybe H is a hydrocarbon like CH4? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like HCl. Wait, but HCl is a gas and a strong acid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is a solvent like ethanol. But how would that form from two gases? Maybe from ethylene and water, but that would require a catalyst, and the stoichiometry is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe H is something else, like an alcohol or something else. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Wait, another angle: perhaps H is a diatomic molecule like O2 or something, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, H could be a noble gas, but they're not typically solvents.

Wait, maybe I should think about the options for E and its symmetry. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are symmetry groups (point groups) in molecular symmetry.

C2 is a two-fold rotation. D4h has a four-fold rotation with inversion, etc. D∞h would be something with infinite symmetry, like a cylinder. C2v has a two-fold rotation plus a mirror plane.

So, what molecules have which symmetries? For example:

- H2O has D2h symmetry.
- NH3 has Td symmetry.
- O2 has D∞h symmetry.
- SO2 has D∞h symmetry? Or maybe C2v. Wait, SO2 is a bent molecule, so it has a C2 axis and a mirror plane. Wait, no, SO2 has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry because it's a bent molecule with two mirror planes perpendicular to the axis and a two-fold rotation.

Wait, but let me think. SO2 has a central S atom with two O atoms. The structure is bent, similar to O3. O3 has C2v symmetry because it's a bent molecule with a mirror plane containing the central oxygen and the C2 axis perpendicular to it.

Wait, so if E is SO2, which has a bent structure, then its symmetry would be C2v. Because it's a trigonal planar molecule with a central atom and two others, but wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule with three atoms, so the point group is C2v.

Alternatively, if E is O2, which is diatomic, it has D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

Wait, but in the second reaction, C reacts with D to form E. If E is O2, then that reaction would be C + 2 D → O2. But O2 is a gas, but in the first reaction, C is produced from A and B. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe E is something else. Let's think about HCN. HCN has a linear structure, which is I symmetry, but I don't think any of the options match that. Oh, wait, I symmetry is a type of symmetry, but it's not one of the options.

Another possibility: if E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, and if E is Cl2, then in the reaction C + 2 D → Cl2. But Cl2 is quite a stable molecule, so that might not be the case.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. A is a solid, B is a gas. They react in a 1:8 ratio to form C, which is bright red.

Another thought: perhaps A is iron and B is sulfur vapor. Iron and sulfur react to form FeS, which is black. Hmm, not red.

Wait, what if C is a form of chromium trioxide (CrO3), which is dark red. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mercury(I) compound. Mercury(I) oxide is red. So, if A is Hg and B is O2, then 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO (red). But I'm not sure if HgO is red. Wait, I think HgO is red, yes.

So, assuming C is HgO, which is red. Then, reacting C with D would produce E. Let's see.

Then, the third reaction: C (HgO) + H2O → A (Hg) + F and G (two acids). So HgO + H2O → Hg + O2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's reacting in a different way. Wait, no, HgO is not very reactive with water. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is PbO2 (lead dioxide), which is dark brown, not red. So that's not it.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a colloidal solution of sulfur. If A is a metal that reacts with B (sulfur vapor) to form colloidal sulfur, which is bright red. For example, perhaps A is sodium, and B is S8 gas. But S8 is solid, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium metal and B is hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S). But that might not form a red product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is A (carbon) reacting with B (sulfur vapor). Carbon reacts with sulfur vapor to form carbon disulfide (CS2), but I'm not sure about the product's color.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is copper(I) sulfide, which is red. So, A is copper and B is H2S. But copper and H2S would form CuS, which is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is between a metal and SO3 gas. But I don't think that's right.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas like F2. The reaction could produce a fluoride. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, maybe the bright red product is mercuric sulfide (cinnabar), which is bright red. Cinnabar is HgS. So, if A is Hg and B is S8 (though S8 is solid), but maybe in the reaction, S is in gaseous form. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2S, and A is Hg. Then, Hg + H2S → HgS (cinnabar) which is red. But that would be a reaction between a metal and a gas, which fits the first reaction.

So, C is HgS. Then, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (a gas) to form E, which is extremely hazardous.

What reaction could HgS undergo with a gas to form a dangerous product? Maybe oxidation. For example, HgS + O2 → HgO + SO2. Let's see the stoichiometry. Suppose 2 HgS + 3 O2 → 2 HgO + 2 SO2. That's plausible. But in the problem, it's C + 2 D → E. So D would be O2, and E would be SO2 and HgO? No, because E is a product, which would have to be a single compound.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's think again. If C is HgS, reacting with O2 (D) in a 2:2 ratio (so 1:1 molar ratio), perhaps to produce HgO and SO2. But that would be two products, which doesn't fit the reaction as E is a single product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is HgS + O2 → HgO + SO2. But that's 1 HgS and 1 O2 giving 1 HgO and 1 SO2. So, that would fit C + D → E, but the problem states 2 D. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider what E is. If E is SO2, which is a gas and dangerous, then that could fit. So, in the reaction, C is HgS, and D is O2. So, HgS + 2 O2 → HgO + 2 SO2. But then E would be a mixture, but the problem says it produces E. So perhaps E is SO2.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is HgS + O2 → HgO + SO2, and E is SO2, which is dangerous.

Then, in the third reaction, C (HgS) reacts with water to reform A (Hg) and two acids. So, HgS + H2O → Hg + H2S. But H2S is a weak acid. So F and G would be H2S (weak acid) and another acid. Wait, but where's the other acid coming from? Alternatively, perhaps HgS is not reacting with water, or the reaction is different.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track with C being HgS.

Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the third reaction again. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, when C is dissolved in water, it produces A, a strong acid, and a weak acid.

This suggests that C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. For example, if C is sodium sulfide (Na2S), then when it reacts with water, it can produce H2S (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But in the reaction, it produces A, which would be Na, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For instance, Ca3N2 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate, like BaSO4. But that doesn't react with water.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate, like CaCO3. It would react with water but not produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. When it reacts with water, it might form H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is a base, not an acid.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal hydroxide. But that doesn't fit with the first reaction.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to think about the possible structures of E and their symmetry groups.

If E is SO2, its structure is bent, with the central S atom and two O atoms. The point group would be C2v. Because it has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and a mirror plane containing the S atom and each O atom. So, the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

Alternatively, if E is O2, it's a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought E might be SO2 because of the reaction with D (O2) and C (sulfide). So, if E is SO2, then its symmetry is C2v.

But wait, earlier I was considering E as O2, which would have D∞h. So, which one is it?

Let me go back to the reactions. If E is O2, that would mean that C + 2 D → O2. But that doesn't make much sense because O2 is already a gas, and that would require C and D to be something that produces O2. Alternatively, if C is HgO, and D is H2, then HgO + H2 → Hg + H2O. But that would produce H2O, not O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2. Then, the reaction would be C + 2 D → Cl2. But Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, and its symmetry is D∞h. So, if E is Cl2, the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But how would that fit the other reactions? Let's try to see.

If C is, say, a chloride, and D is H2. Maybe C is HgCl2. Then, HgCl2 + 2 H2 → Hg + 2 HCl. So E would be HCl, which is a gas, but HCl is a strong acid. But the problem says E is extremely hazardous, so that could fit. But then, in the third reaction, C (HgCl2) + H2O → Hg + HCl and HOCl (a weak acid), but HCl is a strong acid, and HOCl is a weak acid. So F would be HCl (strong) and G would be HOCl (weak). That fits the description.

But then, in the first reaction, A reacts with B to form C (HgCl2). So, what would A and B be? If B is Cl2 gas, then A could be Hg metal. So, Hg (A) reacts with Cl2 (B) in a 1:8 ratio? Wait, the reaction for mercury(II) chloride is Hg + Cl2 → HgCl2. The molar ratio is 1:1. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B, which would imply 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. That doesn't fit because 1 mole of Cl2 reacts with 1 mole of Hg to form 1 mole of HgCl2.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the equations wrong. Let me think about the first reaction again. Solid A + 8 equivalents gas B → C (bright red). So, 1 mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B.

If B is Cl2, then 1 mole of A would react with 4 moles of Cl2 (since each Cl2 molecule contributes 2 Cl atoms). So, if A is a metal that forms a +2 cation, then 1 mole of A would need 2 moles of Cl2. But the problem has 8 equivalents, which is 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. That suggests a higher oxidation state.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a +4 cation. For example, if A is Pb, then Pb + 2 Cl2 → PbCl4. So, 1 mole of Pb reacts with 2 moles of Cl2. But the problem states 8 equivalents, which is 8 moles of Cl2, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is a +1 cation. For example, if A is Na, then Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio. Not 8.

Wait, maybe B isn't Cl2. Let's think of another gas. Suppose B is O2. Then, solid A could be a metal that reacts with O2 to form a metal oxide. But earlier I thought about that and couldn't find a red product.

Wait, another thought: if B is S8 gas, but that's not a gas under standard conditions. Alternatively, maybe B is H2S gas. Then, A could be a metal that reacts with H2S to form a sulfide. For example, Zn + H2S → ZnS + H2. But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just focus on determining E and its symmetry group, assuming I can't figure out all the reactions.

If E is SO2, its point group is C2v. If E is O2, point group is D∞h. If E is Cl2, point group is D∞h. If E is another molecule, like HCN (linear, I symmetry, which isn't an option), or H2O (D2h, which isn't an option), or NH3 (Td, not an option).

So, among the options, the possible E's symmetry groups are either C2v (option D) or D∞h (option C).

Now, considering that in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 D to form E. If E is O2, then D would be something that helps form O2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if E is SO2, then D would be O2, and C would be a sulfide.

In that case, when C (sulfide) reacts with O2 (D), it forms SO2 (E). Then, the third reaction, C (sulfide) reacts with water to form A (metal), H2S (weak acid, G), and another acid F. Wait, but when a sulfide reacts with water, it usually produces H2S and the metal hydroxide. So F would be the hydroxide, which is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate. For example, when a sulfate reacts with water, it doesn't form acids. Hmm.

I'm stuck again. Let me try to think about the options for E. If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2. If E has C2v symmetry, it's a bent molecule like SO2 or O3.

But O3 has C2v symmetry. However, O3 is not a common product. Alternatively, SO2 is more likely.

If E is SO2 (C2v symmetry), then in the fourth reaction, D and B (gases) react to form H (solvent). So, D is O2 and B is something else.

Wait, fourth reaction is D + B → H (solvent), in a 1:1 ratio. If D is O2 and B is H2, then H is H2O. But H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio to form 2 H2O. So that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and B is N2. Then, they don't react. Not helpful.

Wait, another possibility: if D is CO and B is something else. For example, CO and H2O don't react. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2 and B is O2, but again, the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1.

Wait, perhaps H is NH3. Then, B would be N2 and D would be H2. But the reaction N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3 is the Haber process, with a 1:1.5 ratio, which doesn't fit 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is CH4. But I don't see how that would form from two gases.

Wait, perhaps H is something like HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent.

This is getting too complicated. Let me make an educated guess. Based on the options, and the possible products, I think E is SO2, which has a C2v symmetry group. So the answer would be D) C2v.

But wait, another angle: if E is H2O, which has D2h symmetry, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which has C2v symmetry. Ozone is a bent molecule with a central O atom, so its symmetry is C2v.

But I'm not sure if Ozone is produced in such reactions. Alternatively, perhaps E is something else.

If I have to choose, I'll go with E being SO2, which has C2v symmetry. So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. A possible interpretation is that A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas. The bright red color of C suggests it could be a sulfide or a compound like HgS (cinnabar), which is bright red.

2. **Second Reaction**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. If C is a sulfide, D could be O₂, leading to the formation of SO₂, a highly toxic gas. SO₂ is a bent molecule with a trigonal planar geometry, giving it **C2v symmetry**.

3. **Third Reaction**: C reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). If C is a sulfide like HgS, it could decompose in water to form Hg (A) and H₂S (weak acid, G), though the exact reaction details remain unclear.

4. **Fourth Reaction**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If D is O₂ and B is H₂, they could theoretically form H₂O, but the stoichiometry does not perfectly align with a 1:1 ratio. This reaction is less critical to determining the symmetry of E.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are:
   - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis.
   - **D4h**: A four-fold rotation with inversion and horizontal mirror planes.
   - **D∞h**: Infinite symmetry, characteristic of diatomic molecules like O₂ or Cl₂.
   - **C2v**: A two-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane, characteristic of bent molecules like SO₂.

Given the reactions and the hazardous nature of E, SO₂ is a plausible candidate for E. SO₂ has a bent structure with **C2v symmetry**, making this the most consistent choice.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and see what each part is saying. 

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. My goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. 

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, so I should probably start by figuring out what each of these chemicals could be. Let's break down the reactions one by one.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking, what reaction produces a bright red product? I remember that some metal sulfides or maybe metal oxides can be red. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur. Oh, wait, I've heard that when a metal reacts with sulfur, it can form a compound that's bright red. For instance, maybe copper reacting with sulfur? But wait, copper's sulfide is black. Oh, wait, maybe it's lead sulfide, but that's more of a dark color. Oh, wait, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another angle: if A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. Like, maybe B is oxygen or sulfur? Because 8 equivalents is a lot. Let me think about the ratio. If B is a diatomic molecule, like O2 or S8 (which is actually an allotrope of sulfur), but S8 is a solid, not a gas. So maybe B is O2. If A reacts with O2, maybe it's forming a metal oxide. But a bright red oxide... Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is chlorine gas? Because Cl2 is a gas. But 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles per mole of A. Wait, if A is something like sodium, the reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. But that's one equivalent of Cl2 to two of Na. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about another reaction. What about the formation of a metal nitride? For example, nitrogen gas reacting with a metal. But I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe B is sulfur, but S8 is solid, so maybe it's S in another form? Alternatively, maybe B is carbon monoxide or something else. Hmm, not clicking yet.

Let me think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E is possibly a highly toxic gas like HCl, but that's more of a product. Alternatively, if C is SO3, and D is H2O, but that's not a gas. Wait, but the second reaction has gas D. Let me think. Another possibility is that E is something like SO2, which is a gas and can be hazardous. Or maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN or something else. Hmm.

The third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. So maybe C is a salt that's acidic in water. Wait, but C is a product of A and B; maybe C is a sulfide or some other compound. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Si3N4, but that might not react with water to form acids. Wait, if C is a metal sulfide, like FeS, but that would react with water to form H2S (a weak acid) and Fe(OH)2, which isn't an acid. Hmm, maybe C is a sulfate? Or perhaps a higher oxidation state compound.

Wait, another angle. If C reacts with water to form A and two acids, one strong and one weak. Let's think about a reaction where a salt is formed. For example, suppose C is a nitride, like AlN. If AlN reacts with water, it produces NH3 and Al(OH)3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite or sulfate. For example, if C is Na2SO3, reacting with water would not produce acids necessarily. Or, if C is something like CaC2O4 (calcium oxalate), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfide, like CuS. If CuS reacts with water, maybe it's not directly reacting. Alternatively, maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about each step again.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Second: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous). Third: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). Fourth: D + B → H (solvent).

Fourth reaction: D and B, in a 1:1 ratio, form H, which is a solvent. Solvents like water, ethanol, etc. But D and B are both gases, so their combination is a solvent. Hmm, possible options: maybe D is H2O, but then B would have to be something that reacts with H2O to form a solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O. Let's see: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the ratio is 1:1, so maybe D is H2 and B is O2. Then 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, but here the ratio of H2 to O2 is 2:1, so that wouldn't fit a 1:1 ratio. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is something else. Wait, another thought: if B is O2 and D is C (carbon monoxide?), but no, because D is a gas. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, 1:1 reaction: H2 + Cl2 → 2HCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio? Wait, H2 and Cl2 react in a 1:1 molar ratio to form 2 HCl. So that would fit. So D is H2, B is Cl2. Then H is HCl, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then H is HCl, which is not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is C (carbon monoxide), but that's not a common reaction. Alternatively, perhaps B is N2 and D is H2, but that's the Haber process, which makes NH3, a liquid or gas. Hmm, maybe that's it. Let's think: N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3. But the ratio here is 1:1.5, so not 1:1. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, another solvent: maybe H is ethanol. But how would B and D react to form ethanol? That's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe H is something like CH3COOH? Not sure.

Wait, maybe D is CO and B is H2O? No, because B is a gas. H2O is a liquid at room temp. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is NH3 and D is H2O? But then, they don't react. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O? Not sure. Alternatively, think of H as something like H2O. How would that form? B and D could be O2 and H2. Then, 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio of H2 to O2 is 2:1, but the problem states a 1:1 ratio. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is another gas? Wait, but B was earlier a gas reacting with A to form C. So perhaps B is H2O, but that's a liquid. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider what E could be, as it's extremely hazardous. Options like HCN, SO2, NO, Cl2, etc. But E is a product of C reacting with D. So, if E is SO2, then C might be a sulfide, and D could be O2. But let's see.

Wait, earlier when C reacts with water, it forms A and two acids. So if C is, say, FeS, then water wouldn't react much. But if C is something like Al(OH)3, no. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: If A is a metal, B is a diatomic gas. Suppose A is sodium (Na), and B is Cl2. Then, 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's only 1 equivalent of Cl2. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B, so this doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is H2S and B is O2? No, because A is a solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal, and B is O2. Then, the reaction could be 2 Mo + 3 O2 → 2 MoO3. But I don't know if MoO3 is bright red.

Alternatively, maybe A is Fe and B is S8. But S8 is solid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So the decomposition of C in water gives a metal (A) and two acids. That suggests that C is a salt of the metal, perhaps a sulfate or sulfide.

Wait, if C is a metal sulfide, like PbS (which is bright red, I think), then reacting with water might not produce much. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, which reacts with water to produce NH3 and Mg(OH)2. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate, like CuSO4. Then, when CuSO4 reacts with water, it just dissolves, but that doesn't produce an acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2. But that's not giving two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate? No, that would produce CO2 and the metal hydroxide.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Then, reacting with water might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps C is a higher oxidation state compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is Fe and B is O2, then Fe + O2 → FeO or Fe3O4. But would Fe3O4 react with water? Not much. Alternatively, if C is a peroxide, like Na2O2. Then, Na2O2 reacts with water to produce O2 and NaOH. But that's a strong base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate? Not sure how that would react with water. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride. For example, if A is Na and B is Cl2, then 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But again, the ratio isn't matching.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me go back to the second reaction: C + 2 D → E, which is extremely hazardous. If E is a gas, perhaps it's SO2, which is dangerous. Then, D could be O2. So C is a sulfide, and when it reacts with O2, it forms SO2.

Wait, but to get SO2, you could have a reaction where a sulfide (C) is oxidized. Suppose C is FeS. FeS + O2 → FeO + SO2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe C is S itself. But S is bright yellow, not red. Hmm.

Wait, in the first reaction, product C is bright red. What's a bright red solid? Maybe mercury(II) oxide is red, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe it's lead dioxide (PbO2), which is dark brown. Or perhaps it's a sulfide. Wait, another thought: maybe C is a form of chromium(III) oxide, which is green, so that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that's red, but I'm not recalling any. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound of sulfur. For instance, perhaps C is a polymeric form of sulfur, which is bright red. Oh! I think I remember that colloidal sulfur is bright red. So if A is something that reacts with B to produce colloidal sulfur (C), which is bright red.

So, if B is H2S gas, but wait, H2S is a gas, but in the first reaction, B is a gas reacting with solid A to form C. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is S8 gas, but S8 is a solid at room temperature. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and A is a metal that when oxidized forms a red oxide. Wait, perhaps A is copper. Because copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe another form. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another angle: if C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Let's think about E as HCN. HCN is a highly toxic gas. So, if E is HCN, then C would be something that upon reaction with D (which might be a halogen, like Cl2) produces HCN. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, if E is SO2, then D could be O2, and C could be a sulfide.

Wait, let's tie this together. Suppose C is a sulfide, and D is O2. Then, 2 C (sulfide) + 2 O2 → 2 SO2. Wait, but that's an example, but I'm not sure about the actual reaction.

Alternatively, maybe C is FeS. Then, FeS + O2 → FeO + SO2. But I'm not sure of the exact stoichiometry.

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal carbide, maybe it reacts with O2 to form CO or CO2, which are dangerous. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is a highly toxic gas like Cl2, but that's more of a starting material.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the fourth reaction again: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D and B are gases, their reaction produces a solvent. What solvents are produced from reactions of gases?

Hmm, water is a solvent and is formed from H2 and O2. But H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio to form 2 H2O. So that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe H is NH3, which is a gas but can be a solvent. NH3 is a liquid at certain conditions. So, how would you get NH3 from B and D?

If B is N2 and D is H2, then 1:3 ratio in the Haber process, which doesn't fit 1:1.

Alternatively, if B is NO and D is something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is CH3OH (methanol), but how would that form from two gases? Maybe from CO and H2. But the stoichiometry for that would be different. Alternatively, maybe H is a hydrocarbon like CH4? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like HCl. Wait, but HCl is a gas and a strong acid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is a solvent like ethanol. But how would that form from two gases? Maybe from ethylene and water, but that would require a catalyst, and the stoichiometry is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe H is something else, like an alcohol or something else. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Wait, another angle: perhaps H is a diatomic molecule like O2 or something, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, H could be a noble gas, but they're not typically solvents.

Wait, maybe I should think about the options for E and its symmetry. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are symmetry groups (point groups) in molecular symmetry.

C2 is a two-fold rotation. D4h has a four-fold rotation with inversion, etc. D∞h would be something with infinite symmetry, like a cylinder. C2v has a two-fold rotation plus a mirror plane.

So, what molecules have which symmetries? For example:

- H2O has D2h symmetry.
- NH3 has Td symmetry.
- O2 has D∞h symmetry.
- SO2 has D∞h symmetry? Or maybe C2v. Wait, SO2 is a bent molecule, so it has a C2 axis and a mirror plane. Wait, no, SO2 has a bent structure with a C2v symmetry because it's a bent molecule with two mirror planes perpendicular to the axis and a two-fold rotation.

Wait, but let me think. SO2 has a central S atom with two O atoms. The structure is bent, similar to O3. O3 has C2v symmetry because it's a bent molecule with a mirror plane containing the central oxygen and the C2 axis perpendicular to it.

Wait, so if E is SO2, which has a bent structure, then its symmetry would be C2v. Because it's a trigonal planar molecule with a central atom and two others, but wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule with three atoms, so the point group is C2v.

Alternatively, if E is O2, which is diatomic, it has D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

Wait, but in the second reaction, C reacts with D to form E. If E is O2, then that reaction would be C + 2 D → O2. But O2 is a gas, but in the first reaction, C is produced from A and B. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe E is something else. Let's think about HCN. HCN has a linear structure, which is I symmetry, but I don't think any of the options match that. Oh, wait, I symmetry is a type of symmetry, but it's not one of the options.

Another possibility: if E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. But Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, and if E is Cl2, then in the reaction C + 2 D → Cl2. But Cl2 is quite a stable molecule, so that might not be the case.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. A is a solid, B is a gas. They react in a 1:8 ratio to form C, which is bright red.

Another thought: perhaps A is iron and B is sulfur vapor. Iron and sulfur react to form FeS, which is black. Hmm, not red.

Wait, what if C is a form of chromium trioxide (CrO3), which is dark red. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe C is a mercury(I) compound. Mercury(I) oxide is red. So, if A is Hg and B is O2, then 2 Hg + O2 → 2 HgO (red). But I'm not sure if HgO is red. Wait, I think HgO is red, yes.

So, assuming C is HgO, which is red. Then, reacting C with D would produce E. Let's see.

Then, the third reaction: C (HgO) + H2O → A (Hg) + F and G (two acids). So HgO + H2O → Hg + O2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's reacting in a different way. Wait, no, HgO is not very reactive with water. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is PbO2 (lead dioxide), which is dark brown, not red. So that's not it.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a colloidal solution of sulfur. If A is a metal that reacts with B (sulfur vapor) to form colloidal sulfur, which is bright red. For example, perhaps A is sodium, and B is S8 gas. But S8 is solid, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium metal and B is hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S). But that might not form a red product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is A (carbon) reacting with B (sulfur vapor). Carbon reacts with sulfur vapor to form carbon disulfide (CS2), but I'm not sure about the product's color.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is copper(I) sulfide, which is red. So, A is copper and B is H2S. But copper and H2S would form CuS, which is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is between a metal and SO3 gas. But I don't think that's right.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas like F2. The reaction could produce a fluoride. But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, maybe the bright red product is mercuric sulfide (cinnabar), which is bright red. Cinnabar is HgS. So, if A is Hg and B is S8 (though S8 is solid), but maybe in the reaction, S is in gaseous form. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2S, and A is Hg. Then, Hg + H2S → HgS (cinnabar) which is red. But that would be a reaction between a metal and a gas, which fits the first reaction.

So, C is HgS. Then, in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D (a gas) to form E, which is extremely hazardous.

What reaction could HgS undergo with a gas to form a dangerous product? Maybe oxidation. For example, HgS + O2 → HgO + SO2. Let's see the stoichiometry. Suppose 2 HgS + 3 O2 → 2 HgO + 2 SO2. That's plausible. But in the problem, it's C + 2 D → E. So D would be O2, and E would be SO2 and HgO? No, because E is a product, which would have to be a single compound.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's think again. If C is HgS, reacting with O2 (D) in a 2:2 ratio (so 1:1 molar ratio), perhaps to produce HgO and SO2. But that would be two products, which doesn't fit the reaction as E is a single product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is HgS + O2 → HgO + SO2. But that's 1 HgS and 1 O2 giving 1 HgO and 1 SO2. So, that would fit C + D → E, but the problem states 2 D. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider what E is. If E is SO2, which is a gas and dangerous, then that could fit. So, in the reaction, C is HgS, and D is O2. So, HgS + 2 O2 → HgO + 2 SO2. But then E would be a mixture, but the problem says it produces E. So perhaps E is SO2.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is HgS + O2 → HgO + SO2, and E is SO2, which is dangerous.

Then, in the third reaction, C (HgS) reacts with water to reform A (Hg) and two acids. So, HgS + H2O → Hg + H2S. But H2S is a weak acid. So F and G would be H2S (weak acid) and another acid. Wait, but where's the other acid coming from? Alternatively, perhaps HgS is not reacting with water, or the reaction is different.

Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track with C being HgS.

Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the third reaction again. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, when C is dissolved in water, it produces A, a strong acid, and a weak acid.

This suggests that C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. For example, if C is sodium sulfide (Na2S), then when it reacts with water, it can produce H2S (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But in the reaction, it produces A, which would be Na, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For instance, Ca3N2 + H2O → Ca(OH)2 + NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate, like BaSO4. But that doesn't react with water.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate, like CaCO3. It would react with water but not produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. When it reacts with water, it might form H2SO3 (which is a weak acid) and Ca(OH)2. But Ca(OH)2 is a base, not an acid.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal hydroxide. But that doesn't fit with the first reaction.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to think about the possible structures of E and their symmetry groups.

If E is SO2, its structure is bent, with the central S atom and two O atoms. The point group would be C2v. Because it has a C2 axis (180-degree rotation) and a mirror plane containing the S atom and each O atom. So, the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

Alternatively, if E is O2, it's a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought E might be SO2 because of the reaction with D (O2) and C (sulfide). So, if E is SO2, then its symmetry is C2v.

But wait, earlier I was considering E as O2, which would have D∞h. So, which one is it?

Let me go back to the reactions. If E is O2, that would mean that C + 2 D → O2. But that doesn't make much sense because O2 is already a gas, and that would require C and D to be something that produces O2. Alternatively, if C is HgO, and D is H2, then HgO + H2 → Hg + H2O. But that would produce H2O, not O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2. Then, the reaction would be C + 2 D → Cl2. But Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, and its symmetry is D∞h. So, if E is Cl2, the symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But how would that fit the other reactions? Let's try to see.

If C is, say, a chloride, and D is H2. Maybe C is HgCl2. Then, HgCl2 + 2 H2 → Hg + 2 HCl. So E would be HCl, which is a gas, but HCl is a strong acid. But the problem says E is extremely hazardous, so that could fit. But then, in the third reaction, C (HgCl2) + H2O → Hg + HCl and HOCl (a weak acid), but HCl is a strong acid, and HOCl is a weak acid. So F would be HCl (strong) and G would be HOCl (weak). That fits the description.

But then, in the first reaction, A reacts with B to form C (HgCl2). So, what would A and B be? If B is Cl2 gas, then A could be Hg metal. So, Hg (A) reacts with Cl2 (B) in a 1:8 ratio? Wait, the reaction for mercury(II) chloride is Hg + Cl2 → HgCl2. The molar ratio is 1:1. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B, which would imply 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. That doesn't fit because 1 mole of Cl2 reacts with 1 mole of Hg to form 1 mole of HgCl2.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the equations wrong. Let me think about the first reaction again. Solid A + 8 equivalents gas B → C (bright red). So, 1 mole of A reacts with 8 moles of B.

If B is Cl2, then 1 mole of A would react with 4 moles of Cl2 (since each Cl2 molecule contributes 2 Cl atoms). So, if A is a metal that forms a +2 cation, then 1 mole of A would need 2 moles of Cl2. But the problem has 8 equivalents, which is 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. That suggests a higher oxidation state.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that forms a +4 cation. For example, if A is Pb, then Pb + 2 Cl2 → PbCl4. So, 1 mole of Pb reacts with 2 moles of Cl2. But the problem states 8 equivalents, which is 8 moles of Cl2, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe A is a +1 cation. For example, if A is Na, then Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But that's a 1:1 ratio. Not 8.

Wait, maybe B isn't Cl2. Let's think of another gas. Suppose B is O2. Then, solid A could be a metal that reacts with O2 to form a metal oxide. But earlier I thought about that and couldn't find a red product.

Wait, another thought: if B is S8 gas, but that's not a gas under standard conditions. Alternatively, maybe B is H2S gas. Then, A could be a metal that reacts with H2S to form a sulfide. For example, Zn + H2S → ZnS + H2. But that's a 1:1 ratio, not 8.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should just focus on determining E and its symmetry group, assuming I can't figure out all the reactions.

If E is SO2, its point group is C2v. If E is O2, point group is D∞h. If E is Cl2, point group is D∞h. If E is another molecule, like HCN (linear, I symmetry, which isn't an option), or H2O (D2h, which isn't an option), or NH3 (Td, not an option).

So, among the options, the possible E's symmetry groups are either C2v (option D) or D∞h (option C).

Now, considering that in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 D to form E. If E is O2, then D would be something that helps form O2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if E is SO2, then D would be O2, and C would be a sulfide.

In that case, when C (sulfide) reacts with O2 (D), it forms SO2 (E). Then, the third reaction, C (sulfide) reacts with water to form A (metal), H2S (weak acid, G), and another acid F. Wait, but when a sulfide reacts with water, it usually produces H2S and the metal hydroxide. So F would be the hydroxide, which is a base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate. For example, when a sulfate reacts with water, it doesn't form acids. Hmm.

I'm stuck again. Let me try to think about the options for E. If E has D∞h symmetry, it's likely a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2. If E has C2v symmetry, it's a bent molecule like SO2 or O3.

But O3 has C2v symmetry. However, O3 is not a common product. Alternatively, SO2 is more likely.

If E is SO2 (C2v symmetry), then in the fourth reaction, D and B (gases) react to form H (solvent). So, D is O2 and B is something else.

Wait, fourth reaction is D + B → H (solvent), in a 1:1 ratio. If D is O2 and B is H2, then H is H2O. But H2 and O2 react in a 2:1 ratio to form 2 H2O. So that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2 and B is N2. Then, they don't react. Not helpful.

Wait, another possibility: if D is CO and B is something else. For example, CO and H2O don't react. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2 and B is O2, but again, the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1.

Wait, perhaps H is NH3. Then, B would be N2 and D would be H2. But the reaction N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3 is the Haber process, with a 1:1.5 ratio, which doesn't fit 1:1. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe H is CH4. But I don't see how that would form from two gases.

Wait, perhaps H is something like HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent.

This is getting too complicated. Let me make an educated guess. Based on the options, and the possible products, I think E is SO2, which has a C2v symmetry group. So the answer would be D) C2v.

But wait, another angle: if E is H2O, which has D2h symmetry, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps E is O3 (ozone), which has C2v symmetry. Ozone is a bent molecule with a central O atom, so its symmetry is C2v.

But I'm not sure if Ozone is produced in such reactions. Alternatively, perhaps E is something else.

If I have to choose, I'll go with E being SO2, which has C2v symmetry. So the answer is D.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. A possible interpretation is that A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas. The bright red color of C suggests it could be a sulfide or a compound like HgS (cinnabar), which is bright red.

2. **Second Reaction**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. If C is a sulfide, D could be O₂, leading to the formation of SO₂, a highly toxic gas. SO₂ is a bent molecule with a trigonal planar geometry, giving it **C2v symmetry**.

3. **Third Reaction**: C reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). If C is a sulfide like HgS, it could decompose in water to form Hg (A) and H₂S (weak acid, G), though the exact reaction details remain unclear.

4. **Fourth Reaction**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If D is O₂ and B is H₂, they could theoretically form H₂O, but the stoichiometry does not perfectly align with a 1:1 ratio. This reaction is less critical to determining the symmetry of E.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are:
   - **C2**: A two-fold rotation axis.
   - **D4h**: A four-fold rotation with inversion and horizontal mirror planes.
   - **D∞h**: Infinite symmetry, characteristic of diatomic molecules like O₂ or Cl₂.
   - **C2v**: A two-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane, characteristic of bent molecules like SO₂.

Given the reactions and the hazardous nature of E, SO₂ is a plausible candidate for E. SO₂ has a bent structure with **C2v symmetry**, making this the most consistent choice.
