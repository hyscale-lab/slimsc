Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. Their NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four pairs of compounds, and I need to figure out which pair is present.

Hmm. Let's think about what these signals mean. The aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) usually corresponds to protons attached to benzene rings. If there are two singlets, that suggests two different sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Since the mixture is 1:1, each compound contributes equally. So each of the two compounds must have a pair of equivalent aromatic protons, and these pairs are different between the two compounds.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because for each compound, the aromatic protons might be in such a way that their NMR signals split into singlets, but since they're in a mixture, the two compounds' signals would each appear as separate singlets. So each compound contributes one singlet each in the aromatic region. So the two singlets come from the two different compounds.

Wait, but the question says two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound has a single type of aromatic proton, and each contributes a singlet. So each of the two compounds has a completely symmetrical aromatic ring so that all the aromatic protons are equivalent, leading to a singlet. Or maybe each has two equivalent protons that are all the same, so their signals merge into a singlet.

But wait, if a compound has more than one set of equivalent protons, would that cause multiple signals? So perhaps each compound in the mixture has only one type of aromatic proton. So each contributes a singlet, and since they're in a 1:1 ratio, the two signals are equal in area.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. The molecular formula is C10H14. For each compound, the formula would be C5H7, but wait, wait, no. No, wait, each compound is C10H14. Wait, no, the mixture is a 1:1 of two C10H14 compounds. So each compound is C10H14. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait: molecular formula is C10H14 for each of the two compounds. So each is C10H14.

Wait, wait. Let's think about each possible option.

Looking at the options, the compounds are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C which has 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's see:

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: that would be four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring at positions 1,2,3,4. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1,2,3,4 would be adjacent. So the structure would have methyl groups in a row, which is impossible because benzene is a ring. Oh wait, no, I think the positions are 1,2,3,4, which are consecutive. So that would lead to a structure where four methyl groups are adjacent, but that's not possible because it would cause steric strain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more symmetrical arrangement, like 1,2,3,4 could be a 1,2,3,4 tetra but that would imply a chair-like arrangement, which doesn't apply to benzene. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the possible compounds are all tetramethylbenzenes except option C. Let's think about each one's structure and the NMR they would produce.

First, let me consider each option and predict their NMR.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: that would be four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring in positions 1,2,3,4. So the ring would have four methyl groups in a row. Wait, that's four in a row, but benzene is a ring, so positions 1,2,3,4 would actually cause the ring to have methyl groups at adjacent positions, leading to a highly substituted structure. However, I think that such a structure is not possible because it's not symmetrical enough, but perhaps it's para-substituted in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the methyl groups are in positions 1,2,3,4, which would make it a 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, but I'm not sure if that's a real structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1,2,3,4, which is a way of numbering the ring, but maybe it's better to think in terms of whether the structure would have equivalent protons.

Wait, another approach: for the aromatic region, each compound contributes a singlet. So each must have all equivalent aromatic protons. How?

Well, for a benzene ring with substituents, if the substituents are in a symmetrical arrangement, the remaining protons can be equivalent, leading to a singlet.

For example, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) has three methyl groups in a symmetrical pattern, leading to only one set of equivalent aromatic protons, so a singlet.

Wait, but in the problem, the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes. So four methyl groups on the benzene. Let's think about each possible structure.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: positions 1,2,4,5. So the ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and 4 and 5. That would leave positions 3 and 6. Wait, but that would make the structure have two methyl groups opposite each other. Let me visualize the benzene ring. Positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. So if I number the ring with 1 at top, 2 at top-right, 3, 4, etc., then 1,2,4,5 would be four adjacent positions, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a para arrangement. Wait, perhaps this is a more symmetrical structure.

Wait, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: the ring would have methyl groups at 1 and 2, and then at 4 and 5. So between 1 and 2 is adjacent, and between 4 and 5 is adjacent. But perhaps positions 1 and 4 are across from each other (para). Wait, maybe the structure looks like two adjacent methyl groups on one pair of opposite positions. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are in a way that the remaining protons are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the symmetry. For the aromatic protons to be a singlet, they must all be equivalent. So the substituents must be arranged such that the remaining protons are equivalent.

So, for example, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: that would have methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. Wait, but that leaves position 4 and 6. Wait, but in that case, the structure might not have equivalent protons. Or maybe it does.

Alternatively, perhaps the compounds in the options are arranged such that each has two equivalent aromatic protons, leading to a singlet for each.

Wait, but given that each compound contributes a singlet in the aromatic region, each must have only one type of aromatic proton, i.e., all equivalent.

Hmm. Let's consider the first part of the spectrum: two singlets at around 6.7 ppm. So each compound contributes a singlet. So each must have only one type of aromatic proton.

So, each compound must have a structure where the substituents (methyl groups) are arranged in a way that all the remaining aromatic protons are equivalent.

Let me think of each possible compound:

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: If the four methyl groups are arranged in a row, that leaves positions 5 and 6. Are these two equivalent? Well, the ring would have methyl groups at 1,2,3,4; positions 5 and 6 would each have one proton each. Are they equivalent? Since the substituents are in 1,2,3,4, then position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6, and position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. But if the substituents are in 1,2,3,4, which are all adjacent, the symmetry would be such that positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. So the aromatic protons at 5 and 6 would be equivalent, leading to a singlet. So yes, this structure would have a singlet in NMR.

Wait, but wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: actually, that's four methyl groups in a row, but since it's a benzene ring, this would imply that positions 1 and 4 are adjacent, which can't be because in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent to two others. Wait, no, 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6, 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3, etc. So 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions, forming a sort of four-membered block. Then, positions 5 and 6 are the remaining two. In this case, the symmetry would be such that position 5 and 6 are mirror images. Are the protons at 5 and 6 equivalent? Because the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, which are adjacent, position 5 would be next to 4 and 6, and position 6 next to 5 and 1. But if the structure has four methyl groups in a row, then positions 5 and 6 would each have one proton. Are they equivalent? I think in this case, they would be equivalent, leading to a singlet. So, yes, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet in the aromatic region.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that all the remaining aromatic protons are equivalent. So, for example, if the substituents are in a para arrangement, the remaining positions would be equivalent.

Another example: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let me imagine this structure. The positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups, and 4 and 5 have methyl groups. So, positions 3 and 6 would be the remaining. Are these two positions equivalent? Let me think about the symmetry. The benzene ring would have methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. So, looking from the top, if I imagine 1 at the top, then 2 is next, 3 is bottom left, 4 is next, 5 is bottom right, and 6 is at the bottom. Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents at 1 and 4 are opposite each other (para), and 2 and 5 are adjacent. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the substituents as being in a way that positions 1 and 4 are para, and 2 and 5 are adjacent to position 1 and 4 respectively.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that positions 3 and 6 are identical, leading to equivalent protons. So, for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the remaining positions 3 and 6 would each have a hydrogen. Are they equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. Since the substituents are at 1,2,4,5, the ring would have a sort of symmetry where positions 3 and 6 are mirror images. So the aromatic protons at 3 and 6 would be equivalent, leading to a singlet.

So, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet in the aromatic region.

Next, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Which leaves positions 4 and 6. Are these protons equivalent? Let's think about the symmetry. Positions 4 and 6 would be adjacent to 3 and 5 respectively. Wait, but in this case, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. Because substituent at position 5 is adjacent to position 6. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure would have a plane of symmetry that makes positions 4 and 6 equivalent.

Wait, let's try to imagine the structure. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So, the ring has methyl groups at 1,2,3 (adjacent) and at 5. That leaves positions 4 and 6. Looking at position 4: it's adjacent to 3 and 5. Position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. So, those two positions are next to substituents, but would their environments be identical? Hmm, perhaps not, because position 4 is next to 3 (CH3) and 5 (CH3), whereas position 6 is next to 5 (CH3) and 1 (CH3). Wait, maybe that's the same environment. So maybe the protons at 4 and 6 are equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps not. Because substituents are at 1,2,3,5, the environment around 4 and 6 might not be symmetrical. Let's think: position 4 is between 3 (CH3) and 5 (CH3), and position 6 is between 5 (CH3) and 1 (CH3). So, the substituents around 4 and 6 are similar but perhaps not identical. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes 4 and 6 equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for each compound's symmetry. For the aromatic protons to be a singlet, the ring must have a symmetry that makes all the remaining protons equivalent.

Another approach: perhaps each compound in the mixture has two equivalent aromatic protons, but since they are in a 1:1 ratio, each contributes a singlet, and the two signals are from each compound.

Wait, but the problem says two singlets. So each compound contributes one singlet. So each must have only one set of aromatic protons, which are all equivalent.

So, for each of the compounds in the options, are their aromatic protons giving a singlet?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

For the first compound (1,2,3,4), as I thought earlier, the aromatic protons at 5 and 6 are equivalent, so a singlet.

For the second compound (1,2,3,5), the aromatic protons at 4 and 6 would be equivalent. Let me think: substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So, positions 4 and 6. Are these equivalent?

Alternatively, perhaps this structure has a plane of symmetry that makes 4 and 6 equivalent. So, the aromatic protons would be a singlet.

So both would contribute a singlet, so the NMR would have two singlets. That fits the first part.

Now, looking at the other signals: three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

These are likely to be the methyl groups attached to the aromatic ring. Since the aromatic rings are substituted with methyl groups, the methyl protons would appear around 2.2 ppm as singlets if they are equivalent within the compound.

So, each compound contributes some number of equivalent methyl groups.

In the spectrum, there are three signals, each a singlet, in a 2:1:1 ratio. Wait, but the ratio is 2:1:1. So the areas of the peaks are in that ratio.

Wait, but wait, the problem says three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So one signal is twice as intense as the other two, which are equal.

Wait, but each compound in the mixture contributes their own methyl protons. So each compound's methyl groups would split into their own signals, depending on whether the methyl groups are equivalent.

So, for each compound, the number of equivalent methyl groups will determine how many signals they contribute.

Let me think about each compound's structure and the number of equivalent methyl groups.

First compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, in this structure, the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5. Let me visualize that as substituents at positions 1,2,4,5. So, substituents are at 1,2,4,5.

Are any of the methyl groups equivalent? Let's think about symmetry.

If the benzene ring has substituents at 1,2,4,5, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine that: positions 1 and 4 are across from each other (para), and 2 and 5 are across from each other (para). Wait, no, because 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 4 and 5 are adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the substituents are arranged in a way that there are two sets of equivalent methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. Because positions 1 and 4 are para, and 2 and 5 are also para, but in a way that if the molecule is rotated 180 degrees, positions 1 and 4 swap, and 2 and 5 swap.

So, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, giving a singlet. Similarly, those at 2 and 5 are equivalent, giving another singlet. So this compound would contribute two signals from its methyl groups.

Wait, but that depends on whether the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Alternatively, perhaps this structure has two sets of two equivalent methyl groups, leading to two signals. Each set would have two equivalent methyl groups, so each would be a singlet. So in this case, the first compound (1,2,4,5) would have two methyl signals, each integrating for two protons (since each methyl group has 3 H, but perhaps they are equivalent).

Wait, but each methyl group has three protons. If the two methyl groups are equivalent, their protons would integrate as a single peak. So if a compound has two equivalent methyl groups, the peak would integrate for 6 protons (each CH3 contributes 3 H). If it has two sets of equivalent methyl groups, each with one CH3, then two peaks integrating for 3 H each.

Wait, but in the problem, the three signals in the 2.2 ppm region are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one of the compounds contributes two equivalent methyl groups (a 6H peak), and the other contributes two sets of single methyl groups (each 3H). But wait, the options are about which two compounds are present. So let me think for each pair.

But wait, let's go back to the problem. The three signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio, so one signal has twice the area of the other two.

Wait, perhaps the first compound contributes a singlet with 6 H (two equivalent methyl groups), and the second contributes two singlets, each with 3 H. Then the areas would be 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1. That makes sense.

So, which compounds would contribute that?

Let me consider each pair.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

First compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl. As I thought earlier, it has two sets of methyl groups: 1 and 4 equivalent, 2 and 5 equivalent. So each set would be a singlet.

So, that would give two peaks in the methyl region: each integrating for 3 H each. Wait, because each set has two methyl groups, each CH3 has 3 H. So for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the two sets would each be 3 H × 2 = 6 H? Wait no, no. Each methyl group is 3 H. If two methyl groups are equivalent, their signals would add up. So for this compound, if positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, their two methyl groups contribute 6 H as a singlet. Similarly, positions 2 and 5 would contribute another 6 H as a singlet. So in this case, the first compound would contribute two methyl signals each integrating for 6 H.

Wait, but that would require that each pair (1+4 and 2+5) is equivalent, which may not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the two methyl groups at 1 and 2 are adjacent, and those at 4 and 5 are adjacent but in a symmetrical position. So perhaps the entire structure is symmetric such that the two methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. So the methyl signals would be two singlets, each integrating for 6 H (since each set has two CH3 groups).

But wait, each set would be two CH3 groups, so 2 × 3 = 6 H per set. So the first compound would have two signals, each for 6 H.

The second compound in option B is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's think about its structure. Substituents at positions 1,2,3,4. So methyl groups are in four consecutive positions. Would the methyl groups be equivalent in any way?

Hmm. Let's imagine the structure. If the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, perhaps the structure is such that the methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So that would give two sets of equivalent methyl groups, each set having two CH3 groups. So that would result in two methyl signals, each integrating for 6 H.

Wait, but that would mean that in the NMR, this compound would contribute two singlets, each 6 H. So when mixed with the first compound (which also contributes two singlets each 6 H), the total would be four signals, which contradicts the problem statement that there are three signals.

Wait, but the problem says three signals at 2.2 ppm. So perhaps this pair (option B) would not be the correct answer because their methyl groups would produce four signals, not three.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the symmetry. Let's think again.

In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So positions 5 and 6 are each with one H. Let me think about the symmetry: positions 1,2,3,4 are in a row. So the substituents are in a way that the structure is symmetrical along the 1-4 axis. So, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So that would mean two sets of two methyl groups each, each set being equivalent, leading to two singlets in the methyl region, each integrating for 6 H.

So the first compound in option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl) would have two methyl signals (each 6 H), and the second (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl) would have two methyl signals (each 6 H). So when they're mixed in a 1:1 ratio, their methyl signals would combine. So the NMR would show four singlets, each 6 H (since each is from one compound), but in the problem, there are only three signals. So this can't be option B.

Hmm. Let's consider another option.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

First compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl. As before, perhaps two sets of equivalent methyl groups, each contributing 6 H, leading to two signals.

Second compound: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl. Let's think about its structure. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So, the methyl groups are at 1,2,3, and 5. Positions 4 and 6 have H.

Are the methyl groups in this structure equivalent in any way? Let's see. Positions 1,2,3,5. The substituents at positions 1 and 3 are adjacent, and 2 and 5 are adjacent. Hmm, perhaps the structure has some symmetry. Let me think about whether any of the methyl groups are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the methyl groups at 1 and 2 are adjacent, and the ones at 3 and 5 are in a way that they are equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the symmetry. The compound 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene may not have any equivalent methyl groups, leading to four different methyl signals. But that would complicate the NMR, which wouldn't fit the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. Let me think about that. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the structure has a plane of symmetry that makes 1 and 3 equivalent, and 2 and 5 equivalent.

Wait, let me visualize this. If I have substituents at 1,2,3,5, then position 4 and 6 are the remaining. The substituents at 1 and 3 are adjacent to position 2, which is also a substituent. Hmm, perhaps the symmetry isn't there. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that the substituents are arranged in a way that 1 and 3 are equivalent, and 2 and 5 are equivalent.

If that's the case, then each set would have two equivalent methyl groups, leading to two signals from this compound, each integrating for 6 H.

So, in that case, when mixed, the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl) contributes two signals (6 H each), and the second (1,2,3,5) contributes two signals (6 H each). So the total would be four signals, which doesn't match the problem's three signals.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has three methyl groups, but that's not the case as all options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C. Oh wait, option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which has two ethyl groups instead of four methyl groups.

Wait, but the problem says the molecular formula is C10H14 for each compound. Let's check that.

Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is C1H3. So for a tetramethylbenzene, the formula would be C6H6 + 4*(CH3) = C10H14. Yes, that matches.

So each compound is C10H14, which fits.

Now, let's think about the methyl signals.

The problem states that the three signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one compound contributes two equivalent methyl groups (6 H), and the other contributes two sets of methyl groups, each 3 H. Then, the ratio would be 6:3:3, which simplifies to 2:1:1.

So, which pair of compounds would do that?

Looking at the options:

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

The first compound (1,2,4,5) might have two sets of equivalent methyl groups. So, perhaps it contributes two singlets, each integrating for 6 H.

The second compound (1,2,3,5) might have three sets of methyl groups. Wait, but that's impossible because it's a tetramethyl, so four methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the second compound has two equivalent methyl groups and two others that are equivalent, leading to two signals each 6 H, but that doesn't help with the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the second compound in option D (1,2,3,5) has two sets of equivalent methyl groups. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the first compound (1,2,4,5) has two sets of two equivalent methyl groups, leading to two peaks (each 6 H). The second compound (1,2,3,5) might have one set of two equivalent methyl groups (6 H) and another set of two non-equivalent methyl groups (each 3 H), but that would complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the second compound in option D has three methyl groups, but that's not possible as it's a tetramethyl.

Hmm, maybe I should think of another option.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, perhaps the first compound (1,2,4,5) has two sets of equivalent methyl groups, each contributing a singlet of 6 H. The second compound (1,2,3,5) has two sets of equivalent methyl groups, but perhaps one of the sets is a singlet of 6 H and another is a singlet of 3 H. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each methyl group has three H. Wait, perhaps one set is 3 H and another is 3 H. But no, the substituent in each position is a methyl group. So unless two methyl groups are not equivalent, but perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the second compound (1,2,3,5) has three methyl groups that are not equivalent, but that's not possible as it's a tetramethyl.

Hmm. Maybe I should look at option D again. Alternatively, perhaps the first compound (1,2,4,5) has two sets of equivalent methyl groups, leading to two signals. The second compound (1,2,3,5) has three sets: perhaps two methyl groups that are equivalent (6 H) and another two that are not, but that's four methyl groups. Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the second compound (1,2,3,5) has two methyl groups in equivalent positions and two others that are also equivalent. So, two sets of two equivalent methyl groups, leading to two signals, each 6 H. So when mixed, the first compound would contribute two 6 H signals, and the second two 6 H signals. But the problem states there are three signals, so this can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about which compounds have methyl groups that would produce a 2:1:1 ratio in the methyl region.

Another approach: the three signals at 2.2 ppm are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the areas are 2x, x, x.

Each methyl group contributes 3 H. So the possible combinations could be:

- One signal with 6 H (two equivalent CH3 groups)
- Two signals with 3 H each.

Because 6:3:3 would be in a 2:1:1 ratio when considering the areas. Wait, but 6 +3 +3 =12 H. Since each compound has four CH3 groups (each 3 H → 12 H), but in a 1:1 mixture, each would contribute 6 H to the methyl region.

Wait, wait, no: each compound has four methyl groups, each with 3 H. So each compound contributes 12 H in the methyl region. But when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the total would be 24 H (12 from each). So the three signals would sum to 24 H. But according to the problem, the three signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio, which is 6:3:3 → sum 12. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the problem states that the three signals are present in a 2:1:1 ratio. The ratio refers to their areas, which are proportional to the number of H in each peak. So if the areas are 2:1:1, the sum is 4 parts. So each part corresponds to 6 H (since 24 H /4 parts =6 H per part). So the peaks would be 12 H, 6 H, and 6 H.

But how can that happen? Let me see.

One possibility is that one compound contributes a singlet with 12 H (four equivalent methyl groups), and the other contributes two singlets, each with 6 H. But wait, each compound has four methyl groups. So, for example, if one compound has four equivalent methyl groups (so a single peak, 12 H), and the other has two sets of two equivalent methyl groups (each 6 H), then the mixture would have three signals: 12 H (from first compound), 6 H (from second), and another 6 H (also from second). So the ratio would be 12:6:6 → 2:1:1. That matches the problem.

So which pair of compounds would fit this?

So, one compound must have four equivalent methyl groups. Which of the options have that?

Looking at the options:

Which of the compounds have four equivalent methyl groups?

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: I don't think so because the substituents are not symmetrically arranged.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: Perhaps not, because the substituents are in a way that the groups are not all equivalent.

Wait, but wait: if a compound has four methyl groups arranged in a way that all four are equivalent, then their protons would appear as a single singlet. That requires a highly symmetrical structure, like all four methyl groups being in positions that are equivalent through symmetry.

Wait, but can a benzene ring have four methyl groups in a symmetric arrangement that makes all four equivalent? Let me think. For example, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: is there a symmetry that makes all four methyl groups equivalent? Probably not, because the substituents are at adjacent positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's more symmetric.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the four methyl groups form a sort of square around the ring. For example, substituents at 1,2,4,5. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at 1,2,4,5. Are these positions all equivalent under rotation or reflection?

Alternatively, perhaps the four methyl groups are arranged in a way that any of them can be rotated into any other position. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions that are all adjacent, making them not equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that all four are equivalent, leading to a singlet with 12 H.

Wait, maybe the correct compound is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the tetramethyl compounds have four equivalent methyl groups. Wait, let's think about 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene: that's three methyl groups in a symmetric arrangement, so all are equivalent, leading to a single methyl singlet. But the problem's compounds are tetramethyl.

Wait, perhaps the compound 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is symmetric enough to have all four methyl groups equivalent. Let me think about that. If I number the ring with 1 at the top, 2 to the right, 3 at the bottom right, 4 at the bottom left, 5 to the left, and 6 at the top left. Wait, but then substituents at 1, 2, 4, 5 would form a sort of ring around the benzene. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the four methyl groups are in positions that are all equivalent under some symmetry operation, like a 180-degree rotation. For example, if substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then rotating the ring 180 degrees would swap 1 with 4 and 2 with 5. So all four methyl groups would be in equivalent positions after rotation, leading to a single methyl singlet.

Wait, that's possible. So in that case, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have all four methyl groups equivalent, leading to a single singlet of 12 H in the methyl region.

If that's the case, then the other compound in the mixture would have to contribute two singlets, each integrating for 6 H. So let's see which option pairs 1,2,4,5 with another compound that has two sets of equivalent methyl groups.

Looking at option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

If the first has a singlet at 12 H (since all four methyl are equivalent), and the second has two sets of two equivalent methyl groups, each contributing 6 H, then the second compound would have two singlets, each 6 H.

Wait, but when you mix 1:1, each contributes 12 H (from each compound) in the methyl region. So the first compound would contribute 12 H (as a singlet), and the second would contribute two singlets, each 6 H. So the total would be three signals: 12, 6, 6. Which would be in a ratio of 12:6:6 → 2:1:1. That matches the problem.

So this pair would fit.

Now, the other aromatic signals: each compound must contribute a singlet in the aromatic region.

Earlier, we thought that 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet if the aromatic protons are equivalent. Let's check that.

In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic protons are at positions 3 and 6. Are they equivalent? Because the substituents are symmetrically arranged, perhaps they are. So their protons would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

In the second compound, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic protons are at positions 4 and 6. Are they equivalent?

In this structure, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So positions 4 and 6. Are these environments equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 (CH3) and 5 (CH3). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (CH3) and 1 (CH3). Because substituents are at 3 and 5, which are adjacent to 4 and 6, perhaps the environments are the same, making the protons at 4 and 6 equivalent. So that would give a singlet in the aromatic region.

So both compounds would contribute a singlet in the aromatic region, which matches the problem statement.

So this pair (option D) fits all the given data.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture based on their **1H NMR spectrum**. The key observations are:

1. **Aromatic region (6.7 ppm):** Two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, indicating that each compound contributes a single set of equivalent aromatic protons.
2. **Methyl region (2.2 ppm):** Three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, corresponding to methyl protons. This suggests one compound has four equivalent methyl groups (12 H, singlet), and the other has two sets of equivalent methyl groups (6 H each, two singlets).

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**
- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. This would produce two singlets in the methyl region (6 H each), not matching the 2:1:1 ratio.
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. This would also produce two singlets in the methyl region (6 H each), again not matching the 2:1:1 ratio.
- **Conclusion:** This pair does not fit the observed NMR data.

#### **Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. This would produce two singlets in the methyl region (6 H each).
- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. This would also produce two singlets in the methyl region (6 H each).
- **Conclusion:** This pair would result in four signals in the methyl region, not matching the 2:1:1 ratio.

#### **Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** As analyzed earlier, this compound would produce two singlets in the methyl region (6 H each).
- **1,4-diethylbenzene:** This compound has two ethyl groups, not methyl groups, so it does not match the molecular formula **C10H14**.
- **Conclusion:** This pair is invalid due to the incorrect molecular formula of 1,4-diethylbenzene.

#### **Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:** The methyl groups are symmetrically arranged, making all four equivalent. This produces a single singlet in the methyl region (12 H).
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:** The methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. This produces two singlets in the methyl region (6 H each).
- **Methyl region:** The total signals would be 12 H (from 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) and 6 H each from the two sets of methyl groups in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, resulting in a 2:1:1 ratio.
- **Aromatic region:** Both compounds have equivalent aromatic protons, producing two singlets in the aromatic region (6.7 ppm), consistent with the data.
- **Conclusion:** This pair matches all the observed NMR data.

### Final Answer:
The correct pair of compounds is **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**.

**Answer: D**
