Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what the question says. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, so there are two planets orbiting a star, and we've detected them using both transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh wait, but since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out. So I don't have to worry about that.

So the main factors are the star's temperature, the star's radius, and the planet's distance from the star (a). But wait, the question doesn't give the distance a for each planet. Hmm, but maybe I can find it using the radial velocity data.

Radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement because of the planet's gravitational pull. The shift given for each planet is in forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 Å, and for Planet2 it's 0.04 Å.

I think the radial velocity (RV) shift is related to the mass of the planet and the distance between the star and the planet. The formula for RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)) ) * (1 / (c * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3)) ) ) ). Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star^(2/3)) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) ) ) * (1/(a (1-e²)^0.5)) )^(1/3) ). Hmm, no, perhaps I should think of it as K = (v) due to the planet's orbit.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^0.5) )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), and assuming i≈90 degrees (so sin i ≈1), this simplifies. But I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe it's easier to realize that the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G M planet) / ( (M star + M planet)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M planet/M star) )^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2 pi) )

Wait, perhaps I should just relate the RV shift to the velocity. The Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. Since lambda is given as 6300 Angstroms, the shift is 0.03 and 0.04 Angstroms for the two planets.

So for Planet1: delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å; lambda = 6300 Å. So the velocity is v1 = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. Similarly for v2.

Wait, but wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. So the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. So for each planet, K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity.

So K1 = 0.03e-10 m (since 1Å=1e-10 m) divided by 6300e-10 m (since lambda is 6300 Å). So delta_lambda / lambda is (0.03e-10) / (6300e-10) = 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6.

v1 = c * (delta_lambda / lambda) = 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1.428e3 m/s? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the units. Wait, delta_lambda is 0.03 Angstroms, which is 0.03e-10 meters. Lambda is 6300 Angstroms, which is 6300e-10 meters.

So delta_lambda = 0.03e-10 m, lambda = 6300e-10 m.

v1 = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

So (0.03e-10 / 6300e-10) = 0.03/6300 = 3/630000 = 1/210000 ≈ 4.76e-6.

v1 = 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1.428e3 m/s. Wait, that's about 1428 m/s. Hmm, that seems very high for a star's velocity due to a planet. I thought that for Jupiter, it's about 10 m/s or so. Wait, maybe I'm messing up the units. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I should compute delta_lambda / lambda correctly. Let me compute 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) = approx 4.76e-6. Then, v = c * that, so 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 = 1.428e3 m/s. Wait, but that's 1428 m/s. That's way too high for a star's velocity caused by a planet. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula: v = (lambda - lambda_0)/lambda_0 * c. Hmm, but wait, the formula is Doppler shift is delta_lambda/lambda = v / c, but only for small velocities where relativistic effects are negligible. However, if the star's velocity is v, then the observed shift would be delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So for a star moving at velocity v, the Doppler shift would be delta_lambda = v * lambda / c.

So for Planet1, delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m.

v1 = (delta_lambda1 * c) / lambda.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda.

So v = (delta_lambda * c) / lambda.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. For Planet1:

delta_lambda1 = 0.03e-10 m (since 1Å = 1e-10 m).

lambda = 6300e-10 m.

v1 = (0.03e-10 m * 3e8 m/s) / (6300e-10 m).

The e-10 m cancels out:

(0.03 * 3e8) / 6300 = (9e7) / 6300 ≈ 14285.7 m/s. Wait, that's 14 km/s. That's way too high. Wait, the maximum velocity of the star due to a planet should be much smaller. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given shifts (0.03 and 0.04 Å) are the FWHM shifts, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the data. Or maybe the 0.03 and 0.04 are in terms of km/s? No, the question states it's in Angstroms. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given in the same units as the shift. So K is the velocity of the star. So for each planet, K is 0.03 and 0.04 km/s. Wait, because 0.03 Å is 0.03e-10 m, which is 3e-12 m. To convert to m/s, since velocity is m/s, we have K = (3e-12 m) / (6300e-10 m) * c, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think about the formula for K in terms of planetary parameters.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_*) + M_p )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ) * (1/(2π c)) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (a (1) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / ( (P) )^(1/3) ) )

But this seems complicated. Another formula I remember is K = ( (2 pi G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to relate the semi-amplitude K to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Because both planets are orbiting the same star, perhaps I can find the ratio of their distances a1 and a2.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (a (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for a circular orbit (e=0), and since M_p << M_*, then M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1.

So in that approximation, K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) )^(1/3) * (1/(a)) )^(1/3) ) * (v factor?).

Alternatively, a more manageable approach is:

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e^2)^0.5 ) ) ) * ( (2 pi) )^(1/3) / c ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )

But without knowing the period P, maybe I can't get anywhere. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: for a circular orbit, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law: P² = (4 pi² a³) / (G (M_* + M_p) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so P² = (4 pi² a³) / (G M_* )

But without knowing P, perhaps the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2 can help me find the ratio of a1 and a2.

Wait, the question gives the Doppler shifts for each planet on the same spectral line. So the same forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 and 0.04 Å, so the semi-amplitude K is proportional to these shifts.

Wait, but K is the velocity of the star. So K1 = 0.03e-10 m / 6300e-10 m * c = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, 0.03 /6300 = 1e-2 / 2.1e4 ≈ 4.76e-6.

v1 = 4.76e-6 *3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s = 1428 m/s. That seems way too high. Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in units. Let me recheck:

delta_lambda is 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m.

lambda is 6300 Å = 6300e-10 m.

delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) ≈ 4.76e-6.

v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c = 4.76e-6 *3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s = 1428 m/s.

But that's 1.4 km/s. For a star, that's a big velocity. I thought that for even Jupiter, the RV semi-amplitude is about 13 m/s. So I must be doing something wrong here.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the shift is given in terms of wavelength change over the rest wavelength, so delta_lambda / lambda = v/c. So if the shift is 0.03 Å, then v = (0.03e-10 m / 6300e-10 m) * 3e8 m/s.

So that's (0.03 / 6300) *3e8 = (0.03 *3e8) /6300 = 9e6 /6300 ≈ 1428.57 m/s. Again, same result. So why is this so high? It seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the given shifts are in terms of km/s, not Angstroms? The question says 'periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å', so probably in Angstroms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the shift is 0.03 Å per revolution, but that doesn't change the calculation. Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think about the RV method.

The RV method relies on the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. So the formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

But without knowing P, the period, perhaps I can't get a. But wait, since both planets orbit the same star, perhaps the ratio of K1 and K2 can relate to their masses and the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Wait, if I can find the ratio a1/a2 in terms of K1, K2, M1, M2, then I can proceed.

Because equilibrium temperature depends on the distance a, so T_eq is proportional to (R_star / a )^0.5 * T_star^0.5.

So, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_star / a1 ) / ( R_star / a2 ) ) ) * ( T_star )^0.5 / ( T_star )^0.5 )

Wait, T_eq for each planet is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Since albedo is same, that term cancels.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So if I can find a1/a2, then I can find T1/T2.

So to get a1 and a2, I need to find their semi-major axes.

So using the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( ( M_* )^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(a (1 - e²)^0.5 )) )

But again, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation from the RV method for circular orbits and M_p << M_*, so K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( 1/( a ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

But without knowing P, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the same spectral line is observed, so the same star, same a for each planet? No, that's not the case. Each planet has a different a.

Wait, perhaps the RV semi-amplitude K is related inversely to the planet's distance a. So K is proportional to (M_p) / a.

But how?

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (2 pi G) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^0.5 )) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

But for a circular orbit, e=0, so (1 - e²)^0.5 =1.

So K = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_* )^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, for a planet with period P, a³ = ( G M_* P² ) / (4 pi² )

So P² = (4 pi² a³)/( G M_* )

Therefore, P = (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(1/2 )

Substituting into K:

K = [ (2 pi G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ] / [ ( M_* )^(2/3) ) ] * [ (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(-1/6) )

Wait, let's compute this:

P^(1/3) = [ (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(1/2) ]^(1/3) = (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(1/6 )

So 1/P^(1/3) = (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(-1/6 )

Substituting into K:

K = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(-1/6 )

Let me simplify the exponents:

(2 pi G)^(1/3) * (4 pi² )^(-1/6) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * ( (4)^(1/2) pi^(2*(1/6)) ) )^(-1) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express each term with exponents.

Let me try that:

K = [ (2 pi G)^{1/3} * (4 pi² )^{-1/6} ] * ( M_p sin i ) * a^{- (3 * (-1/6))} ) * G^{- (1/6)} M_*^{ (-2/3 -1/6) }

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

The term (4 pi² )^{-1/6} can be written as [ 2^2 pi^2 ]^{-1/6} = 2^{-1/3} pi^{-1/3}.

Similarly, (2 pi G)^{1/3} is 2^{1/3} pi^{1/3} G^{1/3}.

Multiplying these terms together:

(2^{1/3} pi^{1/3} G^{1/3}) * (2^{-1/3} pi^{-1/3} ) ) = G^{1/3}.

So the constants multiply to G^{1/3}.

Now, the a term: (a³)^{-1/6} = a^{-1/2}.

The M_* terms:

The denominator has M_*^(2/3) and from the term ( M_* ) in the denominator, which comes from ( ( G M_* )^{-1/6} ), we have M_*^{-1/6}.

So the total M_* exponent is ( -2/3 - 1/6 ) = (-5/6).

So putting it all together:

K = G^{1/3} * M_p sin i * a^{-1/2} * G^{-1/6} * M_*^{-5/6}.

Simplify G terms: G^{1/3} * G^{-1/6} = G^{1/6}.

So,

K = (G^{1/6}) * ( M_p ) * a^{-1/2} * M_*^{-5/6}.

So,

K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( a^{1/2} M_*^{5/6} )

But since sin i is close to 1 (edge-on orbits, which is often the case for transiting planets), we can ignore that. So,

K1/K2 = ( M1 / a1^{1/2} M_*^{5/6} ) / ( M2 / a2^{1/2} M_*^{5/6} ) )

The M_*^{5/6} terms cancel, so:

K1/K2 = ( M1 a2^{1/2} ) / ( M2 a1^{1/2} )

Let me rearrange:

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1 )^{1/2}.

Let me solve for (a1/a2) ratio.

We can write:

( a2 / a1 )^{1/2} = ( K1 / K2 ) * ( M2 / M1 )

Squaring both sides,

a2/a1 = ( K1^2 M2^2 ) / ( K2^2 M1^2 )

Take the reciprocal,

a1/a2 = [ ( K2^2 M1^2 ) / ( K1^2 M2^2 ) ) ].

So,

a1/a2 = ( K2/K1 )^2 * ( M1/M2 )^2.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure I get this right. From K1/K2 = (M1 a2^{1/2} )/( M2 a1^{1/2} ), solving for a2/a1:

( a2/a1 )^{1/2} = ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 )

Square both sides,

a2/a1 = ( K1^2 M2^2 ) / ( K2^2 M1^2 )

So,

a1/a2 = ( K2^2 M1^2 ) / ( K1^2 M2^2 )

Which can be written as

(a1/a2) = ( K2 / K1 )² * ( M1 / M2 )².

Now, since we are looking for T1/T2, which is sqrt( a2/a1 ), so:

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( (a2/a1) ) = sqrt( ( K1^2 M2^2 ) / ( K2^2 M1^2 ) ) )

= ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 )

Because sqrt( (a2/a1) ) = sqrt( ( K1^2 M2^2 ) / ( K2^2 M1^2 ) ) ) = ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 )

Wait, let me compute that again.

a2/a1 = ( K1² M2² ) / ( K2² M1² )

So sqrt( a2/a1 ) = ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 )

Therefore,

T1/T2 = ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 )

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

K1 is the RV semi-amplitude for Planet1, which is 0.03 Å shift. Wait, but earlier I thought the velocity was too high, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift is given in terms of the velocity as a fraction of c. So, delta_lambda / lambda = v/c.

So for Planet1, K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) * c.

Which is (0.03 / 6300 ) * c.

0.03 /6300 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) ≈ 4.76e-6.

v1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 m/s = 1.428e3 m/s.

Same as before, which seems high. But perhaps I should proceed with these numbers.

So K1 = 1428 m/s.

Similarly, K2 is for Planet2, shift of 0.04 Å.

So K2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) *3e8 = (0.04 *3e8) /6300 = 1.2e8 /6300 ≈ 1.90476e4 m/s. Wait, that's even bigger. That can't be right because for larger shifts, the velocity would be higher, but I'm getting K2 higher than K1, which might make sense if M2 is smaller.

Wait, but in reality, the RV semi-amplitude is usually a few m/s for exoplanets. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the shifts are in km/s? Because 0.03 km/s is 30 m/s, which makes more sense.

Wait, the question says the shifts are up to 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. Let me check the units again. The question says: "Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å."

Wait, perhaps in the RV method, the shift is given in terms of cm/s. Wait, no, the question gives it in Angstroms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given shifts are velocity shifts, not wavelength shifts. But the question says "periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å", which is a wavelength shift. So I think I must proceed with the calculation as I did, even though the numbers seem high.

So K1 = 1428 m/s.

K2 = (0.04e-10 m / 6300e-10 m ) *3e8 m/s = (0.04/6300)*3e8 = (0.04 *3e8 ) /6300.

0.04*3e8 = 1.2e7.

1.2e7 /6300 ≈ 1904.76 m/s.

So K1 = 1428 m/s.

K2 = 1904.76 m/s.

M1 =7 Earth masses.

M2=5 Earth masses.

M1/M2 =7/5=1.4.

So,

T1/T2 = ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 ) = (1428 *5 ) / (1904.76 *7 )

Compute numerator: 1428 *5 =7140.

Denominator: 1904.76 *7 ≈ 13333.32.

So 7140 /13333.32 ≈ 0.535.

So T1 is approximately 0.535 times T2.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.

So T1/T2 ≈0.535. So about 0.53. That's option C, which is ~0.53.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

K1=0.03/6300 *3e8 = 0.03 *3e8 /6300 = 9e6 /6300 = 1428.57 m/s.

K2=0.04/6300 *3e8 =0.04*3e8/6300= 1.2e7 /6300≈ 1904.76 m/s.

So,

T1/T2 = (K1 * M2 )/( K2 * M1 ) = (1428.57 *5 )/(1904.76 *7 )

Compute numerator: 1428.57 *5 =7142.85.

Denominator:1904.76 *7=13333.32.

7142.85 /13333.32 ≈0.535.

Yes, so the ratio is about 0.53. So the answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} \propto \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}} \cdot T_{\text{eff}}
\]

Since both planets orbit the same star with the same albedo and effective temperature \(T_{\text{eff}}\), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of their orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) can be related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) using the RV method. For circular orbits, the RV semi-amplitude is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of the orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{K_2 \cdot M_1}{K_1 \cdot M_2}\right)^2
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures becomes:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{K_1 \cdot M_2}{K_2 \cdot M_1}
\]

### Given Data:
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)
- \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), \(M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)

### Step 1: Calculate \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) in m/s
The Doppler shift formula is:

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{v}{c}
\]

For Planet1:
\[
K_1 = \frac{0.03}{6300} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1428 \, \text{m/s}
\]

For Planet2:
\[
K_2 = \frac{0.04}{6300} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1904.76 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio \(T_1 / T_2\)
Substitute \(K_1 = 1428 \, \text{m/s}\), \(K_2 = 1904.76 \, \text{m/s}\), \(M_1 = 7\), and \(M_2 = 5\) into the formula:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{K_1 \cdot M_2}{K_2 \cdot M_1}
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1428 \cdot 5}{1904.76 \cdot 7}
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{7140}{13333.32} \approx 0.535
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what the question says. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, so there are two planets orbiting a star, and we've detected them using both transit and radial velocity methods. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh wait, but since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out. So I don't have to worry about that.

So the main factors are the star's temperature, the star's radius, and the planet's distance from the star (a). But wait, the question doesn't give the distance a for each planet. Hmm, but maybe I can find it using the radial velocity data.

Radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement because of the planet's gravitational pull. The shift given for each planet is in forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 Å, and for Planet2 it's 0.04 Å.

I think the radial velocity (RV) shift is related to the mass of the planet and the distance between the star and the planet. The formula for RV semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)) ) * (1 / (c * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3)) ) ) ). Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star^(2/3)) / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star) ) ) * (1/(a (1-e²)^0.5)) )^(1/3) ). Hmm, no, perhaps I should think of it as K = (v) due to the planet's orbit.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^0.5) )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), and assuming i≈90 degrees (so sin i ≈1), this simplifies. But I think I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe it's easier to realize that the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G M planet) / ( (M star + M planet)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (1 + M planet/M star) )^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(2 pi) )

Wait, perhaps I should just relate the RV shift to the velocity. The Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. Since lambda is given as 6300 Angstroms, the shift is 0.03 and 0.04 Angstroms for the two planets.

So for Planet1: delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å; lambda = 6300 Å. So the velocity is v1 = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. Similarly for v2.

Wait, but wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. So the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. So for each planet, K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity.

So K1 = 0.03e-10 m (since 1Å=1e-10 m) divided by 6300e-10 m (since lambda is 6300 Å). So delta_lambda / lambda is (0.03e-10) / (6300e-10) = 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6.

v1 = c * (delta_lambda / lambda) = 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1.428e3 m/s? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the units. Wait, delta_lambda is 0.03 Angstroms, which is 0.03e-10 meters. Lambda is 6300 Angstroms, which is 6300e-10 meters.

So delta_lambda = 0.03e-10 m, lambda = 6300e-10 m.

v1 = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

So (0.03e-10 / 6300e-10) = 0.03/6300 = 3/630000 = 1/210000 ≈ 4.76e-6.

v1 = 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1.428e3 m/s. Wait, that's about 1428 m/s. Hmm, that seems very high for a star's velocity due to a planet. I thought that for Jupiter, it's about 10 m/s or so. Wait, maybe I'm messing up the units. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I should compute delta_lambda / lambda correctly. Let me compute 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) = approx 4.76e-6. Then, v = c * that, so 3e8 m/s * 4.76e-6 = 1.428e3 m/s. Wait, but that's 1428 m/s. That's way too high for a star's velocity caused by a planet. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift formula: v = (lambda - lambda_0)/lambda_0 * c. Hmm, but wait, the formula is Doppler shift is delta_lambda/lambda = v / c, but only for small velocities where relativistic effects are negligible. However, if the star's velocity is v, then the observed shift would be delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So for a star moving at velocity v, the Doppler shift would be delta_lambda = v * lambda / c.

So for Planet1, delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m.

v1 = (delta_lambda1 * c) / lambda.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda.

So v = (delta_lambda * c) / lambda.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. For Planet1:

delta_lambda1 = 0.03e-10 m (since 1Å = 1e-10 m).

lambda = 6300e-10 m.

v1 = (0.03e-10 m * 3e8 m/s) / (6300e-10 m).

The e-10 m cancels out:

(0.03 * 3e8) / 6300 = (9e7) / 6300 ≈ 14285.7 m/s. Wait, that's 14 km/s. That's way too high. Wait, the maximum velocity of the star due to a planet should be much smaller. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given shifts (0.03 and 0.04 Å) are the FWHM shifts, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the data. Or maybe the 0.03 and 0.04 are in terms of km/s? No, the question states it's in Angstroms. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given in the same units as the shift. So K is the velocity of the star. So for each planet, K is 0.03 and 0.04 km/s. Wait, because 0.03 Å is 0.03e-10 m, which is 3e-12 m. To convert to m/s, since velocity is m/s, we have K = (3e-12 m) / (6300e-10 m) * c, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think about the formula for K in terms of planetary parameters.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_*) + M_p )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ) * (1/(2π c)) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (a (1) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) * (1 / ( (P) )^(1/3) ) )

But this seems complicated. Another formula I remember is K = ( (2 pi G) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to relate the semi-amplitude K to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Because both planets are orbiting the same star, perhaps I can find the ratio of their distances a1 and a2.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (a (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for a circular orbit (e=0), and since M_p << M_*, then M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and 1 + M_p/M_* ≈ 1.

So in that approximation, K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) )^(1/3) * (1/(a)) )^(1/3) ) * (v factor?).

Alternatively, a more manageable approach is:

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e^2)^0.5 ) ) ) * ( (2 pi) )^(1/3) / c ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )

But without knowing the period P, maybe I can't get anywhere. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: for a circular orbit, the semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law: P² = (4 pi² a³) / (G (M_* + M_p) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so P² = (4 pi² a³) / (G M_* )

But without knowing P, perhaps the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2 can help me find the ratio of a1 and a2.

Wait, the question gives the Doppler shifts for each planet on the same spectral line. So the same forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 and 0.04 Å, so the semi-amplitude K is proportional to these shifts.

Wait, but K is the velocity of the star. So K1 = 0.03e-10 m / 6300e-10 m * c = (0.03 / 6300) * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, 0.03 /6300 = 1e-2 / 2.1e4 ≈ 4.76e-6.

v1 = 4.76e-6 *3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s = 1428 m/s. That seems way too high. Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in units. Let me recheck:

delta_lambda is 0.03 Å = 0.03e-10 m.

lambda is 6300 Å = 6300e-10 m.

delta_lambda / lambda = 0.03e-10 / 6300e-10 = 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-2 / 6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) ≈ 4.76e-6.

v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c = 4.76e-6 *3e8 = 1.428e3 m/s = 1428 m/s.

But that's 1.4 km/s. For a star, that's a big velocity. I thought that for even Jupiter, the RV semi-amplitude is about 13 m/s. So I must be doing something wrong here.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the shift is given in terms of wavelength change over the rest wavelength, so delta_lambda / lambda = v/c. So if the shift is 0.03 Å, then v = (0.03e-10 m / 6300e-10 m) * 3e8 m/s.

So that's (0.03 / 6300) *3e8 = (0.03 *3e8) /6300 = 9e6 /6300 ≈ 1428.57 m/s. Again, same result. So why is this so high? It seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the given shifts are in terms of km/s, not Angstroms? The question says 'periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å', so probably in Angstroms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the shift is 0.03 Å per revolution, but that doesn't change the calculation. Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think about the RV method.

The RV method relies on the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. So the formula for K is:

K = (v) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

But without knowing P, the period, perhaps I can't get a. But wait, since both planets orbit the same star, perhaps the ratio of K1 and K2 can relate to their masses and the ratio of their semi-major axes.

Wait, if I can find the ratio a1/a2 in terms of K1, K2, M1, M2, then I can proceed.

Because equilibrium temperature depends on the distance a, so T_eq is proportional to (R_star / a )^0.5 * T_star^0.5.

So, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_star / a1 ) / ( R_star / a2 ) ) ) * ( T_star )^0.5 / ( T_star )^0.5 )

Wait, T_eq for each planet is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Since albedo is same, that term cancels.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So if I can find a1/a2, then I can find T1/T2.

So to get a1 and a2, I need to find their semi-major axes.

So using the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( ( M_* )^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(a (1 - e²)^0.5 )) )

But again, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation from the RV method for circular orbits and M_p << M_*, so K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( 1/( a ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

But without knowing P, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the same spectral line is observed, so the same star, same a for each planet? No, that's not the case. Each planet has a different a.

Wait, perhaps the RV semi-amplitude K is related inversely to the planet's distance a. So K is proportional to (M_p) / a.

But how?

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (2 pi G) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_* + M_p )^(2/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^0.5 )) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

But for a circular orbit, e=0, so (1 - e²)^0.5 =1.

So K = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_* )^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, for a planet with period P, a³ = ( G M_* P² ) / (4 pi² )

So P² = (4 pi² a³)/( G M_* )

Therefore, P = (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(1/2 )

Substituting into K:

K = [ (2 pi G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ] / [ ( M_* )^(2/3) ) ] * [ (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(-1/6) )

Wait, let's compute this:

P^(1/3) = [ (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(1/2) ]^(1/3) = (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(1/6 )

So 1/P^(1/3) = (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(-1/6 )

Substituting into K:

K = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * M_p sin i / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (4 pi² a³/( G M_* ))^(-1/6 )

Let me simplify the exponents:

(2 pi G)^(1/3) * (4 pi² )^(-1/6) = (2 pi G)^(1/3) * ( (4)^(1/2) pi^(2*(1/6)) ) )^(-1) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express each term with exponents.

Let me try that:

K = [ (2 pi G)^{1/3} * (4 pi² )^{-1/6} ] * ( M_p sin i ) * a^{- (3 * (-1/6))} ) * G^{- (1/6)} M_*^{ (-2/3 -1/6) }

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

The term (4 pi² )^{-1/6} can be written as [ 2^2 pi^2 ]^{-1/6} = 2^{-1/3} pi^{-1/3}.

Similarly, (2 pi G)^{1/3} is 2^{1/3} pi^{1/3} G^{1/3}.

Multiplying these terms together:

(2^{1/3} pi^{1/3} G^{1/3}) * (2^{-1/3} pi^{-1/3} ) ) = G^{1/3}.

So the constants multiply to G^{1/3}.

Now, the a term: (a³)^{-1/6} = a^{-1/2}.

The M_* terms:

The denominator has M_*^(2/3) and from the term ( M_* ) in the denominator, which comes from ( ( G M_* )^{-1/6} ), we have M_*^{-1/6}.

So the total M_* exponent is ( -2/3 - 1/6 ) = (-5/6).

So putting it all together:

K = G^{1/3} * M_p sin i * a^{-1/2} * G^{-1/6} * M_*^{-5/6}.

Simplify G terms: G^{1/3} * G^{-1/6} = G^{1/6}.

So,

K = (G^{1/6}) * ( M_p ) * a^{-1/2} * M_*^{-5/6}.

So,

K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( a^{1/2} M_*^{5/6} )

But since sin i is close to 1 (edge-on orbits, which is often the case for transiting planets), we can ignore that. So,

K1/K2 = ( M1 / a1^{1/2} M_*^{5/6} ) / ( M2 / a2^{1/2} M_*^{5/6} ) )

The M_*^{5/6} terms cancel, so:

K1/K2 = ( M1 a2^{1/2} ) / ( M2 a1^{1/2} )

Let me rearrange:

K1/K2 = (M1/M2) * (a2/a1 )^{1/2}.

Let me solve for (a1/a2) ratio.

We can write:

( a2 / a1 )^{1/2} = ( K1 / K2 ) * ( M2 / M1 )

Squaring both sides,

a2/a1 = ( K1^2 M2^2 ) / ( K2^2 M1^2 )

Take the reciprocal,

a1/a2 = [ ( K2^2 M1^2 ) / ( K1^2 M2^2 ) ) ].

So,

a1/a2 = ( K2/K1 )^2 * ( M1/M2 )^2.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure I get this right. From K1/K2 = (M1 a2^{1/2} )/( M2 a1^{1/2} ), solving for a2/a1:

( a2/a1 )^{1/2} = ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 )

Square both sides,

a2/a1 = ( K1^2 M2^2 ) / ( K2^2 M1^2 )

So,

a1/a2 = ( K2^2 M1^2 ) / ( K1^2 M2^2 )

Which can be written as

(a1/a2) = ( K2 / K1 )² * ( M1 / M2 )².

Now, since we are looking for T1/T2, which is sqrt( a2/a1 ), so:

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt( (a2/a1) ) = sqrt( ( K1^2 M2^2 ) / ( K2^2 M1^2 ) ) )

= ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 )

Because sqrt( (a2/a1) ) = sqrt( ( K1^2 M2^2 ) / ( K2^2 M1^2 ) ) ) = ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 )

Wait, let me compute that again.

a2/a1 = ( K1² M2² ) / ( K2² M1² )

So sqrt( a2/a1 ) = ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 )

Therefore,

T1/T2 = ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 )

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

K1 is the RV semi-amplitude for Planet1, which is 0.03 Å shift. Wait, but earlier I thought the velocity was too high, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift is given in terms of the velocity as a fraction of c. So, delta_lambda / lambda = v/c.

So for Planet1, K1 = (0.03e-10 m) / (6300e-10 m) * c.

Which is (0.03 / 6300 ) * c.

0.03 /6300 = 3e-2 /6.3e3 = 3/(6.3e5) ≈ 4.76e-6.

v1 = 4.76e-6 * 3e8 m/s = 1.428e3 m/s.

Same as before, which seems high. But perhaps I should proceed with these numbers.

So K1 = 1428 m/s.

Similarly, K2 is for Planet2, shift of 0.04 Å.

So K2 = (0.04 / 6300 ) *3e8 = (0.04 *3e8) /6300 = 1.2e8 /6300 ≈ 1.90476e4 m/s. Wait, that's even bigger. That can't be right because for larger shifts, the velocity would be higher, but I'm getting K2 higher than K1, which might make sense if M2 is smaller.

Wait, but in reality, the RV semi-amplitude is usually a few m/s for exoplanets. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the shifts are in km/s? Because 0.03 km/s is 30 m/s, which makes more sense.

Wait, the question says the shifts are up to 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. Let me check the units again. The question says: "Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, while the gravitational impact of Planet2 on the same line results in a periodic Doppler shift of up to 0.04 Å."

Wait, perhaps in the RV method, the shift is given in terms of cm/s. Wait, no, the question gives it in Angstroms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given shifts are velocity shifts, not wavelength shifts. But the question says "periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å", which is a wavelength shift. So I think I must proceed with the calculation as I did, even though the numbers seem high.

So K1 = 1428 m/s.

K2 = (0.04e-10 m / 6300e-10 m ) *3e8 m/s = (0.04/6300)*3e8 = (0.04 *3e8 ) /6300.

0.04*3e8 = 1.2e7.

1.2e7 /6300 ≈ 1904.76 m/s.

So K1 = 1428 m/s.

K2 = 1904.76 m/s.

M1 =7 Earth masses.

M2=5 Earth masses.

M1/M2 =7/5=1.4.

So,

T1/T2 = ( K1 M2 ) / ( K2 M1 ) = (1428 *5 ) / (1904.76 *7 )

Compute numerator: 1428 *5 =7140.

Denominator: 1904.76 *7 ≈ 13333.32.

So 7140 /13333.32 ≈ 0.535.

So T1 is approximately 0.535 times T2.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2.

So T1/T2 ≈0.535. So about 0.53. That's option C, which is ~0.53.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

K1=0.03/6300 *3e8 = 0.03 *3e8 /6300 = 9e6 /6300 = 1428.57 m/s.

K2=0.04/6300 *3e8 =0.04*3e8/6300= 1.2e7 /6300≈ 1904.76 m/s.

So,

T1/T2 = (K1 * M2 )/( K2 * M1 ) = (1428.57 *5 )/(1904.76 *7 )

Compute numerator: 1428.57 *5 =7142.85.

Denominator:1904.76 *7=13333.32.

7142.85 /13333.32 ≈0.535.

Yes, so the ratio is about 0.53. So the answer is option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} \propto \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}} \cdot T_{\text{eff}}
\]

Since both planets orbit the same star with the same albedo and effective temperature \(T_{\text{eff}}\), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends on the ratio of their orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) can be related to the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) using the RV method. For circular orbits, the RV semi-amplitude is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of the orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{K_2 \cdot M_1}{K_1 \cdot M_2}\right)^2
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures becomes:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{K_1 \cdot M_2}{K_2 \cdot M_1}
\]

### Given Data:
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\)
- \(M_1 = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), \(M_2 = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)

### Step 1: Calculate \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) in m/s
The Doppler shift formula is:

\[
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{v}{c}
\]

For Planet1:
\[
K_1 = \frac{0.03}{6300} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1428 \, \text{m/s}
\]

For Planet2:
\[
K_2 = \frac{0.04}{6300} \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 1904.76 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the ratio \(T_1 / T_2\)
Substitute \(K_1 = 1428 \, \text{m/s}\), \(K_2 = 1904.76 \, \text{m/s}\), \(M_1 = 7\), and \(M_2 = 5\) into the formula:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{K_1 \cdot M_2}{K_2 \cdot M_1}
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1428 \cdot 5}{1904.76 \cdot 7}
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{7140}{13333.32} \approx 0.535
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.
