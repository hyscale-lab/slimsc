Okay, so I need to figure out which compound E is in this reaction scheme. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question gives me a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to reach E. There are also some hints provided, so I should definitely pay attention to those.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to give D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

The options for E are all cyclic ketones. Let's think about each step.

Starting with the first step: A + HCN → B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, HCN would add to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, same thing. But wait, the product is B. Then B is reduced. 

In the second step, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. So that's catalytic hydrogenation. If B is a nitrile (from HCN addition), then hydrogenation would reduce it. Wait, HCN adds to carbonyl to form a cyanohydrin which is a vicinal diol with a nitrile group? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another possibility: when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. For example, R2CO + HCN → R2C(OH)CN. But then, when that is hydrogenated, what happens?

Wait, the cyanohydrin has an alcohol and a nitrile group. When you hydrogenate that, the nitrile would reduce to an amine (but that's under different conditions, like LiAlH4 maybe?), or perhaps the alcohol gets reduced. Or perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps A is an alkyl halide? No, because HCN usually adds to carbonyls. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps A is an aldehyde. Wait, but the IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. So A is a ketone.

So when A (a ketone) reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin (B). Then, when B is hydrogenated (H2, Pd), what happens? The nitrile group in the cyanohydrin would typically reduce to an amine, but maybe under hydrogenation with Pd, the nitrile (CN) could become CH2NH2? Wait, no, I think in hydrogenation, CN groups are usually reduced to CH2NH2, but then perhaps under certain conditions, it could go further. But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation reduces the alcohol part of the cyanohydrin.

Wait, the cyanohydrin structure would be R2C(OH)CN. When you hydrogenate that, perhaps the double bond isn't present, so maybe the nitrile group is reduced to an amine, but let me think about that. Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl group is reduced to an alcohol, but wait, it's already an alcohol. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the initial step is a nucleophilic addition. So A is a ketone, which reacts with HCN to form a cyanohydrin. Then, when B is hydrogenated, perhaps the nitrile group is converted into a methyl group. Because, for example, a nitrile (R-CN) upon hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would become R-CH2-NH2. But if it's in excess H2, perhaps it goes further to R-CH2-CH2- something? Wait, no, I think under typical hydrogenation conditions, nitriles reduce to amines. So R-CN + H2 → R-CH2-NH2.

But maybe I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is not for the nitrile but for another group. Alternatively, perhaps the cyanohydrin is treated with H2 and Pd, which might cause the alcohol to become something else. Wait, but an alcohol under hydrogenation (H2, Pd) usually doesn't change unless it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is a catalytic hydrogenation that affects the nitrile group, leading to an amine. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall process. The starting material is a ketone. Then, add HCN to form a cyanohydrin. Then, hydrogenate the cyanohydrin. Let me think about the structure. Suppose A is cyclopentanone. Then, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which would be a cyclopentane ring with an OH group and a CN group attached. Then, when you hydrogenate that, perhaps the CN becomes CH2NH2. But maybe the hydrogenation is partial. Alternatively, maybe the ring opens, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the hydrogenation reduces the nitrile to an amine, but perhaps the compound is then treated further. Hmm, but regardless, let me proceed.

The third step: Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D. HNO2 is nitrous acid. Common reactions with nitrous acid include the formation of diazonium salts, but that's typically with aromatic amines. If C has a primary amine, nitrous acid would convert it to a diazonium salt, which then might undergo elimination or other reactions. Alternatively, if C is a secondary amine, perhaps it doesn't react as much. Or if it's a tertiary amine, no reaction. Alternatively, maybe C has an alcohol group.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me consider each reaction step in more detail.

1. A is a ketone. Reacts with HCN to form B, which is a cyanohydrin. So, B is R2C(OH)CN.

2. B undergoes hydrogenation to become C. Hydrogenation of the nitrile group (R-CN → R-CH2-NH2) would make the structure R2C(OH)CH2NH2. But wait, that's if the nitrile reduces to a primary amine. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation is of the ketone? No, because A is the ketone, and HCN is added after that. Wait, the first step is A + HCN → B. So A is a ketone, so B is the cyanohydrin. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. So perhaps the hydrogenation is of the nitrile group. So the nitrile (CN) becomes CH2NH2. So the structure would be R2C(OH)CH2NH2. Wait, but then in step 3, C reacts with HNO2.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is more thorough, converting the nitrile into a methylene group. Wait, another thought: Maybe the nitrile is reduced to a CH2 group. So the CN becomes CH2. Then, the structure would be R2C(OH)CH2. But that would be a diol, I think. Wait, no, because the hydrogenation of a nitrile (RCN) under certain conditions can produce RCH2NH2, but under other conditions, perhaps in the presence of a catalyst, it could become RCH2CH2NH2? I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation reduces the nitrile to a methyl group. So R-CN → R-CH3. But I don't think that's correct. Nitriles typically reduce to amines, not directly to methyl groups. So, for example, RCN + H2 → RCH2NH2. Then, perhaps further hydrogenation could give RCH2CH2NH2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall structure. Let's consider the hint a). 

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if A is a ketone, then the Wittig reaction would form an alkene.

The product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure mentally. So the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2. Position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituent with a double bond. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=.

Wait, let me think. The structure would be cyclopentane with substituents: at position 1, a methyl group; position 2, a methyl group; position 4, a propan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2-C(CH3)=.

Wait, perhaps the Wittig ylide would attack the carbonyl of A, which is a ketone. The product would have a new double bond. So the structure of A must be such that when the Wittig is applied, it forms the given product.

So the product of the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me imagine the cyclopentane ring: positions 1 and 2 are both methyl. Position 4 has a substituent which is propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene would be a group where the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Propan-2-ylidene refers to a group where the double bond is between C2 and C3 of propane. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, no. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2? No, that's not right. Let me think again.

Propan-2-ylidene would be a group derived from propane with a double bond in position 2. So propane is CH3-CH2-CH3. If we have a ylide, it's usually a carbanion with a double bond. So propan-2-ylidene would be CH2=C(CH3)-. So the substituent at position 4 is a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane ring where position 4 has a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to a C(CH3)=CH2 group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3) with a double bond. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused, maybe I should think of the product as the cyclopentane with a double bond introduced at position 4, connecting via a CH2 group to the ring, and adjacent to a methyl group.

Wait, maybe the product after the Wittig is a cyclopentene derivative. So the Wittig reaction adds a double bond. So the product would have a double bond where the carbonyl was in A.

So, compound A is a ketone, and when the Wittig reaction is performed, it forms a new double bond, making a cyclopentene ring. So the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentane ring where position 4 has a substituent that is an allyl group? Or perhaps it's a substituent with a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group. Let me think about the structure.

In any case, the important point is that the Wittig reaction converts the carbonyl group of A into a double bond. So the position of the substituents in the product will tell me where the carbonyl was in A.

Looking at the product, 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 4. The substituent at 4 is a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-CH(CH3)- with a double bond. So the structure is cyclopentane with methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at position 4, a CH2-CH(CH3)- group attached via a double bond.

Wait, maybe I should think of the product as having a double bond between, say, C4 and C5 of the cyclopentane. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I can move forward.

So, the Wittig reaction product has a double bond, indicating that A was a cyclopentanone (cyclopentane with a ketone group). Because when you perform a Wittig on a ketone, you form an alkene. So A must be cyclopentanone, but substituted with methyl groups at positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at 1 and 2, and at position 4, an allyl group (propan-2-ylidene).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but perhaps it's better to proceed. So A is a cyclopentanone derivative. So for example, if A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, when the Wittig reaction is performed, the ketone (position 1) would react with the ylide, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2, and the substituent from the ylide would be added at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the structure of A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, when the Wittig reagent (from propan-2-ylidene) is added, the carbonyl would be converted into a double bond between C1 and another carbon, and the substituent from the ylide would be added.

Alternatively, perhaps the Wittig ylide is CH2-C(CH3)=PPh3. When this reacts with A (a cyclopentanone), the carbonyl group (O) is replaced by the CH2-C(CH3)= group, forming a double bond. So the product would have a new double bond where the ketone was, plus the substituent from the ylide.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. Let me try to visualize this.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the structure of A. Since the product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, the starting ketone A must have been 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, the Wittig reagent would add a CH2-C(CH3)= group to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond at position 4. So, the original ketone was at position 1. When the Wittig adds, the ketone (C=O) is replaced by a CH2-C(CH3)= group, leading to a double bond between C1 and C2, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to look at the reaction. The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with a CH2 group and adds the ylide's R group as a substituent. So if the ylide is CH2-C(CH3)=, then the product would have a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached to the position where the carbonyl was.

Wait, perhaps A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, the structure is cyclopentane with methyl groups at C1 and C2, and a ketone at C1. Then, the Wittig reagent (propan-2-ylidene) would attack the carbonyl, replacing the O with a CH2 group and adding the R group (CH2-C(CH3)=) to the adjacent carbon (C2). Hmm, maybe that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a double bond between C4 and C5 of the cyclopentane ring, introduced by the Wittig reaction. But I'm not entirely sure.

Moving on to the IR data. Hint b says that A has a strong peak at 1750 cm^-1, which is consistent with a ketone. E has a peak at 1715 cm^-1, which is around where a ketone might be, but also esters. But if E is a ketone, that makes sense.

So, let's go back to the reaction steps.

Step 1: A (ketone) + HCN → B (cyanohydrin). So B is a diol with a nitrile group.

Step 2: B → C via H2 and Pd. So nitrile → amine? Or perhaps the nitrile is reduced to CH2 group.

Wait, another thought: Maybe when H2 is used with Pd as a catalyst, the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine (R-CH2-NH2). Then, in step 3, compound C is treated with HNO2. So if C has a primary amine, HNO2 would form a diazonium salt, which upon warming would decompose. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation reduces the nitrile to a methylene group. So R-CN → R-CH2. But that's not a typical pathway. Wait, perhaps under certain conditions, the nitrile is hydrogenated to a methyl group. Let me think: in the presence of H2 and a catalyst like Raney Ni under high pressure, RCN → RCH2NH2. But with Pd, maybe it's a different outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is not the reactive site here. Maybe the hydrogenation reduces the alcohol in the cyanohydrin to something else, but I don't think that's the case because alcohols don't typically react under H2 and Pd.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about each transformation in order, starting from A.

A is a ketone, let's say cyclopentanone for simplicity.

Step 1: A (cyclopentanone) + HCN → B (cyanohydrin): cyclopentane with OH and CN groups.

Structure of B: cyclopentane with CH(OH)CN group.

Step 2: B → C via H2 and Pd. So, what does H2 and Pd do to a cyanohydrin? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the nitrile group is hydrogenated. Let's say the nitrile (CN) becomes CH2NH2. So structure of C would be cyclopentane with CH(OH)CH2NH2.

But then, step 3: C reacts with HNO2. If C has an NH2 group, HNO2 would react with the amine. Let's think: primary amines react with HNO2 to form diazonium salts, which can then decompose. But under what conditions?

Wait, but HNO2 is nitrous acid, which is typically used under cold acidic conditions. So, perhaps the primary amine in C would form a diazonium salt, which upon elimination (like with heat) would release N2 and form a compound D with a carbocation or something else.

Wait, but another possibility is that if C is a secondary amine, HNO2 might not react. Or if it's a tertiary amine, it might not react either. But if C is a primary amine, then HNO2 would form a diazonium salt.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrous acid is used to convert an amine into an imine or another structure. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the overall process.

If A is a ketone, B is a cyanohydrin, C is the product of hydrogenating B, perhaps turning the nitrile into an amine, then D is the product after nitrous acid treatment, and E is formed by elimination of an inert gas (probably N2).

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the elimination in the last step. If D has a group that upon elimination of a gas (like N2) forms a double bond, then E would be an alkene or a ketone.

Wait, but the options for E are all cyclic ketones. So E must be a ketone.

Let me think about each step again:

A is a ketone. B is cyanohydrin (after HCN addition). C is B after hydrogenation. D is C after HNO2. E is D after elimination of an inert gas.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a double bond, but E is a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, let's try to model each step with a specific example.

Suppose A is cyclopentanone.

1. A + HCN → B: cyclopentane with a cyanohydrin group (OH and CN on adjacent carbons).

Structure of B: cyclopentane with a CH(OH)CN group.

2. B → C via H2 and Pd: perhaps the nitrile (CN) is reduced to CH2NH2.

So structure of C: cyclopentane with CH(OH)CH2NH2.

3. C → D with HNO2: C has a primary amine (NH2). HNO2 would convert it to a diazonium salt. So the NH2 becomes N2+ which then leaves, forming a carbocation.

Wait, but then to form D, perhaps the structure would have a positive charge that gets stabilized, but since it's a ring, maybe it leads to a ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, but let's think: when a primary amine reacts with nitrous acid, it forms a diazonium salt. For example, if the amine is in a ring, like cyclopentylmethylamine, then the diazonium salt could lose N2, forming a carbocation, which could then rearrange.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a ring contraction or expansion, forming a different cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps after the diazonium salt formation, the ring undergoes a change. For example, cyclopentane might lose a carbon, becoming cyclobutane.

Wait, but in this case, the starting ketone is cyclopentanone. So the product after elimination would need to be a ketone, which is one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps after the diazonium salt formation, the nitrogen is eliminated as N2, and the ring undergoes a change.

Wait, perhaps the ring opens, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation step doesn't reduce the nitrile to an amine, but instead something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options for E:

A) 3,4-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one.

B) 2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentan-1-one.

C) 4-methylcycloheptan-1-one.

D) 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one.

So all are cyclic ketones with multiple methyl groups.

Given that A is a ketone, and the reaction steps, perhaps the ring size changes during the process.

Wait, perhaps the elimination step (formation of E) involves the loss of a small gas, like N2, leading to a ring contraction or expansion.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the overall process. The initial ketone A, upon reaction with HCN, forms B (cyanohydrin). Then, B is hydrogenated to C. Then, C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and D loses a gas (maybe N2) to form E.

If E is a ketone, perhaps during the elimination step, a ring is formed or a carbonyl is created.

Wait, perhaps in the elimination step, a ring contraction occurs. For example, if D is a six-membered ring, elimination could form a five-membered ring ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial ring is five-membered (cyclopentanone), and after some steps, it becomes a four-membered ring (cyclobutanone).

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about each possibility.

Option D is 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one. That's a four-membered ring with methyl groups on C2, C3, and C4. Hmm.

Another thought: the initial ketone A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone. Then, after the Wittig reaction, the ring remains cyclopentane but with a substituent that includes a double bond and a methyl group.

But perhaps after the series of reactions, the ring size changes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination step leads to the formation of a new ring with fewer members. For example, if D has a six-membered ring, elimination could lead to a five-membered ring.

Wait, but I'm not getting much progress here. Let me try to think about the possible structures of E.

Since E is a ketone, and the options are all cyclic, the elimination must form a carbonyl group. So perhaps in D, there's a leaving group adjacent to a carbon that can form a carbonyl upon elimination.

Wait, perhaps during the elimination step, a ring forms, and a carbonyl is generated.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination is a Hofmann or Curtius type elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The initial compound A is a cyclic ketone. Let's say it's cyclopentanone. Then, after the Wittig reaction, the product is a cyclopentene with substituents, as given in hint a.

But I'm not making progress there, so perhaps I should think about the possible structures of E.

Looking at the options, option D is 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one. That's a four-membered ring with three methyl groups. Hmm.

Wait, if the elimination step forms a four-membered ring, perhaps the initial ring was five-membered, and through some steps, it contracted.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial ring is six-membered and becomes five-membered.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step reduces the ring size. For example, cyclohexane reducing to cyclopentane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation step doesn't change the ring but modifies substituents.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each step again with more specific structures.

Let me suppose that A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone.

1. Reaction with HCN: forms a cyanohydrin. So structure is cyclopentane with OH and CN groups on adjacent carbons (say, C1 and C2). So, 1-hydroxy-2-cyanocyclopentane.

2. Hydrogenation with H2 and Pd: the nitrile (CN) group is reduced. Let's say it becomes CH2NH2. So the structure becomes 1-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)cyclopentane.

3. Reaction with HNO2: the primary amine (NH2) reacts with nitrous acid to form a diazonium salt. Then, the diazonium group (N2+) is eliminated, likely as N2 gas, forming a carbocation.

So, 1-hydroxy-2-(carbocation)cyclopentane? Wait, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the amine group is converted into a nitro group, but that's under different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the amine into an imine, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the primary amine is converted into a nitro group. Then, D would have a nitro group. Then, elimination of a gas (like N2) would lead to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: if the amine becomes a nitro group, then upon heating, the nitro group could be reduced or decompose.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try a different approach.

Let me consider the possible structure of E. The options are all cyclic ketones. Let's see:

Option D is 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one. That's a four-membered ring with a ketone at position 1, and methyl groups at 2, 3, and 4.

How could that form from the reactions?

Perhaps during the elimination step, a ring contraction occurs. For example, a five-membered ring could contract to a four-membered ring, forming a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial ring is five-membered (cyclopentanone), and through some reactions, it becomes a four-membered ring.

But I'm not exactly sure how that would happen.

Another thought: The hydrogenation step reduces the nitrile to a CH2 group, and then the nitrous acid step removes a CH2 group, leading to ring contraction.

Wait, perhaps the elimination step involves the loss of two carbons, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination step removes a group, leading to a ring contraction.

Wait, another possibility: The elimination could be a Hofmann elimination, where an amine is converted into an amine with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrous acid treatment leads to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think about the possible structures.

If the elimination step produces a ketone, perhaps the structure of E is a result of a ring contraction or expansion.

Looking at the options, option D is a four-membered ring. So perhaps the initial ring is five-membered and becomes four-membered.

But how?

Wait, perhaps during the nitrous acid treatment, a ring contraction occurs. For example, the loss of a CH2 group could cause the ring to contract.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination of a group (like N2) leads to the formation of a double bond, and then a rearrangement forms a smaller ring.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is a bicyclic compound, but the options don't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination step forms a carbonyl, leading to a new ring.

Wait, another approach: the elimination of a gas (like N2) usually involves the loss of a molecule. So maybe the structure of D has a group that upon loss of N2 forms a double bond or a carbonyl group.

If E is a ketone, perhaps the elimination step forms a carbonyl.

So, perhaps D has an imine or similar group which, upon elimination, forms a carbonyl.

Wait, but in that case, D would have a nitrogen that's involved in the elimination, leading to the formation of a double bond or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps D has an amine group adjacent to a carbonyl, and elimination forms a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Given that E is a ketone, and the options are all cyclic, perhaps the correct option is the one where the ring size matches with the initial structure after some steps.

Wait, the hint a says that the Wittig product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So that product has a cyclopentane ring. So A must have been a substituted cyclopentanone.

If A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone, then after reaction with HCN, B would be 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane with a cyanohydrin group.

Then, B is hydrogenated to form C. If the nitrile is reduced to CH2NH2, then C would have a CH2NH2 group.

Then, C reacts with HNO2, which would convert the NH2 to N2 and form a carbocation. But in a ring structure, carbocations are usually not stable unless there's a possibility for ring expansion or contraction.

In a cyclopentane ring, the loss of N2 would form a carbocation at position 2, adjacent to the OH group. Then, perhaps the ring contracts to form a cyclobutane, with the carbocation at position 3.

Wait, perhaps the ring contracts from cyclopentane to cyclobutane, and the carbocation is at position 1. Then, a ketone would form at that position.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ring expansion occurs, but that's less likely.

Wait, another possibility: the elimination step forms a double bond, leading to a ring contraction. For example, if the ring was five-membered and a double bond forms, it could become a four-membered ring with a ketone.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group, making E a ketone.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the IR data again. A has a peak at 1750 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (likely a ketone). E has a peak at 1715 cm^-1, which is slightly lower, suggesting maybe an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone, but it's still a ketone.

So, perhaps E is a smaller ring ketone, as the IR is lower, which might indicate conjugation or a different environment.

Looking at the options, D is a cyclobutanone derivative, which is a four-membered ring. A cyclobutanone would have a higher ring strain, so the carbonyl might absorb at a slightly lower wavenumber, perhaps around 1715 cm^-1. So that fits with the IR data for E.

So, putting it all together, perhaps E is D) 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one.

So, the steps would be:

1. A is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone.

2. Reacts with HCN to form a cyanohydrin (B).

3. Hydrogenation reduces the nitrile to an amine (C).

4. Nitrous acid converts the amine to a diazonium salt, which eliminates N2, leading to a ring contraction to cyclobutane and the formation of a ketone (E).

Thus, the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify compound E in the given reaction scheme, we analyze the transformations and the provided hints:

1. **Compound A**: The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak at 1750 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. The structure of A is inferred to be 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanone, as supported by the Wittig reaction product (1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane) described in hint (a). The Wittig reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen with a double bond, forming the given product.

2. **Reaction of A with HCN**: This forms compound B, a cyanohydrin. The structure of B is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane with an OH group and a CN group on adjacent carbons.

3. **Reduction of B with H₂ and Pd**: The nitrile group (CN) in B is reduced to a primary amine (CH₂NH₂), forming compound C. The structure of C is 1,2-dimethylcyclopentane with an OH group and a CH₂NH₂ group.

4. **Reaction of C with HNO₂**: Nitrous acid reacts with the primary amine in C, forming a diazonium salt. Upon elimination of N₂ gas, a carbocation is formed. In a cyclopentane ring, the carbocation rearranges, leading to a ring contraction to form a cyclobutane ring. This results in compound D, which is 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutane with a carbocation at position 1.

5. **Elimination of an inert gas to form E**: The carbocation in D rearranges to form a ketone at position 1, resulting in compound E, which is 2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one. The IR spectrum of E, showing a strong peak at 1715 cm⁻¹, is consistent with a ketone in a strained cyclobutane ring.

Thus, the correct structure of compound E is **2,2,3,4-tetramethylcyclobutan-1-one**.

Answer: D
