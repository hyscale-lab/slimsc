Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should be straightforward.

First, let me parse the problem. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, so the concentration after dilution will change. Oh right, concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is constant.

So the initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 0.05 M × 0.02 L is indeed 0.001 moles. Dividing by 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. Got it.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, I think that refers to when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So I need to find out how much NaOH is added at that point and calculate the pH accordingly.

Wait, for equivalence point calculations, I need to know how much NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point. Let me think: the moles of acetic acid are 0.001. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added at this point. Moles NaOH = 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. So when we add NaOH, the total volume changes. But for the 25% point, perhaps I should consider the reaction and the resulting buffer solution.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So initially, after dilution, we have 0.025 M CH3COOH. Then, adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol in 0.04 L. So when 0.00025 mol of OH- is added, it will react with 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH, producing 0.00025 mol of CH3COO-.

After reaction, the moles of CH3COOH will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO- will be 0.00025 mol. The total volume is now the initial volume plus the NaOH added. So 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). The pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 × 10⁻⁵. So pKa is about 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is a bit higher, so pKa is around 4.73. Wait, exact calculation: let me compute log(1.85e-5). 

Wait, wait, no: pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that: log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733, but since pKa is -log, it's 4.733. So approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ). Let's compute that ratio: 0.005882/0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me recalculate the ratio. 0.00025 / 0.00075 is 1/3. So the ratio is 1/3, so log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 → about 4.25. Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 at 25%, which is close. But let's check the other possibility.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the dilution correctly. Let me double-check the moles. Oh wait, wait, the initial solution after mixing is 40 cm³, as I had. Then adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (which is 25% of 10 cm³). So total volume is 42.5 cm³.

Wait, another approach: the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, but when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, perhaps it's easier to do a molar calculation considering the moles.

Wait, another way: the moles of CH3COOH initially after dilution are 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.00025 mol. So, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L. So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. [CH3COO-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. So the ratio is (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 0.3333.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.333) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 as the first pH value. So that would be around there.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The moles of NaOH at equivalence are 0.001 mol as calculated before. The total volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So the concentration of CH3COO- is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO-) will hydrolyze in water. The reaction is: CH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M. So using the approximation for weak bases, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recompute Kb. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Then, [CH3COO-] is 0.02 M. So Kb =5.405e-10. The equation is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO-]. Assuming x is the [OH-] concentration.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 M. pOH is log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so pOH ≈ 5 - 0.017 = 4.983. So pH is 14 - 4.983 = 9.017 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH near 9 for the equivalence point. Let me check the options again:

Options:
A) 4.26; 8.52
B) 3.17; 6.73  
C) 4.73; 7.00
D) 4.57; 6.92  

Hmm, none of these have 9.02. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate Kb and the rest.

Wait, wait. Wait, maybe I should compute the pH at equivalence more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the acetate ion's concentration is 0.02 M, but wait, the solution volume is 50 cm³, so 0.05 L. So 0.001 mol / 0.05 L is 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression for the hydrolysis, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the pH more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a weak base. The formula is pH = ½ (pKb - log C). Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct approach is to use the approximation, but perhaps the assumption that x is small isn't valid here. Let me check Kb and concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact equation.

The acetate ion hydrolysis:

CH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]

Let me let [OH-] = x. Then [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3COO-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02).

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → as before, x ≈ 1.04e-5. So pOH is about 4.98, pH about 9.02. But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kw is 1e-14 → Kb = Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85 ) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Hmm. So the pH at equivalence should be around 9.02, but the options don't have anything close. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the stoichiometry. Let's re-examine the equivalence point.

Wait, wait. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. The NaOH added at equivalence is 0.001 mol, so all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / (0.04 + 0.01) = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So the acetate ion will hydrolyze as before.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact quadratic equation. Let me set up the equation.

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)

Assuming x is much less than 0.02, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, which is about 0.0000104 M. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is 4.983 → pH is 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. The options' equivalence points are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92. None are near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me go back.

Wait, when the problem says "25% titration", does that mean 25% of the initial volume of acetic acid solution, or 25% of the moles? No, wait, 25% of the equivalence point volume. Because when you titrate, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. So adding 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence would add 25% of the moles. So that's what I did earlier, which I think is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the dilution more accurately. Let me try a different approach. When the two solutions are mixed (20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and 20 cm³ water), the moles of acetic acid are 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, as before. The total volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

When titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed to reach equivalence is V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O

So the moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.73.

So log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253 → approximately 4.25. So the first pH is about 4.25, which matches option A's first value of 4.26.

Now, for the equivalence point. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Maybe I should consider that the solution at equivalence is a buffer solution if I added more or less than the equivalence point. No, at equivalence, it's a solution of the conjugate base, which is a weak base.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the equivalence point is calculated differently. Another possibility is that the base is in excess. But no, at equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid, so no excess.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of Kb is incorrect? Let's double-check. Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = Kw/Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Then, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So the Kb is 5.405e-10. Using [OH-] = sqrt( (Kb * C) ), which is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.287e-6 M. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 5.405e-10 * 0.02 is 1.081e-11. The square root of that is approximately 1.04e-5 M.

Wait, but earlier I calculated [OH-] as 1.04e-5, which gives pOH around 4.98, pH around 9.02. But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the solution volume. Let me recalculate the concentration.

At equivalence, moles of CH3COO^- are 0.001 mol. Total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So the [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M, and Kb is 5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact quadratic equation instead of the approximation.

The equation is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x).

Assume x is small compared to 0.02. Let's see, x is about sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, which is much less than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So the approximation holds.

So x ≈ 1.04e-5 M. [OH-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 9.02.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the solution at equivalence as being a buffer, but that's not the case. Or perhaps I should consider the solution's ionic strength, but that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I messed up the initial dilution. Let me check again. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³ of water: total volume 40 cm³. So concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to 25% of the solution being titrated, not 25% of the equivalence volume. No, the question says 25% titration, which usually refers to 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So 25% of the volume needed for equivalence.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me think about another approach. Maybe using the concentration of acetate and the Kb, but perhaps I need to consider the exact expression.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH more accurately. Let me proceed.

The equation Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO-] → 5.405e-10 = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x≈√(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 4.57; 6.92. The first value is around 4.57, which is close to 4.7 but not exactly. Let me think: when I did the 25% titration, I got pH ≈4.25, which is closest to option A's first value, 4.26.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculations again. Let me recompute the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration: moles of NaOH added=0.00025.

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.00075. Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

Volume is 42.5 cm³, so [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] =0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈0.00588 M.

Ratio is 0.00588 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

pH = pKa + log(0.3333) =4.73 -0.477=4.253.

So around 4.25, which is close to option A's first value of 4.26.

But for the equivalence point, perhaps the pH is 9.02, which isn't in any option. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb again.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → Kb =1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 ≈0.5405 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula without the approximation.

Let me set up the equation:

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.

Plugging in Kb=5.405e-10.

x² +5.405e-10 x - (0.02)(5.405e-10)=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= - (0.02 *5.405e-10)= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 *1.081e-11.

Let me compute each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 ≈ 2.921e-19.

4ac=4 * 1 * (-1.081e-11) → no, wait, c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac=4 *1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11. Wait, no, in the quadratic formula, it's sqrt(b² -4ac), but since c is negative, it's actually b² +4* a* |c|.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D= b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → (5.405e-10)^2 is 2.921e-19, and 4ac is 4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) → but because c is negative, -4ac becomes positive. So 4 *1 *1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

So D=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 → wait, no, because 4ac is 4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) =-4.324e-11, so D= (5.405e-10)^2 - (4 *1 * (-1.081e-11)) ) → 5.405e-10^2 +4.324e-11= 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11= 4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since 2.921e-19 is negligible). So D ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approximately 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

The positive root will be taken.

So,

x = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ) / 2 → approximately (6.576e-6)/2 →3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 M. pOH = log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514, which is approximately 8.51.

Ah! So that's where the 8.52 comes from. So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52. Which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier by not using the exact quadratic equation. So the initial approximation gave me a pH of 9.02, but the exact calculation gives pH around 8.52, which matches option A.

So, to recap:

At 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26.

At equivalence, pH is approximately 8.52.

Which matches option A: 4.26; 8.52.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, followed by titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Setup**
- **Initial moles of acetic acid**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is \(40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}\). The new concentration is:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

---

### **Step 2: 25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH.  
- **Moles of NaOH added**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \text{formed**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Total volume**:  
  \[
  \text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentrations**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
  \]
  where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\).  
  Substituting the values:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253.
  \]
  Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### **Step 3: Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions.  
- **Moles of NaOH at equivalence**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Total volume**:  
  \[
  \text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentration of CH}_3\text{COO}^-**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **pH calculation**:  
  The acetate ion acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:  
  \[
  \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
  \]
  The \(K_b\) for acetate is:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
  \]
  Using the approximation for weak bases:  
  \[
  [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
  \]
  The pOH is:  
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
  \]
  The pH is:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
  \]
  However, using the exact quadratic equation yields a slightly lower pH of approximately **8.52**.

### **Final Answer**
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately **4.26**, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should be straightforward.

First, let me parse the problem. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, so the concentration after dilution will change. Oh right, concentration is inversely proportional to volume when the amount of solute is constant.

So the initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 0.05 M × 0.02 L is indeed 0.001 moles. Dividing by 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. Got it.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, I think that refers to when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So I need to find out how much NaOH is added at that point and calculate the pH accordingly.

Wait, for equivalence point calculations, I need to know how much NaOH is required to reach the equivalence point. Let me think: the moles of acetic acid are 0.001. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added at this point. Moles NaOH = 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. So when we add NaOH, the total volume changes. But for the 25% point, perhaps I should consider the reaction and the resulting buffer solution.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. The reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

So initially, after dilution, we have 0.025 M CH3COOH. Then, adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let me calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol in 0.04 L. So when 0.00025 mol of OH- is added, it will react with 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH, producing 0.00025 mol of CH3COO-.

After reaction, the moles of CH3COOH will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO- will be 0.00025 mol. The total volume is now the initial volume plus the NaOH added. So 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). The pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is 1.85 × 10⁻⁵. So pKa is about 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is a bit higher, so pKa is around 4.73. Wait, exact calculation: let me compute log(1.85e-5). 

Wait, wait, no: pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that: log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733, but since pKa is -log, it's 4.733. So approximately 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) ). Let's compute that ratio: 0.005882/0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me recalculate the ratio. 0.00025 / 0.00075 is 1/3. So the ratio is 1/3, so log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.73 - 0.477 → about 4.25. Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 at 25%, which is close. But let's check the other possibility.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the dilution correctly. Let me double-check the moles. Oh wait, wait, the initial solution after mixing is 40 cm³, as I had. Then adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (which is 25% of 10 cm³). So total volume is 42.5 cm³.

Wait, another approach: the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M, but when we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, perhaps it's easier to do a molar calculation considering the moles.

Wait, another way: the moles of CH3COOH initially after dilution are 0.001 mol. Moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.00025 mol. So, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L. So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. [CH3COO-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. So the ratio is (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 0.3333.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.333) = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 as the first pH value. So that would be around there.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

The moles of NaOH at equivalence are 0.001 mol as calculated before. The total volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So the concentration of CH3COO- is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion (CH3COO-) will hydrolyze in water. The reaction is: CH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M. So using the approximation for weak bases, [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recompute Kb. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

Then, [CH3COO-] is 0.02 M. So Kb =5.405e-10. The equation is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO-]. Assuming x is the [OH-] concentration.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 M. pOH is log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so pOH ≈ 5 - 0.017 = 4.983. So pH is 14 - 4.983 = 9.017 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH near 9 for the equivalence point. Let me check the options again:

Options:
A) 4.26; 8.52
B) 3.17; 6.73  
C) 4.73; 7.00
D) 4.57; 6.92  

Hmm, none of these have 9.02. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate Kb and the rest.

Wait, wait. Wait, maybe I should compute the pH at equivalence more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the acetate ion's concentration is 0.02 M, but wait, the solution volume is 50 cm³, so 0.05 L. So 0.001 mol / 0.05 L is 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact expression for the hydrolysis, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the pH more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a weak base. The formula is pH = ½ (pKb - log C). Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct approach is to use the approximation, but perhaps the assumption that x is small isn't valid here. Let me check Kb and concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the exact equation.

The acetate ion hydrolysis:

CH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO-]

Let me let [OH-] = x. Then [CH3COOH] = x, and [CH3COO-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small compared to 0.02).

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → as before, x ≈ 1.04e-5. So pOH is about 4.98, pH about 9.02. But none of the options have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kw is 1e-14 → Kb = Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85 ) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Hmm. So the pH at equivalence should be around 9.02, but the options don't have anything close. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the stoichiometry. Let's re-examine the equivalence point.

Wait, wait. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. The NaOH added at equivalence is 0.001 mol, so all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate. So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / (0.04 + 0.01) = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So the acetate ion will hydrolyze as before.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact quadratic equation. Let me set up the equation.

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x)

Assuming x is much less than 0.02, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, which is about 0.0000104 M. So [OH-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is 4.983 → pH is 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. The options' equivalence points are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92. None are near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me go back.

Wait, when the problem says "25% titration", does that mean 25% of the initial volume of acetic acid solution, or 25% of the moles? No, wait, 25% of the equivalence point volume. Because when you titrate, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized. So adding 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence would add 25% of the moles. So that's what I did earlier, which I think is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the dilution more accurately. Let me try a different approach. When the two solutions are mixed (20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and 20 cm³ water), the moles of acetic acid are 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol, as before. The total volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

When titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed to reach equivalence is V = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O

So the moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.73.

So log(0.005882 / 0.017647) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253 → approximately 4.25. So the first pH is about 4.25, which matches option A's first value of 4.26.

Now, for the equivalence point. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Maybe I should consider that the solution at equivalence is a buffer solution if I added more or less than the equivalence point. No, at equivalence, it's a solution of the conjugate base, which is a weak base.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the equivalence point is calculated differently. Another possibility is that the base is in excess. But no, at equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid, so no excess.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of Kb is incorrect? Let's double-check. Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = Kw/Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Then, the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So the Kb is 5.405e-10. Using [OH-] = sqrt( (Kb * C) ), which is sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.287e-6 M. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 5.405e-10 * 0.02 is 1.081e-11. The square root of that is approximately 1.04e-5 M.

Wait, but earlier I calculated [OH-] as 1.04e-5, which gives pOH around 4.98, pH around 9.02. But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the solution volume. Let me recalculate the concentration.

At equivalence, moles of CH3COO^- are 0.001 mol. Total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So the [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M, and Kb is 5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact quadratic equation instead of the approximation.

The equation is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x² / (0.02 - x).

Assume x is small compared to 0.02. Let's see, x is about sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5, which is much less than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So the approximation holds.

So x ≈ 1.04e-5 M. [OH-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = 4.98 → pH = 9.02.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the solution at equivalence as being a buffer, but that's not the case. Or perhaps I should consider the solution's ionic strength, but that's beyond the scope here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I messed up the initial dilution. Let me check again. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³ of water: total volume 40 cm³. So concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to 25% of the solution being titrated, not 25% of the equivalence volume. No, the question says 25% titration, which usually refers to 25% of the way to the equivalence point. So 25% of the volume needed for equivalence.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me think about another approach. Maybe using the concentration of acetate and the Kb, but perhaps I need to consider the exact expression.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH more accurately. Let me proceed.

The equation Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO-] → 5.405e-10 = (x)(x)/(0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x≈√(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5 M.

So [OH-]=1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 4.57; 6.92. The first value is around 4.57, which is close to 4.7 but not exactly. Let me think: when I did the 25% titration, I got pH ≈4.25, which is closest to option A's first value, 4.26.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculations again. Let me recompute the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration: moles of NaOH added=0.00025.

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.00075. Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025.

Volume is 42.5 cm³, so [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] =0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈0.00588 M.

Ratio is 0.00588 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

pH = pKa + log(0.3333) =4.73 -0.477=4.253.

So around 4.25, which is close to option A's first value of 4.26.

But for the equivalence point, perhaps the pH is 9.02, which isn't in any option. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb again.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → Kb =1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 1/1.85 ≈0.5405 → 5.405e-10. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula without the approximation.

Let me set up the equation:

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.

Plugging in Kb=5.405e-10.

x² +5.405e-10 x - (0.02)(5.405e-10)=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= - (0.02 *5.405e-10)= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1 *1.081e-11.

Let me compute each term:

(5.405e-10)^2 ≈ 2.921e-19.

4ac=4 * 1 * (-1.081e-11) → no, wait, c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac=4 *1*(-1.081e-11)= -4.324e-11. Wait, no, in the quadratic formula, it's sqrt(b² -4ac), but since c is negative, it's actually b² +4* a* |c|.

Wait, the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

So a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D= b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → (5.405e-10)^2 is 2.921e-19, and 4ac is 4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) → but because c is negative, -4ac becomes positive. So 4 *1 *1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

So D=2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 → wait, no, because 4ac is 4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) =-4.324e-11, so D= (5.405e-10)^2 - (4 *1 * (-1.081e-11)) ) → 5.405e-10^2 +4.324e-11= 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11= 4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19 ≈ 4.324e-11 (since 2.921e-19 is negligible). So D ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)=sqrt(4.324e-11)= approximately 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

The positive root will be taken.

So,

x = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10 ) / 2 → approximately (6.576e-6)/2 →3.288e-6.

So [OH-]=3.288e-6 M. pOH = log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.486 → pH=14-5.486=8.514, which is approximately 8.51.

Ah! So that's where the 8.52 comes from. So the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52. Which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier by not using the exact quadratic equation. So the initial approximation gave me a pH of 9.02, but the exact calculation gives pH around 8.52, which matches option A.

So, to recap:

At 25% titration, pH is approximately 4.26.

At equivalence, pH is approximately 8.52.

Which matches option A: 4.26; 8.52.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, followed by titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Setup**
- **Initial moles of acetic acid**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is \(40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}\). The new concentration is:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

---

### **Step 2: 25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH.  
- **Moles of NaOH added**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- \text{formed**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Total volume**:  
  \[
  \text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentrations**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation**:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
  \]
  where \(\text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\).  
  Substituting the values:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253.
  \]
  Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### **Step 3: Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions.  
- **Moles of NaOH at equivalence**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Total volume**:  
  \[
  \text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentration of CH}_3\text{COO}^-**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- **pH calculation**:  
  The acetate ion acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:  
  \[
  \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
  \]
  The \(K_b\) for acetate is:  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
  \]
  Using the approximation for weak bases:  
  \[
  [\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot C} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
  \]
  The pOH is:  
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
  \]
  The pH is:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
  \]
  However, using the exact quadratic equation yields a slightly lower pH of approximately **8.52**.

### **Final Answer**
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately **4.26**, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately **8.52**. These values match **Option A**.
