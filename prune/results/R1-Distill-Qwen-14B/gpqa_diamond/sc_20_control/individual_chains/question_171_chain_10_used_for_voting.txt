Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, substituents on a benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions—either ortho, meta, or para. The question is about the para-isomer yield when each of the six substances reacts with excess bromine. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer.

Let me list out the substances first:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, more accurately, I think the structures are:

1) Toluene: methyl group attached to benzene.
2) Benzoate ester: a COOEt group (COOCH2CH3) attached to benzene.
3) Chlorobenzene: Cl attached.
4) Nitrobenzene: NO2 attached.
5) Ethylbenzene: ethyl group attached.
6) Benzoic acid: COOH attached.

So each of these has a substituent on benzene. The reaction is bromination, which is an electrophilic substitution. The directing effect of each substituent will determine where the bromine adds.

But wait, the question is about the formation of the para-isomer. So I need to find out, for each substituent, whether it's meta-directing or para-directing, or ortho/para.

I recall that substituents can be activating or deactivating. Activating groups are usually electron-donating, which makes the ring more reactive and direct the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups are electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive, and typically direct meta.

Let's go through each substituent:

1) CH3 (toluene): methyl is an activating group, ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, it'll go para to the methyl group. So the para isomer will be the major product.

Wait, but wait. Methyl directs ortho and para, but the activating groups typically have more para product because of steric hindrance in ortho? Or depends on the group?

Wait, no, it's about the directing. For toluene, the substituent is activating and directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. But in bromination, since it's a strong electrophile, perhaps more para than ortho, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe the substituent is bulky, leading to para preference.

Wait, but regardless, when the substituent is ortho/para directing, the para isomer tends to be the major one, especially when the substituent is in a position that doesn't allow easy ortho attack due to steric reasons. For example, for a bulky substituent like a methyl group, the para position is more favored because the ortho position is crowded. So toluene would give a higher para product.

2) COOEt (ethyl benzoate): This is a substituent. The ester group is a meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group (EWG). Wait, no, wait! Wait, carbonyl groups are EWGs. So ester (like COOR) is deactivating, because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So it's a meta director. Thus, when bromine adds, it would go meta to this group, so the para isomer would not form. Wait, but wait. The substituent is in the ring. If the substituent is in the para position, but wait, no, no. Wait, the substituent is on the ring, so the incoming electrophile will be directed meta to it. So the product will have the Br in the meta position relative to the ester group, meaning that the para isomer relative to the substituent isn't formed. So for ethyl benzoate, the para isomer is not formed; the meta is the major product. So the weight fraction of the para isomer is low or zero.

Wait, wait no. Wait, if the substituent is meta-directing, the Br will enter in the meta position relative to the substituent. So for the substituent in position 1, Br would go into position 3 or 5 (meta). So the product would be 3-bromo or 5-bromo derivatives, but the para position would be position 4, which is not meta. So the para isomer is not formed. So for substance 2, the para-isomer would not be formed, so its weight fraction is zero. But wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about the para-isomer of the substituted product. So for each substituent X on benzene, the product is bromobenzene with X in a certain position relative to Br. So for each substance, the substituent X is on the benzene, and Br adds either ortho, meta, or para to X.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is X. So when Br adds, it could be in ortho, meta, or para to X. The question is about the para-isomer's yield. So for each X, determine how much Br adds para to X.

So for each substituent, what's the percentage para.

So, for each X, what is the directing effect.

Let me go through each substituent:

1) X = CH3 (toluene). Activating, ortho/para-directing. So the Br can add in ortho or para. But in practice, for toluene, the major product is para-bromotoluene because the methyl group is activating, and being an activating group, it's predominant para. So the para isomer is major. So the weight fraction is high.

2) X = COOEt (ester). This is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So Br will add meta to X. So the para isomer is not formed. So weight fraction is zero.

3) X = Cl. Chlorine is a substituent. Cl is a deactivating (since it's more electronegative), but it's ortho/para directing because it's a -I group but has lone pairs that can donate through resonance. Wait, wait. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group (-I effect) but can donate electrons through resonance (because it's an sp3 hybrid and has lone pairs). So Cl is a meta director? Or is it ortho/para? Hmm, I think Cl is an ortho/para director, but deactivating. So for Cl, the incoming Br will be ortho or para to Cl.

Wait, but wait. I thought Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So for chlorobenzene, the product would have Br in ortho or para. But due to steric reasons, perhaps para is favored. So the para product would be a major isomer.

4) X = NO2 (nitro group). Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So Br would add meta to NO2. So the para isomer would not form. So the weight fraction is zero.

5) X = C2H5 (ethyl group, ethylbenzene). The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So Br would add ortho or para. Again, in this case, for ethyl groups, the para position is more favored because the ethyl group is bulky, making ortho attack less favorable. So the para-isomer is major. So high yield.

6) X = COOH (carboxylic acid group). The COOH group is a strong deactivating group (electron-withdrawing) and is a meta-directing substituent. So Br will add meta to COOH. So the para product is not formed. So weight fraction is zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check each.

1) Toluene (CH3): activating, ortho/para, but para is major due to steric. So high para yield.

2) COOEt (ester): deactivating, meta. So no para, zero.

3) Cl: deactivating, ortho/para. So Br can go ortho or para. Which is higher? For chlorobenzene, the major product is the para isomer because ortho might have some steric hindrance. Wait, but wait. I thought for chlorobenzene, the ortho product is more substituted and perhaps more stable, but wait, Cl is small. So for chlorobenzene, the para product is major because the activating effect is not strong, but it's ortho/para directing. So in bromination, the para product is major.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Substituents that are ortho/para directors can either be activating or deactivating. For example, Cl is deactivating (but weakly so) because of its -I effect, but is ortho/para directing because of resonance donation. So in chlorobenzene, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene, because the para position is more accessible than ortho, perhaps. So the para isomer is major.

4) Nitro group: meta director, so Br adds meta. So para is not formed, zero.

5) Ethyl group: activating, ortho/para. But ethyl is bulkier, so para is favored. So high para yield.

6) COOH: deactivating, meta director. So no para, zero.

Wait, but in some cases, like with -COOH, does the substituent affect the ring in a way that directs Br to para? Or is it definitely meta? I think it's definitely meta, so no para.

So for each substituent, the para yield (weight fraction) would be:

1) High
2) Zero
3) High
4) Zero
5) High
6) Zero

Wait, but wait. Let me correct. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product is formed. For meta directors, no para. Also, some substituents may have a higher tendency to form para than ortho, depending on their bulk.

So let me list the substituents and their effect on the para product's yield.

Substance 1: CH3 (toluene): Ortho/para, but para is major. So high para yield.

Substance 2: COOEt: meta, so no para. Zero.

Substance 3: Cl: Ortho/para, para is major. So high.

Substance 4: NO2: meta, so zero.

Substance 5: C2H5: Ortho/para, para is major. High.

Substance 6: COOH: meta, zero.

So substances 1,3,5 have high para yields, and 2,4,6 have zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about substance 3: Cl. Chlorobenzene. When brominated, the major product is para-bromochlorobenzene, right? Because Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So para should be major. So yes.

Wait, but some sources say that for chlorobenzene, the para product is major. So the para isomer's yield is high.

So the substances with high para yields are 1,3,5.

Wait, but I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para isomer. That is, from the lowest to the highest.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the weight fraction, so which substituents give a higher or lower percentage of the para isomer.

Wait, but for substituents that direct to para, the para isomer is major, so their yield is high. For substituents that don't direct to para, the para isomer isn't formed—so zero.

So the para fraction's order is: zero for 2,4,6; and high for 1,3,5.

Wait, but the options don't have any with three zeros. The options have varying orders.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe some substituents have varying degrees of para preference. Like, perhaps some groups direct more strongly to para than others.

Wait, perhaps the substituents that are ortho/para directors can have different tendencies. For example, in some cases, the para isomer is more favored than others.

Wait, for example: the ethyl group (substance 5) is more bulky than the methyl group (substance 1). So in ethylbenzene, the para product is more favored than in toluene. So substance 5 would have a higher para yield than substance 1.

Similarly, Cl (substance 3) is less bulky than methyl and ethyl groups. So in chlorobenzene, the para product may be higher than in toluene? Or perhaps similar.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the directing.

Wait, the substituent's electronic and steric effects influence where the Br adds. For example, in toluene, the methyl group is an activating group, and directs electrophiles to ortho and para. But due to steric hindrance, the para product is more favored. So toluene would have a high para yield.

In chlorobenzene, Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Since Cl is a smaller substituent, perhaps the para product is not as dominant as in toluene, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's the same.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the relative strengths of the substituents.

The nitro group is a strong deactivating and meta-directing group. The COOH group is also strong deactivating and meta-directing. The ester group (COOEt) is deactivating and meta-directing.

The Cl is a deactivating but ortho/para director.

The methyl and ethyl groups are activating and ortho/para directors.

So, the substituents that are ortho/para directing will have para as the major product.

Now, among the substituents that are ortho/para directors, which ones lead to a higher para yield?

Methyl (1) and ethyl (5) are activating, ortho/para. For both, the para is the major product, but perhaps ethyl is more bulky than methyl, so in ethylbenzene, the para product is more favored than in toluene. So substance 5 (ethyl) would have a higher para yield than substance 1 (toluene).

Similarly, Cl (substance 3) is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Would the para product be major here? Yes, I think so. So the para yield for substance 3 is high.

So, the order of para yield (from lowest to highest) would be:

Substances with low or zero para yield: 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2), 6 (COOH)

Then the next are the ortho/para directors but whether their para yield is high or not.

Wait, but the ortho/para directors (1,3,5) have higher para yields than the meta directors (2,4,6).

So the order would be: 2,4,6 (all zero) have lower yields than 1,3,5 (high yields). So in the question, the order is increasing para yield.

Wait, but the question asks to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para isomer. So from the lowest to the highest.

Wait, but in the given options, I don't see any with 2,4,6 in the lower end. Let me look at the options:

Option A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

Wait, 4 is NO2, 2 is COOEt, 6 is COOH. These are all meta directors, so their para fraction is zero. But the option is putting them in the order 4 <2<6.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the substituents can have varying degrees of para product formation.

Wait, perhaps not all ortho/para directors have the same para yield. For example, some substituents may have a higher percentage of para product than others.

Wait, perhaps the substituents that are activating have higher para yields than those that are deactivating but ortho/para directors.

Wait, but in this case, Cl is a deactivating but ortho/para director. So in chlorobenzene, the para product is the major one. So for substance 3, the para isomer is major.

Substance 1 (toluene) and 5 (ethylbenzene) are activating, so their para products are major.

So the order among the ortho/para directors would be based on how much para is formed.

Wait, perhaps Cl has a lower para yield than the activating substituents. Because Cl is electron-withdrawing, even though it's ortho/para directing, the ring is less activated, so the para product may not be as major as with activating groups.

Wait, but in terms of para product, perhaps Cl directs to para but the yield may be less than for activating groups.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of it another way. The activating groups (methyl, ethyl) will have higher para yields than the deactivating ortho/para directors (like Cl). Because activating groups make the ring more reactive, so the para product is more favored.

Wait, but Cl is a deactivating group. So the overall ring is less reactive, but the substituent directs. So the para product is formed, but perhaps the para product is the major isomer even for Cl.

So substances 1, 3, 5 have para products, and 2,4,6 do not.

So the order of increasing para yield would be: zero (substances 2,4,6) < (substances 1,3,5 in some order).

But looking at the options, none of them have all three meta directors at the lower end. So perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe some substituents direct to para but with lower yields.

Alternatively, perhaps some substituents don't form any para isomer. Wait, no, that can't be. For example, nitro group directs to meta, so para isomer isn't formed.

Wait, perhaps the substituents that are meta directors have zero para, and others (ortho/para directors) have varying yields.

So the initial order would be: 2,4,6 (zero) < 1,3,5 (high, but perhaps in order).

Now, among 1,3,5, which has the highest para yield?

I think ethyl group (5) has a higher para yield than methyl (1) because ethyl is bulkier, leading to more para product.

Chlorine (3) may have a para product, but perhaps less than the activating groups. So the order would be: 2,4,6 < 3 < 1 <5.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Cl (3) has a higher para yield than activating groups because, despite being deactivating, the ring is still reactive enough for para substitution.

Wait, but in terms of the actual yields, perhaps the more activating the group, the higher the para yield. So the order would be: Cl (3) < methyl (1) < ethyl (5). No, that doesn't make sense because Cl is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive, so the para product may be lower in yield than in activating substituents.

Hmm, perhaps the para yield for Cl is lower than for the activating substituents. So the order would be:

Substances with zero para: 2,4,6.

Then substances 1,3,5 with increasing para yields: 3 <1 <5.

Wait, but why would 3 have lower than 1? Because Cl is deactivating, so ring is less reactive, so substitution is less favored. But in terms of directing, the substituent is still ortho/para. So perhaps the overall yield (not just the regiochemistry) is lower for deactivating groups.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer, not the overall reaction rate. So even if the ring is less reactive, the para isomer's percentage could be high, but the overall reaction may be slower. But the question is about the ratio of para isomer in the product, not the reaction rate.

So perhaps the para yield for chlorobenzene (3) is high, same as toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5).

So in that case, the order of increasing para yield would be:

Substances with zero para: 2,4,6. 

Then, the ortho/para directors with high para yields: 3,1,5. Or maybe 1,3,5 in some order.

Wait, but the options don't have this. Let me check the options again.

Option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3

Wait, this would mean:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <1 (toluene) <5 (ethylbenzene) <3 (chlorobenzene).

But 4,6,2 have zero para. So their order would be 4<6<2, since their para fraction is zero. Then 1,5,3 have higher, but perhaps in order of para yield.

Alternatively, if 1 has a lower para yield than 5, then 1 comes before 5.

So, the increasing order would be 4,6,2 (zero) < 1 <3 <5.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again about each substituent's para yield.

Wait, maybe the substituents' ability to direct to para varies. For example, the strength of the activating group affects the para yield.

Methyl is an activating group, so it's a strong director to para. Ethyl is a stronger activating group, so perhaps the para yield is higher than methyl. Chlorine is an activating (but deactivating overall) group, so perhaps its para yield is less than methyl and ethyl.

So, the order of para yield among 1,3,5 would be 3 <1 <5.

So, putting it all together, the order from lowest to highest para yield is:

2,4,6 (zero) < 3 <1 <5.

Wait, but how does the option fit?

Looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. Which would mean, in the order of increasing para fraction: 4,6,2,1,5,3.

But according to my current understanding, substances 4,6,2 have zero para. So they would all come before 3,1,5.

So, the first three would be 4,6,2, but the question is about increasing order. So perhaps option C starts with 4, then 6, then 2, then 1, then 5, then 3.

But wait, why would 4 come before 6 and 2? All have zero. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps certain substituents might have some para product, but minimal. So the order could be based on how much they direct to para.

Wait, but if all three (2,4,6) have zero, the order among them would be arbitrary. But in the options, each option orders them differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that substituents 2,4,6 have zero para. Maybe they have some para, but it's negligible.

Wait, but in practice, for a meta-directing substituent, the para product is a minor isomer. So perhaps the para fraction isn't zero but negligible. But I think in the context of this question, it's considered zero.

So, perhaps the correct order is: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, let me think again. The substituents with zero para (2,4,6) would all come before those with high para (1,3,5). So the correct order would be 2,4,6 < 1,3,5.

But looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So, in option A, the order is 4, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then5.

But why would 4 (NO2) come before 2 (COOEt)? Both are meta directors, so their para fractions are zero. So perhaps the order among them doesn't matter as they all have zero.

But the options treat them differently, so perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps some substituents can lead to a small amount of para product, and others not. I'm not sure, but I think the correct approach is to consider each substituent's directing effect.

Another approach: each substituent's activating or deactivating nature affects the reactivity and the position of substitution.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of each substituent and whether the para product is formed.

- Toluene (1): para is major.
- Ethyl benzoate (2): meta is major, para not formed.
- Chlorobenzene (3): para is major.
- Nitrobenzene (4): meta is major.
- Ethylbenzene (5): para is major.
- Benzoic acid (6): meta is major.

So, 1,3,5 have high para yields; 2,4,6 have none.

So the order of increasing para fraction would be 2,4,6 <1,3,5.

But the options don't directly reflect this. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4.

Wait, option A: 4,2,6 have zero; then comes 3 (high), 1 (high), 5 (high). So the order would be 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But why would 4 come before 2 and 6? All have zero.

Alternatively, perhaps some substituents have more activation, leading to a higher rate of para product. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituents 4 (NO2) is a stronger deactivator than 2 (COOEt), which is stronger than 6 (COOH). But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, maybe in terms of deactivating strength, nitro is stronger than ester, which is stronger than COOH. No, wait, nitro is a strong deactivator, then COOH, then COOEt.

Wait, I think that the order of deactivating groups is: NO2 > COOH > COOEt. But I'm not entirely sure.

But in any case, for the para product, substituents 4,2,6 have zero, so their order is arbitrary. But according to the options, in option A, 4 comes first, then 2, then 6.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the presence of para, but about the degree of para product, meaning that some substituents may have a higher or lower percentage of para isomer.

Wait, perhaps for some substituents, the para product is minor, not major. For example, in nitrobenzene, the para product is not formed. But in chlorobenzene, the para product is major.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that some substituents are strong deactivators, making the ring less reactive, so the para product is present but in lower amounts.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe substituents with more activating effects (like methyl, ethyl) lead to higher para yields.

In any case, perhaps the correct order is that substituents 2,4,6 have zero or low para, and substituents 1,3,5 have high para. So the order from least to most para would be 2,4,6 <1,3,5.

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

But 3 is chlorobenzene, which has a high para yield. So according to option A, the order is 4<2<6 (zero) <3 (high) <1 (high) <5 (high). So this would fit the idea that 4,2,6 have low/zero, then 3,1,5 have higher.

But then why is 3 (chloro) before 1 (toluene) and 5 (ethyl)?

Well, perhaps the para yield of chlorobenzene is lower than toluene and ethylbenzene.

So in terms of para fraction, chlorobenzene (3) has less than toluene (1) and ethylbenzene (5).

So the order would be 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

So the increasing order would be 4, 2, 6, 3, 1,5.

Which matches option A: 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Yes, that's option A.

To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing bromination, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can be activating (electron-donating) or deactivating (electron-withdrawing), and they direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions (ortho, meta, or para). The para-isomer's yield depends on the substituent's directing behavior and steric effects.

### Substituent Analysis:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**:  
   The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the para-isomer is the major product. High para yield.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**:  
   The ester group (-COOEt) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromine adds meta to the ester group, so the para-isomer is not formed. Zero para yield.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**:  
   The chlorine atom is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. Due to steric and electronic effects, the para-isomer is the major product. High para yield.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**:  
   The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromine adds meta to the nitro group, so the para-isomer is not formed. Zero para yield.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**:  
   The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the para-isomer is the major product. High para yield.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**:  
   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromine adds meta to the carboxylic acid group, so the para-isomer is not formed. Zero para yield.

### Order of Increasing Para-Yield:
- Substances with **zero para yield** (2, 4, 6): Ethyl benzoate, nitrobenzene, benzoic acid.
- Substances with **high para yield** (1, 3, 5): Toluene, chlorobenzene, ethylbenzene.

Among the meta-directing groups (2, 4, 6), their para-yields are zero, and their order is arbitrary. However, based on the options provided, the order is **4 < 2 < 6**. For the ortho/para-directing groups (1, 3, 5), the para-yield increases with the substituent's activating effect: **3 < 1 < 5**.

Thus, the complete order is **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
