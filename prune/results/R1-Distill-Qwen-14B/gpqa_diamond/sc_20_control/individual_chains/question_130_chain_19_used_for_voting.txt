Okay, so I've got this question here about the redshift of hydrogen clouds detected by ground-based optical telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A to D, with redshifts ranging from 1.2 to 3.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line is at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. So when this line is redshifted, the observed wavelength changes. The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength)/rest wavelength.

But wait, in this case, the hydrogen is absorbing the light. So the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud at the Lyman-alpha wavelength. So the absorption line would be at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. But the quasar's light, when observed, would show this absorption at a longer wavelength if the cloud is moving away (redshifted).

Wait, no, the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud is at a certain redshift. The quasar's light is from a time when the universe was younger, so the quasar's emission is at a higher redshift than the cloud, because the cloud is in front of the quasar. Because the cloud is in between us and the quasar, the quasar's light passes through the cloud, which absorbs the Lyman-alpha line. So the quasar's spectrum would show a absorption line at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms if the cloud is at a redshift z.

Wait, so the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z). So λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) Angstrom.

But what's the issue with detecting this with optical telescopes? Oh, right, because optical telescopes can't detect wavelengths beyond a certain limit. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to many wavelengths, especially in the infrared. But optical light is roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), I think. But wait, in terms of Angstroms, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, and 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the quasar's emission at Lyman-alpha is in the UV, so if the cloud is at a certain redshift, the observed wavelength would be in a longer wavelength. So if the quasar's Lyman-alpha line is absorbed, the absorption line would appear at a longer wavelength (because it's redshifted). So if the cloud has a redshift z, then the Lyman-alpha absorption line would be observed at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe UV light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So even if the quasar emits in the UV, we can't see it from the ground. But wait, the question is about the absorption line. So the quasar's light is being absorbed at the Lyman-alpha line, and the question is about whether that absorption line is in the optical range.

Wait, no. The quasar emits across the spectrum, but for us to see the absorption line, that line must be in the optical. Because if it's in the UV or infrared, the ground-based telescope can't observe it. So the absorption line must be shifted into the optical range.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The quasar itself emits in the UV, but the absorption line we're talking about is in the quasar's spectrum. So if the quasar is at a high redshift, the UV emission gets redshifted into the optical. But in this case, it's the absorption of the quasar's light by the hydrogen cloud that's being considered.

So the absorption line in the quasar's spectrum is at 1216 Angstroms (rest frame of the hydrogen). But when the hydrogen cloud is at a certain redshift, this absorption line is shifted. So the observed wavelength λ = 1216*(1 + z_cloud). But wait, the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the quasar's light passes through the cloud. So the quasar's redshift is z_quasar = z_cloud + delta_z. But I think for this problem, the quasar's redshift might not matter directly. The key is whether the absorption line is observed in the optical.

So the absorption line's observed wavelength must be within the range observable by a ground-based optical telescope. So optical wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1 + z) must be less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms. Because if it's longer than that, we can't observe it in optical.

So solving 1216*(1 + z) <= 7000.

Let's compute:

(1 + z) <= 7000 / 1216 ≈ let's see, 1216 * 5 = 6080; 1216*5.76 ≈ 7000.

Wait, 7000 / 1216 ≈ let's compute it:

1216 * 5 = 6080 → 7000 -6080= 920.

920 /1216 ≈ 0.756.

So 5.756. So 1 + z <= 5.756 → z <= 4.756. Wait, but that would be the upper limit. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, our condition is that the observed wavelength is less than or equal to 7000 Angstroms (since higher than that is infrared, which optical telescopes can't see). So the maximum (1 + z) would be 7000/1216 ≈ 5.756. So z_max ≈4.756.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. If the observed wavelength must be within the optical, which is less than 7000 Angstroms, but if the absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z), then for that to be in optical (λ ≤ 7000):

So 1 + z ≤ 7000 / 1216 → z ≤ 4.756.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the observed wavelength is longer than 7000 Angstroms (i.e., 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms), then it's in the infrared, which is not visible to optical telescopes. So to be visible in optical, the observed wavelength must be ≤7000 Angstroms.

So the maximum z is when 1216*(1 + z)=7000 → 1 + z =7000/1216 ≈5.756 → z≈4.756.

So for z >4.756, the absorption line is in the infrared, which optical telescopes can't detect. So the lower limit on the redshift is actually the maximum z for which the absorption line is still in optical.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So that they can be detected. So the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is at the lower end of the optical range. Wait, optical's lower end is about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). So let's see:

If 1216*(1 + z) ≥4000 → 1 + z ≥4000/1216 → 4000/1216 ≈3.29 → 1 + z ≥3.29 → z≥2.29.

Wait, but wait, that would be the condition for the line to be in the optical (since lower than 4000 would be UV, which can't be detected). So the absorption line's observed wavelength must be above 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) to be in the optical.

Wait, but is that correct? Because if the observed wavelength is lower than 4000 Angstroms (like 3000 Angstroms, which is 300 nm, UV), the optical telescope cannot observe it. So the absorption line must be observed in the optical, so lambda >=4000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1 + z) >=4000 → 1 + z >=4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z >=2.29.

So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, the choices are 1.2 (B), 1.9 (D), 2.4 (C), 3 (A).

Wait, 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 4000/1216 is exactly what? Let's compute 4000 divided by 1216. 1216 * 3=3648, 1216*3.29=?

Wait, 1216 × 3 is 3648. 1216 ×3.29 ≈ 3648 + 1216*0.29.

1216*0.2=243.2, 1216*0.09=109.44. So 243.2+109.44=352.64. 3648 +352.64=3999.64. So 1216 ×3.29 ≈4000. So 4000/1216≈3.29. So 1 + z ≥3.29 → z≥2.29.

So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the redshift must be at least about 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest lower is 2.4 (option C) or 1.9 (option D). Wait, but 2.29 is higher than 2.4? No, 2.29 is less than 2.4. So the minimum redshift would be about 2.29, which is approximately 2.3. So the lower limit is z=2.29.

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So, what's the minimal z that allows the absorption line to be in the optical. The minimal z is when the observed wavelength is exactly 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). If z is lower than that, the observed wavelength would be in the UV, which can't be seen. So the minimal redshift is z=2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is slightly higher than 2.29. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So the minimal redshift is about 2.29, so any cloud with z ≥2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is z=2.29, so the minimal z is 2.29. So the smallest possible z that allows detection is 2.29.

So which option is the lower limit? The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift, meaning the minimum redshift where detection is possible. So any object with z≥2.29 can be detected, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the redshift must be at least 2.29, so the answer would be approximately 2.3.

Looking at the options, the available options are 2.4 (option C) and 1.9 (D). Wait, 2.29 is between 1.9 and 2.4. So the question is, which is the lower limit? The minimal z is 2.29, so we can't detect anything below that. So the lower limit is 2.29. So the correct answer is the option that is the smallest value that is ≥2.29. So looking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9. So 2.29 is between C and D. So the minimal redshift is 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the answer must be option C)2.4, since 2.4 is the first option above 2.29.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z is 2.29, so anything above that can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29, but the options don't have 2.29. The closest higher value is 2.4 (option C), so the lower limit would be 2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the problem says "lower limit on the redshift". So the minimal z where it can be detected. So any z above that can be detected. So the minimal z is 2.29. So the redshift must be at least 2.29. So the options are C)2.4 and D)1.9. So 2.4 is higher than 2.29, which would be the minimal. But maybe the question is asking for the minimal possible redshift that allows detection, so what's the minimal z.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this backwards. The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift, meaning the smallest possible redshift that can still be detected. So if the minimal z is 2.29, then the lower limit is 2.29, so any object above that can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C)2.4, which is the smallest option higher than 2.29.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's emission is in the Lyman-alpha, but the absorption is from the intergalactic medium (like the Lyman-alpha forest). Wait, but the question says it's neutral hydrogen clouds, so perhaps it's the Lyman-alpha forest? But the problem is about detecting the absorption line in the optical.

Wait, another angle: the quasar's own emission is at 1216 Angstroms. But when the quasar is at a redshift z, the emission is observed at 1216*(1+z). If the quasar is too close (low z), then the emission is in the UV, which can't be seen. So for the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission to be in the optical, z must be such that 1216*(1+z) ≤7000 Angstroms → z ≤5.756 as before.

But in the case of absorption, like the Lyman-alpha forest, the quasar's light is from a time when the universe was younger, so it's at a higher redshift. But the absorption lines are from intervening clouds at lower redshifts. So the absorption line would appear at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Angstroms.

So the quasar's light is observed in optical, so 1216*(1 + z_quasar) ≤7000 → z_quasar ≤5.756.

But for the absorption line (from the cloud at z_cloud) to be in the optical, 1216*(1 +z_cloud) ≤7000 → z_cloud ≤5.756.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so z_cloud < z_quasar.

Wait, but the absorption line in the quasar's spectrum is due to the cloud, which is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Hmm. So let me think of it this way:

The quasar is at redshift z_q. The hydrogen cloud is at redshift z_c, which is less than z_q. The quasar's light passes through the cloud, so the cloud absorbs at its own Lyman-alpha wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. So the absorption line in the quasar's spectrum is observed at 1216*(1 + z_c) Angstroms.

We need this absorption line to be in the optical, i.e., between 4000 and 7000 Angstroms.

So 4000 ≤ 1216*(1 + z_c) ≤7000 → 4000/1216 ≤1 + z_c ≤7000/1216 → approximately 3.29 ≤1 +z_c ≤5.756 → z_c ≥2.29 and z_c ≤4.756.

So the cloud's redshift must be between 2.29 and 4.756. But the question is about the lower limit, the minimal redshift of the cloud for the absorption line to be detected in optical.

So the minimal z_c is 2.29. So the cloud must have z ≥2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest higher option is 2.4 (option C), but I'm not sure if that's the intended answer. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's light is observed in the optical, so the quasar's redshift must be such that its emission is in the optical. Let me think again. The quasar emits light, and the Lyman-alpha emission line is at 1216 Angstroms. For us to see this emission in the optical (since we're looking at the quasar's spectrum to see the absorption line), the quasar's emission must be redshifted into the optical.

Wait, no, the quasar itself is too distant, so its emission lines are redshifted. So the quasar's own Lyman-alpha line would be at 1216*(1 + z_q) Angstroms. But in this case, we're looking for the absorption line in the quasar's spectrum. So the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_c) Angstroms, where z_c is the cloud's redshift.

So for the absorption line to be in the optical, 4000 <= 1216*(1 + z_c) <=7000.

So the minimal z_c is when 1216*(1 + z_c) =4000 → z_c = (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.29-1=2.29.

So the lower limit is z_c=2.29.

But the options don't have 2.29. The closest higher option is C)2.4. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the quasar's light is being absorbed in the Lyman-alpha line, but the quasar's own emission is at a higher redshift. So the quasar's emission line would be at 1216*(1 + z_q), which must be in the near-infrared or beyond for the quasar to be seen in optical.

Wait, but this is getting more complicated. Let me think again. The question is about detecting the absorption line. So the absorption line must be in the optical.

So the cloud's redshift z_c must satisfy 1216*(1 + z_c) <=7000 (so the absorption line is in the optical, because beyond 7000 is infrared, which ground-based optical telescopes can't observe).

So the maximum z_c is when 1216*(1 +z_c)=7000 → z_c= (7000/1216) -1 ≈5.756-1≈4.756.

But the question is about the lower limit. So what's the minimal z_c for the absorption line to be in the optical.

Wait, but the minimal z_c would be when the absorption line is at the lower end of the optical. So 1216*(1 +z_c) ≥4000 → 1 +z_c ≥4000/1216≈3.29 → z_c≥2.29.

So the lower limit is 2.29. So the minimal redshift is ~2.3. So the options are, the closest higher is C)2.4, but that's larger than 2.3. So perhaps the answer is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the redshift. Wait, if the cloud's redshift is higher than a certain value, the absorption line would be in the infrared, which is undetectable. So the lower limit is the minimal z_c that still allows the absorption line to be in the optical. So minimal z_c is 2.29.

So the correct answer would be the minimal z_c, which is approximately 2.3. Since the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9, the only option higher than 2.29 is C)2.4, so that would be the lower limit. But wait, no, the lower limit is the minimum redshift that allows the absorption line to be in optical. So any cloud with z_c >=2.29 can be detected, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the correct answer is the one that is the minimal possible redshift, which is 2.29. But since 2.29 is not an option, perhaps the question expects us to pick the next higher option, which is 2.4 (option C).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the quasar's redshift. Wait, no, the question is about the redshift of the hydrogen clouds, which are the absorbers.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this via the Lyman-alpha forest concept. The Lyman-alpha forest is a series of absorption lines in the spectra of quasars, caused by neutral hydrogen in distant clouds. These lines are blueward (shorter wavelengths) of the quasar's own Lyman-alpha emission line.

Wait, but in this case, the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 +z_c), where z_c is the cloud's redshift.

To be visible in optical, this must be between 4000 and 7000 Angstroms. So the minimal z_c is when it's 4000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1+z_c)=4000 → 1+z_c=4000/1216≈3.29 → z_c≈2.29.

So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 2.29. So the smallest possible redshift is 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest higher is 2.4 (option C), but 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. So 2.29 is between 1.9 and 2.4. So the options are D)1.9 and C)2.4. So the minimal is 2.29, which is higher than 1.9. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any cloud with z_c >=2.29 can be detected. So option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the correct answer is option C). Or perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the quasar's redshift, but no, the question is about the redshift of the hydrogen clouds.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the Earth's atmosphere's cutoff. The atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). So if the observed wavelength is below 3000 Angstroms, the light can't reach ground-based telescopes. So the absorption line must be above 3000 Angstroms.

Wait, that's a different approach. Maybe I was wrong earlier, assuming the lower limit is 4000. But perhaps the cutoff is lower. Let's see.

The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to light below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), in the UV. So for ground-based telescopes, any light with λ <300 nm doesn't reach us. So the absorption line must be observed at λ >=3000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1 + z_c) >=3000 → 1 +z_c >= 3000/1216 ≈2.467 → z_c >=1.467.

So the lower limit would be 1.467. So in this case, the minimal z_c is about 1.47. So looking at the options, the closest higher is option D)1.9, which is 1.9>1.47.

But wait, this contradicts my earlier calculation. So which is correct?

I think I mixed up the concepts. The problem is about whether the absorption line is visible. If the line is observed at λ <300 nm, it's absorbed by the atmosphere and can't be detected. So to be detected, the line must be at λ >=300 nm, which is 3000 Angstroms.

So for the absorption line to be observed, 1216*(1 +z_c) >=3000.

So z_c >= (3000/1216) -1 ≈2.467-1=1.467.

So the lower limit on the redshift is approximately 1.47.

Looking at the options, the closest higher is option D)1.9, which is 1.9>1.47. Alternatively, perhaps the lower limit is 1.47, so any z_c >=1.47 can be detected. So the minimal z_c is 1.47.

But wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 1.47 is between 1.2 and 1.9. So the lower limit is 1.47, so any cloud with z_c ≥1.47 can be detected. So the minimal z_c is 1.47.

Thus, the lower limit is 1.47, which is approximately 1.5. Among the options, D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.47. So the correct answer would be the minimal z_c is 1.47, so any cloud with z_c ≥1.47 can be detected.

But wait, looking at the options, the options are 1.2 (B), 1.9 (D), etc. So 1.9 is higher than 1.47, so the minimal z_c is 1.47, but the available options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is the next higher option, which is D)1.9.

But wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's break it down:

If the observed wavelength is 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), then z_c would be:

z_c = (3000/1216) -1 ≈2.467-1=1.467.

So any z_c >=1.467 would result in the absorption line being observed at 3000 Angstroms or longer, which is detectable by ground-based telescopes.

So the minimal z_c is 1.467. So the lower limit is 1.467. But the options are 1.2, 1.9, etc. So the minimal z_c is approximately 1.47, so the smallest redshift that can be detected is 1.47. The options don't have that. So the correct answer would be the next higher option, which is D)1.9. But wait, 1.9 is higher than 1.47, so any cloud with z_c >=1.47 can be detected. So the lower limit is 1.47. The question asks for the lower limit, which is the smallest possible redshift that allows detection. So the answer should be the minimal z_c, which is approximately 1.47. But the options don't have that, so perhaps I should check the given options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3000/1216.

3000 ÷ 1216. Let me compute that:

1216 ×2 = 2432.

3000-2432=568.

So 2 and 568/1216.

568 ÷1216 ≈0.467.

So 3000/1216 ≈2.467.

So 1 + z_c =2.467 → z_c ≈1.467.

So that's correct.

So the minimal z_c is about 1.467. So any cloud with z_c >=1.467 can be detected.

Looking at the options, the smallest option higher than 1.467 is 1.9 (option D).

But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z is 1.467, so any z >=1.467 can be detected. So the lower limit is 1.467.

But the options are 1.2, 1.9, etc. So 1.2 is below 1.467, which would mean that clouds with z_c=1.2 would have the absorption line at 1216*(1+1.2)=1216*2.2=2675.2 Angstroms, which is 2675 Angstroms or 267.5 nm, which is UV and can't be detected by ground-based telescopes.

So 1.2 is too low. The minimal z_c is 1.467, so the first option that is above this is D)1.9. So the answer is D)1.9.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the lower limit is 2.29, but that was when I considered the lower end of the optical as 400 nm. But the atmosphere's cutoff is 300 nm, so the absorption line must be at 300 nm or longer to be detected. So the minimal z_c is 1.467, which is approximately 1.47.

So the correct answer is the minimal z_c where the absorption line is at 3000 Angstroms. So in the options, the next higher is D)1.9, which is 1.9>1.47.

Wait, but wait, option D is 1.9, which is higher than 1.47. So any cloud with z_c >=1.47 can be detected. So the lower limit is z_c =1.47. So the answer would be the minimal redshift, which is approximately 1.47. But the options don't have that, so perhaps I should check the approach again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about whether the cloud itself is at a redshift that allows the Lyman-alpha line to be in the observed frame. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the quasar's redshift is so high that the Lyman-alpha line is in the optical, but the absorption line from the cloud is at a lower redshift.

Wait, perhaps the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the quasar's redshift is larger than the cloud's. So the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_q) Angstroms, which must be in the optical for us to see it. So 1216*(1 + z_q) ≤7000 → z_q ≤5.756.

The cloud's absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_c) Angstroms, which must be in the optical (≥3000 Angstroms). So 1216*(1 +z_c)≥3000 → z_c≥1.467.

So the minimal z_c is 1.467 → approximately 1.47. So the lower limit is 1.47.

So the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 1.47 is between B (1.2) and D (1.9). So the lower limit is 1.47, so the minimal possible redshift is 1.47, so any redshift equal to or higher than that can be detected.

But the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift, which is the minimal possible z. So the answer is approximately 1.47. Since the options don't have that, the next higher option is D)1.9.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that the quasar's spectrum must be observed in the optical, so the quasar's own Lyman-alpha emission must be in the optical. So 1216*(1 +z_q) ≤7000 → z_q ≤5.756.

But the cloud's absorption line at 1216*(1 +z_c) must be in the optical, so z_c ≥ (3000/1216)-1=1.467.

So the minimal z_c is 1.467, which is approximately 1.47. So the answer is the minimal redshift, which is 1.467. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is option D)1.9.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of the objects (the hydrogen clouds) such that they can be detected. So the minimal z_c is 1.467. So any cloud with z_c >=1.467 can be detected.

Looking at the options, the only option higher than 1.467 is D)1.9. So the correct answer is D)1.9.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the quasar's spectrum must be observed in the optical. So the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission must be in the optical. So 1216*(1 +z_q) <=7000 → z_q <=5.756.

But the cloud's redshift is less than z_q. So the cloud's z_c is <5.756. But for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be >=3000 Angstroms (since below that, the atmosphere blocks it). So 1216*(1 +z_c) >=3000 → z_c >= (3000/1216)-1 ≈1.467.

Thus, the minimal z_c is 1.467. So the lower limit is approximately 1.47. The options are B)1.2 and D)1.9. So the correct answer is D)1.9, as it's the first option higher than 1.47.

Wait, but what if the question's 'lower limit' refers to the maximum z_c below which the line is not visible. No, the lower limit is the minimal z_c needed for detection. So the answer should be D)1.9.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption lines can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the situation as follows:

The Lyman-alpha absorption line is originally at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. When the hydrogen cloud is redshifted, the observed wavelength is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z_c)
\]

where \( z_c \) is the redshift of the cloud. For the absorption line to be detectable by optical ground-based telescopes, the observed wavelength must lie within the optical range. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below approximately 3000 Angstroms (300 nm), so the absorption line must satisfy:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 3000 \, \text{Angstroms}.
\]

Substituting the formula for \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\), we get:

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z_c) \geq 3000.
\]

Solving for \( z_c \):

\[
1 + z_c \geq \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.467, \quad \text{so} \quad z_c \geq 2.467 - 1 \approx 1.467.
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift of the hydrogen cloud is approximately \( z_c = 1.467 \). This means any cloud with \( z_c \geq 1.467 \) can be detected, as the absorption line will be in the optical range.

Now, comparing this result to the provided options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit and is therefore not the minimal redshift.
- **B) 1.2**: This is below the calculated lower limit of 1.467 and would result in the absorption line being in the UV, which cannot be detected by optical telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit and is a valid redshift for detection.
- **D) 1.9**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit and is also a valid redshift for detection.

Since the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift, the correct answer is the smallest value that satisfies the condition. The calculated lower limit is approximately \( z_c = 1.467 \), but this value is not explicitly listed among the options. The next higher option is **D) 1.9**, which is consistent with the requirement that \( z_c \geq 1.467 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
