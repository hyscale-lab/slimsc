Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the diffraction pattern created by a light passing through an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are of the same length 'a'. Mono-chromatic light with wavelength λ is coming along the z-axis and falls vertically on this aperture. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that diffraction patterns depend on the shape of the aperture. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles, but this is a polygon with many sides. Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Oh, wait, no, maybe not. Because a polygon with infinitely many sides would approximate a circle, but in this case, all apothems are the same. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal would approach a regular polygon as N increases.

Wait, but if all apothems are the same, then for a regular polygon, that's just a regular shape. So as N approaches infinity, it becomes a circle. Because a circle can be thought of as a polygon with infinite sides where each side's length approaches zero, but the apothem remains a. Alternatively, maybe the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a'?

Wait no, for a regular polygon, the apothem (distance from center to the midpoint of a side) is related to the radius (distance from center to a vertex). The formula for the apothem 'a' is a = R * cos(π/N), where R is the radius. So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so the apothem a approaches R. So when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle with radius R = a. Because cos(0) is 1, so R = a. So the problem reduces to a circular aperture when N approaches infinity.

Wait, but in that case, the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is different from a single slit. For a single slit, the minima are given by a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer, m=±1, ±2, etc. But for a circular aperture, the minima are determined by the Bessel function zeros. The first minimum occurs at a certain angle, but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, but the question says that the angular distance between the first two minima is to be found. So if we're considering the far field, which is the Fraunhofer diffraction, I think for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ ≈ λ/(2), but wait, I'm not exactly sure about the exact condition.

Wait, no, the far field diffraction for a circular aperture has a pattern where the first minimum occurs at a particular angle. The formula I recall is sinθ = 1.22 λ / (2a), but wait, let me think again. Oh, wait, the first minimum for a circular aperture (like in the Airy disk) is when the Bessel function J1 has its first zero. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but when considering the diffraction angle, I think the condition is a sinθ = λ * (first zero of J1) / (2π) or something like that. Alternatively, the formula I've heard is sinθ = (1.22 λ)/(a), where 1.22 comes from the first zero of J1 divided by π, maybe?

Wait, wait, let me double-check. The formula for the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is based on the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The nth minimum occurs when a sinθ = (x_n) * λ / (2), where x_n is the nth zero of J1. The first zero of J1 is about 3.8317, so a sinθ = (3.8317/2) λ. Wait, 3.8317 divided by 2 is approximately 1.91585, so sinθ ≈ 1.91585 λ / (2a) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Let me get the formula right. The general condition for the minima in the diffraction pattern is when the phase difference between the wavelets from the edges of the aperture leads to destructive interference. For a circular aperture, the intensity minima occur when a sinθ = (x_m) λ / (2), where x_m is the m-th zero of the Bessel function J1. So the first minimum (m=1) occurs at x_1 ≈ 3.8317. So a sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/2. So sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ) / (2a) ) = (1.91585 λ )/(a). But wait, 3.8317/2 is 1.91585, which is approximately 1.22 when divided by something else?

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the correct formula for the minima in the far field (Fraunhofer) for a circular aperture is when a sinθ = (x_m) λ / (2), so for the first minimum, x_1 is about 3.8317, so sinθ ≈ (3.8317 * λ )/(2a). So 3.8317/2 is approximately 1.91585, so sinθ ≈ 1.91585 λ / a. Wait, but that can't be right because sinθ can't be more than 1. So perhaps I got this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the single-slit diffraction, but wait, the polygon is approximated as a circle. Oh wait, perhaps the question is not considering the full diffraction pattern of the polygon, but treating the polygon as a single slit. Wait, but a polygon is a 2D shape, not a 1D slit. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, the problem says when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes something. But earlier, I thought it becomes a circle. So the question is about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. But wait, circular apertures have different minima. Alternatively, perhaps the shape being a polygon with N sides approaching infinity would mean that it's a flat disk (a circle) but with a certain width?

Wait, no, another thought. Wait, the problem says all apothems are the same. So for a polygon with N sides, each side has the same length, and the apothem is the same. So for N approaching infinity, this would become a circle, because each side is infinitesimally small, but the overall shape is a circle with radius a. Because the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a regular polygon is a = R cos(π/N), where R is the radius. As N approaches infinity, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R = a. So the polygon becomes a circle with radius a.

So the problem reduces to a circular aperture of radius a. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot surrounded by concentric rings. The first minimum occurs at a certain angle θ1, and the second minimum is the next ring. But wait, the minima for a circular aperture are more complicated than a single slit because it's 2D, but the question is talking about the first two minima, so maybe it refers to the first and second zeros in the pattern.

Wait, but the options given include 1.220 λ/a, which is option C. I remember that in the single-slit diffraction, the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ = λ, where 'a' is the slit width. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a sinθ = (λ) * (1.22) / (2a) ? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the problem is not considering a 2D circular diffraction but a 1D case, treating the polygon as a slit. Wait, but a polygon is a 2D shape. Hmm, perhaps the approach is different. Let me think about the general approach for polygonal apertures.

Alternatively, perhaps when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a flat disk, but perhaps the problem is simplified to a single slit, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a rectangular aperture, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says the polygon is N-sided, with all apothems equal to 'a'. So each side is at a distance 'a' from the center. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius 'a' because the apothem is the radius for a circle. So the aperture is effectively a circular one with radius a.

So the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture. The minima in this pattern are determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum occurs at a certain angle. But for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a), but wait, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, no. The correct condition for the minima in a circular aperture is given by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J1. The m-th minimum occurs when a sinθ = x_m λ / (2), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. The first zero (m=1) is at x_1 ≈ 3.8317. So the condition becomes a sinθ = (3.8317) λ / 2. So sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ) / (2a) → θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2a). But wait, 3.8317/2 is approximately 1.91585. So theta is approximately (1.91585 λ)/(a).

But wait, that's for the first minimum. The second minimum would be the next zero of J1, which I think is at x_2 ≈ 7.0156. So the condition for the second minimum would be a sinθ = (7.0156 λ)/2. So sinθ ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(2a) = (3.5078 λ)/a. Hmm, but wait, that would give a larger θ than the first minimum, which can't be right because 3.5078 λ/a would be larger than 1.91585 λ/a, but we're looking for the angular distance between the first two minima, which would be the difference in their θs.

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. But in a circular aperture, the first minimum is the first dark ring surrounding the central spot. The angular positions of the minima are given by θ_m = (x_m λ)/(a), because for small angles, sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ (in radians). So, using the approximation sinθ ≈ θ, the condition aθ = x_m λ/2, so θ = x_m λ/(2a).

Wait, no. Wait, if the condition is a sinθ = x_m λ / 2, and for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ (in radians), so aθ ≈ x_m λ/(2). So θ ≈ x_m λ/(2a).

Wait, but then θ for m=1 is approximately 3.8317 λ/(2a) ≈ 1.91585 λ/a. Similarly, for m=2, it's 7.0156 λ/(2a) ≈3.5078 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first and second minima would be the difference between θ2 and θ1: 3.5078 λ/a - 1.91585 λ/a ≈ 1.59195 λ/a. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Hmm.

Wait, but the options given are A) 0.610λ/a, B) 0.500λ/a, C)1.220λ/a, D)0.506λ/a. So none of these match 1.59195 λ/a. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the problem is not about the circular case but a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the polygon's aperture is being treated as a 1D slit whose width is the same as the apothem. But that doesn't make sense because a polygon is 2D. Alternatively, perhaps when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a rectangular slit, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the general case of an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to a. The area is (N * a * s)/2, where 's' is the side length. But perhaps a better approach is to model the polygon as an aperture and find the diffraction pattern.

Wait, the far field diffraction pattern is determined by the Fourier transform of the aperture's transmission function. For a polygon, the Fourier transform would be more complex than that of a slit or a circle. But when N is very large, perhaps the pattern simplifies. Alternatively, maybe the polygon can be approximated as a rectangular slit of width 2a, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but for a rectangular slit of width 'w', the minima occur at a sinθ = m λ/2, where m is an integer. The first minima for m=1 is at θ = λ/(2a). So the angular distance between the first two minima (m=1 and m=-1) would be 2θ, which is λ/a. But that's not one of the options either. Hmm.

Wait, but the options include 1.220 λ/a, which is option C. That's the same as the first minimum condition for a circular aperture. So perhaps the problem is considering that the first minimum occurs at θ=1.220 λ/a. But wait, according to the earlier calculation, for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ≈1.91585 λ/(2a) ? Wait, confusion arises.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the condition for the circular case. The condition for the first minimum is a sinθ = (λ) * (x_1)/(2), where x_1 is approximately 3.8317. So sinθ = (3.8317 * λ)/(2a). So for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ≈3.8317 λ/(2a) = 1.91585 λ/a.

Wait, that's approximately 1.91585 times λ/a. But none of the options match that. So perhaps the problem is not considering a circular aperture but a different shape.

Wait, going back to the problem statement: the aperture is a N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to a. When N approaches infinity, perhaps the shape becomes a circle, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is a regular polygon, and when N is very large, the polygon can be approximated as a rectangle of a certain width. Let me think: the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the side length s is related to the apothem a by s = 2a tan(π/N). As N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so s≈ 2a * (π/N). So when N is very large, each side is very small, but the polygon has a large number of sides. The total width of the polygon (the diameter) would be 2a, because the apothem is a. So, perhaps in this limit, the polygon can be approximated as a rectangle of width 2a, which would make the diffraction pattern similar to a single slit of width 2a.

Wait, if that's the case, then the minima for a single slit of width 'd' occur at d sinθ = mλ. So for d=2a, the minima are at (2a) sinθ = mλ → sinθ = mλ/(2a). So the first minimum is at θ1 where m=1: sinθ1= λ/(2a). The second minimum is at m=2: sinθ2= 2λ/(2a)= λ/a. But wait, λ/a can be larger than 1, which is impossible because sinθ can't exceed 1. So in reality, the first minimum is at θ where sinθ = λ/(2a), and the second minimum would be at m=1 but for the next possible maximum, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, no, for a single slit, the minima are at m=±1, ±2, etc. So the first minimum is at m=1, which is θ1= arcsin(λ/(2a)). The second minimum would be at m=2, but that would require sinθ2 = 2λ/(2a)= λ/a. But if λ/a is greater than or equal to 1, then the second minimum doesn't exist in the far field. So perhaps for a slit of width 2a, the first minimum is at m=1, and that's the only minimum before the angle becomes too large.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options include 1.220 λ/a, which is option C. So perhaps this corresponds to the first minimum in a circular aperture. But earlier calculations suggested that the first minimum for a circular aperture is at θ≈1.91585 λ/a, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about the polygon becoming a circle but something else, perhaps a square? Or perhaps the polygon becomes a slit of width 2a, and the diffraction pattern is that of a single slit. But then, the first minimum would be at θ1 = λ/(2a), the second at θ2=2λ/(2a)= λ/a. But if λ/a is greater than 1, then the second minimum is not present. So perhaps the angular distance between the first and second minima is the angle from θ1 to θ2, but for λ/a ≤1.

Wait, but the options include 1.220 λ/a, which is option C. So perhaps the problem is referring to the first minimum in a circular aperture, which is 1.220 λ/a, but that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the condition.

Wait, another thought—maybe the problem is using the single-slit formula, where the first minimum is at θ=λ/(a), but that doesn't fit the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a polygon. The general approach for a polygon is more complicated, but perhaps when N is large, it can be treated as a rectangular aperture.

Wait, but the options suggest that the answer is 1.220 λ/a. That's a familiar number—it's the first minimum for a circular aperture. But earlier I thought that's about 1.91585 λ/a, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait, another approach. The first minimum for a circular aperture is at θ where a sinθ = 1.22 λ. So sinθ = (1.22 λ)/a. So θ ≈ (1.22 λ)/a, assuming small angles (since tanθ ≈ theta). So the angular distance between the first and second minima would be the difference between θ2 and θ1, but for a circular aperture, the minima are not equally spaced. The first minimum is at around 1.22 λ/a, the second at around 2.45 λ/a (since the next zero is at x_2=7.0156, so (7.0156/2)=3.5078, which is about 3.5078 λ/(2a) =1.7539 λ/a. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the angular distance between the two first minima in the far-field pattern, which could be interpreted as the angle between the first minimum and the central maximum. But that doesn't make sense because the central maximum is a peak, not a minimum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a rectangular slit with width 2a, giving the first minimum at θ= (λ)/(2a), but that would give 0.5 λ/a as the first minimum. Looking at the options, option B is 0.5 λ/a. But the options also have option C as 1.22 λ/a, which I thought was the first minimum for a circular aperture.

Wait, but when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture. So the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/(a), which would be option C. But in my earlier calculation, using x_1=3.8317, I get θ=1.91585 λ/(2a) = 0.9579 λ/a, which is approximately 0.958 λ/a, which isn't one of the options either. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the condition. Let me think again. The condition for the minima in a circular aperture is a * sinθ = (x_m) * (λ/2), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. So for m=1, x_1=3.8317, so a sinθ = (3.8317 * λ)/2. So sinθ = (3.8317 λ) / (2a). So for small angles, sinθ ≈ theta, so theta ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2a) = 1.91585 λ/a. Wait, but that's about 1.916 λ/a, which isn't an option either.

Hmm, the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is not about a circular aperture but a different approach.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the polygon is treated as a flat disk with a certain width, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a line, i.e., a very thin slit. But that doesn't make much sense because a polygon is 2D.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is treated as a rectangular slit of width 2a, and the diffraction pattern is that of a single slit. So the first minimum occurs at θ = λ/(2a), but that would be option B) 0.500 λ/a. But in that case, the angular distance between the first two minima (m=1 and m=-1) would be 2θ, which is λ/a. But that's not one of the options either.

Wait, but perhaps the polygon being a regular N-gon with all apothems a is equivalent to a rectangle when N is large. So the width of the rectangle would be 2a, and the height is negligible, making it a 1D slit. So the diffraction pattern would be similar to a single slit of width 2a. The minima would be at (2a) sinθ = mλ. So m=1: sinθ=λ/(2a) → θ=λ/(2a). So the first minimum is at θ=λ/(2a), which is 0.5 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be the angle between m=1 and m=2, which would be θ2 - θ1. Wait, but for m=2, sinθ=2λ/(2a)=λ/a. But if λ/a is greater than or equal to 1, then the second minimum doesn't exist. So perhaps the only minimum present is m=1, and the next would be at m= -1. But the angular distance between m=1 and m=-1 is 2θ, which would be λ/a. But that's not one of the options either.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the options again. Option C is 1.220 λ/a. I know that 1.22 comes from the first minimum of a circular aperture, where sinθ =1.22 λ/a. So perhaps the problem is expecting that as the answer. But earlier calculations suggested that for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at sinθ=1.91585 λ/(2a) → 0.9579 λ/a. Hmm, that doesn't match 1.22.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me rederive it. The condition for the minima in the far field for a circular aperture is when the phase difference between the edges is an odd multiple of π. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is given by the Bessel function J1, and the minima occur where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The zeros of J1 are at x_m, so k a sinθ = x_m, where k = 2π / λ. So a sinθ = (x_m λ)/(2π). For the first minimum (m=1), x_1=3.8317, so a sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2 * π). Let me calculate that: 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 3.8317/(6.2832) ≈ 0.6098. So a sinθ ≈ 0.6098 λ. So sinθ ≈ 0.6098 λ / a → θ ≈ 0.6098 λ/a. That's approximately 0.610 λ/a, which is option A. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be the angle between the first and second zeros. Let's calculate the second zero: x_2=7.0156. So (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) →7.0156/(6.2832)= approximately 1.116. So sinθ=1.116 λ/a. But that's more than 1, so it's not possible. So perhaps the second minimum is beyond the first, but for small angles, the first minimum is at 0.610 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be the angle between m=1 and m=2, but if m=2 is beyond 1, perhaps the first two minima refer to the first and the second, but considering only those within the far field.

Wait, but according to this calculation, the first minimum is at 0.610 λ/a, which is option A. But earlier I thought the first minimum for a circular aperture is around 1.22 λ/a, but that seems to be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, let me recheck the formula. The condition for minima in a circular aperture is a sinθ = (x_m * λ)/(2), where x_m is the m-th zero of J1. Wait, no! I think I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The correct formula is a sinθ = (x_m * λ)/(2). Because the condition is that the phase difference is π, leading to J1(k a sinθ) = 0. So for x_1=3.8317, a sinθ= (3.8317 λ)/ (2) → sinθ= (3.8317 λ)/(2a) ≈ 1.91585 λ/a. Which again is not possible for a=λ/2, as sinθ would be 1.91585*(0.5)=0.957, which is acceptable. But for a=λ, sinθ=1.91585 *1=1.91585, which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is a sinθ = (x_m λ)/(2), so a = R (the radius), which is the same as the apothem in the limit as N approaches infinity.

Wait, if a is the radius, then a sinθ = (x_m λ)/(2) → sinθ= x_m λ/(2a). For x_1=3.8317, sinθ=3.8317 λ/(2a) ≈1.91585 λ/a. Which would only be possible if 1.91585 λ/a ≤1 → a ≥1.91585 λ. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on 'a' other than it's the apothem.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not about a circular aperture but a different approach. Maybe when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a flat disk, and the diffraction pattern is that of a rectangular slit.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the polygon as a flat disk. But I'm getting stuck between the options and the calculations. Let me think about the options again. Option C is 1.220 λ/a. I know that 1.220 is approximately 3.8317/(2π) times 2? Because 3.8317/(2π)=0.6098, which is option A. So perhaps the first minimum is at 0.6098 λ/a, which is option A. But the problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima. If the first minimum is at 0.6098 λ/a, the next would be at 1.2196 λ/a (since x_2=7.0156, so 7.0156/(2π)=1.116, which is 1.116 λ/a. But wait, 7.0156/(2π)= approx 1.116, but 1.116 * λ/a would be the next minimum. So the angular distance between the first and second minima would be 1.116 λ/a - 0.6098 λ/a = 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. The first minimum is at θ1 = 0.6098 λ/a. The second minimum would be at θ2 =1.116 λ/a. So the angular distance between them is θ2 - θ1 = 1.116 -0.6098 = 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

So that would be the answer. So the correct option is D) 0.506 λ/a.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern of a monochromatic light beam passing through an aperture shaped as an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to \(a\). When \(N\) approaches infinity, the polygon approximates a circular aperture with radius \(a\). The diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is governed by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1\), where the minima occur at angles satisfying the condition:

\[
a \sin\theta = \frac{x_m \lambda}{2},
\]

where \(x_m\) is the \(m\)-th zero of \(J_1\). For small angles, \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), so the condition simplifies to:

\[
a \theta = \frac{x_m \lambda}{2}.
\]

The first zero of \(J_1\) is \(x_1 \approx 3.8317\), and the second zero is \(x_2 \approx 7.0156\). Using these values, the angular positions of the first two minima are:

\[
\theta_1 = \frac{x_1 \lambda}{2a} = \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{2a} \approx 0.6098 \frac{\lambda}{a},
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \frac{x_2 \lambda}{2a} = \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{2a} \approx 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

The angular distance between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = 1.116 \frac{\lambda}{a} - 0.6098 \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately \(0.506 \lambda / a\), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
