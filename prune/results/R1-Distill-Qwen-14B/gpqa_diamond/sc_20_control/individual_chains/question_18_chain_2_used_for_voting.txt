Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me parse the given data. Both stars have masses more than the Sun, but I don't think the mass directly affects the elemental ratios. The problem is about their photospheric compositions, so I can focus on the abundance data.

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Also, the Sun's photospheric composition is provided:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but how does [X/Y] notation work? I think [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, actually, the logarithm is base 10, and [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_H) / (n_X_sun / n_H_sun) )? Or wait, maybe it's [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X_sun / n_Y_sun). Yes, that's right. So, if [X/Y] is 0, their ratio is the same as the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. So the Fe/H ratio in Star_1 is the same as the Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H] = 0, so their Mg/H is the same as the Sun.

Wait, but what do they mean by [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3? That means that [Si/Fe] in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun. So the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than the Sun's.

Let me think about how to find the ratio of silicon in each star relative to the Sun, then compare them.

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we need (n_Si, Star_1) / (n_Si, Star_2).

Hmm. To find that, maybe I can express each star's silicon abundance relative to the Sun, then take the ratio.

But wait, how? Because the abundance ratios are given in terms of [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], but I need to connect that to [Si/H] perhaps.

Wait, here's the plan:

For each star, express [Si/H] in terms of their given [X/Y] values and the Sun's composition.

Once I have [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, I can find the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) = 10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }.

Because [X/H] = log10(n_X / n_H) - log10(n_X_sun / n_H_sun). So [X/H] = log10( (n_X / n_H) / (n_X_sun / n_H_sun) ) → 10^{[X/H]} = (n_X / n_H) / (n_X_sun / n_H_sun) → (n_X / n_H) = 10^{[X/H]} * (n_X_sun / n_H_sun).

Wait, but the problem is that I don't have [Si/H] for the stars. So I have to compute [Si/H] based on the given ratios.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe/H is same as Sun. So n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log10( (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) ) - log10( n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) ) = 0.3.

Let me write that as log10( (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) ) = log10( (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun) ) + 0.3 → (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) = (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, n_Fe,1 = n_Fe,sun * (n_H,1 / n_H,sun) ?

Wait, no. Wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log10(n_Fe / n_H) - log10(n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) = 0. So n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun.

Similarly, n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) * n_H,1.

But I don't know n_H,1 or n_H,2. But maybe I can express the ratios in terms of the Sun's values.

Wait, perhaps I can express [Si/H] for Star_1 in terms of [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

Because [Fe/H] is 0, so [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun.

So [Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si,1 / n_H,1) - log10(n_Si,sun / n_H,sun).

But from [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, which is log10( (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) ) - log10( n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) ) = 0.3.

But since n_Fe,1 = n_Fe,sun * n_H,1 / n_H,sun, because n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun → n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) * n_H,1.

So n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 = (n_Si,1) / ( (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) * n_H,1 ) ) = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) * (n_H,sun / n_Fe,sun )

From [Si/Fe], this equals (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun) ) * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, let me redo this.

We have:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 ) = log10( n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) + 0.3.

So n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 = (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun) ) × 10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) ) × n_H,1.

So, substituting into the above:

n_Si,1 / [ (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) × n_H,1 ] = (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

Multiply both sides by n_Fe,sun × n_H,sun × n_H,1^{-1}:

n_Si,1 × n_H,sun = (n_Si,sun × n_Fe,sun × 10^{0.3} ) × n_H,1 / n_Fe,sun.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange for n_Si,1 / n_H,1.

Wait, let me write:

n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = (n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) × (n_H,1 / n_Fe,1 ) × (n_Fe,sun / n_Si,sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Let me think differently.

We can express [Si/H]_1 as:

[Si/H]_1 = log10( n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) - log10( n_Si,sun / n_H,sun )

= log10( (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) / (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun) ) + log10( n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 ) - log10( n_Si,sun / n_H,sun )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the given ratios.

Let me think: [Fe/H] is 0, so n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun. Let me denote that as Fe_ratio = n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = Fe_ratio_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 ) = (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

So, n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 × (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

But since n_Fe,1 = Fe_ratio_sun × n_H,1, we can substitute:

n_Si,1 = (Fe_ratio_sun × n_H,1 ) × (n_Si,sun / Fe_ratio_sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

Simplify that:

Fe_ratio_sun cancels out, so:

n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun ) × n_H,1 × 10^{0.3}.

Now, [Si/H]_1 is log10( n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) - [Si/H]_sun.

Which is log10( (n_Si,sun ×10^{0.3} ) ) - [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, because n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = n_Si,sun ×10^{0.3}.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10( n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) - log10(n_Si,sun /n_H,sun )

= log10( (n_Si,sun ×10^{0.3} ) / (n_H,1 / n_H,sun ) × n_H,sun ) ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, since n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = n_Si,sun ×10^{0.3} × (n_H,sun / n_H,1) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to express [Si/H]_1.

From n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun ) × n_H,1 ×10^{0.3}.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from earlier:

n_Si,1 = n_Si,sun * 10^{0.3} * (n_H,1 / n_H,sun ) ) ?

Wait, let me think again.

We have:

n_Si,1 = (n_Fe,1) * (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

And n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,1.

So substituting:

n_Si,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,1 * (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

The n_Fe,sun cancels:

n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun ) / n_H,sun * n_H,1 * 10^{0.3}.

So,

n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = (n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

So,

log10( n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) = log10( n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) + 0.3.

Which means [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Because [Si/H] is defined as log10(n_Si/n_H) - log10(n_Si,sun/n_H,sun).

So for Star_1, [Si/H] is 0.3.

Wait, that's a nice result. So Star_1's silicon is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

Now, let's move to Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → n_Mg,2 / n_H,2 = n_Mg,sun / n_H,sun.

And [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10( n_Mg,2 / n_Si,2 ) - log10( n_Mg,sun / n_Si,sun ) = 0.3.

This implies that:

n_Mg,2 / n_Si,2 = (n_Mg,sun / n_Si,sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

But since n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,2.

Substituting into the above:

( (n_Mg,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,2 ) / n_Si,2 = (n_Mg,sun / n_Si,sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

Rearranging:

n_Si,2 = (n_Mg,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,2 * (n_Si,sun / n_Mg,sun ) ) / (10^{0.3} )

Simplify:

n_Si,2 = (n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,2 / 10^{0.3}.

So,

n_Si,2 / n_H,2 = (n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) / 10^{0.3}.

Taking log10,

log10( n_Si,2 / n_H,2 ) = log10( n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) - 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = log10( n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) - log10( n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ) → ?

Wait, [Si/H]_2 = log10(n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) - log10( n_Si,sun /n_H,sun )

= [ log10(n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) -0.3 ] - log10( n_Si,sun /n_H,sun )

= -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So, Star_1 has [Si/H] = 0.3 and Star_2 has [Si/H] = -0.3.

Now, the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2.

That is, (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 ) = ?

We can express this as ( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ) in log.

Wait, actually:

n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) × (n_H,2 / n_H,1 )

Wait, but I don't know n_H,1 or n_H,2. Oh, but maybe they cancel out when taking the ratio of the two stars.

Wait, let me think. The ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 ) = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2 / n_Si,2 )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think in terms of [Si/H].

We have [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) × 10^{-0.3}.

So,

(n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = ( (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) × 10^{0.3} × n_H,1 ) ) / ( (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) × 10^{-0.3} × n_H,2 ) )

Wait, that's because n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{0.3} × n_H,1.

Similarly, n_Si,2 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2.

So, (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = [10^{0.3} × n_H,1 ] / [10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2 ] × (n_Sun terms cancel).

Which simplifies to 10^{0.6} × (n_H,1 /n_H,2 ).

But wait, I don't know n_H,1 or n_H,2. Hmm. So perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of n_Si,1/n_Si,2 is 10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }.

Wait, because each [Si/H] is the log of (n_Si/n_H) relative to the Sun.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si,1/n_H,1) - log10(n_Si,sun/n_H,sun).

Similarly for [Si/H]_2.

So, the ratio of n_Si,1/n_Si,2 is (n_Si,1/n_H,1) / (n_Si,2/n_H,2) ) × (n_H,2 / n_H,1 ).

Wait, because (n_Si,1/n_Si,2) = (n_Si,1/n_H,1) × n_H,1 / (n_Si,2/n_H,2 × n_H,2 ) )

= [ (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2/n_H,2 ) ] × (n_H,1 / n_H,2 )

But I don't know about n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of [Si/H] for each star.

Since [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2 =-0.3, then the ratio of their [Si/H] is 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6.

So, the ratio (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = 10^{0.6}.

Wait, let me think again. Because [Si/H] = log10(n_Si/n_H) - log10(n_Si,sun/n_H,sun).

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun) )

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si,2 / n_H,2 ) / (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun) )

So, the difference [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 )/(n_Si,sun /n_H,sun) ) - log10( (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 )/(n_Si,sun /n_H,sun) )

Which simplifies to log10( (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 )/(n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) [since the (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun) terms cancel in the ratio]

So,

[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si,1/(n_H,1) ) / (n_Si,2/(n_H,2) ) )

Which is log10( (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) * (n_H,2 /n_H,1 ) )

But without knowing the ratio of n_H,2 to n_H,1, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the ratio of n_Si,1 to n_Si,2.

We have:

n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{0.3} ×n_H,1.

n_Si,2 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 = [10^{0.3} ×n_H,1 ] / [10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2 ] × (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun )^{-1} × (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun )

Wait, no, the (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) terms cancel.

So, n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = 10^{0.6} × (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

But I don't have the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2.

Hmm, but wait, maybe both stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), and if they have different masses but same [Fe/H], but wait, the problem says to assume LTE.

Wait, but the masses are given, but I don't think they directly affect the ratio because LTE implies that the ionization states are determined by temperature and density, but not the overall abundance ratios.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogen density is the same for both stars? No, that's not necessarily the case. Each star can have a different number of hydrogen atoms.

Hmm. Maybe the assumption is that both stars have the same total number of particles, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2 can be found from the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values.

Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, so n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun /n_H,sun ) ×n_H,1.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg,sun /n_H,sun ) ×n_H,2.

But I don't see an immediate way to find n_H,1 or n_H,2.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the ratio of the two stars' Si.

Since n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 } × (n_H,2 / n_H,1 )

But I don't know n_H,2 /n_H,1. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So, n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 is the ratio.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the [Si/H] values without considering the overall hydrogen density. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. Since [Si/H]_1 =0.3, which is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun. [Si/H]_2 is 0.3 lower.

So, Log(n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) = [Si/H]_sun + 0.3.

Log(n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) = [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

So, the ratio of (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) =10^{0.6}.

Which is 10^(0.6) ≈3.98, approximately 4. So, n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = 3.98.

But wait, that's only if the terms involving n_H,1 and n_H,2 cancel out.

Wait, considering (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) = 10^{0.6}.

Which is the same as (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) × (n_H,2 /n_H,1 ) ) = 10^{0.6}.

But without knowing (n_H,2 /n_H,1 ), I can't find (n_Si,1/n_Si,2).

Wait, but maybe I can express n_H,1 and n_H,2 in terms of Fe and Mg abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of atoms is the same for both stars. But that’s not stated.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The options are given, so maybe the ratio is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A (~3.9).

But wait, I thought earlier that [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3, so the difference is 0.6, which is log(3.98), so the ratio is ~4. So, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident because I didn't account for the ratio of n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait another thought: when [Fe/H] is zero, that means the ratio of Fe to H is the same as the Sun. So, n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun/n_H,sun) *n_H,1.

Similarly, n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg,sun/n_H,sun)*n_H,2.

But how does this tie into the n_Si?

Wait, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be found via another abundance.

Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, so n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun /n_H,sun ) *n_H,1.

But I don't know about n_Fe,2, because in Star_2, [Mg/H]=0, but [Fe/H] is not given.

Wait, perhaps I can get the ratio of n_H,1/n_H,2 from another abundance.

Wait, let's think about the Sun's values. The Sun's n_Fe/n_H is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=10^-4.5.

Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5), since 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5.

So,

n_Fe,sun = 10^-4.5 *n_H,sun.

n_Mg,sun = 10^-5 *n_H,sun.

Now, for Star_1:

n_Fe,1 = n_Fe,sun * (n_H,1 /n_H,sun )

= 10^-4.5 *n_H,sun * (n_H,1/n_H,sun ) )

= 10^-4.5 *n_H,1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Mg,2 = n_Mg,sun * (n_H,2/n_H,sun )

= 10^-5 *n_H,sun *n_H,2/n_H,sun )

= 10^-5 *n_H,2.

But I don't see how that helps with finding n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2 using another relation.

Wait, perhaps the number of particles in each star is the same as the Sun's? Not necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not needed because the ratio of n_Si,1 and n_Si,2 is independent of n_H,1 and n_H,2. Wait, earlier I thought that (n_Si,1/n_Si,2 ) =10^{0.6} × (n_H,2 /n_H,1 ). But without knowing n_H,2/n_H,1, I can't compute. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be found from the Mg/Si ratio? Let's see.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

Wait, [Mg/Si] = log10(n_Mg/n_Si) - log10(n_Mg,sun /n_Si,sun ) =0.3.

So,

n_Mg,2 /n_Si,2 = (n_Mg,sun /n_Si,sun ) *10^{0.3}.

But n_Mg,2 =10^-5 *n_H,2.

n_Si,2= (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) *10^{-0.3} *n_H,2.

So,

n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 = (10^-5 n_H,2 ) / [ (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) *10^{-0.3} *n_H,2 ) ]

= [10^-5 / (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) *10^{-0.3} ) ]

n_Si,sun /n_H,sun is (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) =10^{ [Si/H]_sun }.

Wait, [Si/H]_sun is 0, because the Sun's [Si/H] is 0, right?

Wait, no. Because [Si/H] is defined relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [Si/H]_sun =0.

So, n_Si,sun/n_H,sun =10^{0} =1.

Wait, but wait the problem states the Sun's composition as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → which is log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12=-4.5 →nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 →nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, for the Sun,

n_Fe =1e-4.5 *n_H,

n_Mg =1e-5 *n_H,

n_Si= ?

Wait, but the Sun's n_Si is not given directly. Hmm.

Wait, but for the Sun, [Si/Fe] is not given. So perhaps looking for another relation.

Wait, perhaps the composition in Star_2 can help us find the ratio of n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here, maybe I should make an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of n_Si,1 to n_Si,2 is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So, since their [Si/H] is 0.3 and -0.3 respectively, the ratio would be (n_Si,1/(n_Si,2)) =10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So the answer would be ~3.9, which is option A.

But wait, earlier I was concerned about the H ratio, but perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering it. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H cancels out.

Wait, let me think again.

n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{0.3} ×n_H,1.

n_Si,2 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = [10^{0.3} ×n_H,1 ] / [10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2 ].

=10^{0.6} × (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

But without knowing (n_H,1 /n_H,2 ), I can't find the ratio.

Hmm. This suggests that I might have made a wrong approach earlier.

Wait, perhaps I've missed that [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0 can help find the ratio of H in the two stars.

Wait, let's think about the number of hydrogen atoms in each star.

In Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun /n_H,sun ) ×n_H,1 → n_Fe,1 = (1e-4.5 ) *n_H,1.

In Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0 → n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg,sun /n_H,sun ) ×n_H,2 → n_Mg,2 = (1e-5 ) ×n_H,2.

But without another equation, I can't find n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to be solved ignoring the H ratio, but that seems incorrect.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen densities are the same in both stars. But that's not stated.

Wait, maybe the problem is setup so that the H doesn't affect the ratio of Si. Because [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] are given, and [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, so perhaps the H cancels out.

Wait, another approach: Let's express the ratio of Si in each star relative to H, and then take the ratio of those.

So,

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → n_Si,1 =n_Si,sun ×10^{0.3} × (n_H,1 /n_H,sun )

For Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → n_Si,2 =n_Si,sun ×10^{-0.3} × (n_H,2 /n_H,sun )

So the ratio n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = (10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}) × (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

=10^{0.6} × (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

But unless I can find (n_H,1/n_H,2 ), I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the H ratio is the same as the Sun, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the H ratio is determined by another abundance. For example, since Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, n_Fe,1 = (Fe_ratio_sun) * n_H,1.

But without any other data, I can't find n_H,1 or n_H,2.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98 ≈4, which is option A.

But I'm not entirely confident because I don't know the H ratio.

Hmm, but the problem gives [Mg/Si]2=0.3 and [Mg/H]2=0, which gives us [Si/H]2=-0.3 as I calculated earlier.

So, perhaps the problem is intended to have n_Si,1/n_Si,2 =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the correct answer would be option A: ~3.9.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
   - [Fe/H] = 0 implies that the Fe/H ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.
   - Using [Si/Fe] = log₁₀(n_Si/n_Fe) - log₁₀(n_Si,☉/n_Fe,☉), we find that [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - [Mg/H] = 0 implies that the Mg/H ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.
   - Using [Mg/Si] = log₁₀(n_Mg/n_Si) - log₁₀(n_Mg,☉/n_Si,☉), we find that [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 dex.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{\, [\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{\, 0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}
\]

Approximating:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

So, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me parse the given data. Both stars have masses more than the Sun, but I don't think the mass directly affects the elemental ratios. The problem is about their photospheric compositions, so I can focus on the abundance data.

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Also, the Sun's photospheric composition is provided:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5
Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but how does [X/Y] notation work? I think [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, actually, the logarithm is base 10, and [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_H) / (n_X_sun / n_H_sun) )? Or wait, maybe it's [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X_sun / n_Y_sun). Yes, that's right. So, if [X/Y] is 0, their ratio is the same as the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. So the Fe/H ratio in Star_1 is the same as the Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H] = 0, so their Mg/H is the same as the Sun.

Wait, but what do they mean by [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3? That means that [Si/Fe] in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun. So the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than the Sun's.

Let me think about how to find the ratio of silicon in each star relative to the Sun, then compare them.

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we need (n_Si, Star_1) / (n_Si, Star_2).

Hmm. To find that, maybe I can express each star's silicon abundance relative to the Sun, then take the ratio.

But wait, how? Because the abundance ratios are given in terms of [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], but I need to connect that to [Si/H] perhaps.

Wait, here's the plan:

For each star, express [Si/H] in terms of their given [X/Y] values and the Sun's composition.

Once I have [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, I can find the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) = 10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }.

Because [X/H] = log10(n_X / n_H) - log10(n_X_sun / n_H_sun). So [X/H] = log10( (n_X / n_H) / (n_X_sun / n_H_sun) ) → 10^{[X/H]} = (n_X / n_H) / (n_X_sun / n_H_sun) → (n_X / n_H) = 10^{[X/H]} * (n_X_sun / n_H_sun).

Wait, but the problem is that I don't have [Si/H] for the stars. So I have to compute [Si/H] based on the given ratios.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe/H is same as Sun. So n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log10( (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) ) - log10( n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) ) = 0.3.

Let me write that as log10( (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) ) = log10( (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun) ) + 0.3 → (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) = (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun) * 10^{0.3}.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, n_Fe,1 = n_Fe,sun * (n_H,1 / n_H,sun) ?

Wait, no. Wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log10(n_Fe / n_H) - log10(n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) = 0. So n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun.

Similarly, n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) * n_H,1.

But I don't know n_H,1 or n_H,2. But maybe I can express the ratios in terms of the Sun's values.

Wait, perhaps I can express [Si/H] for Star_1 in terms of [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

Because [Fe/H] is 0, so [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun.

So [Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si,1 / n_H,1) - log10(n_Si,sun / n_H,sun).

But from [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, which is log10( (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) ) - log10( n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) ) = 0.3.

But since n_Fe,1 = n_Fe,sun * n_H,1 / n_H,sun, because n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun → n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) * n_H,1.

So n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 = (n_Si,1) / ( (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) * n_H,1 ) ) = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) * (n_H,sun / n_Fe,sun )

From [Si/Fe], this equals (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun) ) * 10^{0.3}.

Wait, let me redo this.

We have:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10( n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 ) = log10( n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) + 0.3.

So n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 = (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun) ) × 10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) ) × n_H,1.

So, substituting into the above:

n_Si,1 / [ (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun) × n_H,1 ] = (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

Multiply both sides by n_Fe,sun × n_H,sun × n_H,1^{-1}:

n_Si,1 × n_H,sun = (n_Si,sun × n_Fe,sun × 10^{0.3} ) × n_H,1 / n_Fe,sun.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange for n_Si,1 / n_H,1.

Wait, let me write:

n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = (n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) × (n_H,1 / n_Fe,1 ) × (n_Fe,sun / n_Si,sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Let me think differently.

We can express [Si/H]_1 as:

[Si/H]_1 = log10( n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) - log10( n_Si,sun / n_H,sun )

= log10( (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1) / (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun) ) + log10( n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 ) - log10( n_Si,sun / n_H,sun )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the given ratios.

Let me think: [Fe/H] is 0, so n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun. Let me denote that as Fe_ratio = n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = Fe_ratio_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 ) = (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

So, n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 × (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

But since n_Fe,1 = Fe_ratio_sun × n_H,1, we can substitute:

n_Si,1 = (Fe_ratio_sun × n_H,1 ) × (n_Si,sun / Fe_ratio_sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

Simplify that:

Fe_ratio_sun cancels out, so:

n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun ) × n_H,1 × 10^{0.3}.

Now, [Si/H]_1 is log10( n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) - [Si/H]_sun.

Which is log10( (n_Si,sun ×10^{0.3} ) ) - [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, because n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = n_Si,sun ×10^{0.3}.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10( n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) - log10(n_Si,sun /n_H,sun )

= log10( (n_Si,sun ×10^{0.3} ) / (n_H,1 / n_H,sun ) × n_H,sun ) ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, since n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = n_Si,sun ×10^{0.3} × (n_H,sun / n_H,1) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to express [Si/H]_1.

From n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun ) × n_H,1 ×10^{0.3}.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from earlier:

n_Si,1 = n_Si,sun * 10^{0.3} * (n_H,1 / n_H,sun ) ) ?

Wait, let me think again.

We have:

n_Si,1 = (n_Fe,1) * (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

And n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,1.

So substituting:

n_Si,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,1 * (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

The n_Fe,sun cancels:

n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun ) / n_H,sun * n_H,1 * 10^{0.3}.

So,

n_Si,1 / n_H,1 = (n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

So,

log10( n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) = log10( n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) + 0.3.

Which means [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Because [Si/H] is defined as log10(n_Si/n_H) - log10(n_Si,sun/n_H,sun).

So for Star_1, [Si/H] is 0.3.

Wait, that's a nice result. So Star_1's silicon is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.

Now, let's move to Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0.

So, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → n_Mg,2 / n_H,2 = n_Mg,sun / n_H,sun.

And [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log10( n_Mg,2 / n_Si,2 ) - log10( n_Mg,sun / n_Si,sun ) = 0.3.

This implies that:

n_Mg,2 / n_Si,2 = (n_Mg,sun / n_Si,sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

But since n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,2.

Substituting into the above:

( (n_Mg,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,2 ) / n_Si,2 = (n_Mg,sun / n_Si,sun ) * 10^{0.3}.

Rearranging:

n_Si,2 = (n_Mg,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,2 * (n_Si,sun / n_Mg,sun ) ) / (10^{0.3} )

Simplify:

n_Si,2 = (n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,2 / 10^{0.3}.

So,

n_Si,2 / n_H,2 = (n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) / 10^{0.3}.

Taking log10,

log10( n_Si,2 / n_H,2 ) = log10( n_Si,sun / n_H,sun ) - 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = log10( n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) - log10( n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ) → ?

Wait, [Si/H]_2 = log10(n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) - log10( n_Si,sun /n_H,sun )

= [ log10(n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) -0.3 ] - log10( n_Si,sun /n_H,sun )

= -0.3.

So [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

So, Star_1 has [Si/H] = 0.3 and Star_2 has [Si/H] = -0.3.

Now, the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2.

That is, (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 ) = ?

We can express this as ( [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 ) in log.

Wait, actually:

n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) × (n_H,2 / n_H,1 )

Wait, but I don't know n_H,1 or n_H,2. Oh, but maybe they cancel out when taking the ratio of the two stars.

Wait, let me think. The ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 ) = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) * (n_H,2 / n_Si,2 )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think in terms of [Si/H].

We have [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) × 10^{0.3}.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 → (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) × 10^{-0.3}.

So,

(n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = ( (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) × 10^{0.3} × n_H,1 ) ) / ( (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) × 10^{-0.3} × n_H,2 ) )

Wait, that's because n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{0.3} × n_H,1.

Similarly, n_Si,2 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2.

So, (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = [10^{0.3} × n_H,1 ] / [10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2 ] × (n_Sun terms cancel).

Which simplifies to 10^{0.6} × (n_H,1 /n_H,2 ).

But wait, I don't know n_H,1 or n_H,2. Hmm. So perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of n_Si,1/n_Si,2 is 10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }.

Wait, because each [Si/H] is the log of (n_Si/n_H) relative to the Sun.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si,1/n_H,1) - log10(n_Si,sun/n_H,sun).

Similarly for [Si/H]_2.

So, the ratio of n_Si,1/n_Si,2 is (n_Si,1/n_H,1) / (n_Si,2/n_H,2) ) × (n_H,2 / n_H,1 ).

Wait, because (n_Si,1/n_Si,2) = (n_Si,1/n_H,1) × n_H,1 / (n_Si,2/n_H,2 × n_H,2 ) )

= [ (n_Si,1/n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2/n_H,2 ) ] × (n_H,1 / n_H,2 )

But I don't know about n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio of [Si/H] for each star.

Since [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2 =-0.3, then the ratio of their [Si/H] is 0.3 - (-0.3) = 0.6.

So, the ratio (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) = 10^{0.6}.

Wait, let me think again. Because [Si/H] = log10(n_Si/n_H) - log10(n_Si,sun/n_H,sun).

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10( (n_Si,1 / n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun) )

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si,2 / n_H,2 ) / (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun) )

So, the difference [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 )/(n_Si,sun /n_H,sun) ) - log10( (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 )/(n_Si,sun /n_H,sun) )

Which simplifies to log10( (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 )/(n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) [since the (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun) terms cancel in the ratio]

So,

[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log10( (n_Si,1/(n_H,1) ) / (n_Si,2/(n_H,2) ) )

Which is log10( (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) * (n_H,2 /n_H,1 ) )

But without knowing the ratio of n_H,2 to n_H,1, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the ratio of n_Si,1 to n_Si,2.

We have:

n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{0.3} ×n_H,1.

n_Si,2 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 = [10^{0.3} ×n_H,1 ] / [10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2 ] × (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun )^{-1} × (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun )

Wait, no, the (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) terms cancel.

So, n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = 10^{0.6} × (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

But I don't have the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2.

Hmm, but wait, maybe both stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), and if they have different masses but same [Fe/H], but wait, the problem says to assume LTE.

Wait, but the masses are given, but I don't think they directly affect the ratio because LTE implies that the ionization states are determined by temperature and density, but not the overall abundance ratios.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogen density is the same for both stars? No, that's not necessarily the case. Each star can have a different number of hydrogen atoms.

Hmm. Maybe the assumption is that both stars have the same total number of particles, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2 can be found from the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] values.

Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, so n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun /n_H,sun ) ×n_H,1.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg,sun /n_H,sun ) ×n_H,2.

But I don't see an immediate way to find n_H,1 or n_H,2.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the ratio of the two stars' Si.

Since n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 } × (n_H,2 / n_H,1 )

But I don't know n_H,2 /n_H,1. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So, n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 is the ratio.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the [Si/H] values without considering the overall hydrogen density. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think differently. Since [Si/H]_1 =0.3, which is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun. [Si/H]_2 is 0.3 lower.

So, Log(n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) = [Si/H]_sun + 0.3.

Log(n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) = [Si/H]_sun -0.3.

So, the ratio of (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) =10^{0.6}.

Which is 10^(0.6) ≈3.98, approximately 4. So, n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = 3.98.

But wait, that's only if the terms involving n_H,1 and n_H,2 cancel out.

Wait, considering (n_Si,1 /n_H,1 ) / (n_Si,2 /n_H,2 ) ) = 10^{0.6}.

Which is the same as (n_Si,1 /n_Si,2 ) × (n_H,2 /n_H,1 ) ) = 10^{0.6}.

But without knowing (n_H,2 /n_H,1 ), I can't find (n_Si,1/n_Si,2).

Wait, but maybe I can express n_H,1 and n_H,2 in terms of Fe and Mg abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the total number of atoms is the same for both stars. But that’s not stated.

Wait, another angle: perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The options are given, so maybe the ratio is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A (~3.9).

But wait, I thought earlier that [Si/H]_1 is 0.3 and [Si/H]_2 is -0.3, so the difference is 0.6, which is log(3.98), so the ratio is ~4. So, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident because I didn't account for the ratio of n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait another thought: when [Fe/H] is zero, that means the ratio of Fe to H is the same as the Sun. So, n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun/n_H,sun) *n_H,1.

Similarly, n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg,sun/n_H,sun)*n_H,2.

But how does this tie into the n_Si?

Wait, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be found via another abundance.

Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, so n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun /n_H,sun ) *n_H,1.

But I don't know about n_Fe,2, because in Star_2, [Mg/H]=0, but [Fe/H] is not given.

Wait, perhaps I can get the ratio of n_H,1/n_H,2 from another abundance.

Wait, let's think about the Sun's values. The Sun's n_Fe/n_H is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=10^-4.5.

Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5), since 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5.

So,

n_Fe,sun = 10^-4.5 *n_H,sun.

n_Mg,sun = 10^-5 *n_H,sun.

Now, for Star_1:

n_Fe,1 = n_Fe,sun * (n_H,1 /n_H,sun )

= 10^-4.5 *n_H,sun * (n_H,1/n_H,sun ) )

= 10^-4.5 *n_H,1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Mg,2 = n_Mg,sun * (n_H,2/n_H,sun )

= 10^-5 *n_H,sun *n_H,2/n_H,sun )

= 10^-5 *n_H,2.

But I don't see how that helps with finding n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio of n_H,1 to n_H,2 using another relation.

Wait, perhaps the number of particles in each star is the same as the Sun's? Not necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps it's not needed because the ratio of n_Si,1 and n_Si,2 is independent of n_H,1 and n_H,2. Wait, earlier I thought that (n_Si,1/n_Si,2 ) =10^{0.6} × (n_H,2 /n_H,1 ). But without knowing n_H,2/n_H,1, I can't compute. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars can be found from the Mg/Si ratio? Let's see.

Wait, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3.

Wait, [Mg/Si] = log10(n_Mg/n_Si) - log10(n_Mg,sun /n_Si,sun ) =0.3.

So,

n_Mg,2 /n_Si,2 = (n_Mg,sun /n_Si,sun ) *10^{0.3}.

But n_Mg,2 =10^-5 *n_H,2.

n_Si,2= (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) *10^{-0.3} *n_H,2.

So,

n_Mg,2/n_Si,2 = (10^-5 n_H,2 ) / [ (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) *10^{-0.3} *n_H,2 ) ]

= [10^-5 / (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) *10^{-0.3} ) ]

n_Si,sun /n_H,sun is (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) =10^{ [Si/H]_sun }.

Wait, [Si/H]_sun is 0, because the Sun's [Si/H] is 0, right?

Wait, no. Because [Si/H] is defined relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [Si/H]_sun =0.

So, n_Si,sun/n_H,sun =10^{0} =1.

Wait, but wait the problem states the Sun's composition as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → which is log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12=-4.5 →nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 →nMg/nH=1e-5.

So, for the Sun,

n_Fe =1e-4.5 *n_H,

n_Mg =1e-5 *n_H,

n_Si= ?

Wait, but the Sun's n_Si is not given directly. Hmm.

Wait, but for the Sun, [Si/Fe] is not given. So perhaps looking for another relation.

Wait, perhaps the composition in Star_2 can help us find the ratio of n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here, maybe I should make an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of n_Si,1 to n_Si,2 is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98, which is option A.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. So, since their [Si/H] is 0.3 and -0.3 respectively, the ratio would be (n_Si,1/(n_Si,2)) =10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} =10^0.6 ≈3.98.

So the answer would be ~3.9, which is option A.

But wait, earlier I was concerned about the H ratio, but perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering it. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H cancels out.

Wait, let me think again.

n_Si,1 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{0.3} ×n_H,1.

n_Si,2 = (n_Si,sun /n_H,sun ) ×10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2.

So,

n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = [10^{0.3} ×n_H,1 ] / [10^{-0.3} ×n_H,2 ].

=10^{0.6} × (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

But without knowing (n_H,1 /n_H,2 ), I can't find the ratio.

Hmm. This suggests that I might have made a wrong approach earlier.

Wait, perhaps I've missed that [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0 can help find the ratio of H in the two stars.

Wait, let's think about the number of hydrogen atoms in each star.

In Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun /n_H,sun ) ×n_H,1 → n_Fe,1 = (1e-4.5 ) *n_H,1.

In Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0 → n_Mg,2 = (n_Mg,sun /n_H,sun ) ×n_H,2 → n_Mg,2 = (1e-5 ) ×n_H,2.

But without another equation, I can't find n_H,1 and n_H,2.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to be solved ignoring the H ratio, but that seems incorrect.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hydrogen densities are the same in both stars. But that's not stated.

Wait, maybe the problem is setup so that the H doesn't affect the ratio of Si. Because [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] are given, and [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, so perhaps the H cancels out.

Wait, another approach: Let's express the ratio of Si in each star relative to H, and then take the ratio of those.

So,

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → n_Si,1 =n_Si,sun ×10^{0.3} × (n_H,1 /n_H,sun )

For Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → n_Si,2 =n_Si,sun ×10^{-0.3} × (n_H,2 /n_H,sun )

So the ratio n_Si,1/n_Si,2 = (10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}) × (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

=10^{0.6} × (n_H,1 /n_H,2 )

But unless I can find (n_H,1/n_H,2 ), I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the H ratio is the same as the Sun, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the H ratio is determined by another abundance. For example, since Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, n_Fe,1 = (Fe_ratio_sun) * n_H,1.

But without any other data, I can't find n_H,1 or n_H,2.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 10^{0.6} ≈3.98 ≈4, which is option A.

But I'm not entirely confident because I don't know the H ratio.

Hmm, but the problem gives [Mg/Si]2=0.3 and [Mg/H]2=0, which gives us [Si/H]2=-0.3 as I calculated earlier.

So, perhaps the problem is intended to have n_Si,1/n_Si,2 =10^{0.6} ≈3.98.

So the correct answer would be option A: ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
   - [Fe/H] = 0 implies that the Fe/H ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.
   - Using [Si/Fe] = log₁₀(n_Si/n_Fe) - log₁₀(n_Si,☉/n_Fe,☉), we find that [Si/H]_1 = 0.3 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - [Mg/H] = 0 implies that the Mg/H ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.
   - Using [Mg/Si] = log₁₀(n_Mg/n_Si) - log₁₀(n_Mg,☉/n_Si,☉), we find that [Si/H]_2 = -0.3 dex.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{\, [\text{Si/H}]_1 - [\text{Si/H}]_2}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{\, 0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6}
\]

Approximating:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
