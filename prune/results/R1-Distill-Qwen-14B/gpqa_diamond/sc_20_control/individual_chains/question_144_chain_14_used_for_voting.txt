Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they decay, their mean decay distance depends on certain factors like their energy, mass, and width. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question gives me E_X as 8 GeV, m_X as 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. Wait, how is decay distance calculated? I think it has something to do with the particles' lifetime and their velocity.

Oh right, the mean decay distance (L) is given by L = v * τ, where v is the particle's velocity and τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, τ is related to the width Γ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, I should get the units right. ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, no, wait: 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. Let me think about the units for Γ. Γ is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. Let me plug in the numbers. ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s. Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Hmm, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, I need to find the velocity v. Since the particle is a meson, probably moving relativistically, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is given, and the mass m is given. The formula for the velocity is v = c * sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)), where c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So m²/E² = (1.2)^2 / 8^2 = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775). Let me approximate that. I know that sqrt(0.99) is about 0.995, sqrt(0.96) is 0.98. Hmm, 0.9775 is closer to 0.98, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's see, 0.9775. Maybe around 0.9887? Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute it.

Wait, sqrt(0.9775) = let's think, 0.9887. Because (0.9887)^2 = let's see: 0.98^2 is 0.9604, 0.9887^2 is about (0.98 + 0.0087)^2. Let me calculate: (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². 0.98² = 0.9604. 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 ≈ 0.0172. 0.0087² ≈ 0.000075. So 0.9604 + 0.0172 = 0.9776, plus 0.000075 gives about 0.977675. So yes, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v is approximately 0.9887 * c. Since c is 3e8 m/s, v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the mean lifetime τ is about 2.056875e-24 seconds. So the decay distance is L = v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s. Let's compute that. Multiply 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24. Let's see:

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e(8-24) = (approx 6.112) * 1e-16 meters. Wait, let me calculate 2.966 * 2.056875. Let me compute 2.966 * 2 =5.932, 2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1686. So total is around 5.932 + 0.1686 ≈ 6.1006. So 6.1006e-16 meters.

Wait, but none of the options are around 6e-16 m. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, none of these are 6e-16. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me recheck each step.

First, calculation of τ. ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems correct.

Next, velocity calculation. E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. E is the total energy, but in natural units, where c=1, E (in GeV) is the same as GeV/c² multiplied by c². So E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So, actually, when we have E in GeV and m in GeV/c², it's better to express in terms of E and m, and c is 1 in these units. So, v = sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)) * c.

So m² is (1.2)^2 =1.44, E² is 64. So 1.44/64=0.0225. 1-0.0225=0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.9887. So v=0.9887 c. So that part is correct.

So v= ~2.966e8 m/s.

Then, L= v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875 )e(8-24) = approx 6.1006e-16 m.

But the options are around 4e-15 or 5e-15, or 4e-16, 5e-16. Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L. Let me re-express the numbers accurately.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated v. Let me compute v more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more precisely.

Wait, 0.9887^2 is 0.97750... so that's correct. So v is indeed approximately 0.9887 c.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product. Let me recompute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24. 2.966 * 2.056875 is equal to:

Let me compute 2.966 * 2 =5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 = ?

0.05 *2.966 = 0.1483.

0.006875 * 2.966 = approx 0.02036.

So 0.1483 +0.02036= 0.16866.

So total is 5.932 +0.16866=6.10066. So 6.10066e-16 m.

Hmm, none of the options are near 6e-16. Wait, but the options have A)5.02e-16 and D)4.06e-16. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in tau.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of tau. Tau is ħ divided by Gamma.

Wait, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, and Gamma is 0.32 GeV. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = let's compute this.

6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe I missed a factor of 1e3 somewhere? Because sometimes units can be tricky. Let me re-express all units correctly.

Wait, Gamma is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the mean decay distance is not L = v tau, but L = c tau multiplied by beta gamma? Wait, no, because tau is the proper lifetime, and the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

Wait, no, wait. The mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (which is tau). But when we compute L = v * t, t is the time in the lab frame, which is gamma * tau.

Wait, wait a minute. I think I made a mistake here. Because tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame), so in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor gamma. So earlier, I used v * tau, but that's incorrect because tau is the proper time. The lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau, so the mean distance would be L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, but wait, when we have L = v * gamma * tau, because the lifetime is longer in the lab frame.

Wait, let me clarify. The proper lifetime is tau. The lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. So the decay distance is L = v * (gamma tau).

But wait, v is beta c. So L = beta c * gamma tau.

And beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma.

Wait, but beta gamma is (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )^{1/2}/(m c^2) )= sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) * (E/(m c^2)).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express beta gamma as (E)/(m c^2) multiplied by sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, another approach: gamma = E/(m c^2) because E = gamma m c^2.

So gamma = E/(m c^2). But in our case, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so E/(m c^2) would be (GeV)/(GeV/c² * c²) )= unitless, so that's correct.

Wait, so gamma = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 6.666666... So gamma is 6.6667.

Wait, so beta is sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)) )^{1/2} = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So, beta gamma = beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

So, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So tau_lab = gamma * tau.

So, L = v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau.

Which is beta gamma c tau.

We can calculate beta gamma c tau.

beta gamma is 6.591, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = 6.591 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let's compute this:

6.591 *3e8 = 1.9773e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 1.9773e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9773 * 2.056875) * 1e(9-24) = 1.9773 * 2.056875 ≈ 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, that's approximately 4.0655e-15 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Wait, so I get 4.0655e-15 m, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought L was 6e-16 m, but I think I was wrong because I forgot to account for gamma in the lifetime.

So the correct approach is L = beta gamma c tau.

So beta gamma is ≈6.591, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So 6.591 *3e8 = 1.9773e9, multiplied by 2.056875e-24 gives:

1.9773e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9773 *2.056875 ) * 1e-15.

1.9773 *2.056875 ≈ let's compute this:

1.9773 * 2 = 3.9546.

1.9773 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1122.

Adding up, about 4.0668. So 4.0668e-15 m, which is approximately 4.0655e-15 m as per option B.

Wait, but wait, looking back, the calculation gave me 4.0655e-15 m. So the correct answer would be option B. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but I think I might have a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me recalculate the exponents:

beta gamma c tau = (6.591) * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

So, 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875 =6.170625; exponents 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

So 6.170625e-16 m/s * s? Wait, no: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by 6.591: 6.591 *6.170625e-16.

6 *6.170625 =37.02375, 0.591*6.170625≈3.654, total≈40.677e-16 m.

Wait, 6.591 *6.170625e-16 = let's compute 6.591 * 6.170625 = approx ?

Well, 6 *6=36, 6 *0.170625=1.02375, 0.591*6=3.546, 0.591 *0.170625≈0.1008.

Adding up: 36 +1.02375=37.02375, plus 3.546=40.56975, plus 0.1008=40.67055.

So 40.67055e-16 m, which is 4.067055e-15 m, which rounds to 4.067e-15 m.

So approximately 4.067e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) is the decay width,
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the energy of the particle,
- \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the mass of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} = 6.6667.
\]

The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The product \( \beta \gamma \) is:

\[
\beta \gamma = \beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.591.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau = 6.591 \cdot (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}).
\]

First, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Now, multiply by \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
L = 6.591 \cdot 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
