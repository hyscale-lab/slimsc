Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, that notation—probably a two-component spinor. So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. Right, because in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component vectors.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state vector. In this case, the operator is S_y, the spin along the y-axis.

Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are involved here. The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. And I recall that the spin operators S are related to the Pauli matrices by S = (ħ/2) σ. So S_y would be (ħ/2) times σ_y.

So the formula for the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is χ† * S_y * χ. Let me break this down.

First, let's write down S_y. It's (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ].

So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is χ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ.

Wait, χ is a column vector [3i, 4], right? So χ† is the conjugate transpose, which would be [3i*, 4*] as a row vector. Since 3i is 3i, its complex conjugate is -3i, and 4 is real, so it stays 4. So χ† = [-3i, 4].

So putting it all together: χ† S_y χ = [ -3i, 4 ] * S_y * [3i; 4].

Wait, but S_y is a matrix. Let me compute this step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as a matrix multiplication. Let me write it out.

First, compute S_y * χ.

S_y * χ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i; 4].

Let me compute each component:

First component: (0)*(3i) + (-i)*(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*3i = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So S_y * χ equals (ħ/2) * [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, χ† is [-3i, 4]. So I need to multiply this with the result just obtained.

So χ† * (S_y χ) = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i*(ħ/2) ; -3*(ħ/2) ]

Wait, no—actually, the matrix multiplication is: [a, b] * [ [c], [d] ] = a*c + b*d.

So let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) * (ħ/2) 

Wait, no: actually, the S_y χ is [ -4i, -3 ] multiplied by (ħ/2), so each component in the resulting vector is multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, perhaps a clearer way is to compute each part step by step.

Let me recompute S_y * χ without the (ħ/2) factor:

S_y (without the factor) is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So:

[0 * 3i + (-i) *4 ]   → 0 + (-4i) → -4i.

[ i *3i + 0 *4 ] → i*(3i) = 3i² = -3.

So S_y * χ (without factor) is [ -4i, -3 ].

Multiply by (ħ/2): so [ -4i*(ħ/2), -3*(ħ/2) ].

Now, multiply this by χ†, which is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the expectation value is:

(-3i) * (-4i*(ħ/2)) + 4 * (-3*(ħ/2)).

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) * (ħ/2) = (12 i²) * (ħ/2). Since i² is -1, 12*(-1) = -12. So this term is (-12) * (ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

Wait, wait a second, let me double-check:

-3i * (-4i) = 12 i². i squared is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12. So that's -12, multiplied by ħ/2: -12*(ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

Second term: 4 * (-3) * (ħ/2) = -12 * (ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

Wait, but wait, [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i (ħ/2), -3 (ħ/2) ].

So:

First component of the vector is -4i (ħ/2), so:

-3i * (-4i (ħ/2)) = ( -3i * -4i ) * (ħ/2) = (12 i²) * (ħ/2) = 12*(-1)*(ħ/2) = -6ħ.

Second component: 4 * (-3 (ħ/2)) = (4 * -3) * (ħ/2) = (-12) * (ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

Wait, that can't be right because the two terms are both -6 ħ, so adding them gives -12 ħ. But that doesn't match the answer options. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, no, wait a minute. Let me recalculate each term carefully.

First term: (-3i) multiplied by (-4i (ħ/2)).

So (-3i) * (-4i) = (12 i²) = 12*(-1) = -12. Multiply by (ħ/2): -12*(ħ/2)= -6 ħ.

Second term: 4 multiplied by (-3 (ħ/2)).

4 * (-3) = -12. Multiply by (ħ/2): (-12)*(ħ/2)= -6 ħ.

So total expectation value is (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options:

A) -12 hbar/25

B) 12 hbar/25

C) 25 hbar/2

D) -25 hbar/2

Hmm, so I'm getting -12 ħ, but the options don't have that. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me retrace.

Wait another approach: perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value without breaking it into steps.

The expectation value is χ† S_y χ.

Let me first compute χ† S_y χ = χ† ( (ħ/2) σ_y ) χ.

So that's (ħ/2) * χ† σ_y χ.

Let me compute σ_y χ first.

σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So σ_y χ is:

First component: 0 * 3i + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component: i*3i + 0*4 = 3i² = -3.

So σ_y χ = [ -4i, -3 ].

Now, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† σ_y χ is [ -3i, 4 ] [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, that's a dot product: (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Calculating each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² → 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Add them: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but this leads me to -12ħ, which isn't among the options. That's a problem because the options are fractions with 25 in the denominator or 2.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state vector. The problem states that the spin is (3i, 4). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. Let me check if this state is normalized.

The norm squared is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. So the state isn't normalized. Oh wait, right! So when calculating the expectation value, I need to normalize the state.

Wait, wait a second. The expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = (χ† S_y χ) / (χ† χ). Because the state might not be normalized.

Wait, no. Wait, normally, the expectation value is calculated as ψ† A ψ, but if the state is not normalized, you have to normalize it by dividing by ⟨ψ | ψ⟩.

Wait, but in our case, the state is given as (3i, 4), which is not normalized. Because its squared norm is 25, so the norm is 5. So perhaps I should have normalized the state before proceeding.

Oh! I think I made a mistake here. Let me redo the calculation with the normalized state.

So the correct expectation value formula is ⟨S_y⟩ = (χ† S_y χ) / (χ† χ).

So first, compute χ† χ, which is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 =25. So the normalization factor is 25.

Wait, no, wait. The state is χ, and the expectation value is (χ† S_y χ) / (χ† χ).

Wait, but in our previous calculation, the expectation value came out to be (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ. But the state's norm is 5, so the denominator would be 25.

Wait, wait, no. Because when you calculate χ† S_y χ, that's the numerator. The denominator is χ† χ, which is 25.

So the correct expectation value is (-24)(ħ/2) / 25.

Wait, so let's see:

The numerator is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

The denominator is 25.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (-12 ħ) / 25.

Which is option A: -12 hbar/25.

Ah, that makes sense. Because I forgot to normalize the state earlier.

So that's the correct answer.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( \langle S_y \rangle \), for the given spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Spin Operator**: The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \). The Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) is given as:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\chi^\dagger S_y \chi}{\chi^\dagger \chi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \chi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \chi \).

3. **Compute \( \sigma_y \chi \)**:
   \[
   \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi \)**:
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \sigma_y \chi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Breaking this into components:
   \[
   (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = (12i^2) + (-12) = 12(-1) + (-12) = -12 - 12 = -24.
   \]

5. **Normalize the Result**: The numerator is \( \chi^\dagger S_y \chi = \frac{\hbar}{2} \times (-24) = -12\hbar \). The denominator is the norm of \( \chi \):
   \[
   \chi^\dagger \chi = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final Answer**: Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \text{A) } -\frac{12\hbar}{25}.
   \]
