Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. 

Wait, the question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Right, so redshift determines how much the wavelength is stretched due to the expansion of the universe. If the object is moving away (or the universe is expanding so that it appears to move away), the wavelength increases.

Ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because our atmosphere absorbs it. So if the absorbed light is in the optical range, the redshift must have shifted the Lyman alpha line into the visible spectrum. Oh wait, because if the wavelength is beyond the UV, into optical, that means it's redshifted enough.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers, placing it in the far ultraviolet. So the quasar emits this light, and the hydrogen cloud absorbs it at that wavelength. But for us to see that absorption in optical light, the wavelength must be redshifted into the optical range.

What's the approximate range of optical wavelengths? I think optical is roughly 400-700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs must be greater than, say, 4000 Angstroms because anything below that is UV, which we can't observe from the ground.

So the formula for redshift is z = (lambda_obs / lambda_emit) - 1. Here, lambda_emit is 1216 Angstroms. We want lambda_obs to be at least 4000 Angstroms because that's the lower end of what optical telescopes can detect (since higher than that is visible, but anything lower is UV, which is absorbed by the atmosphere).

Wait no, actually, optical ground-based telescopes can detect up to maybe 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms. But the cutoff is lower for the atmosphere—like, the atmosphere is opaque below about 300 nm (UV). So to observe the absorption line in optical, the wavelength must be longer than what's blocked, so at least 300 nm (but wait, 300 is still UV... Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think.)

Wait, the atmosphere doesn't transmit much below about 300 nm, so ground-based telescopes can't see wavelengths below that. So if the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm), which is in the far UV, then for it to be observed in the optical (say, above 300 nm, but even that's not optical... Wait, optical is visible light, which is 400 nm and above. So to see the absorption line in the optical, the redshift must shift the wavelength to at least 400 nm.

So, z = (lambda_obs / 1216) - 1. Let's compute this for lambda_obs = 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). Because 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms.

So z = (4000 / 1216) - 1. Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216. What's 1216 times 3? 3648. 4000-3648=352. So 3.352 approximately. So 3.352 minus 1 is 2.352. So z is about 2.35.

Wait, but wait. Are we looking for the lower limit on redshift? So the smallest z where lambda_obs is just at the lower edge of optical. So if the observed wavelength is at 4000 Angstroms, that would be a z of about 2.35. So the redshift must be higher than that for the line to be in the optical.

Wait no, I think I messed up the numbers. Let me compute it correctly. 4000 divided by 1216 is approximately 3.29, right? Because 1216 * 3 = 3648, 1216*3.29 is 1216*(3 +0.29) = 3648 + 352.64 = 4000.64. So lambda_obs is 4000.64 Angstroms, so z would be about 3.29 -1 = 2.29. So z is approximately 2.29.

But the question is about the lower limit. So the minimum z at which the Lyman alpha line enters the optical. So if z is 2.3, then observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms (400 nm), which is the lower end of optical. If z is higher, the wavelength is longer (visible light). So the lower limit is z=2.3 or just above.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is a bit higher than 2.3. But wait, another thought: what if the telescope can detect a little into the near-UV? Oh, but the atmosphere doesn't transmit much below 300 nm. So even if the quasar's emission is in the UV, but the absorption is shifted into the optical.

Wait another thing: some ground-based telescopes have instruments that can go a bit into the near-UV, like 350 nm or so. So maybe the cutoff is higher. Let me think: if the observed wavelength needs to be at least 3100 Angstroms (310 nm), that's still UV, but perhaps some telescopes can observe that. But no, the question says 'optical' telescopes. Optical is 400 nm and above, so I think the cutoff is 400 nm.

Wait, perhaps the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra when the absorption is in the higher redshifts—so high that the absorption lines are in the visible. But the initial point is that if the cloud is at redshift z, the Lyman alpha is at 1216*(z+1) Angstroms. So for that to be in the optical (say, 4000 Angstroms), we have 1216*(z+1)= 4000. Solving for z: z+1 = 4000/1216 ≈3.29. So z≈2.29.

So the lower limit is when the observed wavelength is just in the optical, so z≈2.29. The options are:

A)3

B)1.2

C)2.4

D)1.9

So the closest option is C)2.4. But wait, 2.29 is just below 2.4. So why is the option C 2.4?

Alternatively, perhaps the observed wavelength needs to be longer than 4000 Angstroms, which would require z>2.29. So the lower limit is z>2.29, so the minimum redshift is just above 2.29, but the options don't have 2.3. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4 because the next higher option is 2.4, which would ensure that the observed wavelength is in the optical.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me recheck the math. 1216*(z+1) = observed wavelength.

If observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms, then z+1 = 4000/1216. Let's compute 4000 /1216.

Dividing 4000 by 1216: 1216 * 3 is 3648. 4000-3648=352. So 352/1216=0.289 approx. So 3.289. So z=2.289, approximately 2.29.

So the minimum z is about 2.29. So any cloud with z>2.29 would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical. So if the question asks for the lower limit, the minimum z where the line enters the optical would be about 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29. The question says "lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes," so the minimal z is just above 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)2.4. But wait, 2.4 is higher than 2.29, so the lower limit would be just above 2.29, but 2.4 is higher than that. So perhaps the question is asking for the minimal z such that the cloud is at a redshift where the line is definitely in the optical, so the minimal z is 2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the quasar's light must have the Lyman alpha line redshifted into the observed frame, and the observed frame must be within the optical. So the minimal z is when the Lyman alpha line is at the start of the optical range, which is about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

So, z= (4000/1216) - 1 = (3.29) -1=2.29. So, the minimal z is 2.29. So the options don't have 2.29, but option C is 2.4, which is higher. So why would the lower limit be 2.4?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me compute 4000 /1216 more accurately.

1216 *3 = 3648.

4000 -3648= 352.

352/1216 = 0.289 approx.

So total is 3.289 → z=2.289.

So approximately 2.29.

So the lower limit is around 2.29. So the minimal z is just above 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the correct answer should be 2.4 if we're taking the lower limit as the minimal z where the line is observed in optical.

Wait, but maybe there's a miscalculation here. Another approach: What if the quasar's emission is redshifted so that the Lyman alpha line is in the observed optical. So the quasar itself must have a redshift higher than the cloud's redshift, because the cloud is in front of the quasar, right? Or wait, no, the cloud is in front, so the quasar's light passes through the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is less than the quasar's redshift? Or wait, the cloud is at a redshift z_cloud, and the quasar is at a higher redshift, z_quasar.

Wait, but the question is about the cloud's redshift. The cloud would absorb the quasar's light. So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption is 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. But wait, the quasar itself is at a higher redshift, so the observed wavelength also depends on the quasar's redshift.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. When a quasar emits light, the light is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. Any intervening material (like the neutral hydrogen clouds) imprints absorption lines on that light. The absorption lines are also redshifted by the same factor as the quasar's emission. So, the quasar's emission is redshifted to the observed frame. The absorption occurs at the quasar's rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength, but in the observed frame, it's redshifted by the quasar's redshift.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me clarify. The quasar is at redshift z_quasar. The Lyman alpha emission from the quasar would be observed at (1216 Angstroms) * (1 + z_quasar). But in addition, any neutral hydrogen cloud between us and the quasar would have its own redshift, z_cloud, which is less than z_quasar. The cloud would absorb the quasar's light at the quasar's rest frame 1216 Angstroms, but in the cloud's frame, it's 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. No, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, the cloud is at redshift z_cloud. So the quasar's rest frame 1216 Angstroms would be observed by the cloud as 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. Wait, no: if the cloud is at z_cloud, the quasar's light is redshifted by z_quasar, so when the cloud absorbs, it's seeing the quasar's light at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_quasar_cloud), where z_quasar_cloud is the redshift relative to the cloud.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the observed frame. The quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1 + z_quasar). The hydrogen cloud, which is at a lower redshift (z_cloud < z_quasar), would absorb at a wavelength that is in the quasar's frame. So, in the quasar's frame, the Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms. But since the cloud is at a lower redshift, the cloud sees the quasar's light as redshifted. So in the cloud's frame, the quasar's Lyman alpha is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). 

Wait, no, the cloud's frame is moving away at z_cloud. From the cloud's perspective, the quasar's light is coming from a source moving away with z_quasar_cloud, which is z_quasar - z_cloud, assuming z_quasar > z_cloud.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's step back. The observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption is 1216*(1 + z_cloud) * (1 + z_quasar_cloud). Wait, no, I think that's not right because the cloud's absorption is in the quasar's frame. So the observed wavelength would be 1216*(1 + z_quasar). But the cloud's redshift affects the observed wavelength of the absorption line.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that the observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to (1 + z_quasar) * (1 + z_cloud) * lambda_rest. No, that can't be right because redshift is multiplicative along the line of sight. Hmm, actually, the redshift of the absorption line is determined by the cloud's redshift. Because the cloud is at z_cloud, the absorption occurs at a wavelength lambda_abs = 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. But this lambda_abs is in the frame of the cloud. However, when we observe it, the entire system (quasar and cloud) is at a higher redshift. So the observed wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_abs * (1 + z_quasar).

Wait, no. That's getting more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the Lyman alpha absorption line is observed at a wavelength lambda_obs = 1216*(1 + z_cloud) * (1 + z_quasar_cloud), but I'm not sure. Another approach: the quasar's light is emitted at 1216 Angstroms. The cloud is at a lower redshift, so in the cloud's frame, the quasar's light is redshifted. So the cloud's frame sees the quasar's Lyman alpha emission as being at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). The cloud then absorbs this at that wavelength. Then, when the light reaches us, the cloud's absorption line is further redshifted by the quasar's redshift. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud)*(1 + z_quasar).

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about this differently. The quasar is at a high redshift, z_q, and the cloud is at a lower redshift, z_c < z_q. The Lyman alpha line emitted by the quasar is observed at 1216*(1 + z_q). The cloud, being at z_c, will absorb this light at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_c) in the quasar's frame. But when this absorption happens, the light that comes through still has to travel from the cloud to us, which is at a lower redshift, so the absorption line is observed at 1216*(1 + z_c)*(1 + z_q)? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as: the quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms. The cloud, which is at redshift z_c, will absorb this light. The cloud sees the quasar's light as being redshifted by z_c, so the wavelength at which the cloud absorbs is 1216*(1 + z_c). The absorption line, when it reaches us, has been further redshifted by the factor (1 + z_q), where z_q is the quasar's redshift. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_c)*(1 + z_q).

Wait, no, that can't be right, because z_q is larger than z_c, so the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216*(1 + z_c), which may or may not be in the optical.

But the question is about whether the absorption line is observed in the optical. So the observed wavelength must be greater than around 4000 Angstroms (400 nm). So:

1216*(1 + z_c)*(1 + z_q) > 4000 Angstroms.

But without knowing z_q, perhaps we can make an assumption. Wait, the question is about the lower limit on the cloud's redshift (z_c) such that the absorption line is in the optical. So the minimal z_c would be when the quasar's redshift is just enough to bring the absorption line into the optical.

Wait, perhaps the quasar's redshift is such that the Lyman alpha line is observed in the optical, but the cloud's redshift is lower. Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should consider that the cloud's redshift must be such that the absorption line is in the optical, regardless of the quasar's redshift. Because if the quasar is at a higher redshift, the absorption line would be redshifted even further.

Wait, but no. The cloud's redshift determines the position of the absorption line. Let's take an example. Suppose the cloud is at z_c=2. The Lyman alpha line (1216 Angstroms) is absorbed at 1216*(1+2)=3648 Angstroms (364.8 nm). But wait, 3648 Angstroms is 364.8 nm, which is in the UV. So that's not in the optical. So ground-based telescopes can't see that. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the cloud's redshift must be higher.

Wait, this approach makes sense. Let me think. If the cloud is at z_c, then the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_c). For this to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z_c) > 4000 Angstroms. Because 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is the start of optical.

So solving 1216*(1 + z_c) > 4000 → (1 + z_c) > 4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z_c > 2.29.

So the lower limit on z_c is approximately 2.29. So the minimal z_c is just over 2.29.

Looking at the options:

C) 2.4 is higher than 2.29. So option C is a possible choice. But the question asks for the lower limit, so the minimal z_c is 2.29. But since 2.29 isn't an option, the next higher value is 2.4 (option C). Or perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's redshift is also a factor.

Wait, the quasar's redshift may be higher than the cloud's. So the absorption line's wavelength is at 1216*(1 + z_c) in the quasar's frame. But when the light comes to us, the quasar's redshift (z_q) would further redshift the absorption line. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_c)*(1 + z_q).

But without knowing z_q, perhaps the question is assuming that the quasar's redshift is negligible, which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps the quasar's redshift is much higher, making the observed wavelength even longer.

Wait, but the question is about the cloud's redshift. So perhaps the cloud's redshift is such that 1216*(1 + z_c) is just in the optical. So the quasar's redshift would only affect the overall shift, but the cloud's own shift is the main factor. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. The question is asking for the lower limit on the cloud's redshift so that the Lyman alpha absorption line is in the optical. So, the minimal z_c is when 1216*(1 + z_c) is equal to the lower limit of the optical range, say 4000 Angstroms.

As computed earlier, that gives z_c ≈2.29. So the minimal z_c is approximately 2.29. Among the options, C is 2.4, which is the closest higher value.

So the correct answer should be C)2.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) can be detected in the optical range (approximately 4000–7000 Å) by ground-based telescopes, we use the redshift formula:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}} - 1
\]

Here, \(\lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å}\) (the Lyman alpha wavelength), and \(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\) is the observed wavelength in the optical range. The lower limit of the optical range is approximately \(4000 \, \text{Å}\). Substituting these values:

\[
z = \frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift \(z\) for the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical is approximately \(2.29\). However, the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift of the clouds, and the options provided are discrete values. Among the options, the closest value greater than \(2.29\) is \(2.4\).

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift of the clouds, ensuring that the Lyman alpha line is detectable in the optical range, is approximately \(2.4\).
