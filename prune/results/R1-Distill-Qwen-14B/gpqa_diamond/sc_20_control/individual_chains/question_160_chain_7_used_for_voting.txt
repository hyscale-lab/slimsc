Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls vertically on this aperture, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, N approaching infinity would mean the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So in that case, the diffraction pattern would be similar to a circular aperture, which I'm a bit more familiar with.

But wait, the question is about the minima. For a circular aperture, I remember the minima occur at certain angles. The first minimum in the single-slit diffraction (which is similar for a circular aperture's first minimum) happens when the path difference is about λ/2, but wait, no, actually, the single-slit minima are at a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer. But for a single slit, the first minimum is when m=1, making the angle larger.

Wait, but wait, no. For a single slit, the condition is a sinθ = mλ. The first minimum (after the central maximum) is at m=1, so sinθ = λ/(a). Using small angles, θ ≈ λ/(a). But wait, that's for a single slit.

But in this case, the aperture is a polygon. Wait, but when N is infinite, it's a circle. So maybe the problem reduces to the circular aperture case.

Wait, but the problem says the apothems are all the same length 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular N-gon, the apothem is a. So when N approaches infinity, the apothem becomes the radius of the circle. So the effective radius R of the circular aperture would be equal to a.

Wait, no. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) by a = R cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, π/N approaches zero, and a ≈ R (1 - (π²)/(2N²)), but that's a bit more complicated. Alternatively, for very large N, a ≈ R, since the angle is very small. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the apothem a becomes the radius R of the circular aperture.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. For a regular polygon, the apothem is a = R cos(π/N). So when N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches cos(0) = 1. So a = R * 1, so R = a. So the radius of the circular aperture is 'a'.

So for a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur at angles where the path difference is such that destructive interference happens. The formula for the minima in a circular aperture (like a single slit) is given by sinθ = λ/(2R), but wait, no, wait. Let me recall correctly.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. For a single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, m=1,2,3... So for the first minimum, it's at θ ≈ λ/a (since a is the slit width). But for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a larger angle. Or is it different?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of Fraunhofer diffraction. For a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern has rings. The minima occur at certain radii where the path difference leads to destructive interference.

Wait, the formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by sinθ = λ/(R) multiplied by sqrt(m^2 + (n)^2), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I think for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at θ where sinθ ≈ 1.22 λ/R. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I remember that the first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture (like the Airy disk) is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/R. Because the formula is sinθ = 1.22 λ/(R), where R is the radius. So the first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(R).

But wait, in this problem, R is the radius of the circular aperture, which is equal to 'a' (since when N is infinite, the apothem equals the radius). So R = a.

So the angle θ is approximately 1.22 λ / a. Wait, but that's the first minimum. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Oh wait, no! Wait, in a circular aperture, the central maximum is surrounded by rings, and the first minimum is the boundary of the central maximum. Then the next minima are spaced differently. Wait, but I think for a circular aperture, the minima are not equally spaced in θ. So the first minimum is at θ1 ≈ 1.22 λ/R, the next at θ2 ≈ 2.44 λ/R, and so on. Because the pattern is based on Bessel functions zeros, and the minima occur at higher multiples.

Wait, perhaps the first minimum is at θ1 = 1.22 λ / R, and the next minimum (second) is at θ2 = 2.44 λ / R. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be θ2 - θ1 = (2.44 - 1.22) λ / R = 1.22 λ/R.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/R, the second at 2.44 λ/R, so the difference is 1.22 λ/R. So the angular distance is 1.22 λ/(R).

But R is 'a' in this problem, since when N approaches infinity, R = a. So the angular separation is 1.22 λ/a.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem states that when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle with apothem 'a'. So the radius of the circle is 'a' because for a regular polygon, the apothem is a = R cos(π/N), and for N→infty, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a≈R.

Therefore, R =a. So, in the circular case, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/R = 1.22 λ/a.

Wait, but that's the first minimum. What about the second? Wait, no, the question is about the first two minima. Wait, the first minimum is the first one after the central maximum. The second minimum would be the next one, but I thought the next minimum is at about 2.44 λ/R. So the angular distance between the first and second minima is 2.44 λ/(a) - 1.22 λ/(a) = 1.22 λ/a.

So the answer would be 1.22 λ/a, which is option C.

But wait, the options don't show 1.22 λ/a as the correct option? Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) 0.610 λ / a

B) 0.500 λ / a

C) 1.220 λ /a 

D) 0.506 λ / a

So option C is 1.220 λ/a, which matches what I came up with.

Wait, but another thought: the problem says the apothems are all the same length 'a'. So when N is very large, the polygon approximates a circle with apothem a, which we've established R = a. So the minima are based on R = a.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the first two minima, which for a polygon (when N is large but finite) might be different. But when N approaches infinity, it's a circle, so the minima are as we discussed.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is about the minima for the polygon as a multi-slit, but no, it's a single aperture, not a grating. So the single aperture's diffraction applies.

Wait, but wait, for a polygon with N sides, each side would behave like a slit, but when N is very large, the diffraction would be similar to a circular aperture.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a polygon-shaped aperture as an approximation to a slit, but no, the situation is a single aperture.

So I think the correct approach is to model it as a circular aperture, leading to an angular separation of 1.22 λ/a between the first two minima. So the answer is option C.

The problem involves a polygonal aperture with \( N \)-sides, where all apothems are of length \( a \). When monochromatic light of wavelength \( \lambda \) falls vertically on this aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern in the far field. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima when \( N \) approaches infinity, assuming small-angle approximations (\( \tan \theta \approx \theta \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Polygon to Circle Transition**: As \( N \to \infty \), the polygon becomes a circle. For a regular polygon, the apothem \( a \) is related to the radius \( R \) of the circle by \( a = R \cos(\pi/N) \). For large \( N \), \( \cos(\pi/N) \to 1 \), so \( R = a \).

2. **Diffraction Minima for a Circular Aperture**: For a circular aperture of radius \( R \), the minima in the diffraction pattern occur at angles where the path difference leads to destructive interference. The first minimum is at \( \theta_1 \approx 1.22 \lambda / R \), and the second minimum is at \( \theta_2 \approx 2.44 \lambda / R \). The angular distance between the first two minima is:
   \[
   \Delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = (2.44 \lambda / R) - (1.22 \lambda / R) = 1.22 \lambda / R.
   \]

3. **Substituting \( R = a \)**: Since \( R = a \) for the circular aperture, the angular distance becomes:
   \[
   \Delta \theta = 1.22 \lambda / a.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**: Among the given options, the angular distance \( 1.22 \lambda / a \) corresponds to **Option C**.

### Conclusion:
The angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern is \( 1.22 \lambda / a \), which matches **Option C**.
