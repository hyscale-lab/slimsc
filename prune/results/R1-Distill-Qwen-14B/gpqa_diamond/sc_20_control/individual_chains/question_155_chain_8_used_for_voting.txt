Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of operators and uncertainties. But let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that there's an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. The matrices for each are given, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). We need to find the uncertainty in Pz, ΔPz.

Hmm, right. The uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for Pz, that would mean I need to find ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩, then compute the square root of their difference.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So first, I should probably express this state in the eigenbasis of Pz because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expectation values directly without changing the basis? Not sure yet.

Wait, the state is already given in the Pz basis since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the state is already in the correct basis to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩. Because the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, each component of the state vector corresponds to a particular eigenvalue of Pz.

Let me think about the matrix of Pz. The matrix provided for Pz is diagonal, right? The first diagonal element is ħ, the second is 0, and the third is -ħ. So the eigenstates are the basis vectors |1>, |2>, |3>, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

The state vector given is (−1/2, 1/√2, −1/2) as a column vector. So that's |ψ⟩ = c₁|1⟩ + c₂|2⟩ + c₃|3⟩, where c₁ = -1/2, c₂ = 1/√2, c₃ = -1/2.

Wait, but to compute ⟨Pz⟩, I can just compute the sum of |c_i|² multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Because in the eigenbasis, the expectation value is sum |ci|² * λi.

Similarly, since Pz is diagonal, Pz² is just the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So ⟨Pz²⟩ would be the sum of |ci|² * (λi)².

So let's compute each part.

First, let's find the probabilities |ci|².

c₁ = -1/2: |c₁|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

c₂ = 1/√2: |c₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

c₃ = -1/2: |c₃|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Wait, but 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 equals 1, so that makes sense.

Now, the eigenvalues for each state are:

For |1⟩: ħ

For |2⟩: 0

For |3⟩: -ħ

So ⟨Pz⟩ = (|c₁|² * ħ) + (|c₂|² * 0) + (|c₃|² * (-ħ)).

Substituting the values:

⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value of Pz is zero.

Next, ⟨Pz²⟩ is the sum of |ci|² times (λi)^2.

So each λi squared is:

λ1² = (ħ)^2 = ħ².

λ2² = 0.

λ3² = (-ħ)^2 = ħ².

So:

⟨Pz²⟩ = (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, ΔPz is the square root of (⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩^2).

Since ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, that term vanishes. So ΔPz = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Because the state vector given is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me make sure I squared the coefficients correctly.

Yes, (−1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, same for the third component. So the sum is 1, so that's correct.

So ⟨Pz⟩ is zero, and ⟨Pz²⟩ is ½ ħ². So the uncertainty is sqrt( (½ ħ² ) ) = (ħ / sqrt(2)).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that should be the answer.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is given as the column vector $| \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the matrix of $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for the basis states $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively.

### Step 1: Compute $|c_i|^2$ (probabilities)
The coefficients of the state are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. The probabilities are:
\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ for $|1\rangle$, $|2\rangle$, and $|3\rangle$, respectively. Using the formula for expectation values in the eigenbasis:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$ (since $(-\hbar)^2 = \hbar^2$). Using the formula for expectation values:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |c_1|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |c_2|^2 \cdot 0 + |c_3|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 4: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$.
