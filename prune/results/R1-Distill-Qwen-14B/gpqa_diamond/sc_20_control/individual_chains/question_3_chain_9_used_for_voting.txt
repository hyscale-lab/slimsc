Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it. The question is about finding the expectation value of a given operator for a spin-half particle in a specific state.

Alright, the particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me make sure I write that correctly. Oh right, so the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. I should check if these coefficients are normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients should equal 1.

So, let's compute that. (0.5)^2 is 0.25. Then (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4), which is 0.75. Adding them together, 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Oh, okay, so the state is properly normalized. That's good because expectation values would otherwise be messed up if it wasn't normalized.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. I'm supposed to find the expectation value of this operator. Hmm, expectation values. So the expectation value is the average outcome you'd expect if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems.

I remember that for expectation values, if the operator is a sum of terms, the expectation is the sum of the expectations of each term. So, <A + B> = <A> + <B>, where A and B are operators. Also, for scalar multiplication, <cA> = c<A>, where c is a constant. So, I can split this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx. Then add them together.

Let me write that down. The expectation value ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩ is equal to 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ +5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. So I can compute each part separately.

First, let's handle ⟨σz⟩. The σz operator is the Pauli z matrix. Its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are given. So for σz acting on |↑⟩, it gives +1 times |↑⟩, and acting on |↓⟩ gives -1 times |↓⟩. So σz |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σz |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

Wait, no, wait. No, actually, the Pauli matrices: σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 corresponding to |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So, when σz acts on |↑⟩, it gives +1 * |↑⟩, and on |↓⟩, it gives (-1)*|↓⟩.

So for the expectation value of σz, ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Because the state is a linear combination, the expectation value is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1), where a is the coefficient of |↑⟩ and b is the coefficient of |↓⟩.

In this case, a is 0.5, so |a|^2 is 0.25, and b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So, ⟨σz⟩ would be (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the first part is 10 times that, which is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that.

Now, the second part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. The eigenstates of σx are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Oh right, |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are the eigenstates. So calculating ⟨σx⟩ is a bit more involved.

I remember that in such cases, the expectation value can be found by writing the state in terms of the eigenstates of σx, but perhaps a more straightforward way is to express the state in the σx basis and compute the expectation, or alternatively, use the formula for expectation value when the state is a superposition of σz eigenstates.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value of σx is given by the formula ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, which for a state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩ can be calculated as 2*(|α|^2*(⟨down|σx|up⟩) + αβ*(⟨up|σx|down⟩)) or something like that. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute it explicitly.

Alternatively, I can express σx in terms of the basis states. The Pauli x matrix is:

σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|

So, when I compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can expand it. Let's write ψ as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

So, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ] * σx * [0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩ ]

Expanding this, σx is |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So, when we multiply σx with |ψ⟩, we get:

σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (√3/2) σx |↓⟩.

But σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, because σx swaps the spin-up and spin-down states. Similarly, σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So, σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2) |↑⟩.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the conjugate of [0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ] multiplied by [0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩ ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, the expression is [0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ] * [0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩ ].

Wait, no, because σx|ψ⟩ is 0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩, as I found earlier. So the inner product is:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ] * [0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩ ]

Wait, that's because σx|ψ⟩ is 0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩, so when we take ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, it's the inner product of ψ with σxψ.

So, let's compute this inner product:

= (0.5)(0.5)⟨↑|↓⟩ + (0.5)(√3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(0.5)⟨↓|↓⟩ + (√3/2)(√3/2)⟨↓|↑⟩.

Now, the inner products ⟨↑|↓⟩ and ⟨↓|↑⟩ are zero, because they're orthogonal. So the cross terms vanish. So what's left is:

= (0.5)(√3/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(0.5) * ⟨↓|↓⟩.

Each of those terms is 1, so it becomes:

= (0.5 * √3/2) * 1 + (√3/2 * 0.5) * 1.

Which is [ (√3/4) + (√3/4) ] = (√3/2).

So ⟨σx⟩ is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660... So approximately 0.866.

Wait, but wait, the original state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are real, so the inner product calculation should be correct.

So, the expectation value of σx is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So now, going back to the original operator: 10σz +5σx.

The expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Which is 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2).

Let me compute each part.

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(√3/2) = (5√3)/2 ≈ 5*(1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 = 4.33.

So adding these together: -5 + 4.33 = approximately -0.67.

Wait, but let me compute that accurately.

Wait, √3 is approximately 1.73205. So √3/2 is about 0.866025.

So 5*(√3/2) = (5)(0.866025) ≈ 4.330125.

So, 10*(-0.5) is -5. So -5 +4.330125 ≈ -0.669875.

So approximately -0.67 when rounded to two decimal places.

But the question asks for the expectation value up to one decimal place. So -0.7 would be the rounded value. Because 0.6698 is closer to 0.7 than to 0.6, but wait, wait, no—the number is -0.67 approximately, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Because 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to tenths.

Wait, actually, 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to tenths. So, -0.67 would round to -0.7.

Wait, but let me recalculate to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Wait, ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5, 10* that is -5.

⟨σx⟩ is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

5*0.8660 ≈ 4.330.

So -5 +4.330 = -0.670.

So that's -0.67, which to one decimal place is -0.7. Because 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to tenths.

Wait, but wait a second, let me think about the calculation of ⟨σx⟩ again. Did I make a mistake there?

Earlier, when calculating ⟨σx⟩, I found it to be (√3/4 + √3/4) = √3/2. Let me recheck that part. So, the expansion of ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ was:

= (0.5)(√3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(0.5)⟨↓|↓⟩.

Because the other terms involve ⟨↑|↓⟩ and ⟨↓|↑⟩ which are zero.

So, each of these terms is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5.

Which is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2.

So that's correct.

So the calculation of ⟨σx⟩ is correct, and the expectation is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which times 5 is indeed about 4.33.

So, then 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

So, when rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, the options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Did I get the sign right for σz? Let me double-check.

The state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

The expectation value of σz is |↑ coefficient|^2 * (+1) + |↓ coefficient|^2 * (-1).

So |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |√3/2|^2 is 3/4 = 0.75.

So 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct.

So 10 times that is -5.

So, then the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is -5 + (5*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205, so 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5*1.73205)/2 ≈ (8.66025)/2 ≈ 4.330125.

So, -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) are \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(+1) + |b|^2(-1),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). The probabilities are:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = |\uparrow\rangle\langle\downarrow| + |\downarrow\rangle\langle\uparrow|.
\]
The state \( \psi \) is \( 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]
Expanding \( \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0.5|\downarrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\uparrow\rangle.
\]
The inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) becomes:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \left(0.5\langle\uparrow| + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\langle\downarrow|\right) \left(0.5|\downarrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\uparrow\rangle\right).
\]
The cross terms vanish because \( \langle\uparrow|\downarrow\rangle = \langle\downarrow|\uparrow\rangle = 0 \). The remaining terms are:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of the operator is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it. The question is about finding the expectation value of a given operator for a spin-half particle in a specific state.

Alright, the particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me make sure I write that correctly. Oh right, so the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. I should check if these coefficients are normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients should equal 1.

So, let's compute that. (0.5)^2 is 0.25. Then (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4), which is 0.75. Adding them together, 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Oh, okay, so the state is properly normalized. That's good because expectation values would otherwise be messed up if it wasn't normalized.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. I'm supposed to find the expectation value of this operator. Hmm, expectation values. So the expectation value is the average outcome you'd expect if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems.

I remember that for expectation values, if the operator is a sum of terms, the expectation is the sum of the expectations of each term. So, <A + B> = <A> + <B>, where A and B are operators. Also, for scalar multiplication, <cA> = c<A>, where c is a constant. So, I can split this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx. Then add them together.

Let me write that down. The expectation value ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩ is equal to 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ +5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. So I can compute each part separately.

First, let's handle ⟨σz⟩. The σz operator is the Pauli z matrix. Its eigenstates are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are given. So for σz acting on |↑⟩, it gives +1 times |↑⟩, and acting on |↓⟩ gives -1 times |↓⟩. So σz |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, σz |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

Wait, no, wait. No, actually, the Pauli matrices: σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 corresponding to |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So, when σz acts on |↑⟩, it gives +1 * |↑⟩, and on |↓⟩, it gives (-1)*|↓⟩.

So for the expectation value of σz, ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Because the state is a linear combination, the expectation value is |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1), where a is the coefficient of |↑⟩ and b is the coefficient of |↓⟩.

In this case, a is 0.5, so |a|^2 is 0.25, and b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So, ⟨σz⟩ would be (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So the first part is 10 times that, which is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that.

Now, the second part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. The eigenstates of σx are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Oh right, |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are the eigenstates. So calculating ⟨σx⟩ is a bit more involved.

I remember that in such cases, the expectation value can be found by writing the state in terms of the eigenstates of σx, but perhaps a more straightforward way is to express the state in the σx basis and compute the expectation, or alternatively, use the formula for expectation value when the state is a superposition of σz eigenstates.

Wait, another approach: The expectation value of σx is given by the formula ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, which for a state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩ can be calculated as 2*(|α|^2*(⟨down|σx|up⟩) + αβ*(⟨up|σx|down⟩)) or something like that. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute it explicitly.

Alternatively, I can express σx in terms of the basis states. The Pauli x matrix is:

σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|

So, when I compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can expand it. Let's write ψ as 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

So, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ] * σx * [0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩ ]

Expanding this, σx is |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|.

So, when we multiply σx with |ψ⟩, we get:

σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (√3/2) σx |↓⟩.

But σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, because σx swaps the spin-up and spin-down states. Similarly, σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So, σx|ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2) |↑⟩.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the conjugate of [0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ] multiplied by [0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩ ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, the expression is [0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ] * [0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩ ].

Wait, no, because σx|ψ⟩ is 0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩, as I found earlier. So the inner product is:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = [0.5⟨↑| + (√3/2)⟨↓| ] * [0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩ ]

Wait, that's because σx|ψ⟩ is 0.5 |↓⟩ + (√3/2)|↑⟩, so when we take ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, it's the inner product of ψ with σxψ.

So, let's compute this inner product:

= (0.5)(0.5)⟨↑|↓⟩ + (0.5)(√3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(0.5)⟨↓|↓⟩ + (√3/2)(√3/2)⟨↓|↑⟩.

Now, the inner products ⟨↑|↓⟩ and ⟨↓|↑⟩ are zero, because they're orthogonal. So the cross terms vanish. So what's left is:

= (0.5)(√3/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(0.5) * ⟨↓|↓⟩.

Each of those terms is 1, so it becomes:

= (0.5 * √3/2) * 1 + (√3/2 * 0.5) * 1.

Which is [ (√3/4) + (√3/4) ] = (√3/2).

So ⟨σx⟩ is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660... So approximately 0.866.

Wait, but wait, the original state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are real, so the inner product calculation should be correct.

So, the expectation value of σx is (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So now, going back to the original operator: 10σz +5σx.

The expectation is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Which is 10*(-0.5) +5*(√3/2).

Let me compute each part.

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(√3/2) = (5√3)/2 ≈ 5*(1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 = 4.33.

So adding these together: -5 + 4.33 = approximately -0.67.

Wait, but let me compute that accurately.

Wait, √3 is approximately 1.73205. So √3/2 is about 0.866025.

So 5*(√3/2) = (5)(0.866025) ≈ 4.330125.

So, 10*(-0.5) is -5. So -5 +4.330125 ≈ -0.669875.

So approximately -0.67 when rounded to two decimal places.

But the question asks for the expectation value up to one decimal place. So -0.7 would be the rounded value. Because 0.6698 is closer to 0.7 than to 0.6, but wait, wait, no—the number is -0.67 approximately, which is -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Because 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to tenths.

Wait, actually, 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to tenths. So, -0.67 would round to -0.7.

Wait, but let me recalculate to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Wait, ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5, 10* that is -5.

⟨σx⟩ is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

5*0.8660 ≈ 4.330.

So -5 +4.330 = -0.670.

So that's -0.67, which to one decimal place is -0.7. Because 0.67 is 0.7 when rounded to tenths.

Wait, but wait a second, let me think about the calculation of ⟨σx⟩ again. Did I make a mistake there?

Earlier, when calculating ⟨σx⟩, I found it to be (√3/4 + √3/4) = √3/2. Let me recheck that part. So, the expansion of ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ was:

= (0.5)(√3/2)⟨↑|↑⟩ + (√3/2)(0.5)⟨↓|↓⟩.

Because the other terms involve ⟨↑|↓⟩ and ⟨↓|↑⟩ which are zero.

So, each of these terms is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5.

Which is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) ) = sqrt(3)/2.

So that's correct.

So the calculation of ⟨σx⟩ is correct, and the expectation is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866, which times 5 is indeed about 4.33.

So, then 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ is -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

So, when rounded to one decimal place, that's -0.7. So looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, the options are:

A) -1.4

B) 1.65

C) -0.7

D) 0.85

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Did I get the sign right for σz? Let me double-check.

The state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩.

The expectation value of σz is |↑ coefficient|^2 * (+1) + |↓ coefficient|^2 * (-1).

So |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |√3/2|^2 is 3/4 = 0.75.

So 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Correct.

So 10 times that is -5.

So, then the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is -5 + (5*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205, so 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5*1.73205)/2 ≈ (8.66025)/2 ≈ 4.330125.

So, -5 +4.330125 = -0.669875, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) are \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(+1) + |b|^2(-1),
\]
where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). The probabilities are:
\[
|a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = |\uparrow\rangle\langle\downarrow| + |\downarrow\rangle\langle\uparrow|.
\]
The state \( \psi \) is \( 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle.
\]
Expanding \( \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):
\[
\sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0.5|\downarrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\uparrow\rangle.
\]
The inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \) becomes:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \left(0.5\langle\uparrow| + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\langle\downarrow|\right) \left(0.5|\downarrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\uparrow\rangle\right).
\]
The cross terms vanish because \( \langle\uparrow|\downarrow\rangle = \langle\downarrow|\uparrow\rangle = 0 \). The remaining terms are:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})(0.5) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of the operator is:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]
Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle \approx -0.7.
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is **-0.7**, which corresponds to option **C**.
