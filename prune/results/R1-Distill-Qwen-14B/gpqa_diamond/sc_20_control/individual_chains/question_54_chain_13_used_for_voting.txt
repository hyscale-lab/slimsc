Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about ring-closing metathesis, and I need to find the right starting material to make this specific cyclohexene compound. Hmm, let me think about what I know about ring-closing metathesis.

Ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is a reaction where two alkenes undergo a redistribution of their substituents, forming a ring. The catalysts, like Grubbs catalyst, facilitate this by breaking and reforming the carbon-carbon double bonds. The key here is that the metathesis forms a new ring by connecting two ends of a diene, creating a cyclic structure.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are at positions 3,4 (two methyl groups) and position 5 (an isopropyl group). The double bond is between C1 and C2, I think, because in cyclohexene the double bond is usually between C1 and C2 unless specified otherwise.

Wait, actually, in cyclohex-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents are at C3, C4, and C5. Let me visualize the ring: numbering the ring starting from the double bond, so C1 is double bonded to C2. Then C3 has a methyl, C4 has another methyl, and C5 has an isopropyl group.

Now, for ring-closing metathesis, I need to figure out where the double bonds would be in the starting material before the metathesis. RCM typically involves a diene, which upon metathesis forms the ring. The diene should have two alkenes that can come together to form the cyclohexene ring.

In the starting material, the diene should have the substituents positioned such that when the metathesis occurs, the substituents end up at the correct positions in the ring. So, the starting material is probably an octadiene, which upon metathesis forms a six-membered ring.

Let me think about the structure of the starting material. An octadiene has eight carbons and two double bonds. Wait, no, usually a diene has one double bond. Wait, no, wait: metathesis involves alkenes. So the starting material is a diene (1,3-diene or another diene structure) that will form the ring.

Wait, no. Ring-closing metathesis of a dienyne? Or just a diene? Wait, no, RCM typically uses a diene to form the ring. Let me think. Oh, wait, no, more accurately, RCM uses a single diene with two double bonds, but perhaps that's not right. Wait, no, I think it's a monoene, but in a way that when the ends meet, the double bonds can shift.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mechanism. The Grubbs catalyst would break the double bonds and re-form them. So, the starting material is a diene with two alkenes that are positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, the ends connect to form the cyclohexene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps that's a dienophile? Or a diene that can cyclize. Wait, in some cases, ring-closing metathesis can involve a diene where the two ends have the necessary substituents to form the ring. So, the starting material is a diene where the two ends, when connected, form the cyclohexene ring with the substituents in the correct positions.

So, if the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, the starting material must be an octadiene where the substituents are at positions that, when the metathesis occurs, they end up at the correct positions on the ring.

Let me try to imagine the starting material as an octadiene. For example, if the starting material is a linear molecule with two double bonds, or perhaps a single diene that can form a ring upon metathesis.

Wait, no. Wait, RCM of an olefin generally refers to the situation where a diene is present, and the catalyst causes the two ends to connect, forming a ring. So the starting material would be a diene with the substituents arranged so that when the ends undergo metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions on the ring.

So the starting material would have substituents at specific positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene such that positions 1 and 8 are the ends which will form the double bond in the ring. But that's a bit abstract. Let me try to think of the starting material as a diene where the substituents are on the appropriate carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the number of carbons. The target is a cyclohexene, which is six-membered. So the starting material must have six carbons in the ring. Wait, wait, the starting material isn't a cyclohexene but a diene that upon metathesis forms the ring. So the starting material will have more than six carbons because it's linear before the ring-forming.

Wait, the target has six carbons in the ring. So the starting material is likely an eight-carbon diene because when you form a six-membered ring, you lose two carbons as the double bonds (or maybe not, depending on how it works).

Wait, no. Let me think again. RCM typically involves breaking two double bonds and forming a new ring. So, for a cyclohexene, the starting material must be a diene with an eight-carbon chain, perhaps, which upon ring-closing forms a six-membered ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an octadiene. Let's say the two double bonds are in certain positions that allow the ring to form.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has two double bonds, and upon metathesis, they form the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a mono-alkene, but that doesn't make sense for ring-closing.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A through D, each is a 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethyl-octa-diene with varying double bond positions.

Let me list the options:

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So positions 1 and 7 are double bonds.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So all the options are octadienes. That makes sense because RCM typically uses dienes to form a ring. So the starting material must be one of these.

I need to figure out which of these, when undergoing ring-closing metathesis, would form the target cyclohexene.

Remember that in metathesis, the catalyst (like Grubbs) will break the double bonds and re-form them as the ring closes.

In ring-closing metathesis, two alkenes (double bonds) in a molecule undergo a redistribution. So for each double bond, the catalyst breaks the sigma bond adjacent to the double bond and swaps the ends.

So in the starting material, the two double bonds are in positions that, when the two ends undergo metathesis, the substituents are correctly placed in the ring.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine how the metathesis would proceed.

Let me take a generic approach. Suppose the starting material is a diene with two double bonds at positions i and j. When the metathesis occurs, the catalyst will break the double bonds and form new ones, connecting the ends to make the ring.

But wait, noâ€”ring-closing metathesis usually involves a single diene, not necessarily two. Wait, no, maybe it's a single diene with appropriate substituents that, when the ends are connected, form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the ends can cyclize to form the cyclohexene ring.

Consider the structure of the target molecule. The cyclohexene has substituents at positions 3,4 (two methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl). The double bond is at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the substituents are placed such that when the ends are connected, they form the cyclohexene.

Let me imagine the starting material as an octadiene, perhaps with the structure CH2=CH-(CH2)m-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at specific positions.

Wait, maybe the starting material has the substituents at positions 3 and 4 as methyl groups, and position 5 as isopropyl. But how would that arrange in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene where the two double bonds are at positions that, when the metathesis occurs, the ring forms with the substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, another approach: the target cyclohexene has substituents at 3,4, and 5. So when the ring closes, those substituents must be at the correct positions. So in the starting material, which is a linear molecule, these substituents are positioned such that when the ends are connected, they form the cyclohexene.

For example, in the starting material, the substituents would be at positions that, when the ring forms, they become the 3,4,5 positions.

Let me consider the structure of each option:

Option A: octa-1,7-diene. So double bonds at 1 and 7. The substituents are at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the positions are 1 and 7. So the molecule would have 8 carbons. So, positions 1 and 7 are double bonds. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that can't be right.

Wait, actually, the substituents are at 3,4,5 in the molecule. So let's number from 1 to 8.

Option A: positions 1 and 7 are double bonds. So structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2. But wait, that's 8 carbons. So the substituents are at 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH(CH3)), 5 (CH(CH2CH3)).

Wait, when ring-closing metathesis occurs, the double bonds at 1 and 7 would undergo metathesis. So the catalyst would break the double bonds, and the ends would connect, forming a ring.

Let me try to imagine the metathesis. The catalyst would take the two ends of the molecule and swap the ends. So, the double bond at position 1 (between C1 and C2) and the double bond at position 7 (between C7 and C8) would undergo metathesis.

What happens in ring-closing metathesis is that the two alkenes (double bonds) in the starting material undergo redistribution. The catalyst breaks the sigma bonds adjacent to the double bonds and reconnects the ends.

So for the starting material with double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8 positions, the metathesis would form new double bonds between the ends.

So the ring would form by connecting C2 to C7, perhaps, which would create a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me think. The total number of carbons in the ring would be 6, so the starting material must have 8 carbons (so that when 2 carbons are lost in the metathesis, you get a 6-membered ring). Wait, no, I think in metathesis, the number of carbons remains the same. So the starting material is a 8-carbon diene, and the product is a 8-2=6? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because RCM forms a ring, but doesn't lose any carbon. So the starting material is an 8-carbon diene, and the product is a 8-membered ring? No, wait, the target is a cyclohexene, which is 6-membered.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The target has six carbons in the ring. So the starting material must be a diene with six plus two more carbons, making eight. So the starting material is an eight-carbon diene.

Wait, but cyclohexene is 6-membered, so the starting material is an eight-carbon diene, which upon losing two carbons (as two ethylene molecules?), forms the ring. Wait, no, that's olefin metathesis, not ring-closing. Oh wait, in ring-closing metathesis, the diene undergoes cyclization without losing any carbons. So, the starting material is a diene with six carbons plus two more in the chain, making eight.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an eight-carbon diene, and the ring formed is six-membered. So, the diene must have two double bonds in positions that, when the ends are connected, form the six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with two double bonds, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to imagine the starting material as a diene (monoene, but with two double bonds? No, wait, no). Wait, no, RCM usually involves a single diene that can form a ring upon cyclization.

Wait, perhaps it's a mono-alkene, but coupled with another part of the molecule to form the ring.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should consider the positions of the double bonds in the starting material and how they lead to the target.

In the target, the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 1-2. So, when the ring forms, the metathesis should bring the ends together in such a way that the double bond in the ring is at position 1.

So, the starting material's double bonds should be positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, the double bond ends up in position 1.

Let me think about the metathesis process. When the catalyst (Grubbs) performs RCM, it breaks the double bonds and forms new ones. The mechanism is that the catalyst breaks the two double bonds, rearranges the substituents, and forms a new ring with a new double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has two double bonds, and the metathesis connects the ends, forming a new double bond in the ring.

Wait, but the target has only one double bond. So, the starting material must have two double bonds, but after metathesis, one of them is used to form the ring, and the other is incorporated elsewhere.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with two double bonds, and during RCM, one of the double bonds becomes the ring's double bond, and the other is either removed or used elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the positions of the substituents in the starting material.

The target has methyl groups at 3 and 4, and isopropyl at 5. So, in the starting material, these substituents must be at positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at 3,4,5.

Let me consider option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The correct structure would be:

Positions 1 and 6 are double bonds. So the molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me number the octa-1,6-diene.

Carbon 1: CH2=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH2-
Carbon 4: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 5: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 6: CH(CH2CH3)=
Carbon 7: CH2-
Carbon 8: CH2.

Wait, not exactly. Let me write it more accurately.

Option C is octa-1,6-diene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, because it's octa-1,6-diene, so the two double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7 positions.

Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right. Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that has 8 carbons with double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7. But then where are the substituents?

The substituents are at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2.

No, wait. Numbering the octa-1,6-diene:

Carbon 1: CH2=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 4: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 5: CH(CH2CH3)-
Carbon 6: CH2=
Carbon 7: CH2-
Carbon 8: CH2.

Wait, not quite. Let me write it correctly.

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)-
4: CH(CH3)-
5: CH(CH2CH3)-
6: CH2=
7: CH2-
8: CH3? No, wait, the end would be another CH2. Wait, maybe it's:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, but that would make it an 8-carbon molecule. So the substituents are at 3,4,5.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

The metathesis would connect the ends, swapping the substituents. So the end of the first double bond (C2) would connect to the end of the second double bond (C7). Alternatively, perhaps the C1 and C6 ends would connect.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Let me imagine the molecule as:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7 positions.

During ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would break these double bonds and form new ones. The Grubbs catalyst typically breaks the double bonds and re-forms them by connecting the ends.

So, the metathesis would connect the two ends, forming a ring. Let's see: breaking the double bonds would form two alkenes as parts of the catalyst. Then, the ends would connect, so the CH2 from position 1 would connect to the CH2 from position 7.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis would re-form double bonds in such a way that the ring is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst would cause the double bonds to shift. Let me think about the mechanism.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst (for example, Grubbs) cleaves the two alkenes, and then the ends of the alkenes are connected to form the ring. The catalyst will facilitate the exchange of the substituents across the double bonds.

So, the two double bonds in the starting material are at positions 1 and 6. The metathesis would form a ring by connecting the ends of these double bonds.

So, the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2.

The metathesis would break the double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7. Then, the catalyst would facilitate the exchange, leading to the formation of a new ring.

The new ring would have the structure where the substituents from positions 3,4,5 are placed correctly.

Let me imagine the ring formation. If the catalyst breaks the double bonds, the CH2 from position 1 is connected to the CH2 from position 7, and the CH2 from position 2 is connected to the CH from position 6.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine that the two double bonds are at the ends of the molecule, and upon metathesis, the ends are connected to form the ring.

In this case, the ring would have six members, as needed for cyclohexene.

So, the starting material has two double bonds at positions 1 and 6. When connected, the ring will have the substituents at positions 3,4,5 in the correct positions.

But wait, the target is 5-isopropyl, 3,4-dimethyl. So in the starting material, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which are in the middle of the chain.

So when the ring forms, those substituents end up at positions 3,4,5 in the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So the starting material is an 8-carbon diene with substituents at 3,4,5, and double bonds at 1 and 6.

In that case, when the metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 6) will connect, forming a six-membered ring.

Let me count the carbons in the ring. The starting material has eight carbons, but the ring will be six. So the two ends (from carbons 1 and 6) form the ring, with the substituents in between.

So, the ring would have the substituents at the correct positions.

So, the starting material would have double bonds at 1 and 6, and substituents at 3,4,5.

Which option matches that description?

Looking at the options:

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Yes, that's positions 1 and 6 as double bonds, and substituents at 3,4,5.

So during metathesis, the double bonds at 1 and 6 would break, and the ends would connect, leading to the cyclohexene with substituents in the correct positions.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM), we analyze the target molecule and the options provided. The target molecule is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl), and a double bond at position 1. RCM involves breaking and reforming double bonds to form a ring, so the starting material must be a linear diene with substituents positioned such that, upon cyclization, they end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene ring.

The starting material must be an eight-carbon diene (octadiene) because RCM forms a six-membered ring by connecting the ends of the molecule. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the target molecule must correspond to positions in the starting material that, after ring formation, result in the correct substituent placement.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7. If RCM occurs, the ends of the molecule (positions 1 and 7) would form the ring. However, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 would not align correctly to produce the target molecule.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2 and 6. If RCM occurs, the ends of the molecule (positions 2 and 6) would form the ring. However, this arrangement would not place the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 correctly in the target molecule.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 6. If RCM occurs, the ends of the molecule (positions 1 and 6) would form the ring. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 are already in the correct positions to yield the target molecule upon cyclization. This matches the requirements for the starting material.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, but the substituents are misplaced. The isopropyl group is at position 4 instead of 5, and the methyl groups are at positions 5 and 6 instead of 3 and 4. This arrangement would not produce the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as its double bonds at positions 1 and 6 and substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 align perfectly for RCM to form the target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about ring-closing metathesis, and I need to find the right starting material to make this specific cyclohexene compound. Hmm, let me think about what I know about ring-closing metathesis.

Ring-closing metathesis (RCM) is a reaction where two alkenes undergo a redistribution of their substituents, forming a ring. The catalysts, like Grubbs catalyst, facilitate this by breaking and reforming the carbon-carbon double bonds. The key here is that the metathesis forms a new ring by connecting two ends of a diene, creating a cyclic structure.

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are at positions 3,4 (two methyl groups) and position 5 (an isopropyl group). The double bond is between C1 and C2, I think, because in cyclohexene the double bond is usually between C1 and C2 unless specified otherwise.

Wait, actually, in cyclohex-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents are at C3, C4, and C5. Let me visualize the ring: numbering the ring starting from the double bond, so C1 is double bonded to C2. Then C3 has a methyl, C4 has another methyl, and C5 has an isopropyl group.

Now, for ring-closing metathesis, I need to figure out where the double bonds would be in the starting material before the metathesis. RCM typically involves a diene, which upon metathesis forms the ring. The diene should have two alkenes that can come together to form the cyclohexene ring.

In the starting material, the diene should have the substituents positioned such that when the metathesis occurs, the substituents end up at the correct positions in the ring. So, the starting material is probably an octadiene, which upon metathesis forms a six-membered ring.

Let me think about the structure of the starting material. An octadiene has eight carbons and two double bonds. Wait, no, usually a diene has one double bond. Wait, no, wait: metathesis involves alkenes. So the starting material is a diene (1,3-diene or another diene structure) that will form the ring.

Wait, no. Ring-closing metathesis of a dienyne? Or just a diene? Wait, no, RCM typically uses a diene to form the ring. Let me think. Oh, wait, no, more accurately, RCM uses a single diene with two double bonds, but perhaps that's not right. Wait, no, I think it's a monoene, but in a way that when the ends meet, the double bonds can shift.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mechanism. The Grubbs catalyst would break the double bonds and re-form them. So, the starting material is a diene with two alkenes that are positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, the ends connect to form the cyclohexene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps that's a dienophile? Or a diene that can cyclize. Wait, in some cases, ring-closing metathesis can involve a diene where the two ends have the necessary substituents to form the ring. So, the starting material is a diene where the two ends, when connected, form the cyclohexene ring with the substituents in the correct positions.

So, if the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, the starting material must be an octadiene where the substituents are at positions that, when the metathesis occurs, they end up at the correct positions on the ring.

Let me try to imagine the starting material as an octadiene. For example, if the starting material is a linear molecule with two double bonds, or perhaps a single diene that can form a ring upon metathesis.

So the starting material would be a diene with the substituents arranged so that when the ends undergo metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions on the ring.

So the starting material would have substituents at specific positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at 3,4-dimethyl and 5-isopropyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene such that positions 1 and 8 are the ends which will form the double bond in the ring. But that's a bit abstract. Let me try to think of the starting material as a diene where the substituents are on the appropriate carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the number of carbons. The target is a cyclohexene, which is six-membered. So the starting material must have six carbons in the ring. Wait, wait, the starting material isn't a cyclohexene but a diene that upon metathesis forms the ring. So the starting material will have more than six carbons because it's linear before the ring-forming.

Wait, the target has six carbons in the ring. So the starting material is likely an eight-carbon diene because when you form a six-membered ring, you lose two carbons as the double bonds (or maybe not, depending on how it works).

Wait, no. Let me think again. RCM typically involves breaking two double bonds and forming a new ring. So, for a cyclohexene, the starting material must be a diene with an eight-carbon chain, perhaps, which upon ring-closing forms a six-membered ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an octadiene. Let's say the two double bonds are in certain positions that allow the ring to form.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has two double bonds, and upon metathesis, they form the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a mono-alkene, but that doesn't make sense for ring-closing.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A through D, each is a 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethyl-octa-diene with varying double bond positions.

Let me list the options:

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So positions 1 and 7 are double bonds.

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So all the options are octadienes. That makes sense because RCM typically uses dienes to form a ring. So the starting material must be one of these.

I need to figure out which of these, when undergoing ring-closing metathesis, would form the target cyclohexene.

Remember that in metathesis, the catalyst (like Grubbs) will break the double bonds and re-form them as the ring closes.

But wait, noâ€”ring-closing metathesis usually involves a single diene, not necessarily two. Wait, no, maybe it's a single diene with appropriate substituents that, when the ends are connected, form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the ends can cyclize to form the cyclohexene ring.

Consider the structure of the target molecule. The cyclohexene has substituents at positions 3,4 (two methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl). The double bond is at position 1.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the substituents are placed such that when the ends are connected, they form the cyclohexene.

Let me imagine the starting material as an octadiene, perhaps with the structure CH2=CH-(CH2)m-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH2. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at specific positions.

Wait, maybe the starting material has the substituents at positions 3 and 4 as methyl groups, and position 5 as isopropyl. But how would that arrange in the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an octadiene where the two double bonds are at positions that, when the metathesis occurs, the ring forms with the substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, another approach: the target cyclohexene has substituents at 3,4, and 5. So when the ring closes, those substituents must be at the correct positions. So in the starting material, which is a linear molecule, these substituents are positioned such that when the ends are connected, they form the cyclohexene.

For example, in the starting material, the substituents would be at positions that, when the ring forms, they become the 3,4,5 positions.

Let me consider the structure of each option:

Option A: octa-1,7-diene. So double bonds at 1 and 7. The substituents are at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, the positions are 1 and 7. So the molecule would have 8 carbons. So, positions 1 and 7 are double bonds. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that can't be right.

Wait, actually, the substituents are at 3,4,5 in the molecule. So let's number from 1 to 8.

Option A: positions 1 and 7 are double bonds. So structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2. But wait, that's 8 carbons. So the substituents are at 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH(CH3)), 5 (CH(CH2CH3)).

Wait, when ring-closing metathesis occurs, the double bonds at 1 and 7 would undergo metathesis. So the catalyst would break the double bonds, and the ends would connect, forming a ring.

Let me try to imagine the metathesis. The catalyst would take the two ends of the molecule and swap the ends. So, the double bond at position 1 (between C1 and C2) and the double bond at position 7 (between C7 and C8) would undergo metathesis.

What happens in ring-closing metathesis is that the two alkenes (double bonds) in the starting material undergo redistribution. The catalyst breaks the sigma bonds adjacent to the double bonds and reconnects the ends.

So for the starting material with double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8 positions, the metathesis would form new double bonds between the ends.

So the ring would form by connecting C2 to C7, perhaps, which would create a six-membered ring.

Wait, let me think. The total number of carbons in the ring would be 6, so the starting material must have 8 carbons (so that when 2 carbons are lost in the metathesis, you get a 6-membered ring). Wait, no, I think in metathesis, the number of carbons remains the same. So the starting material is a 8-carbon diene, and the product is a 8-2=6? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because RCM forms a ring, but doesn't lose any carbon. So the starting material is an 8-carbon diene, and the product is a 8-membered ring? No, wait, the target is a cyclohexene, which is 6-membered.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The target has six carbons in the ring. So the starting material must be a diene with six plus two more carbons, making eight. So the starting material is an eight-carbon diene.

Wait, but cyclohexene is 6-membered, so the starting material is an eight-carbon diene, which upon losing two carbons (as two ethylene molecules?), forms the ring. Wait, no, that's olefin metathesis, not ring-closing. Oh wait, in ring-closing metathesis, the diene undergoes cyclization without losing any carbons. So, the starting material is a diene with six carbons plus two more in the chain, making eight.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an eight-carbon diene, and the ring formed is six-membered. So, the diene must have two double bonds in positions that, when the ends are connected, form the six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with two double bonds, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is to imagine the starting material as a diene (monoene, but with two double bonds? No, wait, no). Wait, no, RCM usually involves a single diene that can form a ring upon cyclization.

Wait, perhaps it's a mono-alkene, but coupled with another part of the molecule to form the ring.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should consider the positions of the double bonds in the starting material and how they lead to the target.

In the target, the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 1-2. So, when the ring forms, the metathesis should bring the ends together in such a way that the double bond in the ring is at position 1.

So, the starting material's double bonds should be positioned such that when they undergo metathesis, the double bond ends up in position 1.

Let me think about the metathesis process. When the catalyst (Grubbs) performs RCM, it breaks the double bonds and forms new ones. The mechanism is that the catalyst breaks the two double bonds, rearranges the substituents, and forms a new ring with a new double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has two double bonds, and the metathesis connects the ends, forming a new double bond in the ring.

Wait, but the target has only one double bond. So, the starting material must have two double bonds, but after metathesis, one of them is used to form the ring, and the other is incorporated elsewhere.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with two double bonds, and during RCM, one of the double bonds becomes the ring's double bond, and the other is either removed or used elsewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the positions of the substituents in the starting material.

The target has methyl groups at 3 and 4, and isopropyl at 5. So, in the starting material, these substituents must be at positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at 3,4,5.

Let me consider option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The correct structure would be:

Positions 1 and 6 are double bonds. So the molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me number the octa-1,6-diene.

Carbon 1: CH2=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH2-
Carbon 4: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 5: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 6: CH(CH2CH3)=
Carbon 7: CH2-
Carbon 8: CH2.

Wait, not exactly. Let me write it more accurately.

Option C is octa-1,6-diene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, because it's octa-1,6-diene, so the two double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7 positions.

Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that can't be right. Wait, no, octa-1,6-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that has 8 carbons with double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7. But then where are the substituents?

The substituents are at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2.

No, wait. Numbering the octa-1,6-diene:

Carbon 1: CH2=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 4: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 5: CH(CH2CH3)-
Carbon 6: CH2=
Carbon 7: CH2-
Carbon 8: CH2.

Wait, not quite. Let me write it correctly.

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)-
4: CH(CH3)-
5: CH(CH2CH3)-
6: CH2=
7: CH2-
8: CH3? No, wait, the end would be another CH2. Wait, maybe it's:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, but that would make it an 8-carbon molecule. So the substituents are at 3,4,5.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

The metathesis would connect the ends, swapping the substituents. So the end of the first double bond (C2) would connect to the end of the second double bond (C7). Alternatively, perhaps the C1 and C6 ends would connect.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure.

Let me imagine the molecule as:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2.

So the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7 positions.

During ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would break these double bonds and form new ones. The Grubbs catalyst typically breaks the double bonds and re-forms them by connecting the ends.

So, the metathesis would connect the two ends, forming a ring. Let's see: breaking the double bonds would form two alkenes as parts of the catalyst. Then, the ends would connect, so the CH2 from position 1 would connect to the CH2 from position 7.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis would re-form double bonds in such a way that the ring is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst would cause the double bonds to shift. Let me think about the mechanism.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst (for example, Grubbs) cleaves the two alkenes, and then the ends of the alkenes are connected to form the ring. The catalyst will facilitate the exchange of the substituents across the double bonds.

So, the two double bonds in the starting material are at positions 1 and 6. The metathesis would form a ring by connecting the ends of these double bonds.

So, the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH2.

The metathesis would break the double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7. Then, the catalyst would facilitate the exchange, leading to the formation of a new ring.

The new ring would have the structure where the substituents from positions 3,4,5 are placed correctly.

Let me imagine the ring formation. If the catalyst breaks the double bonds, the CH2 from position 1 is connected to the CH2 from position 7, and the CH2 from position 2 is connected to the CH from position 6.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to imagine that the two double bonds are at the ends of the molecule, and upon metathesis, the ends are connected to form the ring.

In this case, the ring would have six members, as needed for cyclohexene.

So, the starting material has two double bonds at positions 1 and 6. When connected, the ring will have the substituents at positions 3,4,5 in the correct positions.

But wait, the target is 5-isopropyl, 3,4-dimethyl. So in the starting material, the substituents are at 3,4,5, which are in the middle of the chain.

So when the ring forms, those substituents end up at positions 3,4,5 in the cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So the starting material is an 8-carbon diene with substituents at 3,4,5, and double bonds at 1 and 6.

In that case, when the metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 6) will connect, forming a six-membered ring.

Let me count the carbons in the ring. The starting material has eight carbons, but the ring will be six. So the two ends (from carbons 1 and 6) form the ring, with the substituents in between.

So, the ring would have the substituents at the correct positions.

So, the starting material would have double bonds at 1 and 6, and substituents at 3,4,5.

Which option matches that description?

Looking at the options:

Option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Yes, that's positions 1 and 6 as double bonds, and substituents at 3,4,5.

So during metathesis, the double bonds at 1 and 6 would break, and the ends would connect, leading to the cyclohexene with substituents in the correct positions.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option C.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis (RCM), we analyze the target molecule and the options provided. The target molecule is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl), and a double bond at position 1. RCM involves breaking and reforming double bonds to form a ring, so the starting material must be a linear diene with substituents positioned such that, upon cyclization, they end up in the correct positions on the cyclohexene ring.

The starting material must be an eight-carbon diene (octadiene) because RCM forms a six-membered ring by connecting the ends of the molecule. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the target molecule must correspond to positions in the starting material that, after ring formation, result in the correct substituent placement.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7. If RCM occurs, the ends of the molecule (positions 1 and 7) would form the ring. However, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 would not align correctly to produce the target molecule.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2 and 6. If RCM occurs, the ends of the molecule (positions 2 and 6) would form the ring. However, this arrangement would not place the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 correctly in the target molecule.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 6. If RCM occurs, the ends of the molecule (positions 1 and 6) would form the ring. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 are already in the correct positions to yield the target molecule upon cyclization. This matches the requirements for the starting material.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, but the substituents are misplaced. The isopropyl group is at position 4 instead of 5, and the methyl groups are at positions 5 and 6 instead of 3 and 4. This arrangement would not produce the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as its double bonds at positions 1 and 6 and substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 align perfectly for RCM to form the target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.
