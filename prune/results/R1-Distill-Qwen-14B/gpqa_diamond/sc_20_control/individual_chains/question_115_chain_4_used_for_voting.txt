Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

From what I remember, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, like an electron and positron here, they produce photons. Since an electron is moving left and a positron is moving right, they're likely colliding head-on. Their Lorentz factors are given as 4 and 2, respectively. Oh wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, which is the factor by which time and length dilate in special relativity.

But wait, wait. Lorentz factor gamma depends on the speed of the particle. So the electron has gamma=4, and the positron gamma=2. So the electron is moving faster than the positron because gamma increases with speed. Wait, no, actually, higher gamma means higher speed. So the electron is moving faster since gamma is 4, compared to 2 for the positron.

Wait, the electron is moving to the left, and the positron to the right—so their velocities are in opposite directions. But when they collide, since they are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, but I'm not sure if that's needed here.

The problem says that both annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy. The directions: one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but in opposite vertical directions.

The question is asking for the angle between the two photons. So I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, let's think about conservation laws here. Since the system is isolated, both energy and momentum must be conserved.

The system before collision consists of the electron and the positron. After collision, it's two photons. So the total energy and momentum before must equal those after.

Wait, the positron is the antiparticle of the electron. So their masses are the same, but their charges are opposite. But since in this case, their Lorentz factors are different, their energies and momenta will vary.

Let me model this.

First, let's compute the total energy and momentum of the system before collision.

But wait, the electron is moving left, which we'll take as negative x-direction, and the positron moving right as positive x-direction. So their velocities are opposite.

The Lorentz factor gamma for each is given: gamma_e =4 for the electron (moving left), gamma_p=2 for the positron (moving right).

Wait, wait. For each particle, their rest mass is m_e (electron mass, since positron is same mass). So the energy of each is gamma*m_e*c².

So the total energy before collision is E_electron + E_positron = (gamma_e + gamma_p)*m_e c².

Similarly, momentum: the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m_e * v_e, but since it's moving left, it's negative. The positron's momentum is gamma_p * m_e * v_p, positive.

But wait, velocities are tricky because they are relativistic. Let me think. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each particle, we can find v in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, since the problem is about directions and angles, maybe we can model the problem in terms of energy and momentum vectors.

Wait, when the particles annihilate, they produce two photons. Each photon has energy E_photon, same for both. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions (upper-right and lower-right), their momenta are in the same direction (both right), but their vertical components (y-direction) are opposite.

Wait, no. Because each photon is moving in a different direction, so their momentum vectors have components in x and y. Let me clarify: one photon is going upper-right, so its momentum is in positive x and positive y. The other is going lower-right, so positive x and negative y.

Wait, but the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So right is positive x, upper is positive y, lower is negative y.

So let's model the momenta of the photons.

Each photon has energy E_photon = h f, but since both have same energy, E1 = E2 = E.

The momentum of each photon is E/c (since for photons, |p| = E/c). But their directions are different.

Let me denote the photons as photon 1 and photon 2.

Photon 1: direction upper-right, so its momentum vector is (p_x, p_y) = (p, p'), where p = (E/c) cos(theta), p' = (E/c) sin(theta). But since it's upper-right, theta is the angle from the x-axis upwards.

Photon 2: direction lower-right, so its momentum is (p_x, p_y) = (p, -p''), where p'' is the y-component magnitude. Wait, but since both photons have same energy, and E = |p| c, their magnitudes of p are the same. So |p| = E/(c) for each.

Wait, no. Both photons have same energy, so their momenta magnitudes are same. So E1 = E2 = E, so |p1| = |p2| = E/c.

But their directions are different. So the components of their momenta can be written as:

p1_x = (E/c) cos(theta1)

p1_y = (E/c) sin(theta1)

p2_x = (E/c) cos(theta2)

p2_y = (E/c) sin(theta2)

Wait, but photon 2 is going lower-right, so theta2 is measured from the x-axis downward. So sin(theta2) is negative. Alternatively, we can write it as theta2 = -theta, if theta is the angle above the x-axis for photon 1. But perhaps it's easier to take theta as the angle for photon 1 above the x-axis, and 360 - theta for photon 2, but that depends.

But maybe a better approach is to think in terms of vectors. The sum of the momenta of the photons must equal the total momentum before collision.

So, the total momentum after collision is:

p_total_x = p1_x + p2_x

p_total_y = p1_y + p2_y

But wait, the system must conserve momentum. So we need to calculate the initial momentum (sum of electron and positron) and set it equal to the sum of the two photons' momenta.

Similarly for energy.

Let me compute the initial total energy and momentum.

First, energy:

Electron energy: E_e = gamma_e * m_e c² = 4 m_e c².

Positron energy: E_p = gamma_p * m_e c² = 2 m_e c².

So total energy E_initial = (4 + 2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

After annihilation, the two photons have energies E1 and E2, but the problem states they have same energy, E1 = E2 = E.

So total energy after: E_total = E1 + E2 = 2E.

Conservation of energy: 2E =6 m_e c² => E=3 m_e c².

Wait, but wait, that can't be correct because the rest mass energy of an electron is m_e c². So 3 m_e c² is the total energy of the photons. So each photon has E=3 m_e c², but wait, that would mean each photon has energy three times the rest mass energy of the electron. Hmm, perhaps, but I'm not certain. Wait, but let me proceed.

Now, momentum: initial momentum.

Electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

But v_e is the velocity of the electron to the left. So let's compute v_e in terms of gamma_e.

We have gamma_e = 1 / sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²) → gamma_e² = 1/(1 - v_e²/c²) → 1 - v_e²/c² = 1/gamma_e² → v_e²/c² =1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2.

Similarly for the positron: v_p = velocity to the right, with gamma_p=2.

So for electron:
gamma_e =4 → v_e^2 = c² (1 - 1/16) = c² (15/16) → v_e = c * sqrt(15/16) = (c * sqrt(15))/4 ≈ 0.968 c.

Since it's moving left, its velocity is negative, so v_e = - (sqrt(15)/4) c.

Electron momentum p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e =4 m_e ( -sqrt(15)/4 c) ) = - sqrt(15) m_e c.

Similarly, positron's velocity:

gamma_p=2 → v_p^2 = c² (1 -1/(4)) →v_p^2= (3/4) c² → v_p= (sqrt(3)/2) c. Since it's moving right, positive.

Positron momentum p_p= gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e (sqrt(3)/2 c )= sqrt(3) m_e c.

Wait, so the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = (-sqrt(15) m_e c ) + (sqrt(3) m_e c ) = m_e c ( -sqrt(15) + sqrt(3) ) .

Hmm, but that seems negative. Let's compute the numerical value.

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872, sqrt(3)≈1.732. So -3.872 +1.732 ≈ -2.14. So p_initial ≈ -2.14 m_e c.

Wait, but let me think: the electron is moving left, positron right. So their momenta are in opposite directions. The electron's momentum is much larger in magnitude because gamma is higher. So the net initial momentum is to the left (negative x-direction).

But wait, the photons are moving to the right (both have positive x components of momentum), because one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So their total x-momentum is (p1_x + p2_x) in positive x-direction. So if the initial system's momentum is negative, the photons' total momentum should be to the left as well. Wait, that's conflicting. Because if the photons are both moving to the right, their total x-momentum would be positive, but the initial system's momentum is negative. That's impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The electron is moving left, so its momentum is negative. The positron is moving right, positive. So the initial momentum is (momentum of positron) + (momentum of electron). Wait, but the electron is moving left, so its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_p + p_e = [sqrt(3) m_e c ] + [ -sqrt(15) m_e c ] = m_e c ( sqrt(3) - sqrt(15) ) ≈ m_e c (1.732 -3.872 ) ≈ m_e c (-2.14 ) → negative.

So the initial momentum is to the left. Therefore, the photons' total momentum must also be to the left. But wait, the photons are moving to the right, so their momentum is positive. That's a problem because total initial momentum is negative. How can the photons' total momentum sum to a negative value if both are moving to the right?

Ah, wait, no, photons can have their momentum vectors in any direction. Wait, each photon's momentum is a vector. So perhaps one photon is moving to the left and the other to the right, but that's not what the question says. The question says both are moving right, one upper, the other lower.

Wait, the question says one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, so their x-components of momentum are positive, but perhaps the sum is to the left? That can't be—because two positive x-components would sum to a positive.

But the initial system's momentum is negative. So this seems like a contradiction. So maybe I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the positron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive, and the electron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_positron + p_electron.

Wait, did I compute that correctly? Let me re-calculate.

Electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

v_e is to the left, so p_e is negative.

gamma_e =4, so v_e = [sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e²))] c = sqrt(1-1/16)=sqrt(15/16)=sqrt(15)/4 c. So v_e = -sqrt(15)/4 c (negative because left).

p_e = 4 * m_e * (-sqrt(15)/4 c) ) → 4 and 4 cancel, so p_e = - m_e * sqrt(15) c.

Similarly, positron's velocity: v_p = sqrt(1 -1/(gamma_p)^2 ) c. gamma_p=2. So v_p = sqrt(1-1/4)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2 c. Since it's moving right, v_p is positive.

p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c ) → 2 and 2 cancel, so p_p= m_e * sqrt(3) c.

Thus, p_initial = p_e + p_p = [ -sqrt(15) m_e c ] + [ sqrt(3) m_e c ] → m_e c ( -sqrt(15) + sqrt(3) ) ≈ m_e c (-3.872 +1.732 ) ≈ m_e c (-2.14). So the initial momentum is to the left.

But the photons are moving to the right. So their total momentum is p_photon1 + p_photon2 = (p1_x + p2_x) i + (p1_y + p2_y) j.

Since both are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. So p1_x = E/(c) cos(theta1), and p2_x = E/(c) cos(theta2). Since both are right, theta1 and theta2 are in the right direction.

But the sum of their x-components must be equal to the initial x-momentum, which is negative (left). Wait, but that's impossible. If both photons are moving to the right, their x-components are positive, so their sum can't be negative. So this suggests that either the setup is impossible, or I have a mistake.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. How can the photons sum to a negative momentum if they are both moving right. So perhaps one of them is moving left, but the question says both are moving right. Hmm, maybe I've made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the positron is moving to the right, and the electron to the left, but their momenta are such that the total is to the left.

Wait, but the sum of the two photons' x-components must be equal to the initial x-momentum, which is negative. So if the photons' x-components sum to a negative, that would mean that their x-components are in the opposite direction, meaning to the left. But the problem says both are moving to the right. So there's a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the direction of the momenta of the particles. Let me re-express everything.

Let me define the coordinate system: positive x to the right, negative x to the left.

Electron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative, and its momentum is negative.

Positron is moving to the right, so its velocity is positive, and its momentum is positive.

So the initial momentum is p_initial = p_e (negative) + p_p (positive).

Wait, but p_initial is negative. So the sum of the photons' momentum vectors must be equal to that.

But photons are moving to the right. So their x-components are positive. So the sum of their x-components is positive, but p_initial is negative. That can't happen. So that suggests that the setup is impossible, which can't be the case because the question states it happens.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the initial momentum. Let me recheck.

Wait, electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e.

v_e is negative (left), so:

gamma_e =4, v_e = -sqrt(15)/4 c.

p_e =4 * m_e * (-sqrt(15)/4 c) )= - m_e sqrt(15) c.

Positron's momentum, p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p.

v_p = sqrt(3)/2 c, positive.

p_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c) )= sqrt(3) m_e c.

So p_initial = p_e + p_p = (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Which is approximately (-3.872 +1.732) m_e c = (-2.14) m_e c.

So negative, as before.

But the photons' x-momentum is positive. So their sum can't be negative. Hence, the only possibility is that the initial assumption is wrong. So perhaps the photons can't both be moving to the right. But the question states that they are.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the direction. Oh wait, the problem says that the directions of the photons are upper-right and lower-right. So both are moving to the right. So their x-momentum is positive. But the initial momentum is negative, which would require that the sum of the photons' x-momentum is negative. Which can't happen. So that means, perhaps, that one of the photons is moving to the left, and the other to the right. But the question says both are moving right. So now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, the total initial energy is E_initial = E_e + E_p =4 m_e c² +2 m_e c² =6 m_e c².

The photons' total energy is 2E, which must equal 6 m_e c² → E=3 m_e c².

So each photon has energy 3 m_e c². Hmm, but photons can't have energy higher than the rest mass energy unless considering relativistic speeds. Wait, but in annihilation, the rest mass energy is converted into photons. So perhaps this is correct.

Now, let's think about the photon momenta.

Each photon has momentum E/c. So E=3 m_e c² → p_photon = (3 m_e c²)/c =3 m_e c.

So each photon has momentum magnitude 3 m_e c.

But wait, that's a problem because the initial momentum is only about -2.14 m_e c. So the sum of the two photons' momenta would have to be -2.14 m_e c. But each photon has a momentum of 3 m_e c. So how can two such photons sum to something less than each?

Hmm, perhaps the photons are moving in opposite directions along the x-axis. But the problem says their directions are upper-right and lower-right, so their x-components are positive. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with momentum conservation.

The initial momentum is p_initial = [ -sqrt(15) + sqrt(3) ] m_e c ≈ (-3.872 +1.732) m_e c = -2.14 m_e c.

The photons' total momentum must be equal to this.

Each photon has momentum vector (p_x, p_y), with magnitude 3 m_e c, since E=3 m_e c².

So the sum of the two photons' momenta must be:

p1 + p2 = (p1x + p2x, p1y + p2y) = (p_initial_x, p_initial_y).

Wait, but initial momentum is only along x? Because before collision, the particles are moving along the x-axis, so their momenta are along x. So the initial momentum is along x. So the sum of the photons' momenta must also be along x. But wait, the problem states that the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. So their momenta have both x and y components. So how can their sum have zero y-component?

Ah, because the initial y-momentum is zero. So the sum of the photons' y-components must be zero.

So, for the photons, the sum of their y-components must be zero.

Photon 1: y-component = p1y = (3 m_e c) sin(theta1) → since it's upper right, theta1 is positive.

Photon 2: y-component = p2y = (3 m_e c) sin(theta2) → it's lower right, so theta2 is negative, or we can take its sin as negative.

So sum p1y + p2y = 3 m_e c [sin(theta1) + sin(theta2)] =0 → sin(theta1) + sin(theta2) =0 → sin(theta2) = - sin(theta1).

So theta2 = - theta1 or theta2 = 180 - theta1? Wait, no, because sin(theta) = sin(180-theta). But in this case, the angles are in different quadrants. So the sum is zero when theta2 = - theta1.

But the problem says one is upper-right (theta1) and the other is lower-right (theta2). So if theta1 is, say, 30 degrees above x-axis, theta2 would be 30 degrees below, making their sines opposites. So their sum is zero.

Now, considering the x-components.

The sum of the x-components of the photons must equal the initial x-momentum, which is p_initial_x = [ -sqrt(15) + sqrt(3) ] m_e c ≈-2.14 m_e c.

Wait, no, p_initial is [ -sqrt(15) + sqrt(3) ] m_e c ≈-2.14 m_e c.

So sum of the x-components of the photons:

p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c [ cos(theta1) + cos(theta2) ].

But theta2 is such that sin(theta2)= - sin(theta1), which implies theta2 = - theta1. So cos(theta2) = cos(theta1), because cos is even.

So, p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c [ cos(theta1) + cos(theta1) ] = 6 m_e c cos(theta1).

But this must equal p_initial_x, which is approximately -2.14 m_e c.

So:

6 m_e c cos(theta1) = (-2.14) m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta1) = -2.14 → cos(theta1) = (-2.14)/6 ≈ -0.3567.

So theta1 is arccos(-0.3567) ≈ 111 degrees.

Wait, that can't be right because the photons are moving in the upper and lower right directions. So their angles from the x-axis are measured as positive and negative. Wait, but if theta1 is 111 degrees, that's in the second quadrant, meaning the photon is moving to the left and upwards. But the problem says both are moving right.

Wait, something's wrong here. Because if cos(theta1) is negative, that would imply that the photon is moving to the left (negative x-direction). But the problem states that both photons are moving to the right. So this suggests that the calculation is leading to a contradiction, meaning perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial momentum calculation. Let me re-calculate the initial momentum.

Electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e.

v_e is to the left, so v_e = - (sqrt(15)/4) c.

p_e =4 * m_e * (-sqrt(15)/4 c) )= - m_e sqrt(15) c.

Positron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p.

v_p = sqrt(3)/2 c.

p_p =2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2 c )= sqrt(3) m_e c.

So p_initial = p_e + p_p = (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Which is negative, as before.

Now, sum of photons' x-momenta is 6 m_e c cos(theta1) (since theta2 = -theta1).

But 6 m_e c cos(theta1) must equal [ -2.14 m_e c ].

So cos(theta1) = (-2.14) /6 ≈ -0.3567.

So theta1 ≈ 111 degrees. Which would mean the photon is moving in the second quadrant, i.e., to the left and upwards. But the problem says it's moving upper-right. That's a contradiction.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the initial momentum is positive. Because perhaps I inverted the directions. Let me recheck.

Wait, the electron is moving left, so its momentum is negative. The positron is moving right, positive.

So p_initial = p_e + p_p = (-sqrt(15) m_e c) + (sqrt(3) m_e c ) = m_e c ( -3.872 + 1.732 ) ≈ -2.14 m_e c.

So initial momentum is negative, to the left.

But the photons are both moving to the right. So their x-components are positive, leading to a sum that's positive. But initial momentum is negative. So this is impossible.

Wait, that can't be. Therefore, perhaps I have made a mistake in the setup of the problem. Maybe the positron is moving to the left, not the right. Let me read the question again.

Question says: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right. Oh wait, from the right—so the positron is moving towards the left as well? No, wait. If the positron is moving from the right along the horizontal axis, it's moving towards the left, same as the electron. Or wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, the electron is moving from the left (so towards the right), and the positron is moving from the right (so towards the left). So they are approaching each other, moving towards each other.

Wait, that changes everything. Let me re-express that.

Electron: moving from left to right → positive x-direction.

Positron: moving from right to left → negative x-direction.

So their velocities are in opposite directions.

In this case, their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's re-calculate their momenta.

Electron is moving right, gamma_e=4, so p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e.

v_e = [sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e²)] c = sqrt(15/16) c = (sqrt(15)/4) c.

p_e =4 m_e * (sqrt(15)/4 c) )= m_e sqrt(15) c.

Positron is moving left, gamma_p=2. So v_p = sqrt(1 -1/(gamma_p^2)) c = sqrt(3/4) c = (sqrt(3)/2) c.

But since moving left, v_p is negative. So p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p =2 m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) )= - m_e sqrt(3) c.

So the initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = [m_e sqrt(15) c ] + [ - m_e sqrt(3) c ] → m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) ≈ m_e c (3.872 -1.732) ≈ m_e c (2.14).

So initial momentum is positive, to the right.

Now, the photons are moving to the right (upper-right and lower-right), so their x-components are positive. So their sum should be positive, matching the initial momentum.

So let's proceed.

Photons' energies are same, E=3 m_e c².

Each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c =3 m_e c.

The sum of their momenta must equal the initial momentum.

So, the sum of x-components: p1x + p2x =3 m_e c ( cos(theta1) + cos(theta2) ) = initial_p_x = 2.14 m_e c.

And the sum of y-components: p1y + p2y =3 m_e c ( sin(theta1) + sin(theta2) ) =0.

So, similar to before, sin(theta1) + sin(theta2) =0 → theta2 = -theta1.

So, cos(theta1) + cos(theta2) = cos(theta1) + cos(-theta1) = 2 cos(theta1).

So,

2 cos(theta1) *3 m_e c = 2.14 m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta1) = 2.14 → cos(theta1) = 2.14/6 ≈0.3567.

So theta1 ≈ arccos(0.3567) ≈69 degrees.

Wait, that makes sense. So theta1 is about 69 degrees above the x-axis, and theta2 is -69 degrees, 69 degrees below x-axis.

So the photons are moving at +69 and -69 degrees relative to the x-axis. So their angle between them is theta1 - theta2 = 69 - (-69)= 138 degrees.

Which matches option C, 138 degrees.

Alternatively, the angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product. The angle between the two photons' directions is 2 theta1, since each deviates from the x-axis by theta1 on either side.

Wait, no. Because one is at +theta1 and the other at -theta1, the angle between them is 2 theta1.

So if theta1 is 69 degrees, the angle between them is 138 degrees. So option C is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision of an electron and a positron, which annihilate to produce two photons of equal energy. The photons move in opposite vertical directions but both to the right. We aim to determine the angle between their directions.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Using their Lorentz factors, their energies are:  
   \[
   E_{\text{electron}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2, \quad E_{\text{positron}} = \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 2 m_e c^2
   \]  
   Thus, the total energy is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
   \]  
   After annihilation, the two photons share this energy equally:  
   \[
   E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2
   \]

2. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   The initial momentum is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Their relativistic momenta are calculated as:  
   \[
   p_{\text{electron}} = \gamma_e m_e v_{\text{electron}}, \quad p_{\text{positron}} = \gamma_p m_e v_{\text{positron}}
   \]  
   Using the relativistic relation \(v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}\), the velocities are:  
   \[
   v_{\text{electron}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4^2}} = c \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}, \quad v_{\text{positron}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2^2}} = c \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]  
   Substituting these into the momentum expressions:  
   \[
   p_{\text{electron}} = 4 m_e \left(-\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} c\right) = -m_e \sqrt{15} c, \quad p_{\text{positron}} = 2 m_e \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} c\right) = -m_e \sqrt{3} c
   \]  
   The total initial momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{electron}} + p_{\text{positron}} = -m_e \sqrt{15} c - m_e \sqrt{3} c = -m_e c (\sqrt{15} + \sqrt{3})
   \]  
   Approximating:  
   \[
   \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732, \quad p_{\text{initial}} \approx -m_e c (3.872 + 1.732) = -5.604 m_e c
   \]

3. **Photon Momentum Components**:  
   Each photon has energy \(E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2\), and its momentum magnitude is \(p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c\).  
   Let the angles of the photons relative to the x-axis be \(\theta_1\) (upper-right) and \(\theta_2\) (lower-right). The momentum components are:  
   \[
   p_{1x} = 3 m_e c \cos\theta_1, \quad p_{1y} = 3 m_e c \sin\theta_1
   \]  
   \[
   p_{2x} = 3 m_e c \cos\theta_2, \quad p_{2y} = 3 m_e c \sin\theta_2
   \]  
   Since the photons are symmetric about the x-axis, \(\theta_2 = -\theta_1\), so \(\cos\theta_2 = \cos\theta_1\) and \(\sin\theta_2 = -\sin\theta_1\).

4. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   The total momentum after annihilation must equal the total momentum before annihilation.  
   - In the x-direction:  
     \[
     p_{1x} + p_{2x} = 3 m_e c (\cos\theta_1 + \cos\theta_2) = 3 m_e c (2 \cos\theta_1)
     \]  
     This must equal the initial x-momentum:  
     \[
     6 m_e c \cos\theta_1 = -5.604 m_e c \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos\theta_1 = \frac{-5.604}{6} \approx -0.934
     \]  
   - In the y-direction:  
     \[
     p_{1y} + p_{2y} = 3 m_e c (\sin\theta_1 + \sin\theta_2) = 3 m_e c (\sin\theta_1 - \sin\theta_1) = 0
     \]  
     This is consistent with the initial y-momentum being zero.

5. **Angle Between Photons**:  
   The angle between the two photons is \(2\theta_1\). Using \(\cos\theta_1 \approx -0.934\):  
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arccos(-0.934) \approx 157^\circ
   \]  
   Thus, the angle between the photons is:  
   \[
   2\theta_1 = 2 \times 157^\circ = 314^\circ
   \]  
   However, since angles are periodic modulo \(360^\circ\), the smaller angle between the photons is:  
   \[
   360^\circ - 314^\circ = 46^\circ
   \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **46 degrees**.
