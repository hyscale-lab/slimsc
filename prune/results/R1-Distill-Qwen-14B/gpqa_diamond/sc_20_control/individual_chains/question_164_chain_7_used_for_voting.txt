Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my binary star concepts, but let's try to break it down.

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods—so that's the time between two primary eclipses. System_1's period is 2 years, and system_2's is 1 year. The problem is about figuring out the mass ratio or something related to determine how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2.

Wait, the question says, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So the mass of system_1 divided by the mass of system_2. Got it.

The other data given are the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have RV variations of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s. Oh right, in binary systems, the stars orbit their common center of mass. The RV amplitudes are related to their masses. The more massive star will have a smaller RV amplitude because it's moving less, right? Because the more massive object has a larger influence on the other, so the less massive one moves more.

So I think the RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. So if star A has a mass M_A and star B has mass M_B, their RV amplitudes K_A and K_B are inversely related. So K_A / K_B = M_B / M_A.

Wait, let me think. The two stars orbit each other. The more massive one has a smaller orbit. So the velocity is proportional to the size of the orbit. Since velocity is 2πa/P, where a is the semi-major axis, and P is the period. But in a binary system, the ratio of the semi-major axes is a_A/a_B = M_B/M_A. Because they're orbiting the same center of mass, so M_A * a_A = M_B * a_B.

So the velocities are v_A = (2π a_A)/P and v_B = (2π a_B)/P. So the ratio v_A/v_B = a_A/a_B = M_B/M_A.

So if K_A is the RV amplitude for star A, and K_B for star B, then K_A/K_B = M_B/M_A.

Wait, so K_A is the velocity of star A, which is proportional to a_A, which is (M_B/(M_A + M_B)) * a_total, where a_total is the separation. Similarly for K_B. So K_A = (2π a_A)/P, K_B = (2π a_B)/P. So K_A/K_B = a_A/a_B. But a_A = (M_B/(M_A + M_B)) * a_total, and a_B = (M_A/(M_A + M_B)) * a_total. So a_A/a_B = M_B/M_A.

So K_A/K_B = M_B/M_A.

So in system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5 km/s. Let's say star A has K_A =10, star B K_B=5. Then K_A/K_B = 2 = M_B/M_A. So M_B = 2 M_A. So the mass of the system is M_A + M_B = M_A + 2 M_A = 3 M_A. The mass ratio M_A/(M_B) is 1/2.

Wait, wait, but the question is about the mass of each system. So system_1 has a total mass of M1 = M_A1 + M_B1. Similarly, system_2 has M2 = M_A2 + M_B2.

So the ratio M1/M2 is what we need.

So for system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. So K1A=10, K1B=5. So K1A/K1B = 2 = M1B/M1A. So M1B = 2 M1A.

So M1 = M1A + M1B = M1A + 2 M1A = 3 M1A. So M1A = M1 /3, M1B = 2 M1/3.

Similarly, in system_2, RV amplitudes are 15 and 10. K2A=15, K2B=10. So K2A/K2B = 15/10 = 3/2. So M2B/M2A = 3/2. So M2B = (3/2) M2A.

So M2 = M2A + M2B = M2A + (3/2) M2A = (5/2) M2A. So M2A = (2/5) M2, M2B = (3/5) M2.

But how do we relate the total masses M1 and M2?

Ah, I think we also have to consider the period and the fact that the period is the same for both stars in a system. Because in a binary system, both stars orbit with the same period.

Wait, but how else can we relate their masses? Because the mass function might come into play here. The mass function relates the period, the velocities, and the masses.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the fact that the velocity semi-amplitudes are related to the masses and the period.

Wait, let me think about the mass function. The mass function for a binary system is given by:

f(M) = (M_B^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

But in the case of an eclipsing binary, the inclination i is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So f(M) ≈ M_B^3 / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

But the mass function can also be expressed in terms of the observed velocities and the period.

The formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = (K_A^3 P) / (241 * (1 - e^2)^1.5 )

Assuming a circular orbit (e ≈0), it simplifies to:

f(M) = (K_A^3 P) / 241.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact units here. Let's think in terms of SI units, but perhaps we can avoid getting into that.

Wait, but both stars in each system have their own K values. So for system 1:

f1 = (K1A^3 P1) / 241 = (10^3 * 2) / 241.

Similarly for system 2: f2 = (K2A^3 P2) / 241 = (15^3 * 1) /241.

But f(M) is M_B^3/( (M_A + M_B)^2 ), and since in system 1, M_B is the more massive star (since K1A is larger than K1B, so M_B is larger?), but wait in system 1, K1A=10 and K1B=5. So from earlier, M1B = 2 M1A. So M1 =3 M1A.

So for system 1's mass function f1 = (M1B^3 )/( (M1)^2 ) = ( (2 M1A)^3 ) / ( (3 M1A)^2 ) = (8 M1A^3 )/(9 M1A^2 ) )= (8/9) M1A.

Similarly, system 2: M2B = (3/2) M2A, so M2 = (5/2) M2A.

f2 = (M2B^3 )/( (M2)^2 ) = ( ( (3/2 M2A )^3 ) ) / ( (5/2 M2A )^2 ) = (27/8 M2A^3 ) / (25/4 M2A^2 ) )= (27/8) / (25/4) * M2A = (27/8 * 4/25) ) M2A = (27/50) M2A.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Maybe instead, since the mass function for each system can be calculated from the observed K and period, and the actual mass can be related.

Wait, but the mass function f(M) is the same for both stars in the system because f(M) depends on both masses. But in reality, each star's f(M) is the same. Or perhaps only for one of the stars.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Maybe there's a simpler approach.

Let me think again about the velocities. Since the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to their masses. So for system_1, M1 = M1A + M1B. And since K1A/K1B = 2, as earlier, M1B = 2 M1A. So M1 = 3 M1A.

Similarly, for system_2, K2A=15, K2B=10, so ratio 3/2. So M2B = (3/2) M2A. So M2 = (5/2) M2A.

Now, the mass of each system is M1 and M2. We need to find M1/M2.

But how?

Ah, perhaps we can relate the velocities and the periods. Because the velocities are linked to the masses and the orbital period.

Wait, the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) * ( (M2 sin i) ) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) (1 + M1/M2) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I remember that in a binary system, the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion and the period.

Wait, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = (2 π G )^ (1/3) * (M_comp sin i) / ( ( (M_primary + M_comp)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P year * (1 + M_primary/M_comp)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude.

The formula is:

K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_p + M_s) )^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

Where M_p is the mass of the primary (the more massive star), M_s is the mass of the secondary. sin i is approximately 1 for eclipsing binaries.

But wait, the formula actually for K (the semi-amplitude) is:

K = (v) = [ (G * P ) / (2 π) ]^(-1/3) * (M sin i) / ( (M + M') )^(2/3) )

Hmm, maybe I should look for a way to relate the velocities and the masses across the two systems.

Wait, another approach: for each system, we can write the velocity amplitudes in terms of the masses and the period. Since the periods are different, that will factor in.

In a binary system, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1, where K1 is the velocity of star 1 and K2 the velocity of star 2.

But in this problem, each system has two stars with known K values. So in system_1, K1A=10 and K1B=5, so K1A/K1B = 2 = M1B/M1A.

So M1B = 2 M1A, so M1 = M1A + M1B = 3 M1A.

Similarly, in system_2, K2A=15, K2B=10. Ratio is 15/10=3/2. So M2B= (3/2) M2A. So M2 = M2A + M2B = (5/2) M2A.

But how to relate M1 and M2.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the velocity amplitude is also related to the period and the masses.

I think the key is to consider the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude, K.

The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / [ ( (M_p + M_s) )^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ]

Assuming sin i ≈ 1 (since eclipsing binaries are edge-on), and for simplicity, let's assume M_p is the primary (the more massive) star.

But wait, in our case, each star has a K value. So for each system, we can write two equations.

Wait, for system_1:

Let me call the two stars as M1A and M1B. M1A is the more massive (since K1A is larger, so M1B is more massive than M1A? Wait, no. Wait the larger K implies smaller mass. Because K is inversely proportional to mass. So if K1A is 10 and K1B is 5, since 10>5, M1B is larger than M1A. Wait wait, K_A is for star A, and K_B is for star B. So if star A's velocity is higher, that would mean star A is less massive. So M1B is more massive than M1A.

So in system_1, M1B = 2 M1A.

Thus, M1 = M1A + 2 M1A = 3 M1A.

So, M1A = M1/3, M1B = 2 M1/3.

Similarly, in system_2, K2A=15, K2B=10. So K2A/K2B = 15/10=3/2 → M2B = (3/2) M2A.

Thus, M2 = M2A + M2B = (5/2) M2A → M2A = (2/5) M2.

So M2A = (2/5) M2, M2B = (3/5) M2.

Now, for each system, the velocity semi-amplitude can be related to the mass and period.

Let me write the formula for K for each star.

For system_1, star A (K1A=10):

K1A = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M1B) ) / [ (M1)^(2/3) * (P1)^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me get the formula right. The semi-amplitude for star A is:

K1A = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M1B sin i) ) / [ ( (M1A + M1B) )^(2/3) * (P1)^(1/3) ) ]

Similarly, K1B is:

K1B = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M1A sin i) ) / [ ( (M1A + M1B) )^(2/3) * (P1)^(1/3) ) ]

But since sin i is the same for both and P is same for both stars in the system, the ratio K1A/K1B is equal to M1B / M1A.

Which we already know, it's 2. So that checks out.

Similarly, for system_2, K2A/K2B = M2B / M2A = 3/2, which aligns with our earlier findings.

So, the key is perhaps to find the ratio of the masses of the systems.

Wait, but each K is different. So perhaps we can take the ratio of K1A and K2A, considering the periods.

Let me write the formula for K1A and K2A.

K1A = [ (2 π G )^(1/3) * M1B ] / [ (M1)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Similarly,

K2A = [ (2 π G )^(1/3) * M2B ] / [ ( M2 )^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )

Take the ratio K1A / K2A:

= [ ( M1B ) / (M1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ] / [ ( M2B ) / ( M2^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ) ]

= [ M1B * M2^(2/3) P2^(1/3) ) ] / [ M2B * M1^(2/3) P1^(1/3) ) ]

We can rearrange this.

We know that M1B = 2 M1A, and M1 = 3 M1A → M1A = M1/3.

Similarly, M2B = (3/2) M2A, and M2 = (5/2) M2A → M2A = (2/5) M2.

So substituting,

M1B = 2*(M1/3) = (2/3) M1

M2B = (3/2) * (2 M2/5) ) → Wait, M2A is (2/5) M2, so M2B = 3/2 * (2/5 M2) )= (3/5) M2.

So now, substituting into the ratio:

[ (2/3 M1) * (M2)^(2/3) * (1)^(1/3) ) ] / [ (3/5 M2) * (M1)^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, because P1 is 2 years and P2 is 1 year.

So P1=2, P2=1.

So the ratio becomes:

[ (2/3 M1) * (M2)^(2/3) * (1)^(1/3) ) ] / [ (3/5 M2) * (M1)^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (2/3 M1) * M2^(2/3) * 1

Denominator: (3/5 M2) * M1^(2/3) * 2^(1/3)

So the ratio is:

(2/3 M1 * M2^(2/3)) / (3/5 M2 * M1^(2/3) * 2^(1/3)) )

Simplify:

= [ (2/3) / (3/5) ) * ( M1 / M1^(2/3) ) * ( M2^(2/3) / M2 ) ) * 1/(2^(1/3)) ]

Let's compute each part:

(2/3)/(3/5) = (2/3) * (5/3) )= 10/9

M1 / M1^(2/3) = M1^(1 - 2/3) = M1^(1/3)

M2^(2/3) / M2 = M2^(2/3 - 1) )= M2^(-1/3) = 1/(M2^(1/3))

So putting it all together:

(10/9) * M1^(1/3) / ( M2^(1/3) ) * 1/(2^(1/3)) )

So:

= (10/9) * (M1/M2)^(1/3) * (1/2^(1/3)) )

But K1A=10, K2A=15. So the ratio K1A/K2A is 10/15 = 2/3.

So,

2/3 = (10/9) * (M1/M2)^(1/3) * (1/2^(1/3)) )

Let me write that equation:

(10/9) * (M1/M2)^(1/3) * (1/2^(1/3)) ) = 2/3

Now, solve for (M1/M2).

Multiply both sides by (9/10):

( (M1/M2)^(1/3) ) * (1/2^(1/3)) ) )= (2/3) * (9/10) )

Calculate (2/3)*(9/10)= (18)/(30) = 3/5.

So,

(M1/M2)^(1/3) * (1/2^(1/3)) )= 3/5

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/3):

(M1/M2)^(1/3) = (3/5) * 2^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

M1/M2 = ( (3/5) )^3 * [2^(1/3)]^3

Which is:

(27/125) * 2 = 54/125 ≈ 0.432.

So M1 is about 0.432 times M2. Wait, but the question asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. Wait, no, wait: M1 is 0.432 times M2, so system_1 is less massive than system_2. But that's not one of the options. Let me check the options.

Options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

Hmm, 0.432 is closest to option A which is ~0.4. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let's go through the calculation again.

We set up the ratio K1A/K2A = (2/3) = [ (10/9) * (M1/M2)^(1/3) * (1/2^(1/3)) ) ]

So,

(10/9) * (M1/M2)^(1/3) * (1/2^(1/3)) ) = 2/3.

So,

(M1/M2)^(1/3) = [ (2/3) / (10/9) ) ] * 2^(1/3)

Wait, let me recompute.

Wait, the equation is:

(10/9) * (M1/M2)^(1/3) * (1/2^(1/3)) ) = 2/3

So solving for (M1/M2)^(1/3):

(M1/M2)^(1/3) = (2/3) * (9/10) ) * 2^(1/3)

Wait, because 10/9 is in the denominator:

(M1/M2)^(1/3) = [ (2/3) / (10/9) ) ] * 2^(1/3)

Which is:

(2/3) * (9/10) ) = (18)/(30) = 3/5.

So,

(M1/M2)^(1/3) = (3/5) * 2^(1/3)

Then, cube both sides:

M1/M2 = (3/5)^3 * 2

Because [2^(1/3)]^3 is 2. So,

= (27/125) * 2 = 54/125 ≈ 0.432.

So system_1 is about 0.432 times as massive as system_2, meaning system_1 is less massive. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive is approximately 0.43, which is about 0.4, option A.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2." So if system_1 is less massive, the factor is less than 1. So 0.43 times. So the answer would be A) ~0.4.

But wait, another thought. Did I correctly assign M1B and M2B as more massive because the K is lower? Because when K is larger, the star is moving faster, implying it's less massive. So in system_1, K1A=10 (larger), so M1A is less massive than M1B. So M1B is 2 M1A, which makes sense.

In system_2, K2A=15, so M2A is less than M2B. So M2B is (3/2) M2A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting M1B and M2B. Let's check.

Earlier, I substituted M1B as (2/3) M1, because M1B = 2 M1A and M1 =3 M1A, so M1B = (2/3) M1.

Similarly, M2B = (3/5) M2.

So that part was correct.

So, the calculation seems correct, leading to M1/M2 ≈ 0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4). But wait, the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the masses more directly.

Another approach: Let's compute the total mass for each system in terms of the velocities and periods.

Wait, another formula for the mass function:

f(M) = (M_B^3 sin^3 i)/( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

But since sin i is approx 1, f(M) = M_B^3/( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

And f(M) can also be written as:

f(M) = (K_A^3 P ) / (241 )

Assuming P is in years, K in km/s, and f(M) in solar masses.

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall the formula.

Yes, the mass function is given by:

f(M) = (K^3 P ) / (241 )

Where K is in km/s, P is in years, and f(M) is in solar masses.

So for system_1, using K1A =10 km/s, P1=2 years.

f1 = (10^3 * 2 ) / 241 ≈ (1000 * 2)/241 ≈ 2000/241 ≈ 8.298 solar masses.

Wait, but that can't be right because K1A is the velocity of star A, which is less massive than star B.

Wait, but the mass function is calculated using the velocity of the primary (the more massive star). Wait, no. The mass function is the same regardless of which star you observe. So f(M) doesn't depend on which star's velocity you use, but in reality, it's the same. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it differently.

Wait, for the mass function, f(M) = (M_B^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M_A + M_B)^2 )

But for system_1, M_B is the more massive star (M1B = 2 M1A, and M1A is less massive).

So, f1 = ( (2 M1A)^3 ) / ( (3 M1A)^2 ) ) = (8 M1A^3 )/(9 M1A^2 ) )= (8/9) M1A.

But f1 is also (10^3 * 2 ) /241 = 2000/241 ≈ 8.298.

So,

(8/9) M1A = 8.298 → M1A = (8.298 *9 ) /8 ≈ (74.682) /8 ≈ 9.335 solar masses.

Then, M1B=2 M1A= 18.67 solar masses.

M1 = 9.335 + 18.67 ≈ 27.005 solar masses.

Similarly, for system_2, we can compute f2.

In system_2, K2A=15 km/s, P2=1 year.

f2 = (15^3 * 1 ) /241 = (3375) /241 ≈ 14.003 solar masses.

Now, f2 = (M2B^3 )/( (M2A + M2B)^2 )

But we know that M2B = (3/2) M2A.

So,

f2 = ( ( (3/2 M2A )^3 ) ) / ( (5/2 M2A )^2 )

= (27/8 M2A^3 )/(25/4 M2A^2 )

= (27/8) / (25/4) * M2A

= (27/8) * (4/25) ) * M2A = (27/50) M2A.

Set this equal to f2=14.003:

(27/50) M2A = 14.003 → M2A= (14.003 *50 ) /27 ≈ 700.15 /27 ≈ 25.93 solar masses.

Then, M2B= (3/2)*25.93 ≈ 38.895 solar masses.

M2=25.93 +38.895 ≈ 64.825 solar masses.

Now, compute M1/M2.

M1 ≈27.005, M2≈64.825.

So 27.005 /64.825 ≈ 0.4175.

So approximately 0.418, which is about 0.42. So the factor is about 0.42, which is closest to option A (0.4).

So the answer should be A) ~0.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity (RV) amplitudes, masses, and orbital periods in binary star systems. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Mass Ratio from RV Amplitudes**:  
   The RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars. For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, giving a ratio \( K_{1A}/K_{1B} = 2 \). This implies \( M_{1B} = 2 M_{1A} \). The total mass of system_1 is:  
   \[
   M_1 = M_{1A} + M_{1B} = M_{1A} + 2 M_{1A} = 3 M_{1A}.
   \]

   For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, giving a ratio \( K_{2A}/K_{2B} = 3/2 \). This implies \( M_{2B} = \frac{3}{2} M_{2A} \). The total mass of system_2 is:  
   \[
   M_2 = M_{2A} + M_{2B} = M_{2A} + \frac{3}{2} M_{2A} = \frac{5}{2} M_{2A}.
   \]

2. **Expressing Masses in Terms of Total Mass**:  
   For system_1:  
   \[
   M_{1A} = \frac{M_1}{3}, \quad M_{1B} = \frac{2 M_1}{3}.
   \]  
   For system_2:  
   \[
   M_{2A} = \frac{2 M_2}{5}, \quad M_{2B} = \frac{3 M_2}{5}.
   \]

3. **Relating Velocities and Periods**:  
   The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is related to the masses and orbital period \( P \) by the formula:  
   \[
   K = \frac{(2 \pi G)^{1/3} M_{\text{companion}} \sin i}{(M_{\text{primary}} + M_{\text{companion}})^{2/3} P^{1/3}}}.
   \]  
   Assuming \( \sin i \approx 1 \) for eclipsing binaries, the ratio of \( K \) values between the two systems can be used to relate their total masses. For system_1 and system_2:  
   \[
   \frac{K_{1A}}{K_{2A}} = \frac{(M_{1B} / M_1^{2/3} P_1^{1/3})}{(M_{2B} / M_2^{2/3} P_2^{1/3})}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( M_{1B} = \frac{2 M_1}{3} \), \( M_{2B} = \frac{3 M_2}{5} \), \( P_1 = 2 \), and \( P_2 = 1 \), the ratio simplifies to:  
   \[
   \frac{K_{1A}}{K_{2A}} = \frac{(2/3) M_1^{1/3} P_2^{1/3}}{(3/5) M_2^{1/3} P_1^{1/3}}}.
   \]  
   Using \( K_{1A} = 10 \) and \( K_{2A} = 15 \), the ratio \( K_{1A}/K_{2A} = 2/3 \) is substituted to solve for \( M_1/M_2 \). After simplifying, the result is:  
   \[
   M_1/M_2 \approx 0.432.
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:  
   The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately \( 0.43 \), which is closest to option **A) ~0.4**.
