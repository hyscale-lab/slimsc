Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nucleons and particle emission. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state, and they emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1.

The question is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from 1S0 to some other state plus a particle. I need to determine which one isn't allowed based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

Wait, the given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Oh right, T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So when the final NN state has T=0, what does that imply about the sum of S, L, and 1?

Wait, the equation is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. If T is 0, then 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L +1 must be even. So S + L must be odd. So S and L have opposite parities. That is, if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

But wait, for the NN system, the total spin S is the sum of their individual spins. Since they are nucleons (protons and neutrons), but the initial state is 1S0. 1S0 implies a spin state of S=0, because 1S0 is (2S+1)L... Wait, 1S0 would be (2*0+1) =1, so L is 0. So initial state is S=0, L=0.

Wait, but the problem is about the final state after emission. So the emission of a particle X changes the state. So the initial is 1S0, and the final NN state has T=0.

Wait, the problem is about the Pauli exclusion principle and the statistical properties. The emitted particle is X. So the parity and angular momentum must be conserved?

Wait, but the problem says that the conservation of both angular momentum and parity must be considered. So I think I need to look at both the parity and the angular momentum.

So first, let me think about the parity. The initial state is 1S0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L, because parity operator P has eigenvalues (-1)^L for orbital angular momentum. For the initial state, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0=1. But when the particle X is emitted, the parity of the final state should be the product of the parity of the initial, the parity of X, and any possible change due to orbital angular momentum. Hmm, wait, I think the parity of the system before and after should be conserved.

Wait, when a particle is emitted, the overall parity of the system (including X) must be conserved. So the parity of the initial state (NN system) is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. Since initial L_initial is 0, P_initial =1.

After emission, the final state is the NN pair in some state (L', S', T') and the emitted particle X in some state with angular momentum l. The parity of X is given as intrinsic parity -1. The parity of the final state would be P_final = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN pair in the final state.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the total parity before and after. The total parity before emission is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial, which is 1, as L_initial is 0.

After emission, the parity is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X, multiplied by (-1)^(L'), where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle's state? Or perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN pair in the final state.

Wait, perhaps I should model the reaction as NN → NN' + X. The parity is conserved, so P_initial = P_final_NN * P_final_X * (-1)^(L'), where L' is the orbital angular momentum between the NN' and X.

Wait, maybe that's not quite right. Alternatively, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The initial parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial =1.

After emission, the system is the NN' plus X. The parity of the NN' is (-1)^{L'}, and the parity of X is given as intrinsic parity -1. The orbital angular momentum between the emitted particle and the NN' would contribute a (-1)^(l), where l is the orbital angular momentum in the decay. So the total parity after is [ (-1)^{L'} ] * [ (-1)^l ] * P_X.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to model the parity as the product of the parity of each part. But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the parity conservation.

The initial parity is (NN system) P_initial = (-1)^L_initial = 1.

The final state consists of the NN' state and the emitted X. The parity of the final state should be equal to the initial parity.

So, P_final = P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X. Because when you emit a particle, its orbital angular momentum contributes a factor of (-1)^L. Wait, that's because the orbital angular momentum contributes to the parity.

Wait, so the parity of the final state is [ P_NN' ) * ( P_X ) ] multiplied by ( -1 )^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.

So, overall, the parity must satisfy:

P_initial = P_NN' * P_X * (-1)^L.

We know P_initial is 1, and P_X is -1.

So:

1 = (P_NN') * (-1) * (-1)^L.

Rearranging:

P_NN' = (-1) * (-1)^L.

But P_NN' is the parity of the NN' state, which is (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' state in the final state.

So, (-1)^(L') = (-1) * (-1)^L.

Simplifying the right side: (-1)^{L+1}.

So, (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{L +1}.

Which implies that L' ≡ L +1 mod 2. So L' and L have opposite parity.

So, L' must be odd if L is even, or even if L is odd.

Wait, that's an important point. So, the orbital angular momentum L' of the NN' state must have opposite parity to L, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.

Hmm, but what is L for the emitted particle X? For each option, X is in a certain angular momentum state. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p

So the X here is a proton (p) in a state with l=1? Because D is l=2, wait no, in spectroscopic notation, S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So if the emitted particle is in a D state, l=2.

Wait, no, wait. The term after the arrow is the state of the NN system plus the emitted particle. Wait, no, the format is: initial state → final state + particle X.

Wait, the options are in the format "1S0 → ... + p", etc. The first part is the initial state, the second is the final state of NN plus the emitted particle X.

Wait, perhaps the emitted particle X is in a state denoted by the lowercase letter. For example, option A is 1S0 →7D1 + p. So the emitted particle is a proton (p) in a state with l=1 (since the letter is p, which is P, so l=1).

Wait, because the emitted particle's angular momentum state is given by the lower case letters. For example, s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.

So for each option, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum l is determined by the lower-case letter. So for option A, the particle is p, which is l=1.

So in option A, the X has l=1. So L is 1.

Then, from earlier, L' must be ≡ L +1 mod 2. So L' is 1 +1 =2 mod 2 → 0. So L' is even.

So the parity condition requires that L' is even. So the NN' state in the final state must have even L'.

Additionally, the other condition is about the isospin. The problem states that for the final NN state, T = S + L +1 mod 2, and T=0. So,

0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2 → S and L have opposite parity.

So for the final NN state, their spin S and orbital angular momentum L must have opposite parities.

Wait, but the NN state's spin S is the total spin. Since each nucleon has spin 1/2, the possible S is 0 or 1. So S can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). The parity is determined by L, but the condition is that S and L must be opposite in parity. So if S is even (0 is even?), then L must be odd, and vice versa.

Wait, S can be 0 or 1. 0 is even (since 0 mod 2 is 0), 1 is odd. So if S is 0, L must be odd. If S is 1, L must be even.

So, combining this with the parity condition from earlier:

The orbital angular momentum L' of the NN' state must be even (since L is 1 for option A).

Wait, for option A, X has l=1, so L is 1. Then L' must be L +1 mod 2 → 1+1=2 → 0 mod 2. So L' is even.

So the NN' state must have L' even.

Now, the final NN' state's L' must be even, and the spin S must have opposite parity. So if L' is even, S must be odd.

Because from the condition S + L' ≡1 mod 2. Since L' is even (0 mod 2), S must be 1 mod 2, so S=1.

So for the final state, S=1 and L' even.

Now, looking at the options, let's evaluate each one.

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p.

The final NN state is 7D1. So the state's L is D=2. So L'=2.

So L' is even (2 is even). So S must be 1.

So the NN' state would have S=1, L=2.

So that's allowed. Now, we have to check if the angular momentum is conserved.

Wait, the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial state has J_initial = 0 (since it's 1S0: J=0). The final state's J would be the sum of the angular momentum from the NN' state and the emitted particle X.

Wait, but how is the angular momentum conserved here? The initial total J is 0. The final state's total J must be the sum of the NN' J (J_NN) and the X's J (J_X), considering their orbital angular momentum.

Wait, more precisely, the initial system has J_initial =0. After emission, the system is the NN' plus X, with orbital angular momentum between them being l (from the lower-case letter).

So the total angular momentum after emission would be the sum of the orbital angular momentum l (for X), and the spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN' state.

Wait, but the NN' state has its own J = S' (spin) + L' (orbital), but in the problem statement, the final state is given in (2S'+1)L'(J') notation. Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which is (2*0+1) S (L=0) with J=0.

The final state is written as, for example, 7D1. Let me parse that. 7D1: (2S +1)=7 → S=3 (since 2*3+1=7). L is D=2. So L'=2. J=1. So J_NN' is 1.

The emitted particle is in a state with l=1 (p state), so the orbital angular momentum between X and the NN' is l=1.

Wait, but how does the total angular momentum add up? The initial J is 0. The final J must be the sum of J_NN' and the orbital angular momentum l, but taken vectorially. So the total J after must be zero, because angular momentum is conserved.

So the possible scenario is that the total J of the final state (NN' plus X) must be zero.

Wait, but that's tricky because it's a vector sum. So for the final state, J_NN' and l must combine to zero. So J_NN' and l must have the same magnitude and opposite directions.

But J_NN' is the total angular momentum of the NN' state, which is given by J' in the term symbol. For example, in option A, J_NN' is 1, and l is 1.

So the sum of these must be zero.

Wait, but 1 and 1 can't sum to zero. Because the possible total angular momenta when adding two 1's are 0, 1, or 2. So if J_NN' is 1 and l is 1, their vector sum could be 0, 1, or 2.

But the initial J was 0. So the final J must also be 0. So their sum must be zero. So it's possible only if the J_NN' and l have the same magnitude and opposite directions, but that's only possible if their sum can be zero.

Wait, but the sum of two spin-1 particles can result in zero. So, in the case where J_NN' is 1 and l is 1, the total angular momentum could be zero if their individual angular momenta are opposite.

But that's possible, but perhaps the question is more about parity and isospin than the detailed angular momentum addition.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's instead look at each option and see which ones violate the parity and isospin conditions.

So, for each option:

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p.

Emit a proton (p) with l=1.

So L (l) is 1.

L' for the NN' state is 2 (D=2).

Check the parity condition: L' must be even, which it is (2 is even). So parity is satisfied.

Now, the isospin condition: T=0.

In the final state, the NN' state has S=3 (from 7D1: 2S+1=7 → S=3) and L'=2.

So S=3 (odd) and L'=2 (even). Since S + L' must be odd (because T = S + L +1 mod 2 =0 → S + L' must be 1 mod 2).

3 + 2 = 5 → 1 mod 2. So that's correct. So isospin condition is satisfied.

Now, check if J_NN' and l can combine to zero.

J_NN' is 1, l is 1. So possible sums are 0,1,2. So the total J could be zero. So angular momentum is allowed.

So option A is allowed.

Option B: 1S0 →3S1 + p.

Wait, 3S1: (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S, which is 0. So L'=0.

Emit a proton, which is l=1.

Parity condition:

L (l) is 1. So L' must be even (since L'= L+1 mod 2 → 1+1=2→0 mod 2). But L' here is 0, which is even. So parity condition is satisfied.

Isospin condition: S=1 (odd), L'=0 (even). So S + L' = 1 +0=1 → 1 mod 2. So T = (1 +0 +1) mod 2 =0. So condition is met.

Now, J_NN' is 1, l=1. So possible total J could be 0. So angular momentum is possible.

So option B is allowed.

Option C: 1S0 →3D3 + f.

Emit a f particle. f is orbital angular momentum l=3.

So L (l)=3.

NN' state is 3D3. So L'=2 (D=2).

Parity condition: L'=2, which is even. Since l=3, which is odd. So L' must be even, which it is. So parity condition holds.

Isospin condition: S is (2S+1=3 → S=1) which is odd. L'=2 even. So S+L'=1+2=3 → 1 mod 2. So T = (1 + 2 +1) mod 2 = (4) mod 2 =0. So condition holds.

Now, J_NN' is 3, and l=3.

So possible J_total could be 0 (3 and 3 can combine to 0). So angular momentum is allowed.

So option C is allowed.

Option D: 1S0 →3P0 + s.

Emit an s particle, which is l=0.

So L (l)=0.

NN' state is 3P0. So L'=1 (P=1). 

Wait, here's a problem. Parity condition: L (l)=0. So L' must be even (0 +1 mod 2 =1 mod 2 → L' must be 1 mod 2, i.e., odd). 

But in option D, the NN' state has L'=1 (P=1), which is odd. So parity condition is satisfied.

Now, isospin condition: S from 3P0 is (2S+1=3 → S=1). So S=1 (odd). L'=1 (odd). So S + L' =1+1=2 → 0 mod 2. 

But T should be S + L' +1 mod 2. So T = (1 +1 +1) mod2 = (3) mod 2 =1. But the question states that T=0. So this would be a problem. 

Wait, that's a big issue. So in option D, T would be 1, but the problem says T=0. So this violates the condition. So option D is not allowed.

Wait, but let me double-check.

The condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Or wait, the problem says "T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)".

Wait, no, the problem says: Pauli statistics require T(NN)= S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

So T = S + L +1 mod 2.

In option D, S=1, L=1. So T = 1 +1 +1 =3 → 1 mod 2. So T=1, but the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So this is a violation. So option D would not be allowed.

So, the forbidden option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions: conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the relation between isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum for the final NN state, \( T(\text{NN}) = S(\text{NN}) + L(\text{NN}) + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). The initial state is \( 1S_0 \), and the final NN state has \( T(\text{NN}) = 0 \). Additionally, the emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \(-1\).

### Key Conditions:
1. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the initial state is \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = 1 \) (since \( L = 0 \) for the \( 1S_0 \) state). After emission, the parity of the final state is given by:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^L,
   \]
   where \( L \) is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle \( X \). Since \( P_X = -1 \), the parity condition simplifies to:
   \[
   P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{L+1}.
   \]
   For the final NN state, \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{L'} \), where \( L' \) is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system. Thus:
   \[
   (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{L+1} \implies L' \equiv L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2).
   \]

2. **Isospin Condition**: For the final NN state, \( T(\text{NN}) = 0 \). Using the relation \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), this implies:
   \[
   S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2),
   \]
   meaning \( S \) and \( L \) must have opposite parity.

3. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The total angular momentum \( J \) must be conserved. The initial state has \( J = 0 \), so the final state must also have total \( J = 0 \).

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A: \( 1S_0 \to 7D_1 + p \)**
- The emitted particle \( X \) is a proton (\( p \)) with \( l = 1 \) (denoted by the lowercase letter \( p \)).
- The final NN state is \( 7D_1 \), where \( S = 3 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 7 \)) and \( L' = 2 \) (from \( D = 2 \)).
- **Parity Check**: \( L = 1 \) (emitted particle), so \( L' \equiv L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies L' = 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). Since \( L' = 2 \) (even), parity is satisfied.
- **Isospin Check**: \( S = 3 \) (odd), \( L' = 2 \) (even). \( S + L' \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), so \( T = 0 \). Condition satisfied.
- **Angular Momentum**: \( J_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( l = 1 \). These can combine to \( J = 0 \). Condition satisfied.
- **Allowed**.

#### **Option B: \( 1S_0 \to 3S_1 + p \)**
- The emitted particle \( X \) is a proton (\( p \)) with \( l = 1 \).
- The final NN state is \( 3S_1 \), where \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L' = 0 \) (from \( S = 0 \)).
- **Parity Check**: \( L = 1 \), so \( L' \equiv L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies L' = 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). Since \( L' = 0 \) (even), parity is satisfied.
- **Isospin Check**: \( S = 1 \) (odd), \( L' = 0 \) (even). \( S + L' \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), so \( T = 0 \). Condition satisfied.
- **Angular Momentum**: \( J_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( l = 1 \). These can combine to \( J = 0 \). Condition satisfied.
- **Allowed**.

#### **Option C: \( 1S_0 \to 3D_3 + f \)**
- The emitted particle \( X \) is an \( f \)-particle with \( l = 3 \) (denoted by the lowercase letter \( f \)).
- The final NN state is \( 3D_3 \), where \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L' = 2 \) (from \( D = 2 \)).
- **Parity Check**: \( L = 3 \), so \( L' \equiv L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies L' = 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). Since \( L' = 2 \) (even), parity is satisfied.
- **Isospin Check**: \( S = 1 \) (odd), \( L' = 2 \) (even). \( S + L' \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), so \( T = 0 \). Condition satisfied.
- **Angular Momentum**: \( J_{\text{NN}} = 3 \), \( l = 3 \). These can combine to \( J = 0 \). Condition satisfied.
- **Allowed**.

#### **Option D: \( 1S_0 \to 3P_0 + s \)**
- The emitted particle \( X \) is an \( s \)-particle with \( l = 0 \) (denoted by the lowercase letter \( s \)).
- The final NN state is \( 3P_0 \), where \( S = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L' = 1 \) (from \( P = 1 \)).
- **Parity Check**: \( L = 0 \), so \( L' \equiv L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies L' = 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). Since \( L' = 1 \) (odd), parity is satisfied.
- **Isospin Check**: \( S = 1 \) (odd), \( L' = 1 \) (odd). \( S + L' \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), so \( T = 1 \). This violates the condition \( T = 0 \).
- **Forbidden**.

### Conclusion:
The partial wave not permitted is **Option D** because it violates the isospin condition. 

Answer: D
