Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Now, the main point is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. They're asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted compared to when it is.

Hmm. So the ratio is n1/n2. When there's no spots, Teff is 6000 K, and when there are spots, Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but the question says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = ?

I remember that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). So the ratio depends on the partition function, which is the statistical weights, and the exponential factor involving the energy difference and temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-UV. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's relevant for the energy difference, but let's think.

The energy difference between the two levels is E = hc/λ. Let me compute that. But maybe I don't need the exact value because it may cancel out later.

Wait, the problem says the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so each region is at a certain temperature. But when spots are present, the overall Teff is lower. Wait, wait. Are the spots cooler regions? I think dark spots on a star are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when 40% of the surface is spots, the overall effective temperature drops.

But how does this affect the ratio? The effective temperature is an average, but the photosphere has different regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at a lower temperature, say T_spot.

Wait, but the question isn't directly about the overall emission or luminosity. It's about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. But wait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, but the spots are cooler than the rest. So when the spots are present, the photosphere has a mix of regions at 6000 K and the spot temperature.

But how does this affect the ratio of Ti ions in the two levels?

Wait, the ratio depends on the local temperature. So if the star has regions at different temperatures, the average ratio would be a weighted average of the ratios from each region. But wait, that’s only the case if the different regions contribute equally to the absorption line. But in this problem, perhaps it's considered that the entire photosphere is at the effective temperature when spots are present. Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is now at 5500 K, which must mean that the spots have significantly lowered the temperature of the entire photosphere? That can't be right physically, because spots are cooler regions on an otherwise hotter surface. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is oversimplified. Maybe when the spots are present, the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K. So the photosphere is now at 5500 K. So the temperature in the photosphere drops from 6000 to 5500 when spots are present. Thus, the ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels would be calculated based on the new temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So perhaps the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K. But wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present, which is a simplification.

I think for the purpose of solving this problem, we can proceed under the assumption that when spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K. So the ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels will change based on the temperature.

So the ratio is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

In the no spot case, T1 = 6000 K. In the spot case, T2 = 5500 K.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the ratio when spotted is calculated at 5500 K, and when not spotted, at 6000 K.

But wait, the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Let me write the equation again:

(n1/n2)_no_spots = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T_no_spots) )

(n1/n2)_spots = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T_spots) )

So the ratio of the two is:

(n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k) ) (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) ) ] )

Wait, let me re-arrange that. Let me denote delta_E = E1 - E2. Then,

The ratio is exp( (delta_E/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )

Wait, let me compute this exponent.

But wait, no. Let me compute (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots:

It's [ (g1/g2) exp(-delta_E/(k T_no)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-delta_E/(k T_spots)) ] )

The g1/g2 terms cancel, so becomes exp[ (-delta_E/(k T_no) ) + delta_E/(k T_spots) ) ]

Which is exp( delta_E/(k) ( 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no) ) )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. delta_E is the energy difference between the two levels, which can be calculated using the wavelength.

The transition corresponds to wavelength λ =1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

The energy E is given by E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) )

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV since 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 1.373e-18 J is about 8.58 eV.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.373e-18 J is 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, but 1448 Å is in the UV range. I remember that visible light is about 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Å), so 1448 Å is about 144.8 nm, which is in the UV, so the energy would be higher than visible. So 8.57 eV seems plausible.

But wait, the transition energy is E = hc/lambda. Let me recalculate:

λ = 1448 Angstroms = 1.448e-7 meters.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

E = hc/lambda = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So delta_E is 8.57 eV.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann factor, we have delta_E/(k*T).

k is Boltzmann's constant, about 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So delta_E is 8.57 eV.

So delta_E/(k*T) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * T) )

Which is 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * T) ) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) * (1/T) )

8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ approximately 99448. So delta_E/(k T) ≈ 99448 / T.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

8.57 divided by 0.00008617.

Well, 0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.

So 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99448.

So the exponent becomes (99448) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots).

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Because T_spots is the temperature when spots are present, which is lower than T_no_spots.

Wait, sorry, the ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( delta_E/(k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )

Wait no, wait. Let me go back.

The ratio is exp( delta_E/(k) (1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots)) )

Because the exponent is (delta_E / (k)) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots).

Wait, wait, actually, because in the expression:

exp( [ delta_E/(k) ) ( 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ) ] )

Wait, let me compute 1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots.

T_spots is 5500 K, T_no is 6000 K.

So 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1

Subtracting: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1

So the exponent becomes (99448) * (0.000015151)

Compute 99448 * 0.000015151.

Let me compute 99448 * 0.000015151:

Hmm, 1e5 * 0.000015151 is 1.5151. But 99448 is approx 9.9448e4.

So 9.9448e4 * (1.5151e-5) = 9.9448e4 * 1.5151e-5 = (9.9448 * 1.5151) * 1e-1.

9.9448 *1.5151 ≈ let's compute:

10 *1.5151 =15.151, minus 0.0552*1.5151≈0.0835. So approx 15.151-0.0835=15.0675.

Multiply by 1e-1: 1.50675.

So the exponent is approximately 1.50675.

So the ratio becomes exp(1.50675) ≈ e^1.50675.

e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817.

e^1.50675 is a bit more. Let me compute:

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.00675 is approximately 1 + 0.00675 + (0.00675)^2/2 ≈ 1.00675 + 0.000023 ≈ 1.006773.

So e^1.50675 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.006773 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.006773.

Compute 4.4817 * 1.006773.

4 *1.006773 = 4.027092

0.4817 *1.006773 ≈ approx 0.4846.

So total is about 4.027092 + 0.4846 ≈4.5117.

So the ratio is approximately 4.51.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might miscalculate.

Wait, delta_E = 8.57 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So delta_E/(k) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ≈ (8.57 / 0.00008617) = same as before, approx 99448.

Then 1/T_spots is 1/5500 = 0.000181818, 1/T_no is 0.000166667.

Difference is 0.000015151.

99448 * 0.000015151 = let me compute it precisely.

99448 * 0.000015151:

Let me compute 99,448 * 15.151e-6.

Compute 99,448 *15.151 = ?

Wait, 99,448 * 15 = 1,491,720.

99,448 *0.151 = let's see:

0.1 *99,448 = 9,944.8

0.05 *99,448 = 4,972.4

0.001 *99,448 =99.448

Adding those together: 9,944.8 +4,972.4 =14,917.2 +99.448=14,  10,016.648.

So total 99,448 *15.151 = 1,491,720 + 14,916.648 = 1,506,636.648.

Multiply by 1e-6: 1,506,636.648e-6 = 1.506636648.

So exponent is 1.506636648.

e^1.506636648 is approximately e^(1.5066).

I can compute e^1.5 is 4.4817.

Then, e^0.0066366 is about 1 + 0.0066366 + (0.0066366)^2/2.

Which is about 1.0066366 + (0.00004404)/2 ≈ 1.0066366 + 0.00002202 = 1.00665862.

So e^1.5066 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.0066 ≈4.4817 * 1.00665862.

Multiply 4.4817 *1.00665862:

4.4817 * 1 =4.4817

4.4817 * 0.00665862 ≈ 0.02985.

So total is approximately 4.51155.

So the ratio is about 4.51, which is ~4.5. So option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the ratios when the star has spots and when it does not is given by:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E \)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we find:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Boltzmann factor
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). The term \( \frac{\Delta E}{kT} \) is given by:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})T}.
\]

For \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \), the difference \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 \approx 0.0000152 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \cdot 0.0000152.
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \):

\[
\frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99448.
\]

Then multiply by \( 0.0000152 \):

\[
99448 \cdot 0.0000152 \approx 1.507.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the ratio
The ratio is:

\[
\exp(1.507) \approx 4.51.
\]

Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \).

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is closest to **4.5**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K.

Hmm. So the ratio is n1/n2. When there's no spots, Teff is 6000 K, and when there are spots, Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but the question says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = ?

I remember that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). So the ratio depends on the partition function, which is the statistical weights, and the exponential factor involving the energy difference and temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-UV. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's relevant for the energy difference, but let's think.

Wait, but the question isn't directly about the overall emission or luminosity. It's about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. But wait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, but the spots are cooler than the rest. So when the spots are present, the photosphere has a mix of regions at 6000 K and the spot temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So perhaps the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K.

I think for the purpose of solving this problem, we can proceed under the assumption that when spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K. So the ratio of Ti atoms in the two levels will change based on the temperature.

So the ratio is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

In the no spot case, T1 = 6000 K. In the spot case, T2 = 5500 K.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the ratio when spotted is calculated at 5500 K, and when not spotted, at 6000 K.

But wait, the question is about the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Let me write the equation again:

(n1/n2)_no_spots = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T_no_spots) )

(n1/n2)_spots = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T_spots) )

So the ratio of the two is:

(n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( [ (E1-E2)/(k) ) (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) ) ] )

Wait, let me re-arrange that. Let me denote delta_E = E1 - E2. Then,

The ratio is exp( (delta_E/k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )

Wait, let me compute this exponent.

But wait, no. Let me compute (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots:

It's [ (g1/g2) exp(-delta_E/(k T_no)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-delta_E/(k T_spots)) ] )

The g1/g2 terms cancel, so becomes exp[ (-delta_E/(k T_no) ) + delta_E/(k T_spots) ) ]

Which is exp( delta_E/(k) ( 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no) ) )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. delta_E is the energy difference between the two levels, which can be calculated using the wavelength.

The transition corresponds to wavelength λ =1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

The energy E is given by E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) )

Let me compute that:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV since 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 1.373e-18 J is about 8.58 eV.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.373e-18 J is 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

Wait, but 1448 Å is in the UV range. I remember that visible light is about 400-700 nm (4000-7000 Å), so 1448 Å is about 144.8 nm, which is in the UV, so the energy would be higher than visible. So 8.57 eV seems plausible.

But wait, the transition energy is E = hc/lambda. Let me recalculate:

λ = 1448 Angstroms = 1.448e-7 meters.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

E = hc/lambda = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E = 1.373e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.57 eV.

So delta_E is 8.57 eV.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann factor, we have delta_E/(k*T).

k is Boltzmann's constant, about 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So delta_E is 8.57 eV.

So delta_E/(k*T) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * T) )

Which is 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * T) ) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) * (1/T) )

8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ approximately 99448. So delta_E/(k T) ≈ 99448 / T.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

8.57 divided by 0.00008617.

Well, 0.00008617 is 8.617e-5.

So 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99448.

So the exponent becomes (99448) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots).

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Because T_spots is the temperature when spots are present, which is lower than T_no_spots.

Wait, sorry, the ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = exp( delta_E/(k) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots) )

Wait no, wait. Let me go back.

The ratio is exp( delta_E/(k) (1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots)) )

Because the exponent is (delta_E / (k)) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots).

Wait, wait, actually, because in the expression:

exp( [ delta_E/(k) ) ( 1/(T_spots) - 1/(T_no_spots) ) ] )

Wait, let me compute 1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots.

T_spots is 5500 K, T_no is 6000 K.

So 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 K^-1

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 K^-1

Subtracting: 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 ≈ 0.000015151 K^-1

So the exponent becomes (99448) * (0.000015151)

Compute 99448 * 0.000015151.

Let me compute 99448 * 0.000015151:

Hmm, 1e5 * 0.000015151 is 1.5151. But 99448 is approx 9.9448e4.

So 9.9448e4 * (1.5151e-5) = 9.9448e4 * 1.5151e-5 = (9.9448 * 1.5151) * 1e-1.

9.9448 *1.5151 ≈ let's compute:

10 *1.5151 =15.151, minus 0.0552*1.5151≈0.0835. So approx 15.151-0.0835=15.0675.

Multiply by 1e-1: 1.50675.

So the exponent is approximately 1.50675.

So the ratio becomes exp(1.50675) ≈ e^1.50675.

e^1.5 is approximately 4.4817.

e^1.50675 is a bit more. Let me compute:

e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

e^0.00675 is approximately 1 + 0.00675 + (0.00675)^2/2 ≈ 1.00675 + 0.000023 ≈ 1.006773.

So e^1.50675 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.006773 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.006773.

Compute 4.4817 * 1.006773.

4 *1.006773 = 4.027092

0.4817 *1.006773 ≈ approx 0.4846.

So total is about 4.027092 + 0.4846 ≈4.5117.

So the ratio is approximately 4.51.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is about 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might miscalculate.

Wait, delta_E = 8.57 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So delta_E/(k) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5) ≈ (8.57 / 0.00008617) = same as before, approx 99448.

Then 1/T_spots is 1/5500 = 0.000181818, 1/T_no is 0.000166667.

Difference is 0.000015151.

99448 * 0.000015151 = let me compute it precisely.

99448 * 0.000015151:

Let me compute 99,448 * 15.151e-6.

Compute 99,448 *15.151 = ?

Wait, 99,448 * 15 = 1,491,720.

99,448 *0.151 = let's see:

0.1 *99,448 = 9,944.8

0.05 *99,448 = 4,972.4

0.001 *99,448 =99.448

Adding those together: 9,944.8 +4,972.4 =14,917.2 +99.448=14,  10,016.648.

So total 99,448 *15.151 = 1,491,720 + 14,916.648 = 1,506,636.648.

Multiply by 1e-6: 1,506,636.648e-6 = 1.506636648.

So exponent is 1.506636648.

e^1.506636648 is approximately e^(1.5066).

I can compute e^1.5 is 4.4817.

Then, e^0.0066366 is about 1 + 0.0066366 + (0.0066366)^2/2.

Which is about 1.0066366 + (0.00004404)/2 ≈ 1.0066366 + 0.00002202 = 1.00665862.

So e^1.5066 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.0066 ≈4.4817 * 1.00665862.

Multiply 4.4817 *1.00665862:

4.4817 * 1 =4.4817

4.4817 * 0.00665862 ≈ 0.02985.

So total is approximately 4.51155.

So the ratio is about 4.51, which is ~4.5. So option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the ratios when the star has spots and when it does not is given by:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta E \)
The transition corresponds to a wavelength \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we find:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Boltzmann factor
The Boltzmann constant is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). The term \( \frac{\Delta E}{kT} \) is given by:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT} = \frac{8.57}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5})T}.
\]

For \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \), the difference \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 \approx 0.0000152 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right) = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \cdot 0.0000152.
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \):

\[
\frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99448.
\]

Then multiply by \( 0.0000152 \):

\[
99448 \cdot 0.0000152 \approx 1.507.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the ratio
The ratio is:

\[
\exp(1.507) \approx 4.51.
\]

Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \).

### Final Answer:
The factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes is closest to **4.5**.
