Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically involving FTIR and NMR spectra. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. Wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring.

The FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-Cl or Ar-Br). So the substituents on the ring are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but the substituents can't both be on the ring because that would make it di-substituted. Wait, no: the ring is di-substituted, meaning two groups attached. So each substituent is a group. So the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe?) and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. Wait, a carbonyl group is a substituent. But if the ring is aromatic and has a carbonyl group, like maybe an acyl group attached. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like an acetyl group, which is -COCH3) and the other substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.)?

Wait, let me think. A benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, and another is a halogen.

But wait, the number of carbons. The ring has 6 carbons. The substituents add 2 carbons, so total 8.

So substituents are likely -COCH3 and -X (like Cl). Because COCH3 is two carbons (the CO is one, but wait, -COCH3 has two carbons: the C in CO and the CH3). So the substituents would be -COCH3 and -X (like -Cl).

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So the ring is benzene, and it's substituted with two groups. One is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, so perhaps an acetyl group) and another is a halogen.

So the molecule would be something like para-substituted benzene with one substituent as -COCH3 and another as -X, like Cl.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. Let's imagine it's para-substituted. So the two substituents are across from each other.

Now, looking at the options, which NMR data correspond to such a structure.

The options are A, B, C, D.

Each option lists a set of peaks.

Let me look at option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).

A singlet at 9.9 ppm is likely an aldehyde proton, but wait, the substituent is a carbonyl group. If it's a ketone (like acetyl), the aldehyde protons wouldn't be present. Wait, maybe it's an aromatic proton next to a carbonyl, but that's more around 8-9 ppm. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic proton where the ring is strongly deshielded. Or perhaps a carbonyl group with an adjacent CH.

Wait, could it be the case that the substituent is an acetyloxy group? No, wait, because the substituent is a carbonyl and a halogen. Alternatively, if the substituent is a carbonyl as part of another group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl like a ketone, so perhaps an acetophenone-type structure. Let's think about acetophenone. Its structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3). So the NMR would show the aromatic protons and the CH3 next to the ketone.

But wait, how does the di-substitution work? So in this case, the ring is di-substituted with a COCH3 and a halogen. Let's say the substituents are para to each other.

So the aromatic protons would be two sets, each as doublets because of the coupling between adjacent protons. Wait, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two sets: each with two protons as doublets. Or maybe, no, wait, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. So the remaining protons would be in positions ortho and meta to each substituent. Wait, perhaps in a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, the H's at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the H's at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent.

So in the NMR, you would see two doublets: one integrating for two H's (say positions 2 and 6) and another integrating for two H's (positions 3 and 5). But wait, that's if the substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions. So the H's at 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent 1) would be one set, and the H's at 3 and 5 (meta to substituent 1) would be another set.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that lead to a different pattern. Hmm.

Wait, but looking at option A, the aromatic peaks are at 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That suggests two sets of two protons each, as doublets. So this could fit a para-substituted benzene with groups in 1 and 4 positions, leading to two sets of H's. So that would fit with substituents in para positions.

But then what about the other peaks in option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s) and 3.7 (2H, s). The 3.7 ppm is likely a CH2 group, maybe next to an oxygen, like OCH2. Or a singlet at 9.9 could be an aldehyde proton. But wait, in the substituent, if one substituent is a carbonyl group, like COCH3, then the CH3 would be a triplet or singlet. Wait, the substituent is -COCH3, which is a ketone. The CH3 would be a singlet because it's attached to a carbonyl, which doesn't split it. So that would be a singlet around 2.6 ppm for the CH3. But in option A, the 3.7 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Wait, a singlet for 2H at 3.7 could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like OCH2. But then where is that coming from? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of another structure, like an ester. But considering the IR data, the carbonyl could be a ketone or an ester. But if it's an ester, the substituent would be O-CO-O-R, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, let's think about the total number of carbons. The ring has 6, substituents add 2, total 8. So for substituents, each must add one carbon.

Wait, but substituents can have more than one carbon. For example, a -COCH3 substituent has two carbons (the CO has one, CH3 has another). So if the ring has two substituents, each adding one carbon, that would sum to 6 + 2 = 8. So in that case, substituents could be a -COCH3 and a -X (like Br or Cl), each adding one carbon (since COCH3 is two carbons, but maybe I'm miscalculating).

Wait, no, perhaps the substituents are each one carbon. Wait, that can't be. Because -Cl is just a substituent without adding any carbons. So if one substituent is a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a -CO-R group, but R is only one carbon.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl as part of a group like -O-CO-R, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen. For example, substituents are -COCH3 and -Cl.

Wait, but that would add two substituents: one with two carbons (COCH3) and the other with none (Cl). So the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8. That works.

So the structure would be para-substituted benzene with -COCH3 and -Cl in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two sets: the ortho and the meta protons. The ortho protons (relative to the substituents) would have different chemical shifts than the meta ones.

In NMR, the protons ortho to electron-withdrawing groups (like COCH3 and Cl) would be deshielded and appear as doublets. The substituent's COCH3 is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the ortho protons would be more downfield.

So for the aromatic region, the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to two H. So looking at option A: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That fits.

What about the other peaks in option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s) and 3.7 (2H, s). Hmm.

Wait, the 9.9 ppm is a singlet, which is very downfield. That could be an aldehyde proton, but in our case, the substituent is a ketone. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton adjacent to the carbonyl, but that's usually around 8-8.5 ppm. So perhaps that's not matching. Also, where would a 9.9 proton come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't a ketone but something else, like a carbonyl as part of an ester or another group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a carbonyl as part of an acetyloxy group (like OAc). So the substituent is -O-CO-CH3. That would add more carbons. Let's see: O-CO-CH3 is three carbons, but in that case, the ring would have 6 +3 =9 carbons, which is more than 8. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group as an aldehyde. So the substituent is -CHO. But that's only one carbon, but the other substituent is -X (like Cl). So 6 +1 +0=7. Doesn't add up to 8.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The di-substituted ring has two substituents. Each substituent adds a certain number of carbons.

Wait, the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Let's say one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone (COCH3, which is two carbons) and the other substituent is a halogen (which is zero carbons). So total substituents add 2 carbons, 6 +2 =8. That fits.

So the structure is benzene with -COCH3 and -Cl in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be as mentioned earlier. The NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons: 2H each.

But then, what about the 9.9 ppm peak? That doesn't fit with the substituents. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent could be an acetyl group attached as a ketone, and the other substituent is not a halogen but something else. Wait, no, the IR says aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent must be a halogen.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl as part of another group. Maybe the substituent is a carbonyl attached as an ester or a nitrile.

Wait, let me think of another possibility. Maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group as an acyl (like benzoyl chloride), but I don't think that makes sense in this context.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a substituent that's more complex. For example, perhaps the substituent is -CO-O-R, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options and see which ones fit the structure.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s) — Could this be a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group? Or maybe a carbonyl group itself? Wait, the carbonyl is C=O, which doesn't have protons. Maybe it's a vinylic proton, but that's usually around 5-6 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, could it be an aromatic proton that's highly deshielded due to being next to electron-withdrawing groups? For example, in a para-substituted benzaldehyde, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a cyclic structure. Oh, wait, perhaps it's not a benzene ring but a different 6-membered ring. Wait no, the question says it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, so benzene.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H, which could be a CH3 attached to a carbonyl group (like COCH3). That makes sense. So the substituent could be a COCH3 and another substituent, perhaps a halogen.

Wait, but the aromatic protons in option C are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that would fit a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause two sets of H's. So the substituents are at para positions, and the NMR shows two doublets for the H's.

If the substituents are -COCH3 and -X (Cl), then the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets. The COCH3 would give a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the CH3 group.

So option C would have the aromatic protons as doublets, and the CH3 as a singlet at 2.3. But what about the IR? The IR has a carbonyl (C=O) and a halogen bond.

Hmm, but in option C, the only other peak is 2.3 (3H, s). So that would be the COCH3, but where's the halogen? Because a halogen substituent might be a Cl, which is a substituent without any protons. So in the NMR, it wouldn't show up as a peak because Cl doesn't have protons.

So, in the NMR, we wouldn't expect a peak for the halogen. So the NMR would show only the aromatic protons and the COCH3's CH3.

So option C's NMR shows 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). That fits the structure of para-substituted benzene with a COCH3 and a Cl.

Wait, but then why isn't the Cl showing up in NMR? Because Cl doesn't have any protons, so it doesn't produce a peak. So that's correct.

So the IR has a carbonyl (from the COCH3) and an aromatic-halogen bond (from the Cl). So the structure is para-bromo (or chloro) acetophenone.

Wait, but does that make sense? Let me think about the substituents. If the substituent is COCH3 and another is Cl, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (assuming para substitution) and the COCH3's CH3 as a singlet.

So option C's NMR fits that. So why is option A even a possibility? Because in option A, there's a peak at 9.9 ppm, which I can't explain.

Wait, what about the other substituents? Suppose another substituent is a hydroxyl group? But no, the IR has a carbonyl and a halogen.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a carbonyl as part of a substituent with an oxygen, like an ether. But I don't think that's necessary here.

Let me consider option A again. The 9.9 ppm is a singlet for 1H. Could that be an aldehyde proton? But if the substituent is an aldehyde, that would be a substituent with -CHO, which is one carbon. So then the substituents would be -CHO (1 C) and a halogen (0 C), making the total C 6+1+0=7, which is less than 8. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group (like -CN), but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Wait, no, the IR says a carbonyl group is present.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a substituent that adds two carbons. For example, a ketone substituent would be -COCH2CH3, but that adds two more carbons, but that would make the substituent adding three carbons (CO plus two CH2), leading to 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So that can't be.

Alternatively, the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a methylene group. Like -CO-CH2- something, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group as a part of a ring substituent, but I can't think of a scenario that fits.

So perhaps option C is correct. Let me check the substituents.

In option C, the substituents would be a COCH3 group (which adds two carbons) and a halogen (Cl, say), which adds zero. So total carbons: 6+2=8. That fits.

In that case, the NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets (7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each 2H), and the COCH3 group as a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H. So option C's data matches that.

So why is option A an option? Let me reevaluate. Because in option A, there's a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which I can't explain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a substituent that has a neighboring proton, like an aromatic ketone with an adjacent substituent. Or maybe it's a carbonyl group as in a benzophenone derivative, but that would involve more than the given carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a substituent attached to the ring, like a benzyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-O-R group (ester), but that would add more carbons. Let's see: R is CH3, then substituent is O-CO-OCH3. That would add four carbons, making the total 6+4=10, which is more than 8. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -COOR group (ester), but that would be O-CO-O-R, which again adds more carbons.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-R group where R is a methyl group, so COCH3, which adds two carbons. That brings us back to the earlier scenario.

So, in that case, option C's NMR data makes sense.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C has three peaks: two aromatic doublets and a singlet at 2.3 ppm. So the peaks are 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). That matches the structure of para-chloroacetophenone, for example.

So the FTIR has a carbonyl (from the CO) and a halogen (from the Cl). The NMR shows the aromatic protons (as two doublets) and the COCH3's CH3 as a singlet.

But wait, another possibility: what if the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a substituent that's a part of a ring? No, perhaps not.

Wait, could the substituent be a carbonyl group as in a benzaldehyde group? But that's a substituent with only one carbon (CHO), which would make the total carbons 6+1=7, which is less than 8. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of each option in detail.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).

Possible assignments: the 9.9 is a singlet, perhaps a proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like a CO). The 3.7 ppm is a singlet for 2H, maybe a CH2 group attached to an oxygen (like OCH2). So perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group and an OCH2 group. But wait, OCH2 would be part of another substituent.

Wait, but the IR says a carbonyl and a halogen. So perhaps the substituent is a ketone and a OCH2Cl group. Hmm, but that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl as part of an ester group, like O-CO-OCH3, but that's four carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group and a -OCH2Cl group. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-OCH3 group (methoxycarbonyl), which is three carbons. So the substituent adds three carbons, making the total 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps option A is not the correct one, as the 9.9 ppm is a singlet which I can't explain in this scenario.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).

These peaks suggest some sort of diastereotopic protons, perhaps in a cyclic structure. The 4.8 and 4.6 are doublets, maybe adjacent to each other, like in a vicinal diol or an ethylene glycol-type structure. The 1.3 is a singlet for 3H, perhaps a methyl group attached to oxygen. But how does that fit with the aromatic ring and substituents?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents that have nearby oxygen atoms. But the IR has a carbonyl and a halogen. If the substituent is a carbonyl group, perhaps as part of a ketone or ester, but I don't see how this NMR fits.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).

The 6.9 is a singlet, which could be a proton in a symmetric position, perhaps in a meta-substituted benzene or a para-substituted but with another substituent causing a singlet. The 4.8 and 4.6 are doublets, maybe an ethylene group adjacent to oxygen. The 1.3 is a singlet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 group next to an oxygen.

But again, how does this fit with the IR data of carbonyl and halogen?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group and the other substituent is a di-substituted group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the substituent with the carbonyl group could be a ketone, which would have a CH3 group as a singlet around 2.3 ppm. So which options have that?

Option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is the CH3 from COCH3.

Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which I don't think is a CH3.

So perhaps option C is the correct one.

Wait, but what about the di-substitution? Let me think about the structure of para-substituted acetophenone with a halogen. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating to two H, and the COCH3 as a singlet for 3H. That's exactly what option C shows.

So I think option C is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct **¹H NMR data** for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. The compound has a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The key is to analyze the options and match them to the expected structure and NMR patterns.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Compound**:
   - The compound is a benzene ring (6 carbons) with two substituents.
   - The substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons, as the total is 8 carbons.
   - Based on the IR data, one substituent is a carbonyl group (e.g., -COCH₃, contributing 2 carbons) and the other is a halogen (e.g., -Cl, contributing no carbons).

2. **Expected NMR Features**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: For a para-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons will split into two sets of doublets due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the substituents. These will appear in the aromatic region (7.0–8.5 ppm).
   - **Carbonyl Substituent**: The -COCH₃ group will produce a singlet for the methyl group (CH₃) in the aliphatic region (~2.3 ppm).

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Peaks at 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 3.7 (2H, s).  
     - The singlet at 9.9 ppm is unexplained, as it does not match the expected -COCH₃ group or any plausible substituent.  
     - This option is inconsistent with the structure.
   - **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), and 1.3 (3H, s).  
     - These peaks suggest a structure with oxygenated groups (e.g., -OCH₂), which does not align with the required substituents (carbonyl and halogen).  
     - This option is inconsistent with the structure.
   - **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s).  
     - The two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) match the expected pattern for a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl and halogen.  
     - The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent.  
     - This option matches the structure and NMR data.
   - **Option D**: Peaks at 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), and 1.3 (2H, s).  
     - The singlet at 6.9 ppm and the peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest a structure with oxygenated groups, which does not align with the required substituents.  
     - This option is inconsistent with the structure.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it matches the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene with a -COCH₃ group and a halogen substituent. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets, and the -COCH₃ group contributes a singlet for the methyl group.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically involving FTIR and NMR spectra. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. Wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. Di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring.

The FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-Cl or Ar-Br). So the substituents on the ring are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but the substituents can't both be on the ring because that would make it di-substituted. Wait, no: the ring is di-substituted, meaning two groups attached. So each substituent is a group. So the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe?) and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. Wait, a carbonyl group is a substituent. But if the ring is aromatic and has a carbonyl group, like maybe an acyl group attached. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like an acetyl group, which is -COCH3) and the other substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.)?

Wait, let me think. A benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, and another is a halogen.

But wait, the number of carbons. The ring has 6 carbons. The substituents add 2 carbons, so total 8.

So substituents are likely -COCH3 and -X (like Cl). Because COCH3 is two carbons (the CO is one, but wait, -COCH3 has two carbons: the C in CO and the CH3). So the substituents would be -COCH3 and -X (like -Cl).

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So the ring is benzene, and it's substituted with two groups. One is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, so perhaps an acetyl group) and another is a halogen.

So the molecule would be something like para-substituted benzene with one substituent as -COCH3 and another as -X, like Cl.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. Let's imagine it's para-substituted. So the two substituents are across from each other.

Now, looking at the options, which NMR data correspond to such a structure.

The options are A, B, C, D.

Each option lists a set of peaks.

Let me look at option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).

A singlet at 9.9 ppm is likely an aldehyde proton, but wait, the substituent is a carbonyl group. If it's a ketone (like acetyl), the aldehyde protons wouldn't be present. Wait, maybe it's an aromatic proton next to a carbonyl, but that's more around 8-9 ppm. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic proton where the ring is strongly deshielded. Or perhaps a carbonyl group with an adjacent CH.

Wait, could it be the case that the substituent is an acetyloxy group? No, wait, because the substituent is a carbonyl and a halogen. Alternatively, if the substituent is a carbonyl as part of another group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl like a ketone, so perhaps an acetophenone-type structure. Let's think about acetophenone. Its structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (COCH3). So the NMR would show the aromatic protons and the CH3 next to the ketone.

But wait, how does the di-substitution work? So in this case, the ring is di-substituted with a COCH3 and a halogen. Let's say the substituents are para to each other.

So the aromatic protons would be two sets, each as doublets because of the coupling between adjacent protons. Wait, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two sets: each with two protons as doublets. Or maybe, no, wait, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. So the remaining protons would be in positions ortho and meta to each substituent. Wait, perhaps in a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, the H's at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the H's at positions 3 and 5 are equivalent.

So in the NMR, you would see two doublets: one integrating for two H's (say positions 2 and 6) and another integrating for two H's (positions 3 and 5). But wait, that's if the substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions. So the H's at 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent 1) would be one set, and the H's at 3 and 5 (meta to substituent 1) would be another set.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that lead to a different pattern. Hmm.

Wait, but looking at option A, the aromatic peaks are at 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That suggests two sets of two protons each, as doublets. So this could fit a para-substituted benzene with groups in 1 and 4 positions, leading to two sets of H's. So that would fit with substituents in para positions.

But then what about the other peaks in option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s) and 3.7 (2H, s). The 3.7 ppm is likely a CH2 group, maybe next to an oxygen, like OCH2. Or a singlet at 9.9 could be an aldehyde proton. But wait, in the substituent, if one substituent is a carbonyl group, like COCH3, then the CH3 would be a triplet or singlet. Wait, the substituent is -COCH3, which is a ketone. The CH3 would be a singlet because it's attached to a carbonyl, which doesn't split it. So that would be a singlet around 2.6 ppm for the CH3. But in option A, the 3.7 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Wait, a singlet for 2H at 3.7 could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like OCH2. But then where is that coming from? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of another structure, like an ester. But considering the IR data, the carbonyl could be a ketone or an ester. But if it's an ester, the substituent would be O-CO-O-R, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, let's think about the total number of carbons. The ring has 6, substituents add 2, total 8. So for substituents, each must add one carbon.

Wait, but substituents can have more than one carbon. For example, a -COCH3 substituent has two carbons (the CO has one, CH3 has another). So if the ring has two substituents, each adding one carbon, that would sum to 6 + 2 = 8. So in that case, substituents could be a -COCH3 and a -X (like Br or Cl), each adding one carbon (since COCH3 is two carbons, but maybe I'm miscalculating).

Wait, no, perhaps the substituents are each one carbon. Wait, that can't be. Because -Cl is just a substituent without adding any carbons. So if one substituent is a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a -CO-R group, but R is only one carbon.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl as part of a group like -O-CO-R, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen. For example, substituents are -COCH3 and -Cl.

Wait, but that would add two substituents: one with two carbons (COCH3) and the other with none (Cl). So the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8. That works.

So the structure would be para-substituted benzene with -COCH3 and -Cl in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two sets: the ortho and the meta protons. The ortho protons (relative to the substituents) would have different chemical shifts than the meta ones.

In NMR, the protons ortho to electron-withdrawing groups (like COCH3 and Cl) would be deshielded and appear as doublets. The substituent's COCH3 is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so the ortho protons would be more downfield.

So for the aromatic region, the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to two H. So looking at option A: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That fits.

What about the other peaks in option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s) and 3.7 (2H, s). Hmm.

Wait, the 9.9 ppm is a singlet, which is very downfield. That could be an aldehyde proton, but in our case, the substituent is a ketone. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton adjacent to the carbonyl, but that's usually around 8-8.5 ppm. So perhaps that's not matching. Also, where would a 9.9 proton come from?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't a ketone but something else, like a carbonyl as part of an ester or another group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a carbonyl as part of an acetyloxy group (like OAc). So the substituent is -O-CO-CH3. That would add more carbons. Let's see: O-CO-CH3 is three carbons, but in that case, the ring would have 6 +3 =9 carbons, which is more than 8. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group as an aldehyde. So the substituent is -CHO. But that's only one carbon, but the other substituent is -X (like Cl). So 6 +1 +0=7. Doesn't add up to 8.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The di-substituted ring has two substituents. Each substituent adds a certain number of carbons.

Wait, the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Let's say one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone (COCH3, which is two carbons) and the other substituent is a halogen (which is zero carbons). So total substituents add 2 carbons, 6 +2 =8. That fits.

So the structure is benzene with -COCH3 and -Cl in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be as mentioned earlier. The NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons: 2H each.

But then, what about the 9.9 ppm peak? That doesn't fit with the substituents. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent could be an acetyl group attached as a ketone, and the other substituent is not a halogen but something else. Wait, no, the IR says aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent must be a halogen.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl as part of another group. Maybe the substituent is a carbonyl attached as an ester or a nitrile.

Wait, let me think of another possibility. Maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group as an acyl (like benzoyl chloride), but I don't think that makes sense in this context.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a substituent that's more complex. For example, perhaps the substituent is -CO-O-R, but that would add more carbons.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options and see which ones fit the structure.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s) — Could this be a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group? Or maybe a carbonyl group itself? Wait, the carbonyl is C=O, which doesn't have protons. Maybe it's a vinylic proton, but that's usually around 5-6 ppm. Hmm.

Alternatively, could it be an aromatic proton that's highly deshielded due to being next to electron-withdrawing groups? For example, in a para-substituted benzaldehyde, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a cyclic structure. Oh, wait, perhaps it's not a benzene ring but a different 6-membered ring. Wait no, the question says it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, so benzene.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H, which could be a CH3 attached to a carbonyl group (like COCH3). That makes sense. So the substituent could be a COCH3 and another substituent, perhaps a halogen.

Wait, but the aromatic protons in option C are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that would fit a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause two sets of H's. So the substituents are at para positions, and the NMR shows two doublets for the H's.

If the substituents are -COCH3 and -X (Cl), then the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets. The COCH3 would give a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the CH3 group.

So option C would have the aromatic protons as doublets, and the CH3 as a singlet at 2.3. But what about the IR? The IR has a carbonyl (C=O) and a halogen bond.

Hmm, but in option C, the only other peak is 2.3 (3H, s). So that would be the COCH3, but where's the halogen? Because a halogen substituent might be a Cl, which is a substituent without any protons. So in the NMR, it wouldn't show up as a peak because Cl doesn't have protons.

So, in the NMR, we wouldn't expect a peak for the halogen. So the NMR would show only the aromatic protons and the COCH3's CH3.

So option C's NMR shows 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). That fits the structure of para-substituted benzene with a COCH3 and a Cl.

Wait, but then why isn't the Cl showing up in NMR? Because Cl doesn't have any protons, so it doesn't produce a peak. So that's correct.

So the IR has a carbonyl (from the COCH3) and an aromatic-halogen bond (from the Cl). So the structure is para-bromo (or chloro) acetophenone.

Wait, but does that make sense? Let me think about the substituents. If the substituent is COCH3 and another is Cl, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (assuming para substitution) and the COCH3's CH3 as a singlet.

So option C's NMR fits that. So why is option A even a possibility? Because in option A, there's a peak at 9.9 ppm, which I can't explain.

Wait, what about the other substituents? Suppose another substituent is a hydroxyl group? But no, the IR has a carbonyl and a halogen.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a carbonyl as part of a substituent with an oxygen, like an ether. But I don't think that's necessary here.

Let me consider option A again. The 9.9 ppm is a singlet for 1H. Could that be an aldehyde proton? But if the substituent is an aldehyde, that would be a substituent with -CHO, which is one carbon. So then the substituents would be -CHO (1 C) and a halogen (0 C), making the total C 6+1+0=7, which is less than 8. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group (like -CN), but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Wait, no, the IR says a carbonyl group is present.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a substituent that adds two carbons. For example, a ketone substituent would be -COCH2CH3, but that adds two more carbons, but that would make the substituent adding three carbons (CO plus two CH2), leading to 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So that can't be.

Alternatively, the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a methylene group. Like -CO-CH2- something, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group as a part of a ring substituent, but I can't think of a scenario that fits.

So perhaps option C is correct. Let me check the substituents.

In option C, the substituents would be a COCH3 group (which adds two carbons) and a halogen (Cl, say), which adds zero. So total carbons: 6+2=8. That fits.

In that case, the NMR would have the aromatic protons as two doublets (7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each 2H), and the COCH3 group as a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H. So option C's data matches that.

So why is option A an option? Let me reevaluate. Because in option A, there's a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which I can't explain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a substituent that has a neighboring proton, like an aromatic ketone with an adjacent substituent. Or maybe it's a carbonyl group as in a benzophenone derivative, but that would involve more than the given carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a substituent attached to the ring, like a benzyl group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to another group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-O-R group (ester), but that would add more carbons. Let's see: R is CH3, then substituent is O-CO-OCH3. That would add four carbons, making the total 6+4=10, which is more than 8. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -COOR group (ester), but that would be O-CO-O-R, which again adds more carbons.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-R group where R is a methyl group, so COCH3, which adds two carbons. That brings us back to the earlier scenario.

So, in that case, option C's NMR data makes sense.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C has three peaks: two aromatic doublets and a singlet at 2.3 ppm. So the peaks are 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). That matches the structure of para-chloroacetophenone, for example.

So the FTIR has a carbonyl (from the CO) and a halogen (from the Cl). The NMR shows the aromatic protons (as two doublets) and the COCH3's CH3 as a singlet.

But wait, another possibility: what if the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a substituent that's a part of a ring? No, perhaps not.

Wait, could the substituent be a carbonyl group as in a benzaldehyde group? But that's a substituent with only one carbon (CHO), which would make the total carbons 6+1=7, which is less than 8. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of each option in detail.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).

Possible assignments: the 9.9 is a singlet, perhaps a proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group (like a CO). The 3.7 ppm is a singlet for 2H, maybe a CH2 group attached to an oxygen (like OCH2). So perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group and an OCH2 group. But wait, OCH2 would be part of another substituent.

Wait, but the IR says a carbonyl and a halogen. So perhaps the substituent is a ketone and a OCH2Cl group. Hmm, but that would add more carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl as part of an ester group, like O-CO-OCH3, but that's four carbons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group and a -OCH2Cl group. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-OCH3 group (methoxycarbonyl), which is three carbons. So the substituent adds three carbons, making the total 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps option A is not the correct one, as the 9.9 ppm is a singlet which I can't explain in this scenario.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).

These peaks suggest some sort of diastereotopic protons, perhaps in a cyclic structure. The 4.8 and 4.6 are doublets, maybe adjacent to each other, like in a vicinal diol or an ethylene glycol-type structure. The 1.3 is a singlet for 3H, perhaps a methyl group attached to oxygen. But how does that fit with the aromatic ring and substituents?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents that have nearby oxygen atoms. But the IR has a carbonyl and a halogen. If the substituent is a carbonyl group, perhaps as part of a ketone or ester, but I don't see how this NMR fits.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).

The 6.9 is a singlet, which could be a proton in a symmetric position, perhaps in a meta-substituted benzene or a para-substituted but with another substituent causing a singlet. The 4.8 and 4.6 are doublets, maybe an ethylene group adjacent to oxygen. The 1.3 is a singlet for 2H, perhaps a CH2 group next to an oxygen.

But again, how does this fit with the IR data of carbonyl and halogen?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group and the other substituent is a di-substituted group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the substituent with the carbonyl group could be a ketone, which would have a CH3 group as a singlet around 2.3 ppm. So which options have that?

Option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is the CH3 from COCH3.

Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which I don't think is a CH3.

So perhaps option C is the correct one.

Wait, but what about the di-substitution? Let me think about the structure of para-substituted acetophenone with a halogen. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating to two H, and the COCH3 as a singlet for 3H. That's exactly what option C shows.

So I think option C is correct.


The question involves identifying the correct **¹H NMR data** for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound containing 8 carbon atoms in total. The compound has a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The key is to analyze the options and match them to the expected structure and NMR patterns.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Compound**:
   - The compound is a benzene ring (6 carbons) with two substituents.
   - The substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons, as the total is 8 carbons.
   - Based on the IR data, one substituent is a carbonyl group (e.g., -COCH₃, contributing 2 carbons) and the other is a halogen (e.g., -Cl, contributing no carbons).

2. **Expected NMR Features**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: For a para-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons will split into two sets of doublets due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the substituents. These will appear in the aromatic region (7.0–8.5 ppm).
   - **Carbonyl Substituent**: The -COCH₃ group will produce a singlet for the methyl group (CH₃) in the aliphatic region (~2.3 ppm).

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Peaks at 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 3.7 (2H, s).  
     - The singlet at 9.9 ppm is unexplained, as it does not match the expected -COCH₃ group or any plausible substituent.  
     - This option is inconsistent with the structure.
   - **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), and 1.3 (3H, s).  
     - These peaks suggest a structure with oxygenated groups (e.g., -OCH₂), which does not align with the required substituents (carbonyl and halogen).  
     - This option is inconsistent with the structure.
   - **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s).  
     - The two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 and 7.6 ppm) match the expected pattern for a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl and halogen.  
     - The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent.  
     - This option matches the structure and NMR data.
   - **Option D**: Peaks at 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), and 1.3 (2H, s).  
     - The singlet at 6.9 ppm and the peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest a structure with oxygenated groups, which does not align with the required substituents.  
     - This option is inconsistent with the structure.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it matches the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene with a -COCH₃ group and a halogen substituent. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets, and the -COCH₃ group contributes a singlet for the methyl group.

**Answer: C**
