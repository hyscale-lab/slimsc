Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the problem is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for Transit Timing Variations, right? I think that's a method where the timing of when a planet transits in front of its star varies because of gravitational interactions with other planets. But maybe that's not directly relevant to the problem; the question is more about orbital periods and temperatures.

The given data are the ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets and the ratios of their masses. The albedo for all three is 0.3, similar to Earth. The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1.

Hmm. So, I need to find the ratio P3/P1. Let's list the given ratios:

- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2 (T1/T2) ≈ 1.4
- Temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3 (T2/T3) ≈ 2.3
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2 (M1/M2) ≈ 1.15
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3 (M2/M3) ≈ 1.35
- Albedo for all is 0.3.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is T = T_star * (L_star / (16πσ D^2))^(-1/4) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4), but maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature scales with (L / (16πσ D²))^½, considering it's a blackbody. Or wait, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) ), where R_star is the star's radius, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/4) * (L / (sigma * 4π D²)) )^(1/4), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is given by:

T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/4)

But in this problem, all planets have the same albedo (0.3), and since the orbits are circular, e=0. So albedo's effect is the same for all. Also, we can assume that the star's luminosity and radius are the same for all planets because they're orbiting the same star. So the only varying factor is the distance D.

So, T is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(2 D)) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4), but since R_star and (1 - albedo) are the same for all planets, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), meaning that D ∝ 1/T².

Wait, more accurately, T is proportional to ( L / (16πσ D² (1 - a)) )^(1/4). So if L is the same, and a (albedo) is the same, then T is proportional to (1/D²)^(1/4), which is 1/D^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), hence D ∝ 1/T².

Wait, let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4). Since all three planets are around the same star, R_star and T_star are the same for each. So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). Therefore, D is proportional to 1/(T²). So, D ∝ 1/(T²).

So, if T1 is the temperature of Planet1, then D1 = k / T1², where k is a constant. Similarly, D2 = k / T2², D3 = k / T3².

So the ratio of D1 to D3 would be (T3²)/(T1²). Because D is inversely proportional to T squared.

Wait, let me see: D1 = k / T1², D3 = k / T3². So D3/D1 = (k/(T3²)) / (k/(T1²)) ) = (T1²)/(T3²) ) = (T1/T3)².

So the ratio of D3 to D1 is (T1/T3)^2.

But wait, the given ratios are T1/T2 = 1.4, T2/T3 = 2.3.

So let's find T1/T3.

T1/T3 = (T1/T2) * (T2/T3) ) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22.

So T1 is 3.22 times T3. Therefore, T1/T3 ≈3.22.

So D3/D1 = (3.22)^2 = approx (3.2)^2=10.24, but more precisely 3.22*3.22.

3.22 squared: 3*3=9, 0.22*3=0.66, 3*0.22=0.66, 0.22*0.22=0.0484. Wait, perhaps better to compute 3.22^2: 3 *3=9, 3*.22=0.66, .22*3=0.66, .22*.22=0.0484. Wait, no, that approach isn't correct. Let me compute it as (3 + 0.22)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 9 + 1.32 + 0.0484 = 10.3684. So D3/D1≈10.3684. So D3 is about 10.3684 times D1.

But the question is about the orbital period, not the distance. So we need to relate the period to the distance. For that, we can use Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance D), provided that the mass of the star is much larger than the planet masses. But in our case, the star's mass is the same for all planets, and the planets' masses are small compared to the star, so Kepler's law applies.

So, Kepler's third law: P^2 ∝ D^3.

So P1^2 / P3^2 = D1^3 / D3^3.

Wait, no, wait: P^2 ∝ D^3, so P3^2 / P1^2 = (D3/D1)^3.

So, P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 ) = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

Wait, D3/D1 is approximately 10.3684, so cube that: (10.3684)^3 ≈ let's compute 10^3=1000, 0.3684^3≈ approx 0.05. But wait, 10.3684^3 is (10 + 0.3684)^3.

Alternatively, compute 10.3684^3:

10.3684 *10.3684= approx 107.5 (since 10^2=100, 10*0.3684*2=7.368, and 0.3684^2≈0.135, so sum is 100+7.368+0.135≈107.503).

Then multiply by 10.3684 again: 107.503 *10.3684 ≈ let's see, 107.5 *10 is 1075, 107.5 *0.3684 ≈ approx 107.5 *0.36=38.7, and 107.5 *0.0084=0.909. So around 1075 + 38.7 + 0.909 = 1114.609.

So (D3/D1)^3 ≈ (10.3684)^3 ≈ approx 1114.6.

So P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 ) = sqrt(1114.6) ≈ 33.385.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. That would be the answer. But wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait a minute, the question also gave the mass ratios. The mass ratios are M1/M2 ≈1.15 and M2/M3≈1.35. So M1 = 1.15*M2, M3 = M2/1.35.

Wait, but in Kepler's third law, when we have a star of mass M* much larger than the planet masses, the period depends only on the semi-major axis (distance) and the star's mass. So the planet's mass is negligible, so the period depends only on the distance, not the planet's mass. Therefore, the mass ratios probably don't affect the period. So I can ignore the mass ratios provided. Therefore, the mass ratios are a red herring, or perhaps they are given for another part of the problem that's not relevant here.

So the answer would be option D) ~33.4.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says all planets have the same albedo, but that doesn't affect the ratio. So my calculation should be correct.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 \approx 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 \approx 2.3 \)
   - Combined: \( T_1 / T_3 = T_1 / T_2 \cdot T_2 / T_3 = 1.4 \cdot 2.3 = 3.22 \)

2. **Equilibrium Temperature and Distance Relationship**:
   - The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (\( T \propto 1 / \sqrt{D} \)).
   - Therefore, \( D \propto 1 / T^2 \), and the ratio of distances is \( D_3 / D_1 = (T_1 / T_3)^2 \).

3. **Distance Ratio**:
   - Substituting \( T_1 / T_3 = 3.22 \), we find:
     \[
     D_3 / D_1 = (3.22)^2 \approx 10.3684
     \]

4. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   - Kepler's third law states \( P^2 \propto D^3 \), so:
     \[
     P_3 / P_1 = \sqrt{(D_3 / D_1)^3}
     \]
   - Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.3684 \):
     \[
     P_3 / P_1 = \sqrt{(10.3684)^3} \approx \sqrt{1114.6} \approx 33.385
     \]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. The mass ratios provided are not relevant to the calculation since Kepler's third law depends only on the distance and the star's mass, which is constant for all three planets.

- Albedo for all is 0.3.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is T = T_star * (L_star / (16πσ D^2))^(-1/4) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4), but maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature scales with (L / (16πσ D²))^½, considering it's a blackbody. Or wait, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) ), where R_star is the star's radius, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/4) * (L / (sigma * 4π D²)) )^(1/4), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is given by:

T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/4)

But in this problem, all planets have the same albedo (0.3), and since the orbits are circular, e=0. So albedo's effect is the same for all. Also, we can assume that the star's luminosity and radius are the same for all planets because they're orbiting the same star. So the only varying factor is the distance D.

So, T is proportional to sqrt(R_star/(2 D)) ) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4), but since R_star and (1 - albedo) are the same for all planets, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), meaning that D ∝ 1/T².

Wait, more accurately, T is proportional to ( L / (16πσ D² (1 - a)) )^(1/4). So if L is the same, and a (albedo) is the same, then T is proportional to (1/D²)^(1/4), which is 1/D^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), hence D ∝ 1/T².

Wait, let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4). Since all three planets are around the same star, R_star and T_star are the same for each. So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). Therefore, D is proportional to 1/(T²). So, D ∝ 1/(T²).

So, if T1 is the temperature of Planet1, then D1 = k / T1², where k is a constant. Similarly, D2 = k / T2², D3 = k / T3².

So the ratio of D1 to D3 would be (T3²)/(T1²). Because D is inversely proportional to T squared.

Wait, let me see: D1 = k / T1², D3 = k / T3². So D3/D1 = (k/(T3²)) / (k/(T1²)) ) = (T1²)/(T3²) ) = (T1/T3)².

So the ratio of D3 to D1 is (T1/T3)^2.

But wait, the given ratios are T1/T2 = 1.4, T2/T3 = 2.3.

So let's find T1/T3.

T1/T3 = (T1/T2) * (T2/T3) ) = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22.

So T1 is 3.22 times T3. Therefore, T1/T3 ≈3.22.

So D3/D1 = (3.22)^2 = approx (3.2)^2=10.24, but more precisely 3.22*3.22.

3.22 squared: 3*3=9, 0.22*3=0.66, 3*0.22=0.66, 0.22*0.22=0.0484. Wait, perhaps better to compute 3.22^2: 3 *3=9, 3*.22=0.66, .22*3=0.66, .22*.22=0.0484. Wait, no, that approach isn't correct. Let me compute it as (3 + 0.22)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 9 + 1.32 + 0.0484 = 10.3684. So D3/D1≈10.3684. So D3 is about 10.3684 times D1.

But the question is about the orbital period, not the distance. So we need to relate the period to the distance.

So, Kepler's third law: P^2 ∝ D^3.

So P1^2 / P3^2 = D1^3 / D3^3.

Wait, no, wait: P^2 ∝ D^3, so P3^2 / P1^2 = (D3/D1)^3.

So, P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 ) = (D3/D1)^(3/2).

Wait, D3/D1 is approximately 10.3684, so cube that: (10.3684)^3 ≈ let's compute 10^3=1000, 0.3684^3≈ approx 0.05. But wait, 10.3684^3 is (10 + 0.3684)^3.

Alternatively, compute 10.3684^3:

10.3684 *10.3684= approx 107.5 (since 10^2=100, 10*0.3684*2=7.368, and 0.3684^2≈0.135, so sum is 100+7.368+0.135≈107.503).

Then multiply by 10.3684 again: 107.503 *10.3684 ≈ let's see, 107.5 *10 is 1075, 107.5 *0.3684 ≈ approx 107.5 *0.36=38.7, and 107.5 *0.0084=0.909. So around 1075 + 38.7 + 0.909 = 1114.609.

So (D3/D1)^3 ≈ (10.3684)^3 ≈ approx 1114.6.

So P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 ) = sqrt(1114.6) ≈ 33.385.
