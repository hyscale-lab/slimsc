Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the electric field at a point outside a spherical conductor. Hmm, let me try to visualize this setup. There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity itself has radius r, which is less than R. Now, someone placed a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, so point P is outside the conductor, right? And the distance from P to the center of the conductor is L. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta. I remember something about angles in geometry, maybe I'll need to use the law of cosines or something.

Since the conductor is uncharged, but there's a charge inside the cavity, I should think about how charges distribute. Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges on a conductor reside on the surface. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. So when you place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. 

Wait, wait. The cavity is inside the conductor, so the conductor's material is all around the cavity. So the charge +q in the cavity will induce a charge on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, the inner surface has -q, and then the outer surface must have +q to balance it out, right? Because the conductor's overall charge is zero, so inner -q, outer +q.

But wait, point P is outside the conductor. So when I'm looking for the electric field at P, it should only depend on the charge outside the conductor. Because for a conductor, the electric field outside it depends only on the total charge enclosed within, and any conducting material inside doesn't contribute—meaning, the charges on the outer surface are the ones contributing to the external field.

So the total charge outside the conductor is the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the electric field at a point outside the conductor due to these charges should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. Because the conductor is spherical, the charges distribute themselves uniformly on the outer surface, so the field outside should be as if a point charge q is at the center.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the electric field at any point outside, like point P, should be as if the charge +q is at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor is a sphere, symmetry makes it so that the field outside is radial and depends only on the total charge.

So point P is outside, so the electric field should be given by Coulomb's law. The formula would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), since L is the distance from the center. Because, for a point charge, E is kq/r², where r is the distance from the charge.

But wait, let me think again. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, but the charge is distributed on the outer surface. So due to the spherical symmetry, the field at P would be the same as if the charge were at the center. So the formula should just be E = kq/(L²).

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²). That's the same as E = kq/L².

Wait, but another option is option D: (1/(4πε₀)) q/(l²). So l is the distance from P to the center of the cavity. Why would that matter? Because the charge is inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the field outside only depends on the total charge, which is +q. So the position of the charge within the cavity shouldn't matter for points outside the conductor. Because the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces would adjust such that the field inside the conductor is zero, and outside it's as if all the charge were at the center.

Alternatively, could it be that the field due to the inner cavity's charge is somehow affecting the point P? But no, because the conductor's material acts as a Faraday cage for the electric fields inside. The charges inside the cavity only influence the inner surface, and the outer surface's charge is what contributes to the external field.

So the electric field outside the conductor, at point P, depends solely on the total charge of the conductor, which is +q. Therefore, the correct formula is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²), which is option B.

Wait, but why are the other options present? Option A and C involve l and s and cosine theta. Could it be that the point P's position relative to the cavity's center affects the field?

Wait a second, no. Because the conductor's outer surface has the charge +q, and any point outside the conductor (like P) experiences the field as if the entire charge were at the center of the conductor. The point P is at distance L from the conductor's center, so its distance from the charge's effective position (the center) is L.

But in the problem, maybe the setup is more complicated? Because the cavity is off-center, the charge +q is not at the center of the conductor. Oh wait, in the setup, the charge is inside the cavity, which itself is not at the center of the conductor. The center of the cavity is s away from the center of the conductor.

Wait, so the charge +q is inside the cavity, which is itself not at the center. So the charge is located at a point that's s away from the conductor's center. So the charge's position relative to the conductor's center is s away. 

But wait, the conductor's outer surface would adjust its charge distribution in response. So would that affect the electric field outside?

Wait, no, because when you have a spherical conductor, even if there's an off-center charge inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform. Because the conductor is a sphere, any internal charge (even off-center) would induce charges on the inner surface. But the outer surface remains spherically symmetric because the conductor is neutral as a whole. So the field outside would still be the same as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but I thought that when a charge is inside a cavity of a spherical conductor, the field outside is the same as if all the charge were at the center, regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity. Because the conductor's outer surface must arrange itself to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the field outside is as if the total enclosed charge is at the center.

Wait, that sounds right. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the field outside is as if the charge is at the center. So regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity (even if it's off-center), the external field remains the same as if the charge were at the center.

So point P is outside, so the distance from the center of the conductor is L. So the electric field should be E = kq/(L²). So the correct answer is option B.

But wait, looking back at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²), which is exactly that.

So why are options A, C, and D present? Let me think.

Option D is 1/(4πε₀) q/(l²), which would be the case if the field was calculated based on the distance from the cavity's center, but that's not the case for the external field. Because the conductor's outer surface's charge is what contributes to the external field, and the field outside should be due to the total charge on the conductor. So the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the external field.

Hmm, but wait a second. Another thought: maybe the setup is such that the conductor is neutral, but the charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So the conductor's inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have zero charge because the conductor is neutral. Wait, no, the conductor is initially neutral. So when you add +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the one touching the cavity) must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But because the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, no. The conductor is neutral. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q, making the total conductor's charge zero. So the outer surface has +q. So the external field is the same as the field due to a charge +q at the center of the conductor.

So the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, so field is E = kq/(L²).

Therefore, option B is correct.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Setup Description**: There is an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The point $P$ is outside the conductor, at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

2. **Induced Charges**: Since the conductor is initially neutral, the charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain the conductor's neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. The outer surface of the conductor has a total charge of $+q$, and due to spherical symmetry, the electric field at any point outside the conductor is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

4. **Distance and Electric Field**: The point $P$ is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Involves $l$, $s$, and $\cos\theta$, which is incorrect because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived formula $E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which is correct.
   - **Option C**: Involves $l$ and $\cos\theta$, which is incorrect for the same reason as Option A.
   - **Option D**: Involves $l^2$, which is incorrect because the electric field outside the conductor depends on $L^2$, not $l^2$.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.
