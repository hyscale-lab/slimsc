Okay, so I've got this physics question here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that charges in accelerated motion emit radiation. This question is about the power radiated in different directions.

The setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates, and the wavelength is λ. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle, which is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis.

The maximum power is given as A. I need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of f.

Wait, I think the power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle θ. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is typically a function of cosθ. Oh right, the dipole radiation pattern is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but wait, no, that's the far-field (radiation) pattern for an oscillating dipole. Alternatively, for an oscillating electric dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is what the question refers to with the radiation zone) is proportional to (sinθ)^2, or wait, I might be mixing up electric and magnetic dipoles.

Wait, no. Let me think. The standard radiation pattern for an electric dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but that's in the far field, right? Wait, no, perhaps I got that wrong. Alternatively, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole varies with sin²θ. Wait, maybe. Let me think: the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the dipole's axis. So for an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis, maximum radiation is in the equatorial plane (θ=90 degrees), and minimal at the poles (θ=0 and 180). So the intensity would depend on sin²θ, perhaps? Or maybe cos²θ?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's try to remember. The radiation pattern for an electric dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2, so the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees. So if that's the case, then at θ=30 degrees, the intensity would be (sin30)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the fraction would be 0.25, or 1/4. But wait, I'm not certain if that's the case here, because the question says it's an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped. So maybe it's not a simple dipole.

Wait, but the problem states that the charge distribution is spheroid. Hmm, a prolate spheroid is like a stretched sphere, but I'm not sure how that affects the radiation pattern. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dipole-like radiator, so the patterns apply similarly.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of multipole radiation. The monopole term doesn't radiate (only static field), so the leading term is the dipole. Higher multipoles might be present, but perhaps the dominant contribution is the dipole.

Assuming that, then the radiation pattern is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum intensity is when sinθ is 1 (θ=90 degrees), which would be the maximum. So the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ=30 degrees would be (sin30)^2 = 0.25, so 1/4. That would correspond to option B or C.

Now, looking at the options for the fraction and the form of f. The options are:

A) 1/2, λ^-4
B) 1/4, λ^-3
C) 1/4, λ^-4
D) 3/4, λ^-6

So if the fraction is 1/4, then options B and C are possible. Now, what about the dependency on λ?

Power radiated for an oscillating charge distribution (like an antenna) typically depends on the square of the amplitude and the frequency. Wait, but in terms of radiation, the power depends on the fourth power of the frequency (or inversely on λ^4, since λ = c/f, so as f increases, λ decreases, and power goes as 1/λ^4).

Wait, for a dipole antenna, the maximum radiation resistance R is proportional to (λ)^2, and the power is (V^2)/R. So if the voltage is proportional to some oscillating factor, but for radiation, the power per unit solid angle might scale with the inverse of wavelength to some power.

The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone should have a certain dependence. I think the intensity (power per unit area per unit solid angle) scales as (something) divided by λ^something.

Wait, the radiation from an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The average power for a dipole is ( (e^2 a^2 )/(6πε₀ c^3) ), where a is the acceleration. But when considering the direction, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) would be the total power integrated over all angles, divided by 4π, but that's not quite right.

Wait, the total power radiated by a dipole is P = (μ₀ e² a²)/(12π c^3), where a is the acceleration. But the intensity in a particular direction is the power per unit solid angle. The total power is the integral of intensity over all solid angles, so 4π I_avg, but that's only if I is isotropic, which it's not.

Wait, for a dipole, the intensity varies with θ. So the intensity I is proportional to (sinθ)^2. To find the total power, you integrate I over 4π steradians. So the integral of (sinθ)^2 * sinθ dθ dφ from 0 to π and 0 to 2π. Which gives a factor that depends on the integral of sin^3θ dθ dφ.

But I'm more interested in the form of I(θ). From what I remember, the intensity for dipole radiation scales as (1/λ^4), because when you have higher frequencies (smaller λ), the radiation is stronger. So the intensity I is proportional to 1/λ^4.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the units. The intensity has units of [W/m²]. The Larmor formula gives the power, which is energy per time. The dependence on frequency (or wavelength) would come from the acceleration. For a sinusoidally oscillating charge, a is proportional to ω², where ω is the angular frequency. So a ~ e^-2 / (m c^2), but perhaps it's more accurate to think in terms of the dipole moment.

But let's think about the dependence on wavelength. The average power radiated by a dipole is proportional to (ω^2)^2 / (c^6), since a ~ ω², and the power has a factor of a², and also 1/c^3 from the Larmor formula. So ω = 2π f, and c = f λ, so ω = 2π (c/λ). So ω² ~ 1/λ². Therefore, the power P is proportional to (1/λ^4) / (c^6) * (1/c^3) ? Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Alternatively, using Larmor's formula, the power is ( (e^2 a^2) )/(6 π ε₀ c^3). Acceleration a is d²x/dt², which for oscillation would be proportional to ω². So a ~ e ω² / m, perhaps? Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the dipole moment p.

The dipole moment p varies sinusoidally as p = p_0 cos(ω t). The acceleration a is the second derivative, so a ~ -p_0 ω² cos(ω t). So a squared is proportional to ω^4. So the power P is proportional to (e² a²)/(c^3) → proportional to (ω^4) * (1/c^3). But since ω c = 2π f c = 2π c / λ (since c = f λ → f = c/λ → ω = 2π c/λ). So ω = 2 π c / λ → ω^4 = (2 π c)^4 / λ^4.

Substituting into P: P ~ ω^4 / c^3 → ( (2 π c)^4 / λ^4 ) / c^3 = (2 π)^4 c^4 / λ^4 / c^3 = (2 π)^4 c / λ^4.

So P is proportional to c / λ^4. But for the intensity, which is the power per unit solid angle, I = P / (4 π) × (something). Wait, no, the total power is the integral of I over all solid angles. So I(θ) is the power per unit solid angle in direction θ. The total power is ∫ I(θ) sinθ dθ dφ over all angles. For a dipole, I(θ) is proportional to (sinθ)^2, as before.

So the intensity I(θ) is proportional to 1/λ^4. Because for each direction, the intensity depends on 1/λ^4. So the function f(λ,θ) is proportional to (sinθ)^2 / λ^4.

Wait, so for the fraction of the maximum power A at θ=30 degrees, the maximum is when sinθ is 1 (θ=90 degrees), so the maximum I is (sin90)^2 / λ^4 = 1/λ^4. The intensity at θ=30 degrees is (sin30)^2 / λ^4 = (0.25) / λ^4. So the fraction would be (0.25/λ^4) / (1/λ^4) )= 0.25, so 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function f is proportional to 1/λ^4 times sinθ^2. So the form of f is 1/λ^4.

Looking at the options, option C says the fraction is 1/4 and f is λ^-4. So that would be the correct option.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not missing anything. The question says it's an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid. Does that affect the radiation pattern? Hmm, a dipole is a simpler case, but for a spheroid, perhaps higher multipoles are present. But in the far field, the dipole term dominates, so the radiation pattern should still be approximately similar to a dipole. So the reasoning about the fraction being 1/4 and f ∝ λ^-4 should still hold.

So the correct answer would be option C: fraction is 1/4, and f is λ^-4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. The charge distribution radiates at a wavelength \( \lambda \), and the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle from the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the possible form of \( f \).

For an oscillating charge distribution, the radiation pattern in the far field is dominated by the dipole term. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) for dipole radiation is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). This means the intensity is maximum at \( \theta = 90^\circ \) (equatorial plane) and decreases as \( \theta \) approaches \( 0^\circ \) or \( 180^\circ \) (polar directions). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), the intensity is proportional to \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

The radiated power per unit solid angle also depends on \( \lambda \). For oscillating charges, the intensity scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \), which arises from the dependence of the acceleration (and hence the radiation) on the frequency (or inversely on \( \lambda \)).

Considering the options:
- **Option A**: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).
- **Option B**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
- **Option C**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as it matches both the fraction and the dependence on \( \lambda \).
- **Option D**: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), and the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**, where the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the function \( f \) scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \).
