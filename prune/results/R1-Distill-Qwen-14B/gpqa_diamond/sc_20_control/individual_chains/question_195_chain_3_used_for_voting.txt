Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there are two planets around a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star's radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet with a radius 2.5 times Earth's radius. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that it exhibits both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane, so their orbits are aligned.

Hmm, okay. I remember that a transit occurs when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, blocking some of the star's light. An occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet is hidden by the star, and we don't see its light. For both of these to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that both events are possible.

Wait, but how does the orbital period relate to both events? Oh, right. For a planet to transit, it needs to pass in front of the star. The transit's occurrence depends on the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star. That would happen when the planet is on the opposite side of the star relative to us, right?

But wait, the problem says the same orbital plane, so their orbits must lie in the same plane. So, the second planet's orbit must also be edge-on enough for transits, just like the first planet. But the question is about the maximum period the second planet can have while still allowing both events.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The first planet has an orbital period of 3 days, and the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii. The impact parameter is 0.2. Impact parameter is the distance, in units of the star's radius, from the center of the star to the closest point of the planet's path during transit. So, if the impact parameter is 0.2, that means the planet's orbit is such that it comes closest 0.2 star radii away from the star's center when it transits.

But wait, for the planet to transit, the impact parameter must be less than or equal to the sum of the planet's orbital distance (in star radii) minus the planet's radius. Or wait, maybe I should think about the geometry of the transit. For a transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of the star, which requires the planet's orbital plane to be aligned such that the planet's path across the star's disk (as seen from Earth) is possible.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the conditions for the second planet to transit and to undergo occultation. For the planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star, so the orbital distance must be such that the transit is possible. Similarly, occultation requires that the planet's position can be behind the star from our view.

Wait, but how does the orbital period affect the possibility of both events? Oh, I think the key here is that the two planets must be in a configuration where their orbital periods allow for mutual transits and occultations. Or maybe it's more about the orbital distances. Because the orbital period depends on the distance from the star. So, the longer the period, the farther the planet is from the star.

But wait, the problem says the second planet has a maximum orbital period. So, that would correspond to the maximum possible distance from the star such that both transit and occultation are possible. But how does that work?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Hill sphere or the Roche limit? No, I think that's for when a planet has moons. That's not directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe the second planet's orbit must be such that when the first planet is transiting, the second is either in occultation or transiting as well. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the condition for both transits and occultations to occur for the second planet. For a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the planet's path crosses the star's disk as seen from Earth. For occultation, the same alignment is required because the planet must pass behind the star, which again depends on the same orbital geometry.

Wait, but all that is given for the first planet is its transit impact parameter. The impact parameter (b) is calculated as (a (1 - e²)^(0.5)) / R_star, where a is the semi-major axis in star radii, and e is the eccentricity. Since the orbit is circular, e is 0. So, the impact parameter b is a / R_star. Wait, no, wait: The impact parameter (b) is given by (distance from star's center to planet's path) in units of the star's radius. So, in a circular orbit, the impact parameter is equal to a * sin(i), where i is the inclination of the orbit. So, for a transit to occur, the inclination must be close to 90 degrees (edge-on), so sin(i) approaches 1. But in reality, the impact parameter is a * sin(i) / R_star, where a is the semi-major axis in meters or whatever units, but for units, if the star's radius is R, then a is in terms of R.

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The impact parameter is the distance from the center of the star to the closest point of the planet's path during transit, measured in units of the star's radius. So, in a circular orbit, this is a (semi-major axis) times sin(i), where i is the inclination. To have a transit, sin(i) must be ≥ (R_planet + R_star) / a, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps the condition for transit is that the planet's path comes within the star's disk. So, the impact parameter must be less than or equal to the star's radius plus the planet's radius. Wait, no, because the impact parameter is measured in units of the star's radius. So, if the impact parameter is less than the sum of (planet radius)/(star radius) + something. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the condition for the planet to transit. For a transit to occur, the planet's orbit must be such that the planet's path passes in front of the star as seen from Earth. That requires the alignment of the orbital plane such that the planet's orbital inclination is near 90 degrees. The transit impact parameter is the distance from the center of the star to the planet's path, in units of the star's radius. So, if impact parameter is 0, the planet transits directly across the center. If it's higher, the transit path is further from the center.

But how does this relate to the orbital period?

Wait, the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. Since both planets are around the same star, their periods relate to their distances. The first planet has a period of 3 days. The second planet has a period P, which we need to find the maximum.

But what's the condition for both the transit and occultation events to occur for the second planet?

Ah, I think I'm missing something. For a planet to transit, the orbital inclination must be high enough, making it edge-on. For occultation, the same condition is needed because the planet must pass behind the star. So, the same orbital inclination would allow both events.

But wait, the question is about the maximum orbital period. So, the maximum period the second planet can have while still being able to transit and undergo occultation. The maximum period would correspond to the largest possible semi-major axis, because a larger a means longer period.

But wait, if the semi-major axis is too large, then the planet's orbit would be more inclined, but how does that affect the transit and occultation?

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the two planets must be in such a configuration that when one is transiting, the other is in a position where it can also transit or occult. But I'm not sure that's the case. The problem states that the second planet must exhibit both transit and occultation events, regardless of the first planet's position.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking what is the longest possible orbital period the second planet can have such that it transits and is occulted. So, for the second planet to transit, its semi-major axis (a2) must be such that the impact parameter allows transit. The impact parameter for the second planet would depend on its a2 and inclination.

Wait, but the first planet's impact parameter is given as 0.2. So, the first planet's semi-major axis (in star radii) is 0.2 / sin(i), but since the impact parameter is a * sin(i), so a = b / sin(i). For the first planet, since it transits, sin(i) is close to 1, so a1 = 0.2 (star radii). Or wait, no: the impact parameter is a * sin(i) in units of R_star. So, if the star's radius is R_star, then a (in terms of R_star) is a = (impact parameter) / sin(i). Since the orbit is circular, a is the semi-major axis. Since the planet transits, sin(i) must be close to 1, so a1 is approximately 0.2 R_star.

Wait, maybe I should compute the semi-major axis (a) of the first planet. Using Kepler's third law, we can find a in terms of the orbital period.

Kepler's third law states that (a^3)/(T^2) = (G(M_star)) / (4π²). But since we're dealing with units where the star's mass is M_sun, and the planet's period is in days, perhaps there's a shortcut.

Wait, the period of the first planet is 3 days. Let me compute its semi-major axis. The formula for Kepler's third law in astronomical units (AU) and years is P^2 = a^3 / (M_star)^(1/3). But M_star here is 1.5 times the Sun's mass. Hmm, but the first planet's period is 3 days. Let me convert that into years.

3 days is 3/365 ≈ 0.008219 years. So,

P^2 = (a1)^3 / (M_star)^(1/3)

So,

(0.008219)^2 = a1^3 / (1.5)^(1/3)

Calculate:

Left side: (0.008219)^2 ≈ 6.755e-5

Right side: a1^3 / (1.5^(1/3)) ≈ a1^3 / 1.1447

So,

6.755e-5 = a1^3 / 1.1447 → a1^3 = 6.755e-5 * 1.1447 ≈ 7.736e-5 → a1 ≈ cube root of 7.736e-5.

Cube root of 7.736e-5: Let's approximate. 4e-5 is (3.4)^3 ≈ 39.304e-6, which is about 0.0000393. That's smaller. Wait, 0.044^3 is approximately 0.000085, so 0.044 is about 4.4e-2. Hmm, wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.044^3 = (0.04)^3 + ... 0.04^3 is 64e-6, 0.044^3 is (44e-3)^3 = 85,184e-9 = 8.5184e-5. Oh, so 0.044^3 is 8.5184e-5. But the a1^3 is 7.736e-5, which is less than that. So a1 is a bit less than 0.044 AU.

Wait, 0.044 AU is about the distance from Earth to Mercury, which is about 0.387 AU on average. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 1 AU is Earth's orbital radius. Mercury is about 0.39 AU. So, 0.044 AU is much closer than Mercury. Hmm. But the first planet has a 3-day period, which is much shorter than Mercury's 88-day period. So, that makes sense.

But perhaps I don't need to go into such detail. The point is, the first planet's a is about 0.044 AU, but given the star is 1.5 solar masses, the actual a is a bit smaller. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's radius instead of AU since the star's radius is given in terms of solar radii.

Wait, the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii. The first planet's impact parameter is 0.2, which is the distance from the star's center in terms of the star's radius. So, the planet's semi-major axis a1 is equal to the impact parameter divided by sin(i), but for a transiting planet, sin(i) is ≈1, so a1 ≈ 0.2 (star radii). Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would imply a1 is 0.2 times the star's radius, which would be way too close, leading to an orbital period much shorter than 3 days. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the impact parameter.

Wait, the impact parameter is the distance from the star's center to the planet's path during transit, measured in units of the star's radius. So, if the planet's orbit is circular, and the impact parameter is 0.2, then a1 (in star radii) is 0.2 / sin(i). For a transiting planet, the inclination i is 90 degrees, so sin(i) is 1. So a1 is 0.2 (star radii). So a1 is 0.2 times the star's radius.

Wait, but the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii. So a1 is 0.2 * 1.5 R_sun = 0.3 R_sun. Hmm, that seems very small. Because the star's radius is about 1.5 million km (approx 1.5 R_sun). So, a1 is 0.3 * 1.5 million km = 0.45 million km. That's 450,000 km. The Earth's average distance is about 150 million km, so this planet is much closer than Mercury.

Wait, but the orbital period is 3 days. Let's check using Kepler's third law.

The formula for the orbital period in days is given by:

P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star)) * a^3

But using the version where P is in years and a is in AU,

P² = a³ / (M_star / M_sun)^(1/3)

Wait, no, the correct formula is P² = (4π² a^3) / (G(M_star)).

Alternatively, for objects in the same system with the same star, the ratio of periods squared is the ratio of a³.

So, comparing the first planet (P1=3 days, a1=0.2 R_star) to the second planet (P2=?, a2=?).

But I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider the ratio of their semi-major axes based on their periods.

Wait, using Kepler's third law:

P² = (4π² * a³) / (G(M))

But since both planets are orbiting the same star, M is the same for both. So,

(P2 / P1)^2 = (a2 / a1)^3

So,

a2 = a1 * ( (P2² / P1²) )^(1/3)

But I'm not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, but the problem is to find the maximum P2 such that the second planet can transit and undergo occultation. So, what conditions must a2 satisfy?

For the planet to transit, the impact parameter b must be less than or equal to (a2) * (R_planet / R_star) + something? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the planet can only transit if the orbital distance is such that the planet's path can cross the star's disk.

Wait, the impact parameter is given by b = a * sin(i) where a is the semi-major axis in units of the star's radius. For a transiting planet, sin(i) must be 1, so a = b. So, the first planet has a1 = 0.2 R_star.

Wait, but the second planet's a2 would be based on its own impact parameter. But the problem doesn't give the second planet's impact parameter. Hmm, perhaps it's that the second planet must also have an impact parameter that allows for transit. But the question is about the maximum period, so perhaps the second planet's impact parameter is the same as the first's, because it's maximum when the impact parameter is at the minimal required for transit.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

The maximum period of the second planet would occur when it's as far away as possible, but still allowing it to transit and be occulted. So, the furthest it can be is such that it's just possible for it to transit and be occulted. What's the condition for that?

Well, for a planet to transit, the orbital distance a must be such that the planet's path can cross the star's disk. The impact parameter must be less than or equal to the star's radius plus the planet's radius, divided by the star's radius. Wait, no, because impact parameter is measured in units of the star's radius.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the planet's size is such that the transit is possible. The transit depth depends on the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. But for the transit to occur, the planet must pass in front. So, the impact parameter just needs to be such that the planet's path crosses the star's disk. The maximum impact parameter for which the planet can still transit is when the planet's path just touches the edge of the star. So, impact parameter b equals a (since sin(i)=1), and b must be less than or equal to the star's radius plus the planet's radius, in terms of the star's radius.

Wait, no, the impact parameter is the distance from the center in star radii. So, for the planet to transit, the impact parameter must be less than or equal to the radius of the star plus the radius of the planet, all divided by the star's radius. Because if the planet's path comes closer than that, the planet will block part of the star.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: For a planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star. So, the planet's orbit must be such that the planet's path (as seen from Earth) intersects the star's disk. The maximum impact parameter for which a transit is possible would be when the planet's path just grazes the star's disk. So, the impact parameter (b) would be equal to the star's radius plus the planet's radius, measured in units of the star's radius.

Wait, but impact parameter is the distance from the star's center to the planet's path during transit. So, if the planet's radius is Rp, and the star's radius is R*, then for the planet's path to just graze the star's disk, the impact parameter b must be equal to (R* + Rp) / R*.

Wait, no. Because if the planet's path is at a distance b R* from the center, and the planet has radius Rp, then the condition for the planet to start blocking the star is that the planet's disk must overlap with the star's disk. So, the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius must be greater than or equal to the impact parameter.

Wait, no. Wait, imagine the star is a circle of radius R*, and the planet's path is a circle of radius Rp, centered at a distance b R* from the star's center. For the two circles to overlap (i.e., the planet's disk overlaps with the star's), the distance between their centers (b R*) must be less than or equal to R* + Rp. So, the condition is:

b ≤ (R* + Rp) / R*

Because Rp is much smaller than R*, this simplifies to approximately b ≤ 1 + Rp/R*.

But wait, if the planet's path is at a distance b R* from the center, and the planet's radius is Rp, then the condition for the planet to transit (i.e., the planet's disk overlapping the star's disk) is that b R* ≤ R* + Rp.

Dividing both sides by R*, we get:

b ≤ 1 + (Rp / R*)

So, in this case, for the second planet, which has a radius of 2.5 Earth radii, and the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii. Wait, but wait—do we need to compare Earth's radius to the star's radius?

Wait, no. Because we need to compute the impact parameter for the second planet in terms of the star's radius. So, the star's radius is 1.5 R_sun. Earth's radius is about 0.00917 R_sun (since the Sun's radius is ~109 times Earth's). So, Earth radius is approximately 0.00917 solar radii. So, the second planet's radius is 2.5 Earth radii, which is 2.5 * 0.00917 ≈ 0.0229 solar radii.

So, Rp2 = 0.0229 R_sun.

So, for the second planet, the maximum impact parameter for transit is:

b_max = 1 + Rp2 / R* = 1 + (0.0229 R_sun) / (1.5 R_sun) ) = 1 + 0.01527 ≈ 1.01527.

But wait, impact parameters are typically less than 1 for transiting planets because when the impact parameter is greater than 1, the planet doesn't transit—it misses the star. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if the impact parameter is greater than 1, the planet doesn't transit because it doesn't cross the star's disk. So, for a transit to occur, the impact parameter must be ≤ 1 + (Rp/R*), but since Rp is small, if a planet's impact parameter is greater than 1, it won't transit.

Wait, but in our case, the second planet has a radius of 0.0229 R_sun, and the star is 1.5 R_sun. So, Rp2/R* = 0.0229 / 1.5 ≈ 0.01527. So, 1 + 0.01527 = 1.01527.

But the impact parameter can't be greater than 1 if we're talking about a planet that transits. Because if b is greater than 1, the planet's path doesn't cross the star's disk. So, for a transit to occur, b must be less than or equal to 1. But wait, that's not exactly correct. Because if the planet's path is at a distance b R* from the center, and the planet's radius is Rp, then the condition is that the planet's disk must intersect the star's disk. So, the condition is b ≤ (R* + Rp)/ R*.

Wait, no. Actually, the correct condition is:

For a transit to occur, the planet's path (a circle of radius Rp) must intersect the star's disk (a circle of radius R*). The distance between the centers is b R*. So, the two circles will overlap if b R* ≤ R* + Rp.

So, b ≤ (R* + Rp) / R*.

Which, as before, is approximately 1 + Rp/R*.

But since Rp is much smaller than R*, the maximum impact parameter for a transit is just slightly larger than 1. But if b is larger than 1, the planet's path is outside the star's disk, so no transit. So, for the planet to transit, b must be ≤ 1 + Rp/R*, which is just a bit over 1.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's plug in the numbers.

Rp2 = 2.5 Earth radii.

Earth radius is ~6371 km. So, 2.5 * 6371 = ~15,927.5 km.

The star has a radius of 1.5 R_sun. R_sun is ~695,700 km. So, 1.5 * 695,700 ≈ 1,043,550 km.

So, Rp2 / R* = 15,927.5 / 1,043,550 ≈ 0.01524.

So, 1 + Rp2/R* ≈ 1.01524.

So, for the second planet to transit, its impact parameter must be ≤ 1.01524. But wait, impact parameters are usually considered as the distance in units of the star's radius. So, the maximum impact parameter for transit is about 1.01524. But if the planet's path is at an impact parameter larger than that, it doesn't transit.

But wait, the impact parameter is the distance from the star's center. If the impact parameter is 1.01524, then the planet's path is just barely touching the star's disk, so it's a grazing transit. So, this is the maximum impact parameter for which a transit occurs.

So, the second planet must have an impact parameter ≤ 1.01524.

But how does this relate to the semi-major axis a2 of the second planet?

The impact parameter b is a2 * sin(i) / R*, assuming a circular orbit and sin(i) = 1 (edge-on). So, for the second planet, a2 = b * R*.

Wait, no, wait. Impact parameter is (a2 sin(i)) in units of R*. So, a2 sin(i) = b.

But for a transiting planet, sin(i) is 1 because the orbit is edge-on. So, a2 = b.

Wait, but wait. The semi-major axis a2 is in meters or kilometers, and R* is in the same units. So, a2 (in meters) = (b) * R* (meters).

So, for the second planet, the maximum a2 for transit is a2 = (1.01524) * R*.

Wait, but the first planet has a1 = 0.2 R* (from the given impact parameter of 0.2). So, a1 = 0.2 R*.

So, the second planet's a2 must be less than or equal to 1.01524 R* to allow transit. But wait, if a2 is larger than a1, that would mean it's further out, so a longer period.

But the problem is asking for the maximum period, so we want the maximum a2 such that the planet can still transit (a2 ≤ 1.01524 R*). However, that's not considering the occultation.

Wait, but occultation occurs when the planet passes behind the star, so we need to see the planet's light dip when it's behind the star. For this to happen, the planet must be bright enough or have a detectable phase. But perhaps the main condition is that the planet's orbital distance is such that it can be on the opposite side of the star from us, so the planet is hidden.

But how does that relate to the orbital period?

Wait, for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star. So, the orbital distance a2 must be such that the star's disk blocks our view of the planet. But that's a function of the orbital distance. The planet must be close enough to the star so that, from our perspective, when it's directly behind the star, it is within the star's apparent disk.

Wait, so for occultation, the planet's angular size as seen from Earth must be smaller than the star's angular size. Which depends on the distance from the star. But perhaps the condition is that the planet's orbital distance a2 is such that the planet's apparent size is smaller than the star's apparent size, allowing it to be occulted.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the condition for occultation is that the planet's orbital period is such that when it's at the opposite side of the star, it's within the star's apparent size, making it possible to be occulted.

Wait, perhaps the maximum period is when the planet's orbital distance is such that when it's at the opposite side of the star, it's just at the edge of the star's disk. So, the planet's orbital distance a2 must satisfy a2 (in star radii) is such that when the planet is at the opposite side, the projected distance is a2 + R*, and this must be equal to the impact parameter's maximum for occultation.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the occultation occurs when the planet is at the same position as the star in the sky, so from our point of view, the planet is behind the star. The condition for this is that the planet's orbital distance a2 (in star radii) must be such that when the planet is at that position, it's within the star's disk. So, the planet's orbital distance a2 must be less than or equal to the star's radius plus the planet's radius, but that seems similar to the transit condition.

Wait, but perhaps the key point is that both planets must be in the same orbital plane, so when the first planet transits, the second could be in a position where it's either transiting or occulting.

But the question is about the second planet's maximum period, so perhaps the second planet must have an orbital period such that its orbital distance is not so large that its orbital period would make it impossible to be in the same orbital plane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The second planet must have an orbital period that is such that it can both transit (when in front) and be occulted (when behind). The maximum period occurs when the second planet's orbit is as large as possible (so, the longest possible period) while still allowing it to transit and be occulted.

For the planet to be occulted, the planet must be on the far side of the star from our perspective. The distance between the planet and the star must be such that, when the planet is behind the star, it's within the star's apparent disk. So, the planet's orbital distance a2 must be such that when it's directly behind the star, the distance from the star to the planet is a2, and the apparent size of the planet must be smaller than the star's apparent size.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that a2 must be such that when the planet is at the far side, it's within the star's disk as seen from Earth. So, the distance from the star to the planet (a2) must be less than or equal to the star's radius (R*) plus the planet's radius (Rp), as seen from Earth. But since we're considering the distance in the same system, perhaps a2 must be less than R* + Rp, but that seems in terms of star radii.

Wait, no, a2 is the semi-major axis in the same units as R*, so a2 is in terms of R*.

So, for the planet to be occulted, a2 must be less than or equal to R* + Rp, but in terms of a2 (semi-major axis) in units of R*.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that a2 (in R*) must be less than or equal to 1 + Rp/R*, which is the same as the transit condition. So, the same condition applies for both events.

So, a2 must be ≤ 1 + Rp/R*.

Which for the second planet is 1 + (0.0229 R*) / R* ) = 1.01524 R*.

Wait, but that would mean the maximum a2 is about 1.01524 R*. But wait, this is the same as the transit condition. So, the maximum a2 for the second planet to transit is 1.01524 R*.

But what about the occultation? Because for occultation, the planet must be behind the star. So, the distance from the star to the planet must be such that when it's behind, the planet is within the star's disk as seen from Earth. But since the planet's orbital distance is a2, which is 1.01524 R*, the planet is just barely outside the star when it's in front (transit) and just barely behind when it's occulting.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up again. Let me think in terms of a2.

If a2 is 1.01524 R*, then during transit, the planet is just barely grazing the star's disk. During occultation, when the planet is on the far side, the distance from the star is a2, so the planet is 1.01524 R* away from the star. But the star's radius is R*, so from our perspective, the planet is 1.01524 R* away, which is 1.01524 R* away from the star's center. But the star's radius is R*, so the planet is 0.01524 R* beyond the star's edge. So, during occultation, the planet would be just outside the star's disk, so we wouldn't see any occultation. Because the planet is not being blocked by the star, it's beyond.

So, to have occultation, the planet must be within the star's disk when it's on the far side. So, a2 must be ≤ R*. Because if a2 > R*, then during occultation, the planet is outside the star's disk, and thus not occulted.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the planet's semi-major axis a2 is greater than R*, then when the planet is on the far side, it's a2 away, which is beyond the star's radius of R*. So, it won't be occulted. Therefore, for occultation to occur, a2 must be ≤ R*.

Wait, but the transit condition requires a2 ≤ 1.01524 R*. So, to satisfy both conditions, a2 must be ≤ R*.

Because if a2 is greater than R*, then during occultation, the planet is beyond the star's disk, so no occultation. Therefore, the maximum a2 for the second planet is R*.

Wait, but that's contradictory. Because for the second planet to transit, a2 must be ≤ 1.01524 R*, but for occultation, a2 must be ≤ R*.

So, the maximum a2 is R*, since that's the stricter condition.

So, a2_max = R*.

Now, using Kepler's third law to find the period P2.

The first planet has a1 = 0.2 R*, period P1=3 days.

The second planet has a2 = R*, period P2=?

Using the formula (P2/P1)^2 = (a2/a1)^3.

Substituting,

P2^2 / 3^2 = (R*/0.2 R*)^3 = (1/0.2)^3 = (5)^3 = 125.

So,

P2^2 = 3^2 * 125 = 9 * 125 = 1125.

P2 = sqrt(1125) ≈ 33.54 days.

So, the maximum period is approximately 33.5 days.

Looking at the options, option C is ~33.5, so the answer should be C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that allows it to exhibit both transit and occultation events, we analyze the conditions for these phenomena and use Kepler's third law to relate the orbital periods and semi-major axes of the two planets.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Transit Condition**:  
   For a planet to transit, its semi-major axis \(a_2\) must satisfy the condition that its path intersects the star's disk. The maximum impact parameter for transit is given by:  
   \[
   b_{\text{max}} = 1 + \frac{R_p}{R_*}
   \]  
   where \(R_p\) is the planet's radius and \(R_*\) is the star's radius. For the second planet:  
   - \(R_p = 2.5 R_{\text{Earth}} \approx 0.0229 R_*\) (since \(R_{\text{Earth}} \approx 0.00917 R_*\)).  
   - Substituting, \(b_{\text{max}} = 1 + \frac{0.0229}{1.5} \approx 1.01524\).  

   The semi-major axis for the second planet is related to the impact parameter by \(a_2 = b_{\text{max}} \cdot R_*\). Thus, \(a_2 \leq 1.01524 R_*\).

2. **Occultation Condition**:  
   For occultation to occur, the planet must pass behind the star, meaning its semi-major axis must satisfy \(a_2 \leq R_*\). If \(a_2 > R_*\), the planet would be outside the star's disk during occultation, and the event would not occur.

3. **Combining Conditions**:  
   To satisfy both transit and occultation, the stricter condition applies:  
   \[
   a_2 \leq R_*.
   \]

4. **Kepler's Third Law**:  
   Using Kepler's third law, the orbital period \(P\) is related to the semi-major axis \(a\) by:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^3
   \]  
   For the first planet:  
   - \(P_1 = 3 \, \text{days}\), \(a_1 = 0.2 R_*\).  
   For the second planet:  
   - \(a_2 = R_*\).  

   Substituting:  
   \[
   \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{R_*}{0.2 R_*}\right)^3 = (5)^3 = 125.
   \]  
   Solving for \(P_2\):  
   \[
   P_2^2 = 3^2 \cdot 125 = 9 \cdot 125 = 1125.
   \]  
   \[
   P_2 = \sqrt{1125} \approx 33.5 \, \text{days}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The maximum orbital period of the second planet that allows it to exhibit both transit and occultation events is approximately **33.5 days**. This corresponds to option **C**.
