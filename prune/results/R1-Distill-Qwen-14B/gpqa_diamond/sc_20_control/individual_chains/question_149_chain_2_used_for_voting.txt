Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Hmm. Let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that we're analyzing a small synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR shows something unusual. Except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton, the spectrum looks correct. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. But why are there two peaks for the same proton?

Wait, the question says to rule out spin-spin coupling. So it's not because of coupling with neighboring protons. So what else could cause a single proton to split into two peaks? Hmm. Maybe it's something to do with the proton's environment.

Then, looking at the LC-MS. The crude compound shows two peaks with the same mass. So same mass, same retention time, right? Because the mass spec is consistent with the expected molecule. So what would cause two peaks with the same mass but different behavior in LC-MS?

Hmm, the options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor in LC-MS would probably have a different mass, like the molecular ion minus something. Since both peaks have the same mass as expected, I think A is less likely.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and would appear as a single peak in MS because mass doesn't distinguish between enantiomers. In LC, if the column is chiral, they might separate, but if it's achiral, they would co-elute. Oh, but the LC-MS was run at elevated temperature. Wait, does temperature affect chiral separation? Maybe if the column is chiral, higher temp could cause the enantiomers to elute at different times. But wait, the peaks have same mass, but if they were enantiomers, LC might separate them if using a chiral column. But the NMR part: enantiomers would have identical NMR shifts because they're mirror images. So in NMR, the alpha proton would be a singlet, right? Unless there's something else. Wait, but in the question, the two peaks for the same alpha proton have similar shifts. Enantiomers would not cause that; the shifts would be same, so same peak. So maybe B is not the answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too familiar with this term. Maybe it's something like forming two different amide bonds, leading to some sort of coupling that creates two different environments for the same proton. Or perhaps during the reaction, the amide bond could form in two different ways, leading to two different diastereomers? Or maybe it's a coupling in the sense of two different adjacent groups causing splitting. Wait, but the NMR peaks have similar shifts and same integral. So maybe they're from two different diastereomers.

Wait, but the question said that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin. So maybe it's a diastereotopic issue? Or perhaps some kind of isomerism that's causing the same proton to have two different environments.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would show up as separate peaks in NMR and maybe separate in LC. So in NMR, each diastereomer would have its own set of peaks. But wait, in the NMR, the same alpha proton is showing two peaks. So perhaps each diastereomer has that proton in a slightly different environment. But wait, if the two diastereomers are present in equal amounts, then the same proton in each would have similar shifts but split into two peaks. But the integrals together are 1H, which makes sense because each diastereomer contributes 1H, but they're split into two.

Wait, but in the NMR, why would two diastereomers of the same compound cause the same proton to split into two peaks? Because each diastereomer has a different environment, so that proton would be in a different chemical environment in each. So in the overall NMR, you'd see two peaks for that proton, each corresponding to each diastereomer. So the integral for each would be roughly 0.5H, adding up to 1H.

And in the LC-MS, since both have the same mass, they would show as two peaks of same mass but perhaps different retention times. But in the question, the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity and same mass. So that's consistent with diastereomers.

So why are the diastereomers present? Maybe the synthesis didn't proceed with 100% stereochemical control. Like, if during the formation of an amide bond, the stereochemistry wasn't fully controlled, leading to a mixture of diastereomers.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is formed with a stereocenter that's not fully controlled. Wait, but for diastereomers, you need more than one stereocenter, or a different configuration that leads to different physical properties.

Wait, another scenario: during the formation of an amide, perhaps the alpha carbon could have formed a diastereomeric mixture. If that's the case, the same alpha proton would be in two different environments, leading to two peaks in the NMR.

So putting it together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because there are two diastereomers. The LC-MS shows two equal peaks because they have the same mass and are in equal amounts.

So the most likely answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, and the LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. The key observations are:

1. **NMR Analysis**: The two peaks for the same alpha-proton have similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (adding up to 1H), and are not due to spin-spin coupling. This suggests the proton is in two distinct environments, likely due to stereochemical differences.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**: The two peaks have the same mass, ruling out the presence of a precursor or unrelated contaminants. This indicates the compound exists as two isomers with the same molecular weight.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor)**: A precursor would have a different mass, which is inconsistent with the LC-MS data showing two peaks of the same mass. This option is unlikely.

- **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers)**: Enantiomers have identical NMR shifts because they are mirror images, so they would not produce two distinct peaks for the same proton. Additionally, LC-MS would not separate enantiomers on an achiral column, and the question does not specify a chiral column. Thus, this option is unlikely.

- **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation)**: While "double coupling" could theoretically create two peaks, the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. There is no clear evidence in the data to support this explanation, making this option less likely.

- **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**: Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, leading to distinct NMR peaks for the same proton in different environments. In the LC-MS, the two peaks with the same mass and equal intensity are consistent with a mixture of diastereoisomers. This explanation aligns well with both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which accounts for the observed NMR and LC-MS data.
