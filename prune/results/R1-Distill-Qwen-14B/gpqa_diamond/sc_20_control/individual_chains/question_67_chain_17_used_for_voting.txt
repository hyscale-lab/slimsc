Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. It says to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. And l and m are the total angular momentum quantum numbers for the system.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ. The options are A to D, with D being 0, which I think might be the answer, but I'm not sure yet.

Hmm. Let me think. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. For a p orbital, l is 1. So each electron has l₁ = 1 and l₂ = 1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is given as 2. So that's the sum of l₁ and l₂, which makes sense because maximum possible.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. But wait, when you couple two angular momenta, the m values add. So m = m₁ + m₂. In this case, m is -1. So each m for the individual electrons contribute to that. 

Wait, but the state is a coupled state, which means it's an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators L² and L_z. So when we measure L_z for the total system, we get mħ. Here m is -1, so the eigenvalue is -ħ. But the question is about measuring each individual L₁z and L₂z.

I remember that for two particles, the coupled state can be expressed as a combination of product states of the individual states. Each product state would have specific m₁ and m₂ values, such that m₁ + m₂ = m_total, which is -1 here.

So the coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m> can be written as a linear combination of |m₁, m₂>, where m₁ and m₂ are the individual z-components. The coefficients are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, right?

Wait, but each electron's angular momentum is l=1. So possible m values are -1, 0, +1 for each. So when combining two l=1 particles to get a total l=2 with m=-1, what are the possible combinations of m₁ and m₂?

The possible m₁ and m₂ must add up to m_total = -1. So the possible pairs are:

m₁ = -1, m₂ = 0 → sum is -1.
m₁ = 0, m₂ = -1 → sum is -1.
m₁ = -2, but wait, no, because each can only go from -1 to +1. So those are the only possibilities.

So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the expansion in terms of the product states is a combination of these |m₁, m₂> states. The coefficients can be found using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, but what's the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining two l=1 states into l=2, m=-1?

The CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

The general formula is a bit complex, but I think for two l=1 states, the possible combinations are:

For M_total = -2: (-1, -1)
For M_total = -1: (-1, 0) and (0, -1)
Similarly for other M values.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is the combination of the product states where m₁ + m₂ = -1. So the states are |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

Wait, but how about the coefficients? The CG coefficient for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1 is given by... I think it's sqrt( ( (2 - m₁)(2 + m₁) ) / (4*(2)) )) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully.

Alternatively, the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = a |m₁=-1, m₂=0> + b |m₁=0, m₂=-1>

We can find the coefficients a and b. The standard approach is to use orthonormality and the properties of CG coefficients.

I recall that for two l=1 particles combining into L=2, the states are:

For M = 2: |1,1,2,2> = |1,1>
For M=1: sqrt( (2)(3)/ (2*(2+1)) ) |1,0> + sqrt( (1)(3)/(2*(2+1)) ) |0,1>
Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me think about symmetries.

Wait, another approach. The combined state must be symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange of the two particles, depending on whether they are identical bosons or fermions. But electrons are fermions, so their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. However, the question says to ignore spin. But wait, in this problem, we're only considering the orbital angular momentum, so maybe spin is being ignored. Hmm, perhaps that's a complication, but maybe not required here.

But wait, the orbital angular momentum part would have a certain symmetry. So for two electrons in p orbitals, the orbital part of the wavefunction must be antisymmetric because electrons are fermions, and the overall wavefunction (including spin) must be antisymmetric. But since spin is being ignored here, perhaps the orbital part must be symmetric or antisymmetric?

Wait, no, actually, the orbital angular momentum part is symmetric under exchange if the spin part is antisymmetric, or vice versa. But the problem says to ignore spin, so perhaps we're only considering the orbital part, which would have a specific symmetry.

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things further. Let me focus on just the angular momentum part.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the total m is -1. So in terms of m₁ and m₂, the possible combinations are m₁=-1 and m₂=0, or m₁=0 and m₂=-1.

The coefficients can be determined using the CG coefficients. So for l1=1, m1, l2=1, m2, and total L=2, M=-1.

The CG coefficient for these quantum numbers is given by:

⟨ l₁ m₁ l₂ m₂ | L M ⟩ = \sqrt{ \frac{(2L +1)}{ (2l₁ +1)(2l₂ +1) } } * [some terms involving m's and L's ]

Wait, the formula for CG coefficients is:

C^{l1 l2}_{m1 m2 | L M} = \sqrt{ \frac{(2L +1)( (L - M + m1 + m2)! ) ( (L + M - m1 - m2)! ) ) ) }{ ( (L + M + m1 - m2)! ) ( (L - M + m1 - m2)! ) ) ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) ) }

Hmm, not sure if I remember that correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look up the specific case for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

Wait, I think for l1=l2=1 and L=2, the CG coefficients can be found in standard tables or known. Alternatively, think about the expansion.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. Let me denote them as |m1, m2>.

So the state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = a | -1, 0 > + b |0, -1>.

We need to find a and b.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Also, the state is symmetric under certain operations, but perhaps with the given quantum numbers, I can find a relation between a and b.

Wait, another approach: the total m is M = m1 + m2 = -1. The state must be such that when we take the sum of m1 and m2, it equals M. But for CG coefficients, there's a specific expansion.

Wait, for L=2, M=-1, the state is a combination of |1, -2> (but wait, l=1, so m can't be -2), so perhaps only |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The coefficients a and b can be determined using the CG formula. Let me think about the general formula again. For l1 = l2 = 1, and L=2, M=-1.

The CG coefficient C is given by:

C = sqrt( [ ( (2L +1) ) ( (L - M + m1 + m2)! ) ( (L + M - m1 - m2)! )) ) / ( (L + M + m1 - m2 +1)! ) ( (L - M + m1 - m2 +1)! ) ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) ) ] )

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe from symmetry or orthogonality.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for L=2, M=-1, the state can be written as:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( ( (2)(3) ) / (4(2 + 1)) ) ) * ( |m1= -1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> )

Wait, no, perhaps the coefficients involve a square root of fractions. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient for M=-1 is sqrt( ( (2)(3) ) / (4*(2+1)) )) ? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a = b.

Let me think: for L=2, M=-2, the state is |m1=-1, m2=-1>, because (-1) + (-1) = -2. So that's a single term, so the coefficient is 1.

For M=-1, the possible terms are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. So the state is ( | -1,0 > + |0,-1> ) multiplied by a coefficient.

Wait, but what's the coefficient? Let me think about the normalization.

The number of terms is 2, so suppose a = b, then the normalization would require 2|a|^2 =1 → a = 1/sqrt(2).

So the state would be ( | -1,0 > + |0,-1> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are different.

Wait, another approach: for two l=1 particles, the possible total L are 2, 1, 0.

The state for L=2, M=-2 is | -1, -1 >.

For L=2, M=-1, the state is a combination of | -1,0 > and |0,-1>.

Hmmm. Let me think about the general expression for adding angular momenta.

The state |l1, l2, L, M> can be written as a sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M.

The coefficient for each term is the CG coefficient, which is given by:

C^{l1 l2}_{m1 m2 | L M} = \sqrt{ \frac{(2L + 1)}{ (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1)} } * [ ... ].

Wait, perhaps I can find the CG coefficients for this specific case using known values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find it from the Wigner 3-j symbols.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible m1 and m2 values.

In our case, M = -1.

So possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = a |m1=-1, m2=0> + b |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² = 1.

What else can I use? The fact that when L=2, the state must be orthogonal to other M states. But perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the expectation value of L_z for each particle.

Wait, but the question is about measuring L₁z and L₂z. Each L₁z and L₂z correspond to the z-components of their respective angular momenta.

So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, which is a superposition of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, the coefficients are a and b.

If the state is a superposition, then the probability of each term is |a|² and |b|².

But wait, the problem states that we measure both L₁z and L₂z and want the joint probability that both are -ħ.

So for L₁z = -ħ, m1 must be -1, and similarly L₂z = -ħ implies m2 = -1.

Wait, no. Because L₁z has eigenvalues m1 * ħ. So if m1 is -1, then L₁z = -ħ. Similarly for m2.

Wait, but in the state |1,1,2,-1>, which is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, neither of these terms have both m1 and m2 equal to -1.

Because in the first term, m1=-1, m2=0 → L₁z = -ħ, L₂z = 0 → so L₂z is 0.

In the second term, m1=0, m2=-1 → L₁z = 0, L₂z = -ħ.

So in the given coupled state, each term has one electron with m=-1 and the other with m=0. There is no term where both m1 and m2 are -1.

So if we measure L₁z and L₂z, the possible outcomes are:

Either (L₁z = -ħ, L₂z=0) with probability |a|², or (L₁z=0, L₂z=-ħ) with probability |b|².

But wait, the question is asking for the joint probability that both L₁z and L₂z are -ħ. That would mean m1 = m2 = -1, so the state would be |m1=-1, m2=-1>, which is not part of the current coupled state.

Hmm. So in the given state, there are no terms where both m1 and m2 are -1. So the probability of measuring both m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero. So the answer is option D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum numbers of the system. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled State Expansion**: The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2\rangle$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the individual $z$-components of angular momentum for the two electrons. The possible combinations of $m_1$ and $m_2$ must satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = m = -1$. These combinations are:
   - $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle$
   - $|m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle$

   Thus, the coupled state is:
   \[
   |1,1,2,-1\rangle = a |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + b |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle
   \]
   where $a$ and $b$ are Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

2. **Normalization**: The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are determined by normalization and symmetry considerations. For this specific case, the state is symmetric under exchange of $m_1$ and $m_2$, leading to $a = b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

3. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are determined by $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively, such that:
   \[
   L_{1z} = m_1 \hbar, \quad L_{2z} = m_2 \hbar
   \]
   To have both $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$, we would need $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, this combination does not appear in the expansion of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$, as the only terms are $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle$ and $|m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle$.

4. **Probability Calculation**: Since the state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not include the term $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle$, the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero because the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not include the term where both $m_1$ and $m_2$ are $-1$.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. It says to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. And l and m are the total angular momentum quantum numbers for the system.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ. The options are A to D, with D being 0, which I think might be the answer, but I'm not sure yet.

Hmm. Let me think. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. For a p orbital, l is 1. So each electron has l₁ = 1 and l₂ = 1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is given as 2. So that's the sum of l₁ and l₂, which makes sense because maximum possible.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total m is -1. But wait, when you couple two angular momenta, the m values add. So m = m₁ + m₂. In this case, m is -1. So each m for the individual electrons contribute to that. 

Wait, but the state is a coupled state, which means it's an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators L² and L_z. So when we measure L_z for the total system, we get mħ. Here m is -1, so the eigenvalue is -ħ. But the question is about measuring each individual L₁z and L₂z.

I remember that for two particles, the coupled state can be expressed as a combination of product states of the individual states. Each product state would have specific m₁ and m₂ values, such that m₁ + m₂ = m_total, which is -1 here.

So the coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m> can be written as a linear combination of |m₁, m₂>, where m₁ and m₂ are the individual z-components. The coefficients are given by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, right?

Wait, but each electron's angular momentum is l=1. So possible m values are -1, 0, +1 for each. So when combining two l=1 particles to get a total l=2 with m=-1, what are the possible combinations of m₁ and m₂?

The possible m₁ and m₂ must add up to m_total = -1. So the possible pairs are:

m₁ = -1, m₂ = 0 → sum is -1.
m₁ = 0, m₂ = -1 → sum is -1.
m₁ = -2, but wait, no, because each can only go from -1 to +1. So those are the only possibilities.

So in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the expansion in terms of the product states is a combination of these |m₁, m₂> states. The coefficients can be found using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, but what's the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining two l=1 states into l=2, m=-1?

The CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

The general formula is a bit complex, but I think for two l=1 states, the possible combinations are:

For M_total = -2: (-1, -1)
For M_total = -1: (-1, 0) and (0, -1)
Similarly for other M values.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is the combination of the product states where m₁ + m₂ = -1. So the states are |m₁=-1, m₂=0> and |m₁=0, m₂=-1>.

Wait, but how about the coefficients? The CG coefficient for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1 is given by... I think it's sqrt( ( (2 - m₁)(2 + m₁) ) / (4*(2)) )) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully.

Alternatively, the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = a |m₁=-1, m₂=0> + b |m₁=0, m₂=-1>

We can find the coefficients a and b. The standard approach is to use orthonormality and the properties of CG coefficients.

I recall that for two l=1 particles combining into L=2, the states are:

For M = 2: |1,1,2,2> = |1,1>
For M=1: sqrt( (2)(3)/ (2*(2+1)) ) |1,0> + sqrt( (1)(3)/(2*(2+1)) ) |0,1>
Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me think about symmetries.

Wait, another approach. The combined state must be symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange of the two particles, depending on whether they are identical bosons or fermions. But electrons are fermions, so their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. However, the question says to ignore spin. But wait, in this problem, we're only considering the orbital angular momentum, so maybe spin is being ignored. Hmm, perhaps that's a complication, but maybe not required here.

But wait, the orbital angular momentum part would have a certain symmetry. So for two electrons in p orbitals, the orbital part of the wavefunction must be antisymmetric because electrons are fermions, and the overall wavefunction (including spin) must be antisymmetric. But since spin is being ignored here, perhaps the orbital part must be symmetric or antisymmetric?

Wait, no, actually, the orbital angular momentum part is symmetric under exchange if the spin part is antisymmetric, or vice versa. But the problem says to ignore spin, so perhaps we're only considering the orbital part, which would have a specific symmetry.

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things further. Let me focus on just the angular momentum part.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the total m is -1. So in terms of m₁ and m₂, the possible combinations are m₁=-1 and m₂=0, or m₁=0 and m₂=-1.

The coefficients can be determined using the CG coefficients. So for l1=1, m1, l2=1, m2, and total L=2, M=-1.

The CG coefficient for these quantum numbers is given by:

⟨ l₁ m₁ l₂ m₂ | L M ⟩ = \sqrt{ \frac{(2L +1)}{ (2l₁ +1)(2l₂ +1) } } * [some terms involving m's and L's ]

Wait, the formula for CG coefficients is:

C^{l1 l2}_{m1 m2 | L M} = \sqrt{ \frac{(2L +1)( (L - M + m1 + m2)! ) ( (L + M - m1 - m2)! ) ) ) }{ ( (L + M + m1 - m2)! ) ( (L - M + m1 - m2)! ) ) ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) ) }

Hmm, not sure if I remember that correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look up the specific case for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

Wait, I think for l1=l2=1 and L=2, the CG coefficients can be found in standard tables or known. Alternatively, think about the expansion.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. Let me denote them as |m1, m2>.

So the state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = a | -1, 0 > + b |0, -1>.

We need to find a and b.

The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

Also, the state is symmetric under certain operations, but perhaps with the given quantum numbers, I can find a relation between a and b.

Wait, another approach: the total m is M = m1 + m2 = -1. The state must be such that when we take the sum of m1 and m2, it equals M. But for CG coefficients, there's a specific expansion.

Wait, for L=2, M=-1, the state is a combination of |1, -2> (but wait, l=1, so m can't be -2), so perhaps only |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The coefficients a and b can be determined using the CG formula. Let me think about the general formula again. For l1 = l2 = 1, and L=2, M=-1.

The CG coefficient C is given by:

C = sqrt( [ ( (2L +1) ) ( (L - M + m1 + m2)! ) ( (L + M - m1 - m2)! )) ) / ( (L + M + m1 - m2 +1)! ) ( (L - M + m1 - m2 +1)! ) ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) ) ] )

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe from symmetry or orthogonality.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for L=2, M=-1, the state can be written as:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( ( (2)(3) ) / (4(2 + 1)) ) ) * ( |m1= -1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> )

Wait, no, perhaps the coefficients involve a square root of fractions. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the CG coefficient for M=-1 is sqrt( ( (2)(3) ) / (4*(2+1)) )) ? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a = b.

Let me think: for L=2, M=-2, the state is |m1=-1, m2=-1>, because (-1) + (-1) = -2. So that's a single term, so the coefficient is 1.

For M=-1, the possible terms are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. So the state is ( | -1,0 > + |0,-1> ) multiplied by a coefficient.

Wait, but what's the coefficient? Let me think about the normalization.

The number of terms is 2, so suppose a = b, then the normalization would require 2|a|^2 =1 → a = 1/sqrt(2).

So the state would be ( | -1,0 > + |0,-1> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are different.

Wait, another approach: for two l=1 particles, the possible total L are 2, 1, 0.

The state for L=2, M=-2 is | -1, -1 >.

For L=2, M=-1, the state is a combination of | -1,0 > and |0,-1>.

Hmmm. Let me think about the general expression for adding angular momenta.

The state |l1, l2, L, M> can be written as a sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M.

The coefficient for each term is the CG coefficient, which is given by:

C^{l1 l2}_{m1 m2 | L M} = \sqrt{ \frac{(2L + 1)}{ (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1)} } * [ ... ].

Wait, perhaps I can find the CG coefficients for this specific case using known values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find it from the Wigner 3-j symbols.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible m1 and m2 values.

In our case, M = -1.

So possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = a |m1=-1, m2=0> + b |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² = 1.

What else can I use? The fact that when L=2, the state must be orthogonal to other M states. But perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps think about the expectation value of L_z for each particle.

Wait, but the question is about measuring L₁z and L₂z. Each L₁z and L₂z correspond to the z-components of their respective angular momenta.

So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, which is a superposition of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, the coefficients are a and b.

If the state is a superposition, then the probability of each term is |a|² and |b|².

But wait, the problem states that we measure both L₁z and L₂z and want the joint probability that both are -ħ.

So for L₁z = -ħ, m1 must be -1, and similarly L₂z = -ħ implies m2 = -1.

Wait, no. Because L₁z has eigenvalues m1 * ħ. So if m1 is -1, then L₁z = -ħ. Similarly for m2.

Wait, but in the state |1,1,2,-1>, which is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>, neither of these terms have both m1 and m2 equal to -1.

Because in the first term, m1=-1, m2=0 → L₁z = -ħ, L₂z = 0 → so L₂z is 0.

In the second term, m1=0, m2=-1 → L₁z = 0, L₂z = -ħ.

So in the given coupled state, each term has one electron with m=-1 and the other with m=0. There is no term where both m1 and m2 are -1.

So if we measure L₁z and L₂z, the possible outcomes are:

Either (L₁z = -ħ, L₂z=0) with probability |a|², or (L₁z=0, L₂z=-ħ) with probability |b|².

But wait, the question is asking for the joint probability that both L₁z and L₂z are -ħ. That would mean m1 = m2 = -1, so the state would be |m1=-1, m2=-1>, which is not part of the current coupled state.

Hmm. So in the given state, there are no terms where both m1 and m2 are -1. So the probability of measuring both m1=-1 and m2=-1 is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability is zero. So the answer is option D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum numbers of the system. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$.

1. **Coupled State Expansion**: The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ can be expressed as a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2\rangle$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the individual $z$-components of angular momentum for the two electrons. The possible combinations of $m_1$ and $m_2$ must satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = m = -1$. These combinations are:
   - $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle$
   - $|m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle$

   Thus, the coupled state is:
   \[
   |1,1,2,-1\rangle = a |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + b |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle
   \]
   where $a$ and $b$ are Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

2. **Normalization**: The coefficients $a$ and $b$ are determined by normalization and symmetry considerations. For this specific case, the state is symmetric under exchange of $m_1$ and $m_2$, leading to $a = b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.

3. **Measurement of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$**: The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are determined by $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively, such that:
   \[
   L_{1z} = m_1 \hbar, \quad L_{2z} = m_2 \hbar
   \]
   To have both $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$, we would need $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, this combination does not appear in the expansion of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$, as the only terms are $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle$ and $|m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle$.

4. **Probability Calculation**: Since the state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not include the term $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle$, the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero because the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not include the term where both $m_1$ and $m_2$ are $-1$.
