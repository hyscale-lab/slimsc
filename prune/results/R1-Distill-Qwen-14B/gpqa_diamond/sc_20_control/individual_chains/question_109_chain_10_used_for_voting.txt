Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Hmm. I'm not super confident about this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Oh right, and Pauli statistics come into play, requiring that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I think T is isospin, S is spin, and L is orbital angular momentum. So, the parity condition might be important too.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. The options are A to D, each involving a transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle.

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The initial state is 1S0. The 1S0 designation probably refers to a specific term symbol. The general form is (2S+1)L J. So, for 1S0, S must be 0 because (2*0 +1)=1. So S=0, L is S (so L=0?), and J would be 0. Wait, no, S is the spin, L is orbital angular momentum, so 1S0 means (2S+1)=1, so S=0. Then L is S, which I'm not sure. Wait, wait, the spectroscopic notation is (2S+1)L^J. So 1S0 must mean S=0, L=0, J=0. Because 1 is (2S+1)=1 → S=0. So for 1S0, L is 0, so it's s-wave.

Now, when they emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1, we have to consider how this affects the overall parity. Because parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the initial state's parity is parity of NN in 1S0.

Wait, for two nucleons (protons and neutrons), their intrinsic parity. Wait, what's the intrinsic parity of a nucleon? I think that for identical particles, like two protons or two neutrons, the parity is (−1)^L. Because in their relative state. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, for two identical bosons, their overall wavefunction must be symmetric under exchange.

But in this case, the NN system is in a 1S0 state. So the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L. Since L=0, parity is +1. Ok.

Now, when they emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1, the parity of the system must be conserved. So the initial parity is NN's parity multiplied by X's parity? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the parity of the entire system would be the product of the parity of the initial NN state and X's parity. But wait, since the system is emitting X, the parity after emission should balance.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of conservation of parity. The initial state is NN in 1S0, which has parity +1 (since L=0). The final state is NN in some state plus X. So the parity of the final state would be (parity of NN's state) × (parity of X). But parity is a multiplicative quantum number.

Wait, but in an emission process, I think the parity of the initial NN system must equal the parity of the final state (NN + X) times the parity of X, because the X is emitted. Wait, not sure. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the parity of the process. The initial parity is P_initial = P_NN_initial. After emission, the parity is P_final = P_NN_final × P_X. But since parity is conserved, P_initial = P_final.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because X is being emitted, so perhaps the parity of the NN system after emission multiplied by the parity of X equals the initial parity. Let me think: When a particle is emitted, the parity of the system (NN) changes based on the parity of the emitted particle. So, the initial parity (P_initial) is the same as (P_final_NN × P_X). Because the initial system's parity is the product of the final NN's parity and the emitted X's parity. So,

P_initial = P_final_NN × P_X

We know that P_initial is the parity of the NN initial state, which is 1S0. So, since 1S0 has L=0, parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

P_X is given as -1. So,

1 = P_final_NN × (-1)

Which implies that P_final_NN = -1.

So the final NN state must have parity -1.

But the parity of the NN final state is (-1)^L_final, where L_final is their orbital angular momentum in the final state. So,

(-1)^L_final = -1 → L_final must be odd. Because (-1)^odd = -1.

So L_final must be 1,3,5,... etc. So possible L for the NN state after emission are odd values.

Now, the problem mentions Pauli statistics which impose T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is isospin, S is spin, and L is orbital angular momentum. So T, S, L are quantum numbers here.

Given that T(NN) = 0.

So 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2.

Which can be rewritten as S + L = 1 mod 2.

So S and L must have opposite parity. If S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

Wait, wait. Let me think: T(NN) = 0. So 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2. Which means (S + L +1) is even. So S + L must be odd.

So S + L is odd → S and L have opposite parity.

So for the final state, the spin S and orbital angular momentum L must be of opposite parity.

Now, the initial state is 1S0. So S_initial is 0. L_initial is 0.

When they emit X, the total angular momentum and spin of the final NN state will depend on the angular momentum carried away by X.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option.

Each option is a transition from 1S0 to some state plus a particle. For example, option A is 1S0 →7D1 + p. So the final NN state is 7D1, and X is p (proton? Or is p a typo? Maybe p denotes a particle like π or something else. Wait, the options aren't clear, but the problem statement says particle X. Oh, the options have the emitted particle denoted as p, s, etc., but maybe it's just a symbol. Wait, in the question, 'particle X of intrinsic parity -1', and the options have p, s, etc. Maybe p is a pion or something. Not sure, but perhaps it doesn't matter for the calculation.

Wait, for each option, the first part is the initial state, then the final state, and the emitted particle. So each option is like initial -> final + particle.

Wait, each option is written as 1S0 → something + something. So for example, option A is 1S0 →7D1 + p.

So, the emitted particle is p (maybe a pion or a proton?), but perhaps the details of the particle don't matter except for its parity. The problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, so the emitted particle in each option must have parity -1. Let me check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1S0 →7D1 + p

B)1S0 →3S1 +p

C)1S0 →3D3 +f

D)1S0 →3P0 +s

Wait, the emitted particles are p, p, f, s. Hmm. I'm not sure if p, f, s are particles with specific parities. But the problem says that X has parity -1. So in each case, the emitted particle must have parity -1. So let's check each option.

Wait, but the options state that the emitted particle is p, f, s. So I need to know the intrinsic parity of these particles. For example, p could be a pion (π), which has parity -1. Or perhaps these are just labels. But maybe the problem treats p, f, s as certain types of particles with known parity.

Wait, I'm not certain about the parity of these particles. Let's think: The intrinsic parity of a particle is a property. For example, pions (π^+, π^0, π^-) have parity -1. The photon (γ) also has parity -1. Neutrinos have parity... wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the letters denote the angular momentum state of X. Wait, no, the note in the problem says that the lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. So in the options, the emitted particle's symbol is a letter indicating its angular momentum state. So in option A, the emitted particle is 'p', which probably denotes a spin state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The note says: 'the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X'. So, in the options, the last part is the angular momentum state of X. So in option A, the emitted X is in state 'p', which probably refers to a p-wave (l=1). Because in spectroscopic notation, the letter denotes the orbital angular momentum: s=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. So the emitted particle's angular momentum state is given by the lowercase letters. So for example, in option D, the emitted X is in state 's', which is s-wave (L=0). So in this case, the emitted particle's intrinsic parity is given as -1, regardless of its orbital angular momentum. Because intrinsic parity is a property of the particle, not its state.

Wait, wait, no. The intrinsic parity of the particle X is given as -1. The orbital angular momentum state of X would affect the overall parity, but the intrinsic parity is a separate thing. So the overall parity of X would be (intrinsic parity) × (-1)^Lx, where Lx is the orbital angular momentum of X. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity of the emitted particle is -1 regardless of its orbital angular momentum. Because the problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So the intrinsic parity is -1. The overall parity of the emitted particle would be (-1)^{Lx} × (-1) = (-1)^{Lx +1}. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Hmm, maybe I should first focus on the parity of the NN system. We already determined that the parity of the final NN state must be -1. Which requires that L_final is odd.

Looking at each option's final state:

Option A: 7D1 → D is the orbital angular momentum letter. D corresponds to L=2. Because S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So L_final is 2. So parity is (-1)^2 = +1. But earlier we said the parity must be -1. So this can't be allowed. Wait, but wait—no, because the parity of the NN system is determined by the final state's L. So if the option's final state has L=2, the parity would be +1. But earlier calculation said parity must be -1. So this would violate parity conservation. So option A is not allowed.

But wait, let me make sure. The initial parity is +1. The emitted X has parity -1. So, the NN final state's parity must be P_initial / P_X. Because P_initial = P_final_NN * P_X.

So, 1 = P_final_NN * (-1) → P_final_NN = -1.

So, P_final_NN is (-1)^L_final = -1 → L_final must be odd. So any option where the final NN state has L even (D=2, etc.) would have P_final_NN positive, which is not allowed. So that would make those options invalid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 (D is 2). So (-1)^2 =1 → which is wrong. So this can't be allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → S is 0 → L=0. So (-1)^0=1. Wrong, since it needs to be -1. So this is not allowed.

Option C: 3D3 → D is 2. So L=2. Parity is +1. Not allowed.

Option D: 3P0 → P is 1. So L=1. Parity is (-1)^1= -1. Correct. So D is allowed.

So, options A, B, C have L=2, 0, 2 respectively. Only D has L=1.

But wait, the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the others (A, B, C) are not allowed because their L is even. But wait, the question says which is not permitted, so the one with even L.

Wait, but the options are about the partial waves of the emitted X. Wait, no. The options present the final states of the NN system. So, for example, option A says the NN state is 7D1. So L=2. That's even, which would give parity +1, which is wrong. So this option is not allowed.

So, in the options, the forbidden states are those where the NN final state has even L, because that would give parity +1, conflicting with the required parity of -1.

So the question is which of the options is not permitted. So all except D are forbidden because their L is even. So the options A, B, C are forbidden, but the question gives four options and only one is the answer.

Wait, but the question says "which is not permitted". So the correct answer would be any option where the final state's L is even, because that would give the wrong parity. So looking at the options, A is 7D1 (L=2), B is 3S1 (L=0), C is 3D3 (L=2), D is 3P0 (L=1). So options A, B, C have even L, D has L=1 (odd).

So options A, B, C are forbidden because their final state's L is even, which gives parity +1. Only D is allowed.

But the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer should be the one that is not allowed. So the ones that are not allowed are A, B, and C. But the options are limited. The problem is, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck. Because perhaps the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is considered, and how that affects the total angular momentum. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should look at the total angular momentum and spin conservation.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which is spin S=0, L=0, J=0. When emitting X, which has some angular momentum, the final state must have angular momenta that satisfy conservation.

Wait, but the initial state has J=0. So the total angular momentum after emission must also be zero. So the emitted particle's angular momentum (Lx) plus the final NN's angular momentum (J_final) must sum to zero. But because angular momentum is a vector, perhaps there's more to it. But since we're dealing with quantum numbers, the total J must be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the angular momenta of the emitted X and the final NN must equal zero. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the spin and angular momentum considerations for the Pauli statistics condition.

Wait, the condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Given that T=0, so S + L +1 must be even. So S + L must be odd.

So S and L must have opposite parity.

So for the final state, the spin S_final and orbital angular momentum L_final must satisfy S + L being odd.

So in each option, we can compute S_final and L_final.

Looking at the options:

Each option's final state is given as a term symbol. Let's parse each one.

Term symbol is (2S+1)L^J.

So for each option, after the arrow, the first part is the term symbol of the NN state.

Option A: 7D1 → (2S+1)=7 → S=3. L is D=2. So S=3, L=2. So S and L: 3 is odd, 2 even → sum S+L = 5 → odd. So 3 +2 =5 → odd. Which satisfies S + L =1 mod 2. So condition is satisfied. So Pauli condition is okay.

But earlier, the parity condition says that L=2 is even → parity +1, which is wrong. So this option is not allowed because of parity.

Option B: 3S1 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S=0. So S=1, L=0. S+L=1 → odd. So this satisfies Pauli condition. But L=0 → parity (-1)^0=1 → wrong. So this option is also not allowed.

Option C: 3D3 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D=2. S=1 (odd), L=2 (even). S+L=3 → odd. So Pauli condition is met. But L=2 → parity +1, which is wrong. So this option is not allowed.

Option D: 3P0 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P=1. S=1 (odd), L=1 (odd). S + L = 2 → even. Which does not satisfy S + L =1 mod 2. Because 1+1=2 → even. So S + L is even, which would make T=0 = (even) +1 → T=1 mod 2. But T is 0, so this would violate the Pauli condition. Wait, no.

Wait, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. T is 0.

So 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 → (S+L) must be 1 mod 2.

In option D: S=1, L=1 → sum S+L=2 → 0 mod 2. So 0 = (0 +1) mod 2 → 1 mod 2. Which is not possible. So T would be 1, which contradicts T=0.

So Pauli condition is not met for option D.

Wait, but earlier we saw that the parity condition is satisfied for D (L=1, odd → parity -1). But the Pauli condition isn't. So D is not allowed because Pauli condition isn't satisfied.

Hmm, so each option:

A: even L → parity wrong.

B: even L → parity wrong.

C: even L → parity wrong.

D: even (S+L) → Pauli condition wrong.

Wait, so all options have some issue. But the question is which is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Let me recheck.

The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

Given T=0,

0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So for each option:

Option A: S=3, L=2. 3+2=5 → 1 mod 2. So condition holds. But parity is wrong.

Option B: S=1, L=0. 1+0=1 → condition holds. Parity is wrong.

Option C: S=1, L=2. 1+2=3 → 1 mod 2. Condition holds. Parity wrong.

Option D: S=1, L=1. 1+1=2 → 0 mod 2. So 0 ≠1 mod 2. Condition not met. So Pauli condition not satisfied.

So, which options are forbidden?

The problem is to find which partial wave (emitted particle's state) is not permitted, considering both parity and Pauli conditions.

Wait, but the options are about the emitted particle's state, not the NN state. Wait, no. The options are the final NN states. So for each option, we need to check both parity and Pauli conditions.

So for each option:

Option A: parity wrong. So forbidden.

Option B: parity wrong. Forbidden.

Option C: parity wrong. Forbidden.

Option D: Pauli condition wrong. Forbidden.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the question says one of them is not permitted.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the Pauli condition.

Wait, the note in the problem says Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So, let me re-express.

So for each option, the final state's T, S, L must satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2.

But T is given as 0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So, which options have S+L odd?

Option A: S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → 1 mod 2. So condition met.

Option B: S=1, L=0 → 1 mod 2. Condition met.

Option C: S=1, L=2 → 3 mod 2 → 1. Condition met.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → 2 → 0 mod 2. Condition not met.

So options A, B, C meet the Pauli condition, but D does not.

But we have to consider parity as well. Let's recheck.

Which options have the correct parity (parity of the NN state must be -1).

Option A: L=2 → parity +1. Not allowed.

Option B: L=0 → parity +1. Not allowed.

Option C: L=2 → parity +1. Not allowed.

Option D: L=1 → parity -1. Allowed.

So only D meets the parity condition, but fails the Pauli condition.

Wait, that's contradictory. Because only D has the correct parity, but Pauli condition is not met. So in that case, the only allowed option would be none, but since the question says one is not permitted... Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, let me think again. The question says to consider both conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Wait, perhaps the Pauli condition refers to the emitted particle's isospin, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Pauli condition is applied to the emitted particle, but I think it's the final NN state.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express each part.

So, for each option, the final state must have:

1. Parity of NN state is -1 → L must be odd.

2. Pauli condition: S + L must be odd.

So, options:

Option A: L=2 (even). Parity +1 → not allowed.

Option B: L=0 (even). Parity +1 → not allowed.

Option C: L=2 (even). Parity +1 → not allowed.

Option D: L=1 (odd). Parity -1 → allowed. But Pauli condition: S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → even → not allowed.

So, the only option that satisfies the parity condition is D, but violates the Pauli condition. So, it's not allowed. The others violate parity condition.

But the question is which partial wave (of the emitted X) is not permitted. Wait, no. The question is about the final NN state's partial wave. Or perhaps the options are about the emitted particle's state.

Wait, the options are written as 1S0 → [something] + [particle], where [something] is the final NN state.

So, the options are about the final state of the NN system. So the forbidden transitions are those where either the parity condition is not met or the Pauli condition is not met.

So, for an option to be allowed, both conditions must be satisfied.

Looking at the options:

Option A: L=2 → parity wrong. So forbidden.

Option B: L=0 → parity wrong. Forbidden.

Option C: L=2 → parity wrong. Forbidden.

Option D: L=1 → parity correct. But S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → even. So Pauli condition not met. Forbidden.

So all options are forbidden. But that can't be possible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the Pauli condition wrong. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)."

So, T = S + L +1 mod 2.

Given T=0,

0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So, S and L must have opposite parity.

So, for each option:

Option A: S=3 (odd), L=2 (even). Sum is odd. OK.

But parity is wrong (L=2 → even → parity +1). So parity condition not met → forbidden.

Option B: S=1 (odd), L=0 (even). Sum is odd. OK.

Parity is wrong (L=0 → even → +1). Forbidden.

Option C: S=1 (odd), L=2 (even). Sum is odd. OK.

Parity is wrong. Forbidden.

Option D: S=1 (odd), L=1 (odd). Sum even → 0. So 0 = (0 +1) → 1 mod 2. No. So condition not met. Forbidden.

So all four options are forbidden, which can't be. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the Pauli condition is about the emitted particle. No, because the condition is on the final NN state.

Wait, perhaps the emitted particle's quantum numbers also affect the condition. Maybe I should consider the spin and angular momentum of the emitted particle.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l, which contributes to the total angular momentum. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the parity and the Pauli condition for the NN state, and the emitted particle's L doesn't affect the NN's L and S.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the overall angular momentum and spin.

The initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The final state NN must have some S and L, and the emitted particle must carry away some L and S to conserve angular momentum.

So, the initial J is 0. So the sum of the NN's J and the X's J must be 0. So J_NN + J_X = 0. But J is a vector, so they must be opposite in direction and equal in magnitude. So J_NN = - J_X.

But without knowing the emitted particle's angular momentum, perhaps it's hard to proceed.

But perhaps the problem is only about the parity and the Pauli condition, so focusing on those.

Let me re-express:

Only the option where the final NN state has L odd (so parity -1) and S + L is odd (Pauli condition) will be allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option D is the only one with L=1 (parity correct). But S=1 (odd) and L=1 (odd) → S + L = 2 (even) → condition not met. So D is forbidden.

The other options have L even → parity wrong. So, all options are forbidden, which can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition.

Wait, maybe the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So for T=0, S + L +1 must be even → S+L must be odd.

So, which options have S+L odd?

Options A: 3+2=5 → odd → yes.

Option B: 1+0=1 → odd → yes.

Option C:1+2=3 → odd → yes.

Option D:1+1=2 → even → no.

So, the Pauli condition is satisfied by A, B, C but not D.

But their parity is wrong (A, B, C have L even, so parity +1). Only D has L odd, so parity -1. But Pauli condition not met.

So, the only option that meets the parity condition is D, but it fails the Pauli condition. So it's forbidden.

The other options don't meet parity. So which one is 'not permitted'? The question is about which partial wave (emitted) is not permitted. Or perhaps it's about the final NN state.

Wait, the question says: "Which of the following partial waves is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X?"

Wait, the lowercase letters in the options are the emitted particle's angular momentum. So for option A, the emitted X is in 'p' state → Lx=1.

So perhaps the question is asking which emitted particle's L is not allowed.

But I'm confused now. Alternatively, the question is about which transition is not allowed, considering the parity and Pauli condition.

Hmm.

Wait, in the problem, when the NN system emits X, the final state of NN must have T=0, which affects their spin and orbital angular momentum.

The emitted particle's L must combine with the NN's L and S to conserve angular momentum.

But perhaps the key is to find the emitted particle's L that would cause the final NN state to violate the Pauli condition or parity.

But this is getting very complicated, and I'm not confident anymore.

Alternatively, perhaps the only option that violates the parity condition is A, B, C. So the allowed option is D. So the question is which is not allowed. So all except D are forbidden because of parity. So the answer is any of A, B, C. But the question states that only one option is not permitted.

But the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted, considering both conservation laws.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the parity of the entire process.

The initial parity is 1. The final parity is (parity of NN state) × (parity of X). The parity of X is intrinsic (-1) multiplied by (-1)^Lx, where Lx is the orbital angular momentum of X.

So, parity conservation: 1 = (parity_NN_final) × (parity_X).

parity_X = (-1) × (-1)^Lx.

So,

1 = ( (-1)^L_NN_final ) * [ (-1) * (-1)^Lx ]

→ 1 = (-1)^{L_NN_final} * (-1) * (-1)^{Lx}.

→ 1 = (-1)^{L_NN_final + Lx +1}.

→ (-1)^{L_NN_final + Lx +1} = 1.

So,

L_NN_final + Lx +1 must be even → L_NN_final + Lx must be odd.

So,

L_NN_final + Lx = odd.

So, for each option, we can compute L_NN_final and Lx, and see if their sum is odd.

The options give L_NN_final as part of the term symbol and Lx as the lowercase letter.

Wait, the option's format is 1S0 → [term symbol] + [particle]. The particle's state is given by a lowercase letter indicating its Lx.

So for option A: particle is 'p' → Lx=1.

L_NN_final is D → L=2.

So 2 +1=3, which is odd → satisfies the parity condition.

But earlier conclusion was that the parity of the NN state must be -1. So L_NN_final must be odd.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express. Let me re-express the parity condition correctly.

The initial parity is 1. The final parity is (parity_NN_final) × (parity_X).

parity_X = intrinsic_parity_X × (-1)^Lx.

intrinsic_parity_X is -1.

So,

parity_X = (-1) * (-1)^Lx.

parity_NN_final = (-1)^L_NN_final.

So,

parity_initial = parity_NN_final × parity_X.

1 = [ (-1)^L_NN_final ] × [ (-1) * (-1)^Lx ].

Simplify:

1 = (-1)^{L_NN_final} * (-1) * (-1)^Lx.

1 = (-1)^{L_NN_final + Lx +1}.

→ (-1)^{L_NN_final + Lx +1} = 1.

So,

L_NN_final + Lx +1 must be even → L_NN_final + Lx must be odd.

So, for each option:

Compute L_NN_final and Lx, sum. Check if sum is odd.

Option A:

Final state: 7D1 → L_NN_final=2.

Emitted X: 'p' → Lx=1.

Sum: 2+1=3 → odd → condition satisfied.

But wait, earlier analysis said that the NN state's parity must be -1, which requires L_NN_final to be odd. So for option A, L_NN_final is 2 (even), so parity is +1. So the overall parity would be:

parity_NN_final = +1.

parity_X = (-1) * (-1)^1 = (-1)*(-1) = +1.

So,

parity_initial = 1.

parity_NN_final * parity_X = (+1) * (+1) = +1 → which matches. So parity is conserved.

But according to the condition we derived, L_NN_final + Lx must be odd.

In option A, 2+1=3 → odd → condition is met. So why do we have a problem?

Because the parity of the NN state is +1, which would require that L_NN_final is even. But earlier, I thought that the parity of the NN state must be -1, but that was a mistake.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up earlier.

Let me re-examine the initial parity and the final parity.

The initial state's parity is P_initial = parity_NN_initial = (-1)^L_initial.

Since the initial state is 1S0 → L_initial=0 → parity +1.

The final parity is P_final = parity_NN_final × parity_X.

parity_X is intrinsic_parity_X × (-1)^Lx.

So,

parity_NN_final = (-1)^{L_NN_final}.

parity_X = (-1) × (-1)^Lx.

So,

P_final = (-1)^{L_NN_final} × [ (-1) × (-1)^Lx ].

Set P_initial = P_final:

1 = (-1)^{L_NN_final} × (-1) × (-1)^Lx.

1 = (-1)^{L_NN_final + Lx + 1}.

So,

(-1)^{L_NN_final + Lx +1} = 1 → exponent must be even.

So,

L_NN_final + Lx +1 = even → L_NN_final + Lx = odd.

So, for each option, we must have L_NN_final + Lx = odd.

Additionally, the Pauli condition must be met: S_NN_final + L_NN_final = odd (since T=0).

So, for each option, let's compute both conditions.

Let's go through each option:

Option A:

Final state: 7D1 → (2S+1)=7 → S=3. L=2.

Emitted X: 'p' → Lx=1.

Pauli condition: S + L = 3+2=5 → odd. → condition met.

Parity condition: L_NN_final + Lx = 2+1=3 → odd. → condition met.

Thus, both conditions are met. So option A is allowed.

Option B:

Final state: 3S1 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L=0.

Emitted X: 'p' → Lx=1.

Pauli condition: S + L =1+0=1 → odd. → condition met.

Parity condition: 0 +1=1 → odd. → condition met.

So, both conditions met. Option B allowed.

Option C:

Final state: 3D3 → S=1, L=2.

Emitted X: 'f' → Lx=3.

Pauli condition: 1+2=3 → odd. → condition met.

Parity condition: 2 +3=5 → odd. → condition met.

So, both conditions met. Option C allowed.

Option D:

Final state:3P0 → S=1, L=1.

Emitted X: 's' → Lx=0.

Pauli condition:1+1=2 → even. → condition not met.

Parity condition:1 +0=1 → odd. → condition met.

So, Pauli condition not met. So Option D is not allowed.

Wait, but according to the new analysis, options A, B, C are allowed, but D is not. So the answer is D.

But earlier I thought that the final NN state's parity must be -1. But that was a mistake because the parity of the NN state is not necessarily required to be -1. Instead, the overall parity of the system (NN and X) must be conserved.

So, the correct way is to ensure that L_NN_final + Lx is odd, as per the condition derived.

So, for each option:

Only option D has L_NN_final + Lx even (1+0=1 → odd? No: 1+0=1, which is odd. Wait, 1+0=1 is odd. Wait, in option D, L_NN_final=1, Lx=0. So sum is 1, which is odd. So parity condition is met.

But Pauli condition is not met. So option D fails Pauli condition.

So, which option is not permitted? The question is which partial wave is not permitted.

The options give the emitted particle's Lx as p, p, f, s.

So, for each option, the emitted particle's Lx is 1,1,3,0.

So, the partial wave refers to the emitted particle's Lx.

The question is which emitted particle's Lx is not allowed.

But according to the analysis, all options except D meet both conditions.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think: the problem says which partial wave is not permitted.

So, which of the four options (A to D) is not allowed, considering both parity and Pauli conditions.

Only D fails the Pauli condition. So D is not permitted.

So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Parity Conservation**: The initial parity of the NN system in the 1S0 state is +1 (since \( L = 0 \)). After emitting a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \(-1\), the final parity of the system must satisfy:
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final, NN}} \cdot P_X
   \]
   Substituting \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \) and \( P_X = (-1) \cdot (-1)^{L_x} \), we find:
   \[
   1 = (-1)^{L_{\text{NN, final}}} \cdot [(-1) \cdot (-1)^{L_x}]
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{\text{NN, final}} + L_x + 1} = 1
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   L_{\text{NN, final}} + L_x + 1 \quad \text{is even} \quad \Rightarrow \quad L_{\text{NN, final}} + L_x \quad \text{is odd}.
   \]

2. **Pauli Condition**: The problem states that for the final NN state:
   \[
   T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \quad (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Given \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \quad (\text{mod } 2).
   \]

### Analysis of Each Option

- **Parity Condition**: \( L_{\text{NN}} + L_x = 2 + 3 = 5 \), which is odd. Condition satisfied.
- **Conclusion**: Allowed.

#### Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
- Final NN state: \( 3P0 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (P corresponds to \( L = 1 \)).
