Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's a question about the Lagrangian in quantum field theory, specifically about the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants, so I need to figure that out.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So this must be some kind of interaction term between fermions and a gauge field, maybe like a spinor current interacting with a field strength tensor. I think this is a type of higher-order interaction, possibly similar to the chiral anomaly or something with axial currents.

But wait, the problem is just asking about the dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Right, so I need to find the mass dimension of κ. Mass dimensions are important because they tell us about the renormalizability. In 4-dimensional spacetime (which is the usual case for these problems), the action must be dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian (which is integrated over spacetime) must have a mass dimension of 4, because [Mass]^4 * [Action] is dimensionless.

So each term in the Lagrangian, like L_int, must have dimension 4. So I can set up the equation for the dimension of L_int.

Let me write down the dimensions of each part. The Lagrangian L has mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. So each term in the Lagrangian must also have dimension 4.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}. So each of these factors contributes to the dimension.

Let me think about the fields. The fermion field ψ has mass dimension 3/2 in 4D. Because for a Dirac spinor in D dimensions, the mass dimension is (D-1)/2. So D=4, so (4-1)/2 = 3/2. So ψ̄ (the adjoint spinor) also has dimension 3/2.

Now, what about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor. For a gauge field A_mu, which is a vector field, the mass dimension is 1. Because in 4D, the gauge field A has dimension 1. The field strength F is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so that's dimension 2. Because each derivative ∂ has dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so F is dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices and their commutators. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they don't carry mass dimensions. So σ_{μν} is built from γ matrices, so it's dimensionless.

Putting it all together: The term is κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

So each part: κ has some dimension [κ], ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. σ is 0. So the total dimension is [κ] + (3/2 + 3/2) + 2 = [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1. So that's the mass dimension of κ. So looking at the options, options A and C say the dimension is -1.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants are of positive mass dimension, because that implies that the interaction terms are of lower dimension, making the theory renormalizable. Alternatively, if a coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction becomes non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. In 4D, the renormalizability condition is that each coupling has a mass dimension ≥0. Because each term in the Lagrangian can have higher dimensions, and if the coupling has negative mass dimension, the term is non-renormalizable, leading to an infinite number of counterterms.

So, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable. Because the coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction is higher-dimensional. So the term would have dimension 4, but the coupling is negative dimension, which implies higher-order.

Wait, but wait. The term in the Lagrangian is [κ] = -1, so L_int has dimension 4 because κ is -1, and the rest contributes 5. Wait, no, because L_int is dimension 4, so [κ] is -1, so the term adds up to 4.

But for renormalizability, each coupling must have positive mass dimension. Because each term in the Lagrangian is multiplied by a coupling. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, then the term is of higher order, which makes the theory non-renormalizable.

Wait, another way: the mass dimension of the coupling κ in a term like L ~ κ O, where O is some operator. The operator O must have a dimension such that [κ] + [O] = 4. If [κ] is negative, then [O] is higher than 4. Because [O] =4 - [κ], so if [κ]=-1, [O]=5.

So the operator here is ψ̄ σ F ψ.

Wait, the operator is ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let's compute its dimension: ψ̄ is 3/2, F is 2, ψ is 3/2. So 3/2 + 3/2 +2 = 3 +2 =5. So the operator is dimension 5. So the term is κ multiplied by a dimension 5 operator, and [κ]=-1. So the term has dimension 4, which is correct for the Lagrangian.

But for renormalizability, we require all interaction terms to be renormalizable, which requires that the operators have mass dimension ≤4. Because if they have higher dimension, you can't renormalize them with a finite number of terms. So in this case, the operator is dimension 5, which is higher than 4. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So now, putting it together, [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, option C says mass dimension -1 and not renormalizable. Option A says dimension -1 and renormalizable, which is wrong. Option D has dimension 1 and not renormalizable. But our κ has dimension -1, so D is wrong. So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\). 

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\)
In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action is dimensionless. Each term in the Lagrangian must therefore have mass dimension 4. The given term is:

\[
\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}.
\]

- The fermion field \(\psi\) has mass dimension \(\frac{3}{2}\) in 4D.
- The adjoint spinor \(\bar{\psi}\) also has mass dimension \(\frac{3}{2}\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension 2, as it is derived from the gauge field \(A_\mu\) (dimension 1) via derivatives (dimension 1 each).
- The object \(\sigma_{\mu\nu}\), being a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, is dimensionless.

The total mass dimension of the term is:

\[
[\kappa] + \left[\bar{\psi}\right] + \left[\sigma_{\mu\nu}\right] + \left[\psi\right] + \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]

Since the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4, we solve:

\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\).

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. This ensures that the interaction terms are of low dimension, allowing for a finite number of counterterms. In this case, \([\kappa] = -1\), which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension (dimension 5, as the operator \(\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension 5). Since the interaction involves a higher-dimensional operator, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable. The correct option is:

**C) The mass dimension \([κ]_M = -1\). The theory is not renormalizable.**
