Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be a bit tricky. But let's try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? Oh, but when it dissociates, the ions are H2PO4^- (which is dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate). So the question is asking about PO4^3- concentration.

Hmm, but I remember that in buffer solutions, the species present depend on the pH. Since we're mixing a weak acid and its conjugate base, this is a buffer solution. The buffer here is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, because KH2PO4 is K+ plus H2PO4^- (so the salt of the acid), and Na2HPO4 is Na+ plus HPO4^2- (the conjugate base of H2PO4^-). Wait, no, wait. Let me think: H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in steps.

The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
Second: H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
Third: HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So in solution, depending on pH, the species will be mostly H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the solution is a buffer between them. Because we're adding the salts of H2PO4^- (KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (Na2HPO4), the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, what's the pH of this solution? Because the buffer will determine which species are present. But since the problem is about orthophosphate (PO4^3-), which is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, but in this case, maybe the solution is such that HPO4^2- is the major species, and some PO4^3- may form, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can approach this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Because we have a buffer solution. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So let's calculate the moles of each component.

First, calculate moles of KH2PO4. Molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007344 mol.

Then moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but wait: Na2HPO4·2H2O is the formula. So that's the same as Na2HPO4 with two water molecules attached. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and 2 H2O. But for the purpose of calculating moles, the molar mass is given as 177.99 g/mol, so the moles are correct as above.

Wait, but when it dissolves, the moles of HPO4^2- would be equal to the moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O, because each mole of the salt gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So now, in solution, the concentration of H2PO4^- is from KH2PO4, which is 0.007344 mol in 0.2 L. So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.

Similarly, [HPO4^2-] is 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) = about 7.2079 (since log(6.2)=0.7924, so log(6.2e-8)= -7.2076, so pKa2 is 7.2076).

So pH = 7.2076 + log(0.028065 / 0.03672) → Let's compute the ratio: 0.028065 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is about -0.115. So pH ≈ 7.2076 -0.115 = 7.0926.

Wait, but wait. Now, the question is the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. Which comes from HPO4^2- dissociating further: HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for that is Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So the concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the expression for Ka3.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

But we need to find [H+] in the solution, which we can get from the pH we calculated earlier.

pH is 7.0926 → [H+] = 10^(-7.0926) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

So plugging into the equation:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.028065 M) / (8.21e-8 M)

Let me compute that step by step.

First multiply 1.8e-12 by 0.028065:

1.8e-12 * 0.028065 ≈ 5.0517e-14.

Then divide by 8.21e-8:

5.0517e-14 / 8.21e-8 ≈ 6.15e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, option B 5.48e-7, etc.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check each step.

Wait, let me recalculate the pH part.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.03672 M, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M. So ratio is 0.028065 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.764.

Log(0.764) is approximately log(0.764) = log(7.64e-1) → log(7.64) is about 0.884, so 0.884 -1 = -0.116. So pH ≈ 7.2076 -0.116 =7.0916, which matches earlier.

Then [H+] is 10^(-7.0916) → 10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0916) is about 0.88 (since 10^0.09 ≈ 1.23, but wait, wait. 10^(-0.09) is 1/(10^0.09) → 10^0.09 is about 1.23, so 1/1.23≈0.813 → So 1e-7 * 0.813 → 8.13e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier I said 8.21e-8. Let me check that calculation again.

7.0916 is 7 + 0.0916. So 10^(-7.0916) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0916).

What is 10^(-0.0916)? Let's compute that accurately.

We can use the formula log(8) ≈ 0.9031, so 8 is 10^0.9031 → 10^0.9031 = 8. So 10^(-0.0916) is the reciprocal of 10^0.0916.

Wait, but 0.0916 is close to 0.09. So 10^0.09 = approximately 1.23 (since 10^0.1 is about 1.258, so 0.09 is about 1.23). So 10^(-0.09) is 1/1.23 ≈0.813.

Wait, but 0.0916 is a bit higher than 0.09. Let's compute it more accurately.

We can use the Taylor series for 10^x around x=0. Let's approximate 10^0.0916.

Alternatively, using natural logarithm:

ln(10^0.0916) = 0.0916 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0916 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.2108.

So e^0.2108 ≈ 1 + 0.2108 + (0.2108^2)/2 + (0.2108^3)/6 ≈ 1 + 0.2108 + (0.0444)/2 + (0.00936)/6 → 1 +0.2108 =1.2108; 0.0444/2=0.0222 → 1.233; 0.00936/6 ≈0.00156 → 1.23456. So e^0.2108≈1.2346. So 10^0.0916 ≈1.2346 → 10^(-0.0916)≈1/1.2346≈0.810.

So [H+] ≈1e-7 * 0.810 → 8.1e-8 M.

So going back to [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12) * (0.028065) / (8.1e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 = (1.8 * 0.028065) e-12 → 1.8 *0.028065 ≈0.050517 → 5.0517e-14.

Denominator: 8.1e-8 → 8.1e-8.

So 5.0517e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0517 /8.1) * 1e-6 → 5.0517/8.1 ≈0.6236 → 0.6236e-6 → 6.236e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches this. So the answer is A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the moles.

Wait, moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007344 mol. Yes.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol = approx 0.005613 mol. Correct.

Concentrations: 0.007344 /0.2=0.03672 M; 0.005613/0.2=0.028065 M. Correct.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → log(6.2)=0.7924 → 6.2e-8 → pKa2=7.2076.

Ratio: 0.028065 /0.03672 ≈0.764. Log(0.764)= -0.115 → pH=7.2076-0.115=7.0926.

[H+]=10^-7.0926 → let me compute more accurately.

7.0926: break into 7 +0.0926.

10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0926) is 1/(10^0.0926).

Compute 10^0.0926:

Using natural logarithm: ln(10^0.0926)=0.0926 * ln(10)=0.0926 *2.3026≈0.2133. e^0.2133≈ 1.238.

So 10^(-0.0926)=1/1.238≈0.807.

So [H+]=1e-7 * 0.807=8.07e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / (8.07e-8)

Numbers:

1.8e-12 *0.028065=0.050517e-12=5.0517e-14.

Divide by 8.07e-8: 5.0517e-14 /8.07e-8 = (5.0517/8.07)*1e-6 → 5.0517/8.07≈0.6264 → 0.6264e-6=6.264e-7 M.

Which is about 6.26e-7, so option A is 6.24e-7. Close enough, considering rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise calculations would get to 6.24e-7.

So I think the correct answer is A.

To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The relevant dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are Ka₁ = 7.5×10⁻³, Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸, and Ka₃ = 1.8×10⁻¹².

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each compound
- Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
  \[
  \text{Molar mass of KH₂PO₄} = 136.09 \, \text{g/mol}, \quad \text{moles} = \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007344 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
  \[
  \text{Molar mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O} = 177.99 \, \text{g/mol}, \quad \text{moles} = \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in solution
- Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄):  
  \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007344}{0.2} \approx 0.03672 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O):  
  \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005613}{0.2} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with Ka₂ = 6.2×10⁻⁸. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right).
\]
- pKa₂ = \(-\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076\).  
- Ratio of concentrations:  
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.028065}{0.03672} \approx 0.764.
  \]
- Logarithm of the ratio:  
  \[
  \log(0.764) \approx -0.115.
  \]
- pH:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 7.2076 - 0.115 \approx 7.0926.
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using Ka₃
The concentration of PO₄³⁻ is determined by the dissociation of HPO₄²⁻:  
\[
\text{Ka₃} = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]
Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka₃} \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]
- [H⁺] is calculated from pH:  
  \[
  [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0926} \approx 8.07 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}.
  \]
- Substituting values:  
  \[
  [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065)}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}}.
  \]
- Numerator:  
  \[
  (1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028065) \approx 5.0517 \times 10^{-14}.
  \]
- Denominator:  
  \[
  8.07 \times 10^{-8}.
  \]
- Final calculation:  
  \[
  [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0517 \times 10^{-14}}{8.07 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.26 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
  \]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions is approximately **6.24 × 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to option **A**.
