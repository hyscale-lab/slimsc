Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

So, the question is about a small peptidic compound that's chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and together integrate to 1H. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum as expected. Hmm.

Wait, so in the NMR, there's a duplication of peaks for the same proton. But they integrate to 1H together, meaning each is about half. So maybe each is a doublet or something, but why?

The options are about possible structures or impurities. Let's go through them.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, that would probably have a different mass. Since the LC-MS shows same mass, that's probably not it because the precursor would have lower mass. So A might not be the right answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same molecular weight and would have the same mass spectrum. In NMR, enantiomers would typically show the same peaks because they're symmetrical. But wait, if the molecule has some symmetry, maybe the alpha-proton environment isn't affected. Or perhaps if it's a diastereomer, but that's another option. Hmm, but I thought enantiomers don't split signals because each proton's environment is the same. Unless the splitting is from something else.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too sure about this. Double coupling could cause peaks to split into more lines, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe this isn't the case. Or perhaps it's a different kind of coupling?

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would show different peaks. If you have a mixture, like two diastereomers, some protons that are equivalent in one structure might not be in the other. But wait, the question says the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So maybe each diastereomer has that proton in a slightly different environment. For example, if one is cis and the other trans, the chemical shifts might be similar but split. But then why would their integrals add up to 1H? Oh, because each contributes equally. So in the NMR, each isomer has one proton, but when mixed, each contributes a peak. So, as a 50:50 mix, each would integrate as 0.5H each, adding to 1H. That makes sense.

Wait, but how does this relate to the LC-MS? Since the molecules are diastereomers, their retention times would be different. So in the LC-MS, you'd get two peaks with the same mass (since same molecular weight) but different retention times. And same mass spec because mass is same. That matches the question.

But what about the NMR? So, if the molecule is a diastereomeric mixture, the alpha-proton in each diastereomer would have a slightly different environment. So in the NMR, each would show a peak, perhaps as a doublet if coupled, but the question says coupling isn't the issue. So the two peaks are from each isomer, but why same shift? Oh, perhaps the shifts are similar because the environment is almost the same, just slightly different. So the peaks are close, but split.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two peaks have similar shifts and same integrals. So each is ~0.5H. So each isomer contributes a peak, but together they're one proton. So the molecule is a diastereomer mixture. So that would fit option D.

Option B, enantiomers: For enantiomers, the NMR would look the same because they're mirror images. So each peak would be same, and not split. Unless in a racemic mixture, but then the NMR wouldn't split peaks. So probably not B.

So putting it together, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because there are two diastereomers present. The LC-MS shows two peaks because they are separated, same mass, same retention time? Wait, no. Wait, no, same mass, but different retention times. So two peaks is because they are separated, but same mass.

So the most likely answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (adding up to 1H). The LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both consistent with the expected molecule. The coupling pattern in the NMR rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor):** A precursor would have a different mass, and the LC-MS would show a distinct mass spectrum. Since the LC-MS shows the same mass spectrum as the expected molecule, this option is unlikely.

- **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers):** Enantiomers are mirror images and typically produce identical NMR spectra because the chemical environment of each proton is the same. Additionally, enantiomers would not cause a split in the NMR peaks for the same proton. Thus, this option does not explain the observations.

- **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation):** While "double coupling" could theoretically cause splitting, the question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the explanation. Therefore, this option is not consistent with the data.

- **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, including NMR chemical shifts. If the compound is a mixture of two diastereoisomers, each isomer would contribute a peak for the alpha-proton, with slightly different chemical shifts due to the differing environments. The equal integrals (1H total) suggest a 50:50 mixture. The LC-MS showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum is consistent with two diastereoisomers, as they have the same molecular weight but different retention times. This explanation aligns well with the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
