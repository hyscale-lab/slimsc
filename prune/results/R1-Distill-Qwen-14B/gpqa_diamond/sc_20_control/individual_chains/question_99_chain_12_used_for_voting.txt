Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and think through the solution step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be some sort of substituted carboxylic acids. Let me break down the given data.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching. So, this compound likely has an -OH group, probably from a carboxylic acid since the broad peak suggests hydrogen bonding, which is common in carboxylic acids. The other strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ probably corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). So, a carboxylic acid makes sense because they have both an -OH and a carbonyl group.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data: several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So this molecule doesn't have any double bonds, or if it does, the protons on the double bond aren't present. Wait, but none of the options are showing a double bond. Looking at the options, I think they all are single bonds. Wait, no, no double bonds in any of the structures? Let me check.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. The structure would be something like CH2CH2 groups attached to a central carbon, then a CH2COOH. No double bonds here.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. Similar structure but the COOH is at the end, and the central carbons are each attached to a CH2CH3 and a H. No double bonds.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. Here, the central carbons each have a CH3 and a H. So, no double bonds.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. Same as D, so no double bonds. So, no vinyl protons in any of them. So that aligns with the NMR data.

Now, looking at the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmmm. That's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting in NMR. Each split arises from coupling with neighboring protons. So, the number of neighboring protons determines the splitting.

Let's consider each option's structure and their expected NMR signals.

First, all options have a COOH group, so the -OH proton is probably exchanged and might not show up as a peak, or it could be a broad peak that's not mentioned. But the question says none of the signals are vinyl, so no problem there.

Looking at each structure:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the molecule is:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH? Wait, wait, no. The formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the central part is two CH groups each attached to C2H5 and H, and connected to a CH2COOH. So the structure is more like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, looking at each group:

The CH3 group is probably on the first carbon. The next two CH groups each have a C2H5 group and a H. Then the CH2 connects to COOH.

In the NMR, the CH3 would be a singlet because it's attached to a carbon without any neighboring Hs (if it's a CH3 attached to a CH group, but wait, the CH3 is attached to a CH, which has H. Wait, no: the CH is attached to a C2H5 and a H. So the CH3 in option A is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)... So the CH3 is attached to the CH, which has two other substituents (a C2H5 and a H). So the CH3 is attached to a CH group that has one H. So the CH3 would be split by the adjacent H on the CH group.

Wait, so the CH3 group is on a CH that has one H. So, the CH3 would have a neighboring H (on the adjacent carbon). How many Hs are on that adjacent carbon? Each of the CH groups (in options A and B) is attached to one H and another substituent (C2H5). So, each CH has only one H. So, the CH3 group would see one neighboring H, leading to a doublet. But the NMR has more complex multiplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group in the structure is where the complexity comes from. Let's look for split patterns.

The CH groups (like in option A) each have H attached. So, each CH has one H. The CH2 group (like in the CH2COOH part) has two Hs. So, the CH2 group would split into a quartet if adjacent to a CH group with one H. Because the CH2 is next to a CH that has one H, each H on the CH2 would see one neighboring H, leading to a triplet. But wait, maybe more.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about each option's structure and the possible splitting.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So, the central two CH groups each have a C2H5 and a H. The groups attached to the CH2 would be the CH3CH2 and the two CH groups. Let's imagine the NMR for the CH2 group in CH3CH2-.

The CH2 group (from CH3CH2-) is next to a CH group. Each CH has one H. So, the CH2 would split into a triplet because each H on CH2 is adjacent to a CH with one H. But wait, each H on CH2 is next to a CH with one H, so splitting would be into a triplet (n+1, where n=1. So splitting into 2, but wait, the CH2 has two Hs, so each H is adjacent to the same CH group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex. If a proton is adjacent to a group with multiple Hs, each with their own splitting, the splitting can become a doublet of doublets, etc.

Wait, perhaps looking at the branching can give more clues. The splitting patterns described are a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests that each proton is coupled to multiple sets of neighboring protons, each with different coupling constants.

Let me think about the possible structures and which would lead to such splitting.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, each CH group is attached to two CH3 groups and a H. The CH2 is then attached to the COOH.

So, the central part is two CHs, each with a CH3 and a H, connected to a CH2.

So, the CH2 group is next to a CH group (with one H). The CH2 would split into a triplet because the neighboring CH has one H. Each H on CH2 would see the adjacent CH's H, leading to a splitting of n+1 = 2 → triplet. But the problem says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's more complex.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to two equivalent CH groups, each with one H. So, the CH2's Hs would couple with two sets of Hs, each from the adjacent CH groups. But wait, each CH is in a symmetric position. So perhaps the CH2's Hs are split by two neighboring Hs. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the CH groups (each with one H) are adjacent to other groups which cause further splitting.

Let me think about each option's possible structure and the expected NMR signals.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the CH groups each have a CH3 and a H. The CH2 is attached to the first CH group, and the COOH is at the end.

In this case, the CH2 (from CH3CH2-) is next to a CH group with one H. So, the CH2 would split into a triplet (n=1 → 2 peaks). But in the NMR, that's not what's observed. The observed splitting is more complex, so perhaps option D isn't the right one.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from adjacent CH groups. For example, if a proton is next to a CH that is itself next to other Hs, the splitting could multiply.

Wait, let's think about the substituents on the central carbons. In option A and B, the CH groups are attached to ethyl groups (C2H5), while in C and D, they're attached to methyl groups (CH3).

In option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each CH is attached to a CH3 and a H. So, the CH groups are each CH with two CH3 substituents and a H. The CH2 group is attached to the CH.

So, the CH2 would be next to a CH group. Each H on CH2 would split based on the adjacent H on the CH. So, the CH2 would be a triplet. But what about the CH groups themselves?

The CH groups are each attached to two CH3 groups. The H on each CH would be adjacent to the Hs on the neighboring CH. Wait, no. Each CH is only attached to one H. So, the H on CH would be next to the CH2's Hs and perhaps the H on the adjacent CH group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to draw the structure of option C:

The structure is: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, it's like:

CH3-C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each of the two CH groups (middle carbons) has one H and two CH3 groups attached.

So, looking at the H on the first CH group (CH3-C(H)(CH3)):

This H is next to the CH group on the adjacent carbon (C(H)(CH3)), which has one H. So, the H on the first CH would couple with that H, leading to a doublet.

But wait, each CH group is next to another CH group. So each H on a CH is adjacent to the H on the neighboring CH. So, the Hs on each CH would be split by the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet for each CH group. But since the structure is symmetrical, perhaps the two CH groups are equivalent, leading to a singlet. No, wait, because each CH is attached to two CH3 groups and a H, but they're in a chain, so symmetry might not make them equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH is attached to a CH2 group, but no, the structure is CH3-CH(...)-CH(...)-CH2-COOH.

So, the two CH groups are in a row. Each has a H and two CH3s.

So, the H on the first CH (let's say position 2) is adjacent to the H on position 3. So, the H at position 2 would couple with the H at position 3, leading to a doublet. Similarly, the H at position 3 would couple with the H at position 2, but also with any other Hs nearby. But in this structure, position 2's H is only adjacent to position 3's H.

So, each CH group's H would be a doublet. But wait, the question mentions a signal that is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is where the splitting comes from. The CH2 is attached to the COOH. Let's imagine the CH2 is next to a CH with one H. So, each H on the CH2 would couple with that H, leading to a triplet. But then, if the CH2 is also next to another group, like maybe a branching point with more Hs, that could add more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH groups are each next to other CH groups. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the splitting in the NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests that each proton is coupled with three different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different coupling constant.

So, which structure would lead to a proton being split by three different groups?

Looking at option A: the structure is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the central part is two CH groups each attached to C2H5 and H, connected to a CH2 group.

So, the CH2 is between the two CH groups. Each CH group has one H. So, the CH2's Hs are adjacent to two Hs (one on each adjacent CH group). But wait, each CH has only one H. So the CH2 is next to two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on the CH2 would be split by two Hs, each from adjacent CH groups.

Wait, but the CH2 is between two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (one on each side). So, each H on CH2 would couple with two Hs, each with a different coupling constant. So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets. But the observed splitting is more complex, like a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 group is also adjacent to another group, like the CH3 or the C2H5, which brings in more Hs. Wait, but the CH2 is only attached to the two CH groups on either side and the COOH.

Wait, maybe the CH3 groups (in options A and B) are attached to the CH groups. So, the CH3 groups in options A and B are attached to the CH, which has one H. So, the CH3's Hs are next to the H on the CH. So, each CH3 would split into a doublet because their Hs are adjacent to one H on the CH.

But in the NMR, the question says multiple peaks, none of which are vinyl. So, all the Hs are on single bonds.

Let me think about the splitting for the CH2 group.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The CH2 is between two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from the two CH groups). But each CH group has only one H, so the CH2's Hs would split into a triplet for each adjacent H. Wait, because each H on CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on either side, each from a different CH group. So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, perhaps, but the observed splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH group is attached to a C2H5 group, which has two Hs adjacent to the CH group. Wait, the C2H5 group is a CH2CH3, so the Hs on the CH2CH3 are not adjacent to the CH's H. Because the CH is attached to the ethyl group (C2H5), which is a substituent. So, the H on the CH is only adjacent to the H on the adjacent CH group. So, the CH2 group's Hs are adjacent to two Hs (one from each CH group), but each CH has one H.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group would have each H split by two Hs, leading to a triplet for each. But since there are two adjacent Hs, each coupling, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets? But that gets complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 group is next to a CH which is next to another CH, leading to more splits.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the possible structures and their symmetry.

Looking at the options, options A and B have ethyl groups attached to the CH groups, while C and D have methyl groups.

If the structure is symmetrical, the NMR splitting patterns might be less complex. For example, in option C, the CH groups are each attached to two CH3 groups. So, the structure is symmetrical, and the two CH groups are equivalent. So, their Hs would show as a singlet, but that's not what's observed. The NMR shows a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a complex splitting.

Hmm. Maybe the CH2 group is where the splitting comes from. Let me think about the CH2 in each option.

Option A: The CH2 is between two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from the two CH groups). So, each H on CH2 would have two neighboring Hs, each causing a split. So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but that's not matching the given data.

Option B: The CH2 is at the end, attached to the COOH. So, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the CH2 is part of the CH3CH2 group. The CH2 is attached to a CH group (with one H). So, the Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to one H on the CH. So, each H on CH2 would split into a doublet. But in the NMR, the splitting is more complex, so maybe this isn't the case.

Option C: The CH2 is attached to the COOH and between two CH groups. Each CH has one H. So, the CH2 is adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on CH2 would be split by two Hs, leading to a triplet for each. But the problem mentions a quartet in the splitting, which suggests more neighbors.

Option D: The CH2 is part of the CH3CH2 group attached to a CH group. So, similar to option B, the CH2 is attached to a CH with one H. So, each H on CH2 would be a doublet.

Wait, but the problem states that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group which is itself adjacent to another CH group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, maybe the CH2 is next to a CH group which is next to another CH group, leading to each H on CH2 being split by three different Hs. For example, H on CH2 is adjacent to H on CH, which is adjacent to H on another CH, leading to a triplet, which is then split again by another group, leading to a quartet.

Hmm, perhaps the structure has a branching that leads to multiple layers of splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from the arrangement of substituents. For example, if a proton is next to a CH that is itself next to another CH, each with different numbers of Hs, the splitting would be more complex.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (probably -OH from carboxylic acid) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl from the COOH group). So, all options are possible.

In the 1H NMR, none of the peaks are vinyl, which we've already established.

Looking at the NMR splitting: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

This suggests that each proton is coupled to multiple different sets of neighboring protons. So, perhaps the structure is such that each CH group is adjacent to multiple other CH groups, each with their own Hs.

Which option would lead to such a complex splitting pattern?

Looking at option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Structure: two CH groups (each with C2H5 and H), connected to CH2COOH.

The CH2 is between two CH groups.

So, the Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs (one from each CH group). So, each H on CH2 would couple with two Hs, each on adjacent CH groups. So, the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is a quintet? Or perhaps an AB system, leading to a doublet of doublets.

Alternatively, considering the coupling constants, the splitting might be more complex.

Wait, another approach: the CH2 group in option A would have two neighboring CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on CH2 is split by two Hs (from the two CH groups). So, the splitting would be a triplet for each, but since they couple with two different Hs, it would be a doublet of doublets. But the question mentions quartets, so perhaps this isn't the right structure.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

The CH2 is between two CH groups, each with one H and two CH3s.

So, each H on CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs (one from each CH group). So, the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is a septet. But the observed splitting is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm. Not matching.

Option B: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

The CH2 is part of the CH3CH2 group, attached to a CH group which has a C2H5 and a H. The other CH group is identical.

So, the CH2 (from CH3CH2-) is adjacent to a CH group with one H. So, each H on CH2 would split into a doublet. Then, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups would split based on their neighbors.

Wait, the Hs on the CH groups would be adjacent to the Hs on the CH2 and perhaps the Hs on the other CH group.

So, the H on each CH would be adjacent to the H on the CH2 (two Hs on CH2) and the H on the other CH group. So, the H on each CH would see two Hs (from CH2) and one H (from the other CH), leading to a triplet of triplets, perhaps.

But the NMR data mentions two different signals with complex splitting, not just one.

Another approach: perhaps the CH2 group is next to a CH which is next to another CH, each with one H. So, each H on CH2 is adjacent to one H on the first CH, which is adjacent to another H on the second CH. So, the CH2's Hs would split based on the first CH's H, which in turn is split by the second CH's H. This could lead to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH which is adjacent to another CH, each with Hs. So, the CH2's Hs would split into a quartet. Because each H on CH2 is adjacent to one H on the first CH, which is adjacent to another H on the second CH. So, the first split is into a doublet (from the first CH), and then each of those peaks splits again into a doublet from the second CH, leading to a quartet.

But the NMR data shows a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Wait, maybe the CH2 is adjacent to a CH which is itself adjacent to another CH, but the coupling constants are different, leading to multiple splittings.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two CH groups, each of which is attached to another CH group. So, each H on CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from two CH groups), each of which is adjacent to another H. This would lead to multiple layers of splitting.

This is getting quite complicated. Perhaps I should think about the structures and their expected NMR signals.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

In this structure, the CH groups are each attached to two CH3 groups and a H. The CH2 is attached to the COOH and between the two CH groups.

So, the CH2's Hs are adjacent to two Hs (one from each CH group). Each H on CH2 would couple with both Hs, leading to a triplet for each coupling. But since there are two different couplings, this would result in a doublet of doublets. But the observed splitting is a quartet, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, the CH groups themselves might have their Hs split by the neighboring CH2's Hs and other groups. For example, the H on each CH is adjacent to the CH2's Hs (two Hs) and maybe the H on the other CH group. So, each H on CH would be split into a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a quintet or more complex splitting.

But the data mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests three layers of splitting.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH group which is next to another CH group, each with one H. So, the CH2's Hs would couple with the first CH's H (doublet), which in turn couples with the second CH's H (another doublet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but the observed data has a quartet, which is a quartet from perhaps a different coupling.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the possible structures and which one would have a CH2 group next to two CH groups, each of which is next to another CH group. That way, the CH2's Hs would be split by three different groups, leading to a quartet in their splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that a CH2 group is adjacent to a CH which is adjacent to another CH, which is adjacent to another CH group. But I'm not sure any of the options present that.

Wait, looking at option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the CH2 is between two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 and a H. So, each H on CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (one from each CH group). So, each H on CH2 would see two Hs, leading to a triplet for each. But if the two CH groups are not equivalent, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps each CH group is attached to a different substituent, making them nonequivalent. So, the H on the first CH would be adjacent to the H on the second CH, leading to a doublet. And the CH2's Hs would be adjacent to both, leading to a triplet. But in this case, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, the problem says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's three layers. So, each H is split by three different groups. How?

Another thought: perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH which is adjacent to another CH, which is adjacent to a third CH. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH which is adjacent to another CH, which is part of an ethyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from the ethyl groups. The ethyl groups (C2H5) have their own Hs. But the question says none of the peaks are vinyl, which is correct because ethyl groups don't have double bonds. But the ethyl groups' Hs could contribute to the splitting.

Wait, let's think about the ethyl groups in option A and B. The CH groups are attached to C2H5 groups, which have two Hs on the CH2 part. So, the Hs on the ethyl groups might be adjacent to the Hs on the CH groups, causing further splitting.

But if the ethyl groups are attached to the CH groups, their Hs would be on a different carbon and might not be directly adjacent to the Hs on the CH groups. So, perhaps their coupling constants are small and may not significantly affect the splitting.

Another angle: think about the number of signals in the NMR. The question says "several peaks", but doesn't specify how many. So, perhaps the structure has multiple distinct environments of Hs.

Looking back, the question says one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, these are two distinct signals with complex splitting.

Which structure would have such signals?

Perhaps the CH2 group in option A is next to two CH groups, each with one H, and each CH is next to another CH. So, the CH2's Hs are split by two Hs, each from the two CH groups. Each H on CH2 would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet for each. But since the two CH groups are different (since they're attached to ethyl groups), the coupling constants may differ, leading to a doublet of triplets or similar.

Wait, the splitting pattern is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, three layers of splitting. How?

Perhaps each H on CH2 is adjacent to one H on a CH group, which is adjacent to another H on another CH group, which is adjacent to another H on another CH group. But that would require a longer chain than any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH which is adjacent to another CH, and the CH2 is also adjacent to another group with Hs.

Wait, maybe the CH2 is next to a CH which is next to another CH, and the CH2 is also adjacent to a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the splitting patterns and what structures cause them.

A doublet of triplets of quartets would arise if each proton is:

1. Split by one proton (doublet),
2. Then each of those peaks is split by a second set of two protons (triplet),
3. And each of those is split by a third set of three protons (quartet).

But wait, the quartet comes from three neighboring Hs (n=3 → quartet, n+1=4). So, each H is adjacent to three Hs.

But in our structures, the maximum number of adjacent Hs would be two (from the CH groups), unless there's a branching point.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group which is itself adjacent to another CH group and also to another CH2 group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two CH groups, each adjacent to another CH group. So, the Hs on the CH2 would see two Hs (from the adjacent CH groups), and each of those Hs would see another H on another CH group, leading to a quartet.

Wait, maybe the CH2's Hs are split by two Hs (doublet of doublets), but each of those is further split by another set of Hs, leading to a quartet. So, the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2's Hs are split by three different groups, each with a different number of Hs.

This is getting too vague. Let me think about the options again. Which one would have a CH2 group that is adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H, and those CH groups are themselves adjacent to another CH group with one H.

Wait, perhaps option A has the CH2 between two CH groups, each with one H. Each of those CH groups is attached to an ethyl group, which has two Hs on the CH2 part of the ethyl. So, the Hs on the CH groups would be adjacent to the Hs on the ethyl groups, leading to additional splitting.

But the ethyl groups' Hs are on a different carbon, so their coupling with the CH group's H might be small and possibly not observed as a splitting. Alternatively, it could be that the CH groups' Hs are adjacent to the CH2's Hs and the ethyl groups' Hs, leading to more splitting.

But I'm not confident about this. Let me think about another angle: the number of neighboring Hs each proton has.

The doublet of triplets of quartets implies that a proton is coupled with three different sets of Hs. So, perhaps each proton is adjacent to three different groups with Hs.

Wait, another way: each proton is next to one H (doublet), which is next to two Hs (triplet), which is next to three Hs (quartet). So, each layer of splitting adds another factor.

Hmm. Maybe the CH2 group is next to a CH group which is next to another CH group which is next to another CH group. But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH group which is attached to an ethyl group, whose CH2 has two Hs. So, the Hs on the CH2 would couple with the H on the CH, and the Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 would also couple, leading to a more complex splitting.

But again, this is speculative.

Given that I'm a bit stuck, perhaps it's better to look for other clues. Let me think about the integration of the signals, but the question doesn't provide integration data. So, perhaps I should think about the splitting patterns again.

The problem mentions two specific splitting patterns: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from vicinal coupling and coupling through space, but that's less common.

Another thought: perhaps the CH2 group is next to a CH which is next to another CH, which is next to another CH group, but I don't think any of the options have such a structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a branching point where each CH group is attached to two other CH groups, leading to multiple couplings.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So, the two central CH groups are each attached to a C2H5 and a H. The CH2 is part of the CH3CH2 group attached to the first CH.

So, the CH2 (from CH3CH2-) is adjacent to a CH group with one H. The Hs on the CH2 would couple with the H on the adjacent CH group, leading to a doublet. But perhaps the H on the CH group is also adjacent to another CH group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, the H on the CH group (C(H)(C2H5)) is adjacent to the H on the other CH group (C(H)(C2H5)). So, the H on each CH group is adjacent to one H on the other CH group.

Thus, the H on each CH would be a doublet. Additionally, the CH2's Hs are adjacent to the H on the first CH, leading to a doublet for each.

But how does that lead to the observed splitting patterns?

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group's Hs are split by the H on the first CH (doublet), and the Hs on the first CH are split by the Hs on the second CH (doublet), leading to a quartet for the CH2.

Wait, perhaps the CH2's Hs are split by the H on the adjacent CH (doublet), and the Hs on that CH are split by the Hs on the other CH (doublet), leading to a quartet for the CH2's Hs. So, the CH2 would show as a quartet.

But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex. So, perhaps this isn't the case.

Hmm. I'm really not sure. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the information.

The FTIR suggests a carboxylic acid. The NMR doesn't show any vinyl Hs, which aligns with all options.

The complex splitting suggests that the Hs are coupled with multiple neighboring Hs. Option A and B have ethyl groups, which might contribute additional Hs for coupling, but option C and D have methyl groups, which don't add more Hs.

Wait, in option A, each CH group is attached to an ethyl group (C2H5). The ethyl group has a CH2CH3, meaning the Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 are adjacent to the CH group's H. So, the Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the CH group, leading to a coupling.

So, the Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 would split into a doublet because they're next to one H. Similarly, the H on the CH group would see the Hs on the ethyl's CH2, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not sure how this affects the overall splitting patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups add more Hs into the coupling, leading to more complex splitting.

Given that, perhaps option A would have more complex splitting because the CH2 groups in the ethyl substituents add more Hs into the mix.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option A because the CH2 group is adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H, leading to more splitting.

Wait, another thought: in option A, the CH2 is between two CH groups, each with one H. Each H on the CH2 would be split by both Hs, leading to a triplet for each. But the two CH groups are attached to ethyl groups, which themselves have CH2 groups. So, the Hs on the CH2 might also couple with the Hs on the ethyl groups' CH2, leading to more splitting.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting observed is due to the CH2 being next to a CH which is next to another CH, each with one H, leading to a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group's Hs are split by the first CH's H into a doublet, and then each of those peaks is split by the second CH's H into a quartet, leading to a doublet of quartets. But the observed splitting is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more layers.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible correct answer based on the structures.

The correct answer is likely option A or C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR signals for each structure.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

The two CH groups are each attached to two CH3 groups. So, the Hs on each CH are adjacent to the Hs on the other CH group. So, each CH's H would be a doublet. The CH2 group is between the two CH groups, so each H on CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from the two CH groups), leading to a triplet. But the problem mentions a quartet in the splitting, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group's Hs are adjacent to two Hs (from the two CH groups), leading to a triplet, and each of those is split by another H, leading to a quartet.

Wait, if the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from two CH groups), leading to a triplet, and those are further split by another set of Hs, perhaps from the methyl groups, leading to a quartet. But methyl groups are attached to the CH groups, so their Hs are not adjacent to the CH2's Hs.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider the options again.

Looking at the options, option A has ethyl groups, which are more complex and might lead to more splitting. So, perhaps option A is the correct answer.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option C, which has a symmetric structure that might lead to more complex splitting.

Wait, the problem states that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests three layers of splitting. So, perhaps the CH2 group in option A is next to a CH which is next to another CH, which is next to another group with Hs, leading to three layers.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and ¹H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, corresponding to a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens, and two specific splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. These splitting patterns suggest complex coupling between protons, likely due to multiple neighboring groups with hydrogens.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**  
   - The structure features two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group (C₂H₅) and a hydrogen, with a CH₂ group connected to the COOH group.  
   - The CH₂ group is between two CH groups, each with one hydrogen. The ethyl groups add additional hydrogens, contributing to the complexity of the splitting patterns.  
   - The CH₂ protons are adjacent to two CH groups, each with one hydrogen, leading to a triplet splitting. Further splitting from the ethyl groups' hydrogens could explain the observed doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets.

2. **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**  
   - Similar to Option A, this structure has two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group and a hydrogen, but the CH₂ group is part of the CH₃CH₂ group at the end.  
   - The CH₂ protons are adjacent to one CH group with one hydrogen, leading to a simpler splitting pattern (e.g., a doublet or triplet). This does not align with the observed complex splitting patterns.

3. **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**  
   - This structure features two CH groups, each attached to two methyl groups and a hydrogen, with a CH₂ group connected to the COOH group.  
   - The CH₂ protons are adjacent to two CH groups, each with one hydrogen, leading to a triplet splitting. However, the symmetry of the methyl groups reduces the complexity of the splitting patterns, making it less likely to match the observed data.

4. **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**  
   - This structure has two CH groups, each attached to a methyl group and a hydrogen, with a CH₂ group connected to the COOH group.  
   - The CH₂ protons are adjacent to one CH group with one hydrogen, leading to a simpler splitting pattern. This does not align with the observed complex splitting patterns.

### Conclusion:
The observed splitting patterns in the ¹H NMR spectrum, particularly the doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets, suggest a more complex coupling environment. Option A, with its ethyl groups and CH₂ group between two CH groups, provides the structural complexity needed to produce these splitting patterns. Therefore, the most likely compound is **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and think through the solution step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be some sort of substituted carboxylic acids. Let me break down the given data.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching. So, this compound likely has an -OH group, probably from a carboxylic acid since the broad peak suggests hydrogen bonding, which is common in carboxylic acids. The other strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ probably corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). So, a carboxylic acid makes sense because they have both an -OH and a carbonyl group.

Moving on to the 1H NMR data: several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So this molecule doesn't have any double bonds, or if it does, the protons on the double bond aren't present. Wait, but none of the options are showing a double bond. Looking at the options, I think they all are single bonds. Wait, no, no double bonds in any of the structures? Let me check.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. The structure would be something like CH2CH2 groups attached to a central carbon, then a CH2COOH. No double bonds here.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. Similar structure but the COOH is at the end, and the central carbons are each attached to a CH2CH3 and a H. No double bonds.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. Here, the central carbons each have a CH3 and a H. So, no double bonds.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. Same as D, so no double bonds. So, no vinyl protons in any of them. So that aligns with the NMR data.

Now, looking at the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmmm. That's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting in NMR. Each split arises from coupling with neighboring protons. So, the number of neighboring protons determines the splitting.

Let's consider each option's structure and their expected NMR signals.

First, all options have a COOH group, so the -OH proton is probably exchanged and might not show up as a peak, or it could be a broad peak that's not mentioned. But the question says none of the signals are vinyl, so no problem there.

Looking at each structure:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the molecule is:

CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH? Wait, wait, no. The formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the central part is two CH groups each attached to C2H5 and H, and connected to a CH2COOH. So the structure is more like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, looking at each group:

The CH3 group is probably on the first carbon. The next two CH groups each have a C2H5 group and a H. Then the CH2 connects to COOH.

In the NMR, the CH3 would be a singlet because it's attached to a carbon without any neighboring Hs (if it's a CH3 attached to a CH group, but wait, the CH3 is attached to a CH, which has H. Wait, no: the CH is attached to a C2H5 and a H. So the CH3 in option A is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)... So the CH3 is attached to the CH, which has two other substituents (a C2H5 and a H). So the CH3 is attached to a CH group that has one H. So the CH3 would be split by the adjacent H on the CH group.

Wait, so the CH3 group is on a CH that has one H. So, the CH3 would have a neighboring H (on the adjacent carbon). How many Hs are on that adjacent carbon? Each of the CH groups (in options A and B) is attached to one H and another substituent (C2H5). So, each CH has only one H. So, the CH3 group would see one neighboring H, leading to a doublet. But the NMR has more complex multiplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group in the structure is where the complexity comes from. Let's look for split patterns.

The CH groups (like in option A) each have H attached. So, each CH has one H. The CH2 group (like in the CH2COOH part) has two Hs. So, the CH2 group would split into a quartet if adjacent to a CH group with one H. Because the CH2 is next to a CH that has one H, each H on the CH2 would see one neighboring H, leading to a triplet. But wait, maybe more.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about each option's structure and the possible splitting.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So, the central two CH groups each have a C2H5 and a H. The groups attached to the CH2 would be the CH3CH2 and the two CH groups. Let's imagine the NMR for the CH2 group in CH3CH2-.

The CH2 group (from CH3CH2-) is next to a CH group. Each CH has one H. So, the CH2 would split into a triplet because each H on CH2 is adjacent to a CH with one H. But wait, each H on CH2 is next to a CH with one H, so splitting would be into a triplet (n+1, where n=1. So splitting into 2, but wait, the CH2 has two Hs, so each H is adjacent to the same CH group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is more complex. If a proton is adjacent to a group with multiple Hs, each with their own splitting, the splitting can become a doublet of doublets, etc.

Wait, perhaps looking at the branching can give more clues. The splitting patterns described are a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests that each proton is coupled to multiple sets of neighboring protons, each with different coupling constants.

Let me think about the possible structures and which would lead to such splitting.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, each CH group is attached to two CH3 groups and a H. The CH2 is then attached to the COOH.

So, the central part is two CHs, each with a CH3 and a H, connected to a CH2.

So, the CH2 group is next to a CH group (with one H). The CH2 would split into a triplet because the neighboring CH has one H. Each H on CH2 would see the adjacent CH's H, leading to a splitting of n+1 = 2 → triplet. But the problem says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's more complex.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to two equivalent CH groups, each with one H. So, the CH2's Hs would couple with two sets of Hs, each from the adjacent CH groups. But wait, each CH is in a symmetric position. So perhaps the CH2's Hs are split by two neighboring Hs. Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the CH groups (each with one H) are adjacent to other groups which cause further splitting.

Let me think about each option's possible structure and the expected NMR signals.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So, the CH groups each have a CH3 and a H. The CH2 is attached to the first CH group, and the COOH is at the end.

In this case, the CH2 (from CH3CH2-) is next to a CH group with one H. So, the CH2 would split into a triplet (n=1 → 2 peaks). But in the NMR, that's not what's observed. The observed splitting is more complex, so perhaps option D isn't the right one.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from adjacent CH groups. For example, if a proton is next to a CH that is itself next to other Hs, the splitting could multiply.

Wait, let's think about the substituents on the central carbons. In option A and B, the CH groups are attached to ethyl groups (C2H5), while in C and D, they're attached to methyl groups (CH3).

In option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each CH is attached to a CH3 and a H. So, the CH groups are each CH with two CH3 substituents and a H. The CH2 group is attached to the CH.

So, the CH2 would be next to a CH group. Each H on CH2 would split based on the adjacent H on the CH. So, the CH2 would be a triplet. But what about the CH groups themselves?

The CH groups are each attached to two CH3 groups. The H on each CH would be adjacent to the Hs on the neighboring CH. Wait, no. Each CH is only attached to one H. So, the H on CH would be next to the CH2's Hs and perhaps the H on the adjacent CH group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to draw the structure of option C:

The structure is: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

So, it's like:

CH3-C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Each of the two CH groups (middle carbons) has one H and two CH3 groups attached.

So, looking at the H on the first CH group (CH3-C(H)(CH3)):

This H is next to the CH group on the adjacent carbon (C(H)(CH3)), which has one H. So, the H on the first CH would couple with that H, leading to a doublet.

But wait, each CH group is next to another CH group. So each H on a CH is adjacent to the H on the neighboring CH. So, the Hs on each CH would be split by the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet for each CH group. But since the structure is symmetrical, perhaps the two CH groups are equivalent, leading to a singlet. No, wait, because each CH is attached to two CH3 groups and a H, but they're in a chain, so symmetry might not make them equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH is attached to a CH2 group, but no, the structure is CH3-CH(...)-CH(...)-CH2-COOH.

So, the two CH groups are in a row. Each has a H and two CH3s.

So, the H on the first CH (let's say position 2) is adjacent to the H on position 3. So, the H at position 2 would couple with the H at position 3, leading to a doublet. Similarly, the H at position 3 would couple with the H at position 2, but also with any other Hs nearby. But in this structure, position 2's H is only adjacent to position 3's H.

So, each CH group's H would be a doublet. But wait, the question mentions a signal that is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is where the splitting comes from. The CH2 is attached to the COOH. Let's imagine the CH2 is next to a CH with one H. So, each H on the CH2 would couple with that H, leading to a triplet. But then, if the CH2 is also next to another group, like maybe a branching point with more Hs, that could add more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH groups are each next to other CH groups. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the splitting in the NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets. That suggests that each proton is coupled with three different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different coupling constant.

So, which structure would lead to a proton being split by three different groups?

Looking at option A: the structure is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So, the central part is two CH groups each attached to C2H5 and H, connected to a CH2 group.

So, the CH2 is between the two CH groups. Each CH group has one H. So, the CH2's Hs are adjacent to two Hs (one on each adjacent CH group). But wait, each CH has only one H. So the CH2 is next to two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on the CH2 would be split by two Hs, each from adjacent CH groups.

Wait, but the CH2 is between two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (one on each side). So, each H on CH2 would couple with two Hs, each with a different coupling constant. So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets. But the observed splitting is more complex, like a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 group is also adjacent to another group, like the CH3 or the C2H5, which brings in more Hs. Wait, but the CH2 is only attached to the two CH groups on either side and the COOH.

Wait, maybe the CH3 groups (in options A and B) are attached to the CH groups. So, the CH3 groups in options A and B are attached to the CH, which has one H. So, the CH3's Hs are next to the H on the CH. So, each CH3 would split into a doublet because their Hs are adjacent to one H on the CH.

But in the NMR, the question says multiple peaks, none of which are vinyl. So, all the Hs are on single bonds.

Let me think about the splitting for the CH2 group.

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

The CH2 is between two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from the two CH groups). But each CH group has only one H, so the CH2's Hs would split into a triplet for each adjacent H. Wait, because each H on CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on either side, each from a different CH group. So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, perhaps, but the observed splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH group is attached to a C2H5 group, which has two Hs adjacent to the CH group. Wait, the C2H5 group is a CH2CH3, so the Hs on the CH2CH3 are not adjacent to the CH's H. Because the CH is attached to the ethyl group (C2H5), which is a substituent. So, the H on the CH is only adjacent to the H on the adjacent CH group. So, the CH2 group's Hs are adjacent to two Hs (one from each CH group), but each CH has one H.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group would have each H split by two Hs, leading to a triplet for each. But since there are two adjacent Hs, each coupling, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets? But that gets complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the CH2 group is next to a CH which is next to another CH, leading to more splits.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the possible structures and their symmetry.

Looking at the options, options A and B have ethyl groups attached to the CH groups, while C and D have methyl groups.

If the structure is symmetrical, the NMR splitting patterns might be less complex. For example, in option C, the CH groups are each attached to two CH3 groups. So, the structure is symmetrical, and the two CH groups are equivalent. So, their Hs would show as a singlet, but that's not what's observed. The NMR shows a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is a complex splitting.

Hmm. Maybe the CH2 group is where the splitting comes from. Let me think about the CH2 in each option.

Option A: The CH2 is between two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from the two CH groups). So, each H on CH2 would have two neighboring Hs, each causing a split. So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but that's not matching the given data.

Option B: The CH2 is at the end, attached to the COOH. So, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the CH2 is part of the CH3CH2 group. The CH2 is attached to a CH group (with one H). So, the Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to one H on the CH. So, each H on CH2 would split into a doublet. But in the NMR, the splitting is more complex, so maybe this isn't the case.

Option C: The CH2 is attached to the COOH and between two CH groups. Each CH has one H. So, the CH2 is adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on CH2 would be split by two Hs, leading to a triplet for each. But the problem mentions a quartet in the splitting, which suggests more neighbors.

Option D: The CH2 is part of the CH3CH2 group attached to a CH group. So, similar to option B, the CH2 is attached to a CH with one H. So, each H on CH2 would be a doublet.

Wait, but the problem states that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group which is itself adjacent to another CH group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, maybe the CH2 is next to a CH group which is next to another CH group, leading to each H on CH2 being split by three different Hs. For example, H on CH2 is adjacent to H on CH, which is adjacent to H on another CH, leading to a triplet, which is then split again by another group, leading to a quartet.

Hmm, perhaps the structure has a branching that leads to multiple layers of splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from the arrangement of substituents. For example, if a proton is next to a CH that is itself next to another CH, each with different numbers of Hs, the splitting would be more complex.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ (probably -OH from carboxylic acid) and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl from the COOH group). So, all options are possible.

In the 1H NMR, none of the peaks are vinyl, which we've already established.

Looking at the NMR splitting: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

This suggests that each proton is coupled to multiple different sets of neighboring protons. So, perhaps the structure is such that each CH group is adjacent to multiple other CH groups, each with their own Hs.

Which option would lead to such a complex splitting pattern?

Looking at option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Structure: two CH groups (each with C2H5 and H), connected to CH2COOH.

The CH2 is between two CH groups.

So, the Hs on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs (one from each CH group). So, each H on CH2 would couple with two Hs, each on adjacent CH groups. So, the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is a quintet? Or perhaps an AB system, leading to a doublet of doublets.

Alternatively, considering the coupling constants, the splitting might be more complex.

Wait, another approach: the CH2 group in option A would have two neighboring CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on CH2 is split by two Hs (from the two CH groups). So, the splitting would be a triplet for each, but since they couple with two different Hs, it would be a doublet of doublets. But the question mentions quartets, so perhaps this isn't the right structure.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

The CH2 is between two CH groups, each with one H and two CH3s.

So, each H on CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs (one from each CH group). So, the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets, which is a septet. But the observed splitting is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm. Not matching.

Option B: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

The CH2 is part of the CH3CH2 group, attached to a CH group which has a C2H5 and a H. The other CH group is identical.

So, the CH2 (from CH3CH2-) is adjacent to a CH group with one H. So, each H on CH2 would split into a doublet. Then, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups would split based on their neighbors.

Wait, the Hs on the CH groups would be adjacent to the Hs on the CH2 and perhaps the Hs on the other CH group.

So, the H on each CH would be adjacent to the H on the CH2 (two Hs on CH2) and the H on the other CH group. So, the H on each CH would see two Hs (from CH2) and one H (from the other CH), leading to a triplet of triplets, perhaps.

But the NMR data mentions two different signals with complex splitting, not just one.

Another approach: perhaps the CH2 group is next to a CH which is next to another CH, each with one H. So, each H on CH2 is adjacent to one H on the first CH, which is adjacent to another H on the second CH. So, the CH2's Hs would split based on the first CH's H, which in turn is split by the second CH's H. This could lead to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is adjacent to a CH which is adjacent to another CH, each with Hs. So, the CH2's Hs would split into a quartet. Because each H on CH2 is adjacent to one H on the first CH, which is adjacent to another H on the second CH. So, the first split is into a doublet (from the first CH), and then each of those peaks splits again into a doublet from the second CH, leading to a quartet.

But the NMR data shows a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex.

Wait, maybe the CH2 is adjacent to a CH which is itself adjacent to another CH, but the coupling constants are different, leading to multiple splittings.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two CH groups, each of which is attached to another CH group. So, each H on CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from two CH groups), each of which is adjacent to another H. This would lead to multiple layers of splitting.

This is getting quite complicated. Perhaps I should think about the structures and their expected NMR signals.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

In this structure, the CH groups are each attached to two CH3 groups and a H. The CH2 is attached to the COOH and between the two CH groups.

So, the CH2's Hs are adjacent to two Hs (one from each CH group). Each H on CH2 would couple with both Hs, leading to a triplet for each coupling. But since there are two different couplings, this would result in a doublet of doublets. But the observed splitting is a quartet, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, the CH groups themselves might have their Hs split by the neighboring CH2's Hs and other groups. For example, the H on each CH is adjacent to the CH2's Hs (two Hs) and maybe the H on the other CH group. So, each H on CH would be split into a triplet (from CH2) and a doublet (from the other CH), leading to a quintet or more complex splitting.

But the data mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests three layers of splitting.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH group which is next to another CH group, each with one H. So, the CH2's Hs would couple with the first CH's H (doublet), which in turn couples with the second CH's H (another doublet). So, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but the observed data has a quartet, which is a quartet from perhaps a different coupling.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the possible structures and which one would have a CH2 group next to two CH groups, each of which is next to another CH group. That way, the CH2's Hs would be split by three different groups, leading to a quartet in their splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that a CH2 group is adjacent to a CH which is adjacent to another CH, which is adjacent to another CH group. But I'm not sure any of the options present that.

Wait, looking at option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the CH2 is between two CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 and a H. So, each H on CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (one from each CH group). So, each H on CH2 would see two Hs, leading to a triplet for each. But if the two CH groups are not equivalent, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps each CH group is attached to a different substituent, making them nonequivalent. So, the H on the first CH would be adjacent to the H on the second CH, leading to a doublet. And the CH2's Hs would be adjacent to both, leading to a triplet. But in this case, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, the problem says one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's three layers. So, each H is split by three different groups. How?

Another thought: perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH which is adjacent to another CH, which is adjacent to a third CH. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH which is adjacent to another CH, which is part of an ethyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from the ethyl groups. The ethyl groups (C2H5) have their own Hs. But the question says none of the peaks are vinyl, which is correct because ethyl groups don't have double bonds. But the ethyl groups' Hs could contribute to the splitting.

Wait, let's think about the ethyl groups in option A and B. The CH groups are attached to C2H5 groups, which have two Hs on the CH2 part. So, the Hs on the ethyl groups might be adjacent to the Hs on the CH groups, causing further splitting.

But if the ethyl groups are attached to the CH groups, their Hs would be on a different carbon and might not be directly adjacent to the Hs on the CH groups. So, perhaps their coupling constants are small and may not significantly affect the splitting.

Another angle: think about the number of signals in the NMR. The question says "several peaks", but doesn't specify how many. So, perhaps the structure has multiple distinct environments of Hs.

Looking back, the question says one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, these are two distinct signals with complex splitting.

Which structure would have such signals?

Perhaps the CH2 group in option A is next to two CH groups, each with one H, and each CH is next to another CH. So, the CH2's Hs are split by two Hs, each from the two CH groups. Each H on CH2 would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet for each. But since the two CH groups are different (since they're attached to ethyl groups), the coupling constants may differ, leading to a doublet of triplets or similar.

Wait, the splitting pattern is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, three layers of splitting. How?

Perhaps each H on CH2 is adjacent to one H on a CH group, which is adjacent to another H on another CH group, which is adjacent to another H on another CH group. But that would require a longer chain than any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH which is adjacent to another CH, and the CH2 is also adjacent to another group with Hs.

Wait, maybe the CH2 is next to a CH which is next to another CH, and the CH2 is also adjacent to a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the splitting patterns and what structures cause them.

A doublet of triplets of quartets would arise if each proton is:

1. Split by one proton (doublet),
2. Then each of those peaks is split by a second set of two protons (triplet),
3. And each of those is split by a third set of three protons (quartet).

But wait, the quartet comes from three neighboring Hs (n=3 → quartet, n+1=4). So, each H is adjacent to three Hs.

But in our structures, the maximum number of adjacent Hs would be two (from the CH groups), unless there's a branching point.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group which is itself adjacent to another CH group and also to another CH2 group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two CH groups, each adjacent to another CH group. So, the Hs on the CH2 would see two Hs (from the adjacent CH groups), and each of those Hs would see another H on another CH group, leading to a quartet.

Wait, maybe the CH2's Hs are split by two Hs (doublet of doublets), but each of those is further split by another set of Hs, leading to a quartet. So, the overall splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2's Hs are split by three different groups, each with a different number of Hs.

This is getting too vague. Let me think about the options again. Which one would have a CH2 group that is adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H, and those CH groups are themselves adjacent to another CH group with one H.

Wait, perhaps option A has the CH2 between two CH groups, each with one H. Each of those CH groups is attached to an ethyl group, which has two Hs on the CH2 part of the ethyl. So, the Hs on the CH groups would be adjacent to the Hs on the ethyl groups, leading to additional splitting.

But the ethyl groups' Hs are on a different carbon, so their coupling with the CH group's H might be small and possibly not observed as a splitting. Alternatively, it could be that the CH groups' Hs are adjacent to the CH2's Hs and the ethyl groups' Hs, leading to more splitting.

But I'm not confident about this. Let me think about another angle: the number of neighboring Hs each proton has.

The doublet of triplets of quartets implies that a proton is coupled with three different sets of Hs. So, perhaps each proton is adjacent to three different groups with Hs.

Wait, another way: each proton is next to one H (doublet), which is next to two Hs (triplet), which is next to three Hs (quartet). So, each layer of splitting adds another factor.

Hmm. Maybe the CH2 group is next to a CH group which is next to another CH group which is next to another CH group. But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is next to a CH group which is attached to an ethyl group, whose CH2 has two Hs. So, the Hs on the CH2 would couple with the H on the CH, and the Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 would also couple, leading to a more complex splitting.

But again, this is speculative.

Given that I'm a bit stuck, perhaps it's better to look for other clues. Let me think about the integration of the signals, but the question doesn't provide integration data. So, perhaps I should think about the splitting patterns again.

The problem mentions two specific splitting patterns: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from vicinal coupling and coupling through space, but that's less common.

Another thought: perhaps the CH2 group is next to a CH which is next to another CH, which is next to another CH group, but I don't think any of the options have such a structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a branching point where each CH group is attached to two other CH groups, leading to multiple couplings.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH.

The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH.

So, the two central CH groups are each attached to a C2H5 and a H. The CH2 is part of the CH3CH2 group attached to the first CH.

So, the CH2 (from CH3CH2-) is adjacent to a CH group with one H. The Hs on the CH2 would couple with the H on the adjacent CH group, leading to a doublet. But perhaps the H on the CH group is also adjacent to another CH group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, the H on the CH group (C(H)(C2H5)) is adjacent to the H on the other CH group (C(H)(C2H5)). So, the H on each CH group is adjacent to one H on the other CH group.

Thus, the H on each CH would be a doublet. Additionally, the CH2's Hs are adjacent to the H on the first CH, leading to a doublet for each.

But how does that lead to the observed splitting patterns?

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group's Hs are split by the H on the first CH (doublet), and the Hs on the first CH are split by the Hs on the second CH (doublet), leading to a quartet for the CH2.

Wait, perhaps the CH2's Hs are split by the H on the adjacent CH (doublet), and the Hs on that CH are split by the Hs on the other CH (doublet), leading to a quartet for the CH2's Hs. So, the CH2 would show as a quartet.

But the problem mentions a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more complex. So, perhaps this isn't the case.

Hmm. I'm really not sure. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the information.

The FTIR suggests a carboxylic acid. The NMR doesn't show any vinyl Hs, which aligns with all options.

The complex splitting suggests that the Hs are coupled with multiple neighboring Hs. Option A and B have ethyl groups, which might contribute additional Hs for coupling, but option C and D have methyl groups, which don't add more Hs.

Wait, in option A, each CH group is attached to an ethyl group (C2H5). The ethyl group has a CH2CH3, meaning the Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 are adjacent to the CH group's H. So, the Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 would be adjacent to the H on the CH group, leading to a coupling.

So, the Hs on the ethyl group's CH2 would split into a doublet because they're next to one H. Similarly, the H on the CH group would see the Hs on the ethyl's CH2, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not sure how this affects the overall splitting patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl groups add more Hs into the coupling, leading to more complex splitting.

Given that, perhaps option A would have more complex splitting because the CH2 groups in the ethyl substituents add more Hs into the mix.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is option A because the CH2 group is adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H, leading to more splitting.

Wait, another thought: in option A, the CH2 is between two CH groups, each with one H. Each H on the CH2 would be split by both Hs, leading to a triplet for each. But the two CH groups are attached to ethyl groups, which themselves have CH2 groups. So, the Hs on the CH2 might also couple with the Hs on the ethyl groups' CH2, leading to more splitting.

But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting observed is due to the CH2 being next to a CH which is next to another CH, each with one H, leading to a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group's Hs are split by the first CH's H into a doublet, and then each of those peaks is split by the second CH's H into a quartet, leading to a doublet of quartets. But the observed splitting is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is more layers.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible correct answer based on the structures.

The correct answer is likely option A or C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR signals for each structure.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

The two CH groups are each attached to two CH3 groups. So, the Hs on each CH are adjacent to the Hs on the other CH group. So, each CH's H would be a doublet. The CH2 group is between the two CH groups, so each H on CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from the two CH groups), leading to a triplet. But the problem mentions a quartet in the splitting, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group's Hs are adjacent to two Hs (from the two CH groups), leading to a triplet, and each of those is split by another H, leading to a quartet.

Wait, if the CH2 is adjacent to two Hs (from two CH groups), leading to a triplet, and those are further split by another set of Hs, perhaps from the methyl groups, leading to a quartet. But methyl groups are attached to the CH groups, so their Hs are not adjacent to the CH2's Hs.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should consider the options again.

Looking at the options, option A has ethyl groups, which are more complex and might lead to more splitting. So, perhaps option A is the correct answer.

Alternatively, the correct answer is option C, which has a symmetric structure that might lead to more complex splitting.

Wait, the problem states that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which suggests three layers of splitting. So, perhaps the CH2 group in option A is next to a CH which is next to another CH, which is next to another group with Hs, leading to three layers.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.


The question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and ¹H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid, and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹, corresponding to a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens, and two specific splitting patterns: a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. These splitting patterns suggest complex coupling between protons, likely due to multiple neighboring groups with hydrogens.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: CH₃C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)CH₂COOH**  
   - The structure features two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group (C₂H₅) and a hydrogen, with a CH₂ group connected to the COOH group.  
   - The CH₂ group is between two CH groups, each with one hydrogen. The ethyl groups add additional hydrogens, contributing to the complexity of the splitting patterns.  
   - The CH₂ protons are adjacent to two CH groups, each with one hydrogen, leading to a triplet splitting. Further splitting from the ethyl groups' hydrogens could explain the observed doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets.

2. **Option B: CH₃CH₂C(H)(C₂H₅)C(H)(C₂H₅)COOH**  
   - Similar to Option A, this structure has two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group and a hydrogen, but the CH₂ group is part of the CH₃CH₂ group at the end.  
   - The CH₂ protons are adjacent to one CH group with one hydrogen, leading to a simpler splitting pattern (e.g., a doublet or triplet). This does not align with the observed complex splitting patterns.

3. **Option C: CH₃C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)CH₂COOH**  
   - This structure features two CH groups, each attached to two methyl groups and a hydrogen, with a CH₂ group connected to the COOH group.  
   - The CH₂ protons are adjacent to two CH groups, each with one hydrogen, leading to a triplet splitting. However, the symmetry of the methyl groups reduces the complexity of the splitting patterns, making it less likely to match the observed data.

4. **Option D: CH₃CH₂C(H)(CH₃)C(H)(CH₃)COOH**  
   - This structure has two CH groups, each attached to a methyl group and a hydrogen, with a CH₂ group connected to the COOH group.  
   - The CH₂ protons are adjacent to one CH group with one hydrogen, leading to a simpler splitting pattern. This does not align with the observed complex splitting patterns.

### Conclusion:
The observed splitting patterns in the ¹H NMR spectrum, particularly the doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets, suggest a more complex coupling environment. Option A, with its ethyl groups and CH₂ group between two CH groups, provides the structural complexity needed to produce these splitting patterns. Therefore, the most likely compound is **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
