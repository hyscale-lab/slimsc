Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum mechanics concepts. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the uncertainty principle. Right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I remember that it states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The problem says that an electron is traveling along the x-direction at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. They're asking for the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Hmm, wait. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates position and momentum, not directly energy. But I think energy is related to momentum. Oh right, because the kinetic energy of a particle is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum.

So I need to use the uncertainty principle to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, and then use that to find the uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

The formula for the uncertainty principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Since they're asking for the minimum uncertainty, I can use Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). But maybe for an approximate calculation, people often take Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx), just to make it easier. I think that's what I'll do here, as the exact factor of 2 might not matter much for an order-of-magnitude estimate.

Wait, what's ħ? Oh right, it's approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. So I can use that value.

Let me jot down the variables:

Δx = 0.1 nm. Oh wait, nanometers. So 0.1 nm is 0.1 * 10^-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters.

v is given as 2e8 m/s. Hmm, but wait, do I need that for this problem? Because the question is about the uncertainty in energy, which relates to the uncertainty in momentum. So maybe the velocity is a red herring, or perhaps it's used for something else. Let me think.

Wait, the question gives the speed of the electron, but the uncertainty principle is about the uncertainty in position and momentum. So perhaps the uncertainty in momentum is being calculated, and then that relates to the uncertainty in kinetic energy.

But wait, actually, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but when you have an uncertainty in momentum, the uncertainty in energy would be related to the uncertainty in kinetic energy, which is (Δp²)/(2m), because dK = p dp/m or something like that. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so if p has an uncertainty Δp, then the uncertainty in K would be ΔK ≈ (2p Δp)/(2m) )? Or maybe it's more accurate to use the derivative approach.

Alternatively, using calculus, the uncertainty in energy ΔE can be approximated by the derivative of the energy with respect to momentum times the uncertainty in momentum. So ΔE ≈ |dE/dp| * Δp.

Since E = p²/(2m), dE/dp is p/m. So ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but I don't know p exactly, but I know the speed v. So p = m*v. So substituting that in, ΔE ≈ (m v / m) * Δp = v * Δp.

Wait, but wait. If I'm using the minimum uncertainty, then Δp is approximately ħ/(Δx). So ΔE ≈ v * (ħ/(Δx)).

Let me plug in the numbers.

v = 2e8 m/s.
Δx = 1e-10 m.
ħ = 1e-34 J·s (approximating since 1.05e-34 is close to that).

So Δp ≈ ħ/(Δx) = (1e-34) / (1e-10) = 1e-24 kg·m/s.

Then ΔE ≈ v * Δp = (2e8) * (1e-24) = 2e-16 J.

Wait, but wait. Earlier I thought that ΔE is (p/m)*Δp. Let's re-express that.

Wait, E = p²/(2m), so the derivative is dE/dp = p/m. So if Δp is the uncertainty in p, then the uncertainty in E, ΔE, is approximately (p/m) * Δp.

But wait, p is m v, so substituting, (m v / m) * Δp = v Δp. So yes, same result. So that gives ΔE ≈ v Δp = 2e8 * 1e-24 = 2e-16 J.

But wait, the options are A) ~1e-18, B) ~1e-17, C) ~1e-19, D) ~1e-16.

So 2e-16 is approximately 1e-16, which is option D.

But wait, wait a second. I thought the uncertainty principle says Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So when I take Δp = ħ/(2Δx), which would give a smaller Δp, leading to a smaller ΔE.

Using that, let's recalculate:

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-10) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-10) ≈ 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

Then ΔE = v * Δp ≈ 2e8 * 5.25e-25 = 1.05e-16 J.

Which is around 1e-16 J, still option D.

Wait, but wait. Another approach is to use the uncertainty in energy directly. Since energy is related to momentum, perhaps using the energy-time uncertainty relation. But wait, that's a different relation, and I don't think that's applicable here because the question is about position uncertainty leading to momentum uncertainty, which affects kinetic energy.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider the kinetic energy uncertainty in terms of the momentum uncertainty, as I did earlier.

Another thing to consider: sometimes, people use ΔE ≈ ħ c / Δx when dealing with relativistic speeds or for photons, but that's the energy of a photon with wavelength related to Δx. But here, we're dealing with an electron, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the momentum's uncertainty and then find the corresponding kinetic energy, but using the relation between p and E.

Wait, let's step back. Let's compute Δp as ħ/(2Δx), which is approximately (1e-34)/(2e-10) = 5e-25 kg m/s.

Then, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in kinetic energy would be ΔK ≈ ( (Δp)^2 )/(2m) )

Wait, that's another approach. Let's compute that.

Δp = 5e-25 kg m/s.

m is the mass of the electron, about 9.11e-31 kg.

So ΔK ≈ ( (5e-25)^2 ) / (2 * 9.11e-31 )

Calculating numerator: (5e-25)^2 = 25e-50 = 2.5e-49.

Denominator: 2*9.11e-31 = ~1.82e-30.

So 2.5e-49 / 1.82e-30 ≈ 1.37e-19 J.

Wait, that's about 1e-19 J, which would be option C.

But wait, earlier I thought ΔE was about 1e-16 J, but this approach gives me 1e-19. So which one is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the uncertainty in energy due to momentum and the calculation using the energy expression.

Wait, perhaps the first approach is correct. Let me think again.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, so the minimum Δp is ħ/(2Δx).

The kinetic energy is E = p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in E, ΔE, would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m).

Wait, that's what I did in the second approach.

Alternatively, another way: using the relation between energy and momentum, if Δp is the uncertainty in p, the uncertainty in E is (dE/dp) * Δp.

dE/dp is p/m, so ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

But p is the average momentum, which is m v. So substituting, (m v / m) * Δp = v Δp.

So ΔE ≈ v * (ħ/(2Δx))).

That's the first approach, giving around 1e-16 J.

So why are these two methods giving different answers?

Ah! Because perhaps in the first approach, I assumed that ΔE is approximately v Δp, but that's a linear approximation. The other approach is quadratic in Δp.

Which one is correct? Hmm.

Wait, I think the confusion arises from whether the energy uncertainty is due to the momentum uncertainty or not.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the uncertainty in kinetic energy, which is (Δp)^2/(2m).

So let's compute that.

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 1e-10) = approx 5.25e-25 kg m/s.

So (Δp)^2 = (5.25e-25)^2 = 2.756e-49 (kg^2 m^2/s^2).

Divide by 2m: 2 * 9.11e-31 kg = 1.822e-30 kg.

So 2.756e-49 / 1.822e-30 = approx 1.51e-19 J.

So ΔE ≈ 1.5e-19 J, which is about 1e-19 J. That's option C.

But wait, why is this different from the earlier approach? Because the first approach assumed ΔE is proportional to v*Δp, but that's only correct if E is proportional to p. Which is the case for non-relativistic speeds, where E = p²/(2m). So if E is a quadratic function of p, the uncertainty in E would depend on (Δp)^2.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct approach is the second one, where ΔE is approximately (Δp)^2/(2m).

So why did the first approach give a different answer? Because that approach treated E as linear in p, which is only true at low p, but E is actually quadratic.

Therefore, the correct way is to compute ΔE using the second approach.

So the correct ΔE is about 1.5e-19 J, so approximately 1e-19 J. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, wait another thing. The problem says 'minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.' So I'm a bit confused whether it's the kinetic energy or the total energy. But since the electron is moving non-relativistically (v=2e8 m/s, which is about 0.66c, wait no, 2e8 is about 20% of the speed of light (which is ~3e8 m/s), so it's non-relativistic. So the kinetic energy is indeed (p²)/(2m).

So, using the second approach, the ΔE is about 1.5e-19 J, which is 1e-19 order of magnitude, so option C.

But wait, wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the variables.

Given that v=2e8 m/s, but I didn't use that in the second approach. Because in the second approach, I calculated ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m), which doesn't involve v.

But perhaps that's correct because the uncertainty in E comes from the uncertainty in p, not the actual value of p.

Hmm, but in the first approach, using v, I get a different answer. So which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the uncertainty in momentum, then find the corresponding uncertainty in kinetic energy, which is (Δp)^2/(2m), as I did.

Let me compute that again with precise values.

Compute Δp:

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-10 m) ) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10 = 5.272859e-25 kg·m/s.

Then (Δp)^2 = (5.272859e-25)^2 ≈ 2.78e-49 (kg² m²/s²).

Mass of electron m = 9.10938356e-31 kg.

So 2m = 1.8218767e-30 kg.

So (Δp)^2/(2m) = 2.78e-49 / 1.8218767e-30 ≈ 1.525e-19 J.

Which is about 1.5e-19 J, so 1e-19 J when considering orders of magnitude.

So the answer would be option C.

But wait, earlier when I thought the answer was D, I was using the first approach, which perhaps was incorrect.

So why did the first approach give a different result? Because it assumed that ΔE is linear in Δp, which is only correct if E is linear in p, which isn't the case. So the second approach is correct.

Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately 1e-19 J, so option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainties in position (\( \Delta x \)) and momentum (\( \Delta p \)) as:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Given \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the electron is related to its momentum by \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), so the uncertainty in kinetic energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}.
\]

The mass of the electron is \( m \approx 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \) and \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, compute \( (\Delta p)^2 \):

\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 \approx 2.78 \times 10^{-49} \, \text{kg}^2 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2.
\]

Next, compute \( 2m \):

\[
2m = 2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \approx 1.82 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{kg}.
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{2.78 \times 10^{-49}}{1.82 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.53 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This result is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option C.

### Key Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\( 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \))**: Too large compared to the calculated value.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-17} \, \text{J} \))**: Also too large.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \))**: Matches the calculated value of \( 1.53 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).
- **Option D (\( 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \))**: Far too large and inconsistent with the calculation.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
