Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup involves a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. They mention small values of m, which I remember is the orbital magnetic quantum number. B is given as 1 Tesla.

Hmm, right. So I'm supposed to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic term) with the energy transition Delta E. The options are different relations between them, like whether the paramagnetic term is much greater than, much less than, etc.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is usually due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and the external magnetic field. The formula I remember is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. Oh, but wait, in the context of an atom, the magnetic moment comes from the electron's spin and orbital angular momentum, right?

But wait, the question says it's the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism is due to the electron's spin, I think. So maybe it's the spin-orbit coupling? Or just the spin in the magnetic field. Hmm, but I might be mixing things up. Let me clarify.

In the hydrogen atom, the main paramagnetic effect comes from the electron's spin. The Zeeman effect, on the other hand, is the splitting of energy levels due to an external magnetic field, which is also a magnetic interaction. So maybe the question is referring to the Zeeman term here.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term would be the Hamiltonian term due to the magnetic interaction. So the Zeeman term is H_Zeeman = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but in the hydrogen atom, the orbital contribution might be considered as well. Oh, but for small m, perhaps the term is small. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

The transition energy Delta E is given, and it's associated with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, wait, that's the wavelength of the Balmer series in hydrogen. Specifically, the Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm, but 0.486 micrometers is 486 nm, which is the H-alpha line? Or is it another line? Wait, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is the H-alpha line... Wait, no, H-alpha is about 656 nm. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, 0.4861 micrometers is 4861 Angstroms, which is the H-alpha line. No, wait, 1 micrometer is 1000 nm, so 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is the H-alpha line. Or wait, is that the H-beta? Let me think: H-alpha is 656 nm, H-beta is 486 nm. Oh right! So wavelength lambda is 486 nm corresponds to the H-beta transition.

Wait, but the energy transition Delta E is given by hc/lambda. Let's compute that. For lambda = 486.1e-9 meters, planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J s, speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So Delta E = hc/lambda.

Calculating that: 6.626e-34 *3e8 / 486.1e-9 ≈ (1.9878e-25) / 4.861e-7 ≈ approximately 4.089e-19 J.

Wait, but in terms of eV, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.089e-19 J is about 2.55 eV. Hmm, that's a rough calculation, but I think I'm in the right ballpark.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. So H_para = - μ·B.

The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = g_s μ_B m, where g_s is the spin g-factor (about 2), μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is μ = μ_B m, where μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), and m is the magnetic quantum number. Wait, but in the case of the paramagnetic term (spin), m is the spin quantum number, which can be ±1/2. But wait, the question says m is small, which for spin, m could be ±1/2, which are small in magnitude. So maybe m is small in terms of the quantum number, but not the actual value.

Wait, but the hydrogen atom's fine structure comes from relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling, but in the presence of an external magnetic field, the Zeeman effect comes into play, leading to splitting of energy levels. So the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman term.

So the paramagnetic coupling energy would be H_para = - μ·B. The magnetic dipole moment μ is given by μ = m μ_B, where m is the magnetic quantum number related to the orbital angular momentum, but wait, no, for the spin, it's μ = g_s μ_B s_z, where s_z is the spin component. For an electron, s_z can be ± ħ/2, so m_s is ±1/2. So in this case, m is small, but the actual value of μ would be (g_s * μ_B * (ħ/2))/ℏ? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is eħ/(2m_e), right? So for the spin, the magnetic moment is μ = g_s μ_B m_s, with m_s = ±1/2. So for an electron, g_s is about 2, so μ = 2 * μ_B * (±1/2) = ± μ_B. That's the maximum.

So the energy from the paramagnetic term is H_para = -μ·B. So the expectation value would be ⟨H_para⟩ = -μ B.

Wait, but the expectation value for an electron in a state with m_s = +1/2 would be ⟨H_para⟩ = - μ B = - (g_s μ_B m_s) B. Wait, but I'm not sure if the sign is correct here. Or maybe it's H_para = -μ·B, so the energy is -μ B cos(theta), where theta is the angle between μ and B. But in this case, B is along Oz, and the magnetic moment μ is along the same axis, so theta is zero, cos(theta)=1. So the energy is - μ B.

But the problem specifies small m, so perhaps m is small in magnitude, but that's for the orbital, but wait, no, in the paramagnetic term, m is the spin quantum number, which is ±1/2. So maybe the question is considering the orbital magnetic quantum number l, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the question mentions orbital magnetic quantum number m, which is for the orbital angular momentum. So for orbitals, m can be -l, ..., +l. But if m is small, like m=0 or m=1, then the paramagnetic coupling would be proportional to m. Hmm, but I thought paramagnetism is due to spin, but perhaps the question is about orbital contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps in this context, the paramagnetic coupling term refers to the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment in the presence of an external field. So the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (μ_B) m / l, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the orbital contribution is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L_z)/(ħ) ) * m, where m is the orbital quantum number. Wait, no, L_z is m ħ, so μ_orbital = (e)/(2m_e) * L_z = (e)/(2m_e) * m ħ = (eħ m)/(2m_e) ) = μ_B * m, where μ_B is eħ/(2 m_e). So yes, μ_orbital is μ_B m.

So the paramagnetic term H_para = - μ_orbital · B. Since B is along Oz, and μ_orbital is along m, the dot product is μ B.

So the expectation value ⟨H_para⟩ would be - μ_B m B.

Wait, but in the question, m is small. Let's take m=1, for example.

So let's compute the magnitude of this term.

Given that B is 1 T. μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.

So plugging in m=1: H_para = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but wait, if m is small, like m=1, which is small compared to higher m values. But the question says "small values of m".

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering m as 1 because, for hydrogen, the possible m values are up to l, and for small l, m is small.

But let me calculate the transition energy Delta E. Earlier, I got approximately 2.55 eV, which is about 4.089e-19 J.

Now, compute H_para: 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

Now, compare H_para with Delta E.

H_para is about 9.274e-24 J, while Delta E is about 4.089e-19 J.

So H_para is about 9.27e-24 / 4.089e-19 ≈ 2.267e-5 times Delta E. So that's much smaller.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, μ_B is 9.274e-24 J/T. So H_para is μ_B * m * B.

With m=1, B=1 T: 9.274e-24 * 1 * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Delta E is about 4.089e-19 J. So H_para is about 9.27e-24 / 4.089e-19 ≈ 2.27e-5 times Delta E. So H_para is much smaller than Delta E.

Wait, but wait, another thought: is m the orbital quantum number or the spin quantum number?

If m refers to the spin, then m can be ±1/2. So plugging m=1/2: H_para = 9.274e-24 * (1/2) * 1 T = 4.637e-24 J.

Which would be even smaller, about 1.13e-5 times Delta E.

In either case, H_para is much smaller than Delta E. So the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy.

Wait a second, but the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy.

Wait, but the transition energy is the energy difference between two atomic states, like the energy levels of hydrogen. The paramagnetic term is a perturbation due to the external magnetic field. So in the presence of B, the energy levels split, and the shift is given by the paramagnetic term.

If the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy, then the paramagnetic effect is negligible compared to the transition energy.

Wait, but in the hydrogen atom, the transition energy is the energy required to excite the electron from one energy level to another. The paramagnetic term, on the other hand, is a shift in energy levels due to the magnetic field.

So comparing the two: if ⟨H_para⟩ is much smaller than Delta E, then the paramagnetic term is negligible compared to the transition energy. So the correct option would be C: ⟨H⟩ << Delta E.

Wait, but let me think again. What's the order of magnitude here.

H_para is about 1e-23 J or so, and Delta E is about 4e-19 J. So H_para is about 1e-4 times smaller than Delta E? Wait, 1e-23 is 1e-4 times 1e-19. Oh wait, no. 1e-23 is 1e-4 times 1e-19 is 1e-23, because 1e-19 * 1e-4 is 1e-23. So yes, H_para is 1e-4 times smaller than Delta E. So ⟨H_para⟩ is much less than Delta E.

So the correct option is C: ⟨H⟩ << Delta E.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy ($\Delta E$):**  
   The transition energy is associated with the wavelength $\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm}$. Using the formula $\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$, where $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}$ and $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$, we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.089 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts ($1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}$), we find $\Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}$.

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ($\langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle$):**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field $\vec{B}$. The magnetic moment is given by $\mu = \mu_B m$, where $\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}$ is the Bohr magneton, and $m$ is the magnetic quantum number. For small values of $m$ (e.g., $m = 1$ or $m = 1/2$), the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is:  
   \[
   \langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle = -\mu_B m B.
   \]  
   Substituting $\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}$, $m = 1$, and $B = 1 \, \text{T}$, we find:  
   \[
   \langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   For $m = 1/2$, the value is halved:  
   \[
   \langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle \approx 4.637 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   Comparing $\langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle$ with $\Delta E$:  
   \[
   \frac{\langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.089 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This shows that $\langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle$ is approximately $2.27 \times 10^{-5}$ times $\Delta E$, which is much smaller. Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is negligible compared to the transition energy.

**Conclusion:** The paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy.
