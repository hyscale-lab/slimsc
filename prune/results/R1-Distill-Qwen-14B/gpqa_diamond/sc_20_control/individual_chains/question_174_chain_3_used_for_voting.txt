Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so the initial nucleus is at rest. When it splits, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum because the initial momentum is zero. So the momenta should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me note down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy of nucleus: 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 * m2.
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M. Since M is the initial mass, but wait, the initial rest mass is given as 300 GeV. Hmm, but mass and energy are related via E=mc², so perhaps M is the rest mass in units where c²=1, so 300 GeV is the rest energy.

Wait, the problem says the sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So if M is the initial rest mass, then m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

But m1 is twice m2. So m1 = 2 m2. So substituting, 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M /3. Then m1 = 0.99 M * 2/3 = 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is the initial rest mass. So M is the sum of m1 and m2 plus the mass of any other particles, but the problem says nothing else is produced, just the two fragments. Wait wait, the total rest mass after is 0.99 M. So the initial rest mass is M, but after fission, the sum is 0.99 M. So the mass defect is 1% of M, which would be the mass converted into kinetic energy or other forms. Oh wait, but the problem says "sum of rest-masses is 99% of initial mass M." So yes, that's correct. So the initial rest mass is M, and after, the sum is 0.99 M.

But wait, actually, in real fission, some mass is converted into kinetic energy and other forms, so that the sum of the rest masses is less than the initial. So that's correct.

So the two fragments will have rest masses m1 and m2, with m1 = 2*m2, and m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So let's compute m1 and m2.

m1 = 2 m2.

m1 + m2 = 3 m2 =0.99 M → m2 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M.

m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M.

So m1 is 0.66 M and m2 is 0.33 M.

Now, since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments move with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 (assuming non-relativistic first, then relativistic for the correct calculation). Wait but the question is about the difference between the correct and the classical (non-relativistic) T1. So I need to compute T1 relativistically and then compare it to T1 calculated non-relativistically.

Wait, but for non-relativistic, KE is (1/2) m v². But for relativistic, it's (gamma - 1) m c². But since all the energy is kinetic except for their rest mass, maybe I can use conservation of energy and momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of invariant mass or something.

Wait, but let's think in terms of momentum and energy. The initial nucleus is at rest, so initial energy is just its rest energy, 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two fragments. Each fragment's energy is their rest energy plus their kinetic energy, so E1 = m1 c² + K1, E2 = m2 c² + K2.

But wait, in the rest frame of the nucleus, after fission, the fragments have kinetic energy and their rest energy. So total energy after is E1 + E2 = (m1 + m2) c² + (K1 + K2).

But the initial energy is Mc² =300 GeV.

So energy conservation: Mc² = (m1 + m2) c² + K1 + K2.

But (m1 + m2) c² is 0.99 M c². Wait, wait, because m1 + m2 is 0.99 M, so (m1 + m2) c² = 0.99 * (M c²) = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So the total kinetic energy K1 + K2 is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV.

So the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

Now, we can also compute the velocities because momentum is conserved.

Let me denote v1 as the velocity of m1 and v2 as the velocity of m2.

Since momentum is conserved, m1 v1 = m2 v2 (but opposite in direction, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2).

Wait, no, let's set up the momentum correctly. Let me choose the direction of m1 as positive. Then m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → m1 v1 + m2 v2 =0.

So m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

But m1 = 2 m2 → v2 = (2 m2 / m2) v1 → v2 = 2 v1.

Wait, but wait, directionally, if m1 is moving in positive direction, then m2 is moving in negative, so v2 is negative. Hmm, perhaps I should take absolute values.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relativistic velocity relation might complicate things, but since the initial velocities are likely non-relativistic, because 3 GeV is a small fraction compared to 300 GeV, maybe non-relativistic approximation is close. But since the problem is about the difference between correct and non-relativistic, we have to do the relativistic calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think in terms of four-momentum.

The initial four-momentum is (E, 0) = (300 GeV, 0).

After fission, each fragment has four-momentum (E1, p1 c) and (E2, p2 c).

Since the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So p1 c = - p2 c → p1 = -p2.

So the total four-momentum is (E1 + E2, 0).

Which should equal (300 GeV, 0).

So E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Which we have from earlier.

But each E1 and E2 are the total energies of the fragments, so E1 = gamma1 m1 c², E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

And their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

The momentum p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 (but wait, in natural units where c=1, p = gamma m v → but in any case, p1 = gamma1 m1 v1 /c. Hmm, perhaps better to work in units where c=1, so E = gamma m, p = gamma m v.

Wait, let's adopt natural units where c=1, so E = gamma m, and p = gamma m v.

So for each fragment:

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since p1 = -p2,

gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

But since the velocities are in opposite directions, perhaps v2 = - (m1/m2)(v1/(gamma2/gamma1)) )? Hmm, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps express v in terms of beta.

Let me think in terms of beta (v = beta c).

So for each fragment,

p1 = gamma1 m1 beta,

p2 = gamma2 m2 beta'.

Since p1 = -p2,

gamma1 m1 beta = - gamma2 m2 beta'.

But beta' is the beta of fragment 2, so it's the magnitude, but in opposite direction. So perhaps beta' = - (gamma1 m1 beta) / (gamma2 m2).

But perhaps it's easier to consider the magnitudes. So |p1| = |p2|.

So gamma1 m1 |v1| = gamma2 m2 |v2|.

But from earlier, because m1 is twice m2, v2 must be twice v1 in magnitude if velocities were non-relativistic. But wait, that's under non-relativistic assumption. With relativity, it's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of the velocities using relativistic momentum.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that the kinetic energy and momentum are related. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe we can write beta in terms of p and energy.

We know that for each particle, p² c² = (E² - m² c^4).

In natural units (c=1), p² = E² - m².

So for fragment 1: p1² = (gamma1 m1 )² - (m1)^2 = m1² (gamma1² - 1).

Similarly for fragment 2: p2² = m2² (gamma2² - 1).

But since p1 = p2 (in magnitude, but opposite direction, so |p1|=|p2|), so:

m1² (gamma1² -1) = m2² (gamma2² -1).

Hmm, but with m1 = 2 m2, this becomes (4 m2²)(gamma1² -1) = m2² (gamma2² -1) → 4 (gamma1² -1 ) = gamma2² -1.

So 4 gamma1² -4 = gamma2² -1 → 4 gamma1² = gamma2² +3.

But also, from the energy conservation:

gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2 = 300 GeV.

But m1 = 2 m2, so gamma1 (2 m2) + gamma2 m2 =300 → m2 (2 gamma1 + gamma2 ) =300.

Wait, but m2 is (0.33 M), but M is the initial mass, which is 300 GeV when at rest. So m2 c² is 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV. Wait, that's because the rest energy is 300 GeV, so m = E_rest /c², so m1 is 0.66 M, m2 is 0.33 M. But M is the initial mass, which is 300 GeV/c².

So m2 c² = 99 GeV.

So m2 = 99 GeV /c².

Similarly, m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.

So E1 = gamma1 * 198 GeV,

E2 = gamma2 *99 GeV.

So the energy equation becomes:

gamma1 *198 + gamma2 *99 = 300 GeV.

We can write this as 198 gamma1 + 99 gamma2 = 300.

Divide both sides by 99:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 300/99 ≈ 3.0303.

So equation (1): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 ≈ 3.0303.

Equation (2) from momentum: 4 gamma1² = gamma2² +3.

So we have two equations:

Equation (1): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303,

Equation (2): 4 gamma1² - gamma2² = 3.

Hmm, perhaps we can express gamma2 from equation (1) and substitute into equation (2).

From equation (1): gamma2 = 3.0303 - 2 gamma1.

Substitute into equation (2):

4 gamma1² - (3.0303 - 2 gamma1 )^2 =3.

Expanding the square:

(3.0303)^2 - 2*3.0303*2 gamma1 + (2 gamma1)^2.

So,

4 gamma1² - [ (3.0303)^2 - 4*3.0303 gamma1 +4 gamma1² ] =3.

Let me compute that.

4 gamma1² - (9.1824) + 12.1212 gamma1 -4 gamma1² = 3.

Wait, 4 gamma1² -4 gamma1² cancels out.

So left with:

-9.1824 + 12.1212 gamma1 =3.

So 12.1212 gamma1 = 3 +9.1824 =12.1824.

gamma1 = 12.1824 /12.1212 ≈ 1.005.

Wait, let me calculate that.

Wait, 12.1212 gamma1 =12.1824 → gamma1 =12.1824 /12.1212 ≈ 1.00503.

Hmm, interesting. So gamma1 is approximately 1.005.

Then gamma2 =3.0303 -2 *1.00503 → 3.0303 -2.01006= 1.01994.

So gamma2≈1.02.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 3.0303 is 300/99=3.03030303... So let's write it as 300/99=100/33≈3.0303.

So gamma1 = (100/33 + 2 gamma1 )=?

Wait, no, equation (1) is 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =100/33.

Hmm, but perhaps better to compute more accurately.

Compute 12.1824 /12.1212.

Let me compute 12.1824 ÷12.1212.

Let me compute 12.1212 *1.005 = ?

12.1212 *1=12.1212,

12.1212 *0.005=0.060606,

So total 12.1212 +0.060606=12.1818, which is close to 12.1824.

So 12.1824 is 12.1818 +0.0006.

So 12.1212 *1.005=12.1818.

The difference is 12.1824−12.1818=0.0006.

So 0.0006 /12.1212 ≈0.0000495.

So gamma1≈1.005 +0.0000495≈1.0050495.

So gamma1≈1.00505.

Then gamma2=100/33 -2*(1.00505)= (3.03030303) -2.0101=1.020203.

So gamma2≈1.0202.

So, for fragment 1 (more massive), its energy is E1= gamma1 *198 GeV.

E1=1.00505 *198 ≈199.00 GeV.

Similarly, E2=1.0202 *99≈100.9998 GeV.

Wait, but let me compute it accurately.

198 *1.00505 =198*(1 +0.00505)=198 +198 *0.00505.

198 *0.005=0.99, 198 *0.00005=0.0099.

So approx 0.99+0.0099=0.9999. So 198 +0.9999≈198.9999 GeV.

Similarly, 99 *1.0202 =99*(1 +0.0202)=99 + 99*0.0202.

99 *0.02=1.98,

99 *0.0002=0.0198.

So 1.98+0.0198=1.9998.

So 99 +1.9998=100.9998 GeV.

So E1=approx 199 GeV,

E2=approx 101 GeV.

So the sum is 199 +101=300 GeV, which checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy for fragment 1 is K1=E1 -m1 c² =199 -198=1 GeV.

Similarly, K2=E2 -m2 c²=101 -99=2 GeV.

So the kinetic energies are 1 GeV and 2 GeV, sum 3 GeV, which matches earlier.

Wait, but that's the correct relativistic calculation. So T1 is 1 GeV.

Now, let's compute what T1 would be using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v^2.

So how would that work?

In the non-relativistic case, we can use conservation of momentum and kinetic energy.

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2.

But since m1=2 m2,

2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2=2 v1.

Kinetic energy conservation:

(1/2)m1 v1² + (1/2)m2 v2² =3 GeV.

Substitute m1=2 m2, v2=2 v1:

(1/2)(2 m2) v1² + (1/2)(m2)(2 v1)^2 =3.

Which is m2 v1² + (1/2 m2)(4 v1² )=3.

Simplify:

m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² =3 →3 m2 v1²=3 → m2 v1²=1.

But what is m2? m2 is 0.33 M, and M is 300 GeV/c² → m2=0.33 *300 GeV/c²=99 GeV/c².

So m2=99 GeV/c².

So m2 v1²=1 GeV → 99 GeV/c² * v1² =1 GeV → v1² = (1 GeV ) / (99 GeV/c² ) ) → v1²= c² /99.

So v1= c / sqrt(99) ≈c/(9.9499)≈0.1005 c.

So v1≈0.1005 c.

So the kinetic energy of fragment 1 in non-relativistic case:

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1² = 0.5 * 198 GeV/c² * (c² /99 ) = (0.5 * 198 /99 ) GeV.

198/99 =2, so 0.5 *2 =1 GeV.

Wait, same as the relativistic calculation? That can't be right. What's wrong here?

Wait, because in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy comes out to 1 GeV. But the correct relativistic calculation also gives 1 GeV.

Wait, but that would mean the difference is zero, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

But that can't be right because in reality, relativistic effects would change the kinetic energies.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the non-relativistic approach. Let me double-check.

Wait, in the non-relativistic approximation, when the nucleus is at rest, and it splits into two parts with m1 and m2, then the velocities are determined by momentum conservation.

But in our earlier calculation, the relativistic T1 was 1 GeV, and the non-relativistic T1 was also 1 GeV. So the difference would be zero. But the options don't include zero, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the non-relativistic calculation. Because in reality, the non-relativistic approach should give a different result.

Wait, let me re-calculate the non-relativistic case more carefully.

In non-relativistic approximation:

m1 v1 = m2 v2 → v2= (m1/m2) v1 = 2 v1.

Kinetic energy: (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 v2² =3 GeV.

Substitute m1=2 m2, v2=2 v1.

So:

(1/2)(2 m2) v1² + (1/2)(m2)(2 v1)^2 =3 GeV.

Simplify each term:

First term: (1/2)(2 m2) v1² = m2 v1².

Second term: (1/2)(m2)(4 v1²) = 2 m2 v1².

So total: m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² = 3 m2 v1² =3 GeV.

So 3 m2 v1²=3 → m2 v1² =1 GeV.

So v1² =1/(m2).

But m2 =99 GeV/c² → v1²= c²/(99).

v1= c / sqrt(99) ≈0.1005 c.

Then K1 = (1/2) m1 v1².

m1=198 GeV/c².

So K1= 0.5 *198 GeV/c² * (c²/99) )=0.5 * (198/99) GeV = 0.5 *2 GeV=1 GeV.

Same as relativistic calculation. So the difference is zero. But that's not an option. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe because in the relativistic case, gamma is slightly higher than 1, but the kinetic energy comes out to be 1 GeV, same as non-relativistic. But that's not possible.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. The correct relativistic calculation gave K1=1 GeV. The non-relativistic also gives K1=1 GeV. So the difference would be zero. But the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV. So perhaps I messed up in the setup.

Alternative approach: Maybe the problem is that when using the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is different.

Wait, maybe I shouldn't have used natural units. Let me try to re-calculate using non-relativistic equations without unit substitution.

Wait, initial nucleus rest mass energy is 300 GeV.

Fission produces two fragments with m1=0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

Sum of rest masses is 0.99 M. So M is 300 GeV/c². So m1 c²=0.66 *300 =198 GeV, m2 c²=99 GeV.

In the non-relativistic approximation, the velocities are found from momentum conservation and energy conservation.

But perhaps I should calculate the velocities more accurately.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy would be:

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1²,

K2 = (1/2) m2 v2²,

with m1 v1 = m2 v2 (since p1 = -p2, so m1 v1 = -m2 v2 → but in magnitude, m1 v1 = m2 v2).

So v2 = (m1/m2) v1 = 2 v1.

Now, the kinetic energies sum to 3 GeV.

So (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 (2 v1)^2 =3 GeV.

Which is:

(1/2) * (2 m2) * v1² + (1/2) m2 * (4 v1²) =3.

Simplify:

m2 v1² + 2 m2 v1² =3 →3 m2 v1² =3 → m2 v1²=1.

So v1²=1/(m2).

But m2=99 GeV/c².

So v1^2= (1 GeV) / (99 GeV/c²) ) * c² → v1^2 = c²/(99).

v1= c / sqrt(99) ≈0.1005 c.

Then K1= (1/2) m1 v1^2 = (1/2) *198 GeV/c² * (c^2/99) ) = (1/2) * (198/99) GeV = (1/2)*2 GeV=1 GeV.

Same result as relativistic.

Wait, that's strange. So according to this, both methods give the same T1=1 GeV.

But that's confusing because usually non-relativistic and relativistic calculations differ.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the relativistic approach. Let me re-calculate the relativistic case.

Earlier, in the relativistic case, I found gamma1≈1.005, which gives K1=1 GeV.

Wait, when gamma is just over 1, the kinetic energy is approximately (gamma-1) m c².

In this case, (gamma1 -1) *198 GeV ≈ (0.00505)*198≈1.00 GeV.

So that's consistent with K1=1 GeV.

Similarly, for fragment 2, gamma2≈1.02, so K2=(1.02-1)*99 ≈0.02 *99=1.98 GeV.

So K1=1 GeV, K2=2 GeV. Sum is 3 GeV.

So both methods give the same T1=1 GeV, so the difference is zero. But the options don't have zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me go back.

Wait, the problem says "the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M."

Wait, initial nucleus's rest mass is M, so sum of rest masses after is 0.99 M.

So M is the initial rest mass, so after fission, m1 + m2=0.99 M.

Thus, m1 =0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

But in the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the energy is E_initial=Mc²=300 GeV.

The energy after is E1 + E2 = (gamma1 m1 c²) + (gamma2 m2 c²) )=300 GeV.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, we have E1=gamma1 m1 c²,

E2=gamma2 m2 c².

But in the non-relativistic case, E1= m1 c² + (1/2 m1 v1²),

E2= m2 c² + (1/2 m2 v2²).

So the kinetic energies are K1= (1/2 m1 v1² ), K2= (1/2 m2 v2² ), and K1 + K2=3 GeV.

But in the non-relativistic case, the calculation gives K1=1 GeV, same as the relativistic case.

Hmm, so why are the K1's the same?

Wait, maybe because the non-relativistic approximation is so accurate here that the difference is negligible. But the problem says to find the difference, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relativistic gamma factors more accurately.

Earlier, I found gamma1≈1.00505, leading to K1=1 GeV.

But let me compute with more accurate gamma.

Let me go back to the equations:

Equation (1): 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 100/33 ≈3.03030303.

Equation (2): 4 gamma1² - gamma2² =3.

Express gamma2 from equation (1): gamma2=100/33 - 2 gamma1.

Substitute into equation (2):

4 gamma1^2 - (100/33 -2 gamma1)^2 =3.

Expand the square:

(100/33)^2 - 2*(100/33)*(2 gamma1) + (2 gamma1)^2.

So:

4 gamma1² - [ (10000/1089) - (400 gamma1)/33 +4 gamma1² ] =3.

So:

4 gamma1² -10000/1089 + (400 gamma1)/33 -4 gamma1² =3.

The 4 gamma1² and -4 gamma1² cancel.

Leaving:

-10000/1089 + (400 gamma1)/33 =3.

Move -10000/1089 to the other side:

(400 gamma1)/33 =3 +10000/1089.

Compute RHS:

3 = 3*1089/1089 =3267/1089.

So 3267 +10000=13267 → 13267/1089.

So:

(400 gamma1)/33=13267/1089 → gamma1= (13267/1089) * (33/400)= (13267 *33)/(1089 *400).

Compute 1089 is 33^2. So 1089=33^2.

So denominator is 33^2 *400.

So 33 cancels one 33 in numerator.

So gamma1= (13267 ) / (33 *400 )=13267/(13200)= approx 1.00509.

So gamma1≈1.00509.

So the kinetic energy K1=(gamma1 -1) m1 c².

So (1.00509 -1) *198 GeV =0.00509 *198≈1.0128 GeV.

Wait, that's about 1.0128 GeV.

Wait, but earlier I thought K1 was 1 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation.

Wait, earlier, I thought E1=gamma1 *198 GeV, so K1=E1 -198 GeV.

If gamma1=1.00509,

E1=1.00509 *198= approximately 198 + 198*0.00509.

198 *0.005 is 0.99, 198 *0.00009=0.01782 → total 0.99+0.01782=1.00782.

So E1≈199.00782 GeV.

So K1=E1 -198=1.00782 GeV ≈1.0078 GeV.

Which is about 1.0078 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, K1=1 GeV.

So the difference is approximately 0.0078 GeV, which is 7.8 MeV.

Wait, but the options are in MeV. The options are A)2 MeV, B)5, C)10, D)20.

Hmm, 7.8 MeV is close to 5 or 10. But perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute the exact value of (gamma1 -1) * m1 c².

gamma1=1.00509,

gamma1 -1=0.00509.

m1 c²=198 GeV.

So K1=0.00509 *198=1.00782 GeV=1007.82 MeV.

Wait, no, wait, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 1.00782 GeV is 1007.82 MeV.

Wait, no, wait, no: 1 GeV=1000 MeV. So 1.00782 GeV is 1007.82 MeV.

Wait, but the non-relativistic K1 is 1 GeV=1000 MeV.

So the difference is 1007.82 MeV -1000 MeV=7.82 MeV.

So approximately 7.8 MeV.

But the options don't have that. Closest is 5 MeV (option B) or 10 MeV (option C).

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute gamma1.

Earlier steps:

Equation (1):2 gamma1 + gamma2 =100/33 ≈3.0303.

Equation (2):4 gamma1² - gamma2² =3.

Express gamma2=3.0303 -2 gamma1.

Substitute into equation (2):

4 gamma1² - (3.0303 -2 gamma1 )² =3.

Expanding (3.0303 -2 gamma1 )²= (3.0303)^2 - 2 *3.0303 *2 gamma1 + (2 gamma1)^2.

So,

4 gamma1² - [9.1824 - 12.1212 gamma1 +4 gamma1² ]=3.

Which becomes:

4 gamma1² -9.1824 +12.1212 gamma1 -4 gamma1² =3.

Simplify:

12.1212 gamma1 -9.1824=3.

12.1212 gamma1=12.1824 → gamma1=12.1824 /12.1212= approx 1.00505.

Wait, exactly:

12.1824 ÷12.1212.

Let me compute:

12.1212 *1.005=12.1818.

Which is 12.1824 -12.1818=0.0006.

So 0.0006/12.1212≈0.0000495.

So gamma1=1.005 +0.0000495=1.0050495.

So gamma1=1.0050495.

So (gamma1 -1)=0.0050495.

K1=0.0050495 *198 GeV=1.0000 GeV.

Wait, so K1=1 GeV exactly.

Wait, because 198 *0.0050495=1.000 GeV exactly.

Hmm, that's interesting. So maybe the mistake was earlier. Because when I took gamma1=1.00509, perhaps that was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute gamma1=12.1824 /12.1212.

Let me compute 12.1824 ÷12.1212.

12.1212 *1.005=12.1818.

So 12.1824 -12.1818=0.0006.

So 0.0006/12.1212= x.

x =0.0006 /12.1212 ≈0.00004953.

So gamma1=1.005 +0.00004953=1.00504953.

So (gamma1-1)=0.00504953.

So K1=0.00504953 *198= (198 *0.00504953).

Compute:

0.005 *198=0.99.

0.00004953 *198=approx 0.0098.

So total K1=0.9998 GeV≈0.9998 GeV.

Which is approximately 1 GeV, but slightly less.

Wait, but that's 0.9998 GeV, which is 999.8 MeV.

So the non-relativistic calculation gives 1000 MeV, and the relativistic gives 999.8 MeV.

The difference is 0.2 MeV, which is 0.2 MeV. That’s way less than the options given.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the problem is that the non-relativistic approach neglects the variation in gamma, so perhaps in reality, the relativistic calculation gives a higher K1 than the non-relativistic.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, the relativistic K1 was 1 GeV, same as non-relativistic. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the correct method: using conservation of energy and momentum to find the velocities, and compute the kinetic energies.

Alternatively, perhaps using the invariant quantity.

The total energy squared minus (momentum c) squared is invariant.

So for the initial state, E_initial=300 GeV, p_initial=0.

So invariant s= (300 GeV )^2.

After fission, the invariant is (E1 + E2 )^2 - (p1 c + p2 c )^2.

But p1 and p2 are opposite, so p1 c - p2 c = 2 p1 c.

But wait, no: p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2=gamma2 m2 v2.

But since p1 = -p2, their sum is zero. So (E1 + E2 )^2 - (0)^2 = (300 GeV )^2.

So we have E1 + E2 =300 GeV.

Which we already used.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The problem says that the correct T1 is higher or lower than the non-relativistic value.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is smaller than in the relativistic case. Because in non-relativistic, KE is (1/2)mv², but relativistic KE is (gamma-1) mc². Since in relativistic cases, for the same momentum, higher velocities lead to higher KE.

Wait, but in our case, the relativistic approach gave K1=1 GeV, same as non-relativistic. So perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I got the masses wrong. Let me recheck.

The problem states that the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2=0.99 M.

And m1=2 m2.

So m1= (2/3)*0.99 M=0.66 M,

m2=0.33 M.

But M is the initial rest mass, which is 300 GeV/c².

So m1 c²=0.66 *300=198 GeV,

m2 c²=0.33*300=99 GeV.

So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the initial setup of the equations. Let me think again.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

In non-relativistic, it's (1/2)m v².

But in the non-relativistic case, the velocities are v1 and v2, related by m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the velocities are not as high as in the relativistic case, so perhaps the non-relativistic approach underestimates the kinetic energy.

Wait, but in our calculation, the non-relativistic approach gives the same KE.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another approach: compute the velocities using relativistic equations.

We have p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2,

and p1 = -p2.

So gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

But since m1=2 m2,

gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = - gamma2 v2.

But velocities are in opposite directions, so v2 = - (2 gamma1 v1)/(gamma2).

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m c², and the momentum is gamma m v.

So for each fragment,

p = gamma m v → v = p/(gamma m).

So KE = (gamma -1) m c².

But without knowing p, this is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of velocities.

But perhaps it's better to consider that in the non-relativistic case, the KE is (1/2 m v² ), and in the relativistic case, the same KE would require a higher momentum, but in our case, the non-relativistic and relativistic KEs are the same.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the mistake here. Given that both approaches give the same T1, the difference should be zero. But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, the initial nucleus is at rest, so when it splits, the two fragments move with velocities such that their momenta cancel.

In the non-relativistic case, the calculation gave K1=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, K1=1 GeV.

So the difference is zero. But the options don't have zero. So perhaps the correct answer is A) 2 MeV, but I'm not seeing where the error in my calculation is.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the difference in the kinetic energies more accurately.

Wait, earlier I found gamma1=1.00505, so K1=(gamma1 -1)*198 GeV.

gamma1-1=0.00505.

0.00505 *198=1.0049 GeV=1004.9 MeV.

In non-relativistic, K1=1000 MeV.

So the difference is 1004.9-1000=4.9 MeV≈5 MeV. So the correct T1 is 5 MeV higher than the non-relativistic value.

So answer B)5 MeV.

Wait, that makes sense. Because in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is a bit higher than the non-relativistic calculation.

Wait, so perhaps I miscalculated earlier when I thought K1 was exactly 1 GeV. Because when gamma1 is 1.00505, K1 is 0.00505 * 198 GeV=1.0049 GeV=1004.9 MeV.

Ah, that's right. So the correct T1 is approximately 1005 MeV, and the non-relativistic is 1000 MeV. The difference is about 5 MeV.

So the correct answer is option B)5 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the energy and momentum conservation in both relativistic and non-relativistic approximations for the fission process.

### Problem Setup
- The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \).
- After fission, the nucleus splits into two fragments with rest masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \), where \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \). Since \( M = 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), we calculate:
  \[
  m_1 = 0.66M, \quad m_2 = 0.33M.
  \]
  Thus, \( m_1 c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m_2 c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \).

- The total energy of the system is conserved, and the initial rest energy of the nucleus is \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \). After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies and kinetic energies of the two fragments:
  \[
  E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV},
  \]
  where \( E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 \) and \( E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \). The total kinetic energy is:
  \[
  K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
  \]

### Relativistic Calculation
Using relativistic energy and momentum conservation:
1. Momentum conservation gives \( p_1 = p_2 \), where \( p = \gamma m v \).
2. Energy conservation gives:
   \[
   \gamma_1 m_1 + \gamma_2 m_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
   Substituting \( m_1 = 2m_2 \), we solve for \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \). The result is:
   \[
   \gamma_1 \approx 1.00505, \quad \gamma_2 \approx 1.0202.
   \]
3. The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:
   \[
   K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1 c^2 = (1.00505 - 1) \cdot 198 \, \text{GeV} \approx 1.005 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

### Non-Relativistic Approximation
In the non-relativistic case:
1. Momentum conservation gives \( m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2 \), and \( v_2 = 2v_1 \).
2. Energy conservation gives:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 v_2^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]
   Substituting \( m_1 = 2m_2 \) and \( v_2 = 2v_1 \), we solve for \( v_1 \) and find:
   \[
   K_1 = \frac{1}{2}m_1 v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
   \]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)
The relativistic \( K_1 \) is approximately \( 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \), while the non-relativistic \( K_1 \) is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:
\[
\Delta K_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct \( T_1 \) and the non-relativistic \( T_1 \) is **5 MeV**.
