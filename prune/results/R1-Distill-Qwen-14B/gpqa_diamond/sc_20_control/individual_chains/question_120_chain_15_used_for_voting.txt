Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are from A to D, each involving a different power of 1/plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance. That means as plx increases, the distance decreases because the star is closer.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So we're looking at how density changes with plx. But the stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their actual number density in space is uniform. Uniformly distributed usually implies that the number per unit volume is constant.

So let's think in terms of volumes and distances. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. But when we observe them, their distribution in terms of parallax depends on how distances translate to parallax.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx. What's the corresponding range in distance? Since d = 1/plx, then a small change in plx would translate into a change in d. Let me compute that.

The distance d is 1/plx. So the derivative of d with respect to plx is dd/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So a small change in plx, dplx, leads to a change in d of approximately dd = - (1/(plx)^2) * dplx. But since d decreases as plx increases, I think I need to take the absolute value here. So the change in distance is about (dplx)/(plx²).

Wait, but when plx increases, the star is closer. So for a given volume around us, the number of stars would depend on the actual volume in space that corresponds to a range in plx.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about how the volume element changes with distance. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd multiplied by the number density n (since it's uniform). But the number per unit parallax range would involve how much dd corresponds to a given dplx.

Wait, let me approach this step by step.

First, the number of stars in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dd is 4πd² dd multiplied by the number density (n). But since the distribution is uniform in space, n is a constant.

But the parallax is plx = 1/d. So for a small change in plx, dplx, the corresponding change in d is dd. Let's express dd in terms of dplx.

We have d = 1/plx, so taking the derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're considering the magnitude, we can ignore the negative sign, so dd ≈ dplx/(plx²).

But wait, plx is inversely proportional to d. So plx = 1/d, so plx² is 1/d².

So, substituting, dd ≈ dplx * d².

Wait, no, let's do it carefully. Let me write plx as p.

p = 1/d ⇒ d = 1/p.

Then, dd/dp = -1/p² ⇒ dd = -(1/p²) dp. So the absolute change in d is |dd| = (dp)/(p²).

Wait, but when p increases by dp, d decreases by (dp)/(p²). So for a given dp, the corresponding volume element in space is the volume of a thin shell around us with radius d and thickness dd.

The volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. So substituting dd:

Volume = 4π d² * (dp / p²) = 4π (1/p²) (1/p^2) )? Wait, no. Wait, d is 1/p. So d squared is 1/p². So Volume = 4π (1/p²) * (dp / p²) ) = 4π dp / p^4.

Wait, wait, let me compute it again.

d = 1/p ⇒ d² = (1/p)^2 = 1/p².

dd = dp/(p²).

So the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) (dp /p²) ) = 4π dp / p^4.

But the number of stars in this shell would be n (number density) multiplied by the volume, so number of stars N = n * (4π dp / p^4).

So the number per unit dp (dplx) is N = (4π n) * dp / p^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So per unit p, that would be N/(dp) = (4πn) / p^4.

Wait, but that seems to suggest that the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. But looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. But wait, is this correct?

Wait, let me think again. Because we're considering the number per unit p. So for each small change dp, the number of stars is N = n * (4π d² dd) = n * 4 π (1/p^2) (dp/p²) ) = 4 π n dp / p^4.

So to get the number per unit p (dp), we can divide by dp, giving N/(dp) = 4 π n / p^4.

So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. But wait the options are about number per unit range of plx, which would be the same as N/(dp), so option A is ~1/plx^4. But that's option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 1/p². Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Since the number density in space is uniform, the number of stars in a volume V is proportional to V. Let's think about the differential volume element in terms of parallax.

Parallax p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. The volume of a thin shell between d and d + dd is 4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of p, d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in this shell is n * 4 π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit p is (n *4 π) (1/p^4) per unit p. So the number per unit range of p (i.e., per dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So this would imply that the number of stars per unit parallax range decreases as 1/p^4.

But wait, the options are about "number of stars per unit range of parallax". So that's exactly what this is. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but why is the answer not 1/p^3? Because in three dimensions, perhaps the volume scales with p^3?

Wait, let's think in terms of distance. The number of stars in a sphere of radius d is proportional to d^3, since the volume is (4/3)π d^3. But here, we're considering a thin shell, so the volume is 4π d² dd. When expressed in terms of p, which is 1/d, so d = 1/p, then d² = 1/p² and dd = -dp/p². So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/p²) (dp/p²) ) = 4π dp / p^4. So the volume is proportional to 1/p^4.

Thus, the number of stars in this volume is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number per unit p is 1/p^4.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think of it another way. Imagine that in space, the number of stars is the same in each volume element. So if I pick a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the number of stars is n * 4π d² dd. But since d=1/p, and dd= - dp/p², the number of stars becomes n *4π (1/p^2) (dp/p^2) )= n *4π dp / p^4.

So the number per unit p is (n *4π) / p^4. Therefore, the number decreases with p^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~1/p^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I've heard that the number of stars per unit distance increases as you go closer, but perhaps that's not the case here. Wait, higher p (lower d) would imply a higher number of stars, but according to the calculation, the number per unit p is 1/p^4, so higher p (lower d) would mean fewer stars per unit p. Wait, that doesn't make sense because closer stars should be more frequent.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Let's say I have two parallax ranges: dp around p=1 and dp around p=2.

At p=1, d=1 parsec. The volume for a shell at d=1 is 4π (1)^2 * (1/(1^2)) dp) =4π dp. So the number of stars is n*4π dp.

At p=2, d=0.5 parsec. The shell volume is 4π (0.5)^2 * (dp/(2^2)) )=4π *0.25 * (dp/4) = 4π * (0.25 * 0.25) dp = 4π * (1/16) dp.

So the number of stars at p=2 is n * (4π/16) dp = n π/4 dp. Whereas at p=1, it's n*4π dp. So at p=1 (a larger d), the number per unit p is much higher than at p=2 (smaller d).

Wait, but that would mean that closer stars (higher p) have fewer stars per unit p. But that's counterintuitive because there are more nearby stars. So perhaps I have a mistake in the approach.

Wait a minute, maybe I should consider that when you have a higher p (closer stars), the same volume in space corresponds to a larger range in p. So the number of stars per unit p would decrease as p increases.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider how the number of stars in a given range of parallax depends on the range. Let me think about a small range of parallax, dp.

The corresponding range in distance is from 1/(p+dp) to 1/p. So the distance range is between d and d - dd, where d=1/p and dd is a small change.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: the number of stars in a given volume is uniform. So the volume in terms of p is important.

The volume element in terms of p would be 4π (d)^2 (dd), and since d=1/p, dd = (1/p²) dp. So Volume = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp )= 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So N = n * Volume = n *4 π (1/p^4) dp.

To find the number per unit dp, divide by dp, giving N/dp = 4 π n / p^4.

So N per unit dp is 1/p^4. So as p increases, the number per unit dp decreases.

Which would mean that for a given range of p, you find fewer stars as p increases. So the number of stars per unit p is inversely proportional to p^4.

So the correct answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that there should be more stars at lower p (since more stars are nearby), but according to this, the number per unit p is higher for lower p.

Wait, let's check. For p=1, N per unit p is 1/1^4 =1.

For p=2, it's 1/16. So for a given dp (like 0.1), there are 16 times fewer stars in a 0.1 range at p=2 than at p=1.

But wait, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is proportional to d² dd. So when you move to a closer distance (higher p), the same dd in terms of p corresponds to a larger volume in space, meaning fewer stars per unit p.

Wait, no. Because when p increases, the same change in p (dp) corresponds to a larger change in d. So for a given change in p, the volume in space you're looking at is larger, meaning more stars in that volume. But the number per unit p (dp) would be higher if the volume increases with p, but according to our earlier calculation, the volume element decreases with p^4.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about how the number of stars in a given range of p changes. For example, if I have a dp range, how does the number of stars in that range vary with p.

Wait, let's try with concrete numbers. Suppose n is 1 star per cubic parsec.

At p=1 (d=1 pc):

Volume =4 π (1)^2 * (1/1^2) * dp =4 π dp.

So for dp=1, number of stars is 4 π *1 = ~12.566.

At p=2 (d=0.5 pc):

Volume =4 π (0.5)^2 * (1/(2^2)) * dp =4 π * 0.25 * 0.25 * dp =4 π * 0.0625 * dp = 0.25 π dp.

So for dp=1, number of stars is ~0.785.

So indeed, at p=1, the number per unit p is higher. So the number of stars per unit p decreases as p increases.

But wait, that seems to contradict the expectation that there are more stars closer (lower d, higher p). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, not the number per unit volume. So for a given range in p, how many stars are there?

In this case, as p increases, the same range in p (say, from p to p+dp) corresponds to a larger volume in space, but the number of stars per unit p is inversely proportional to p^4.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the number of stars per unit p is 1/p^4. So as p increases, the number of stars in each unit p decreases.

So the answer would be A) ~1/p^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of stars per unit distance increases as you get closer, but perhaps that's not the case when considering per unit parallax.

Another way: If stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a shell of radius d and thickness dd is proportional to d² dd. But since d=1/p, and dd= dp/(p²), the number per unit p is (d² * dd) = (1/p²) * (dp/p²) )= dp/p^4. So the number per dp is 1/p^4.

So I think the correct answer is A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Volume of a Thin Shell**:  
   The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), the volume becomes:  
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{dp}{p^2} = \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.
   \]

2. **Number of Stars in the Shell**:  
   The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, so it becomes:  
   \[
   N = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp,
   \]  
   where \( n \) is the constant number density of stars.

3. **Number of Stars Per Unit Range of Parallax**:  
   To find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( dp \)), we divide \( N \) by \( dp \):  
   \[
   \frac{N}{dp} = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{p^4}.
   \]  
   This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to \( p^4 \).

4. **Behavior with Increasing Parallax**:  
   As \( p \) increases (i.e., as stars are farther away), the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). This reflects the fact that closer stars (lower \( p \)) are more densely distributed in terms of parallax.

### Conclusion:
The number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with parallax as \( \sim \frac{1}{p^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
