Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it. Alright, the question is about the probability of an atom decaying over a certain time period, given that it hasn't decayed already for a while.

Hmm, let's read the problem again. So, we have an atom that has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So I remember that the decay process is memoryless, which means the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh wait, no, wait. Or is it that the probability is the same each moment?

Wait, no, the key thing I should recall is that the probability of decay is independent of the time elapsed so far. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay shouldn't affect the future probability, right?

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The decay probability is based on the half-life or the decay constant. So perhaps I should model this using the decay equation.

The decay constant λ is related to the half-life. The formula for the probability of decay over time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt). Oh wait, but wait, the problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, P(100) = 0.32.

So, let's write that down. P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). Let's solve for λ.

Rearranging: e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logs on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, let me compute that. What's ln(0.68)? Hmm, I remember that ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1, and ln(0.5) is about -0.693. 0.68 is a bit higher, so ln(0.68) is about -0.4005. So λ is approximately 0.4005 / 100 ≈ 0.004005 per minute.

Now, the question is, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed without decay.

Wait, but wait! The total time is 100 minutes, but 50 have passed. So the remaining time is 50 minutes until the 100-minute mark. Or wait, wait, no, the question is about the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, the initial 100 minutes is the time frame for the 32% probability. But in this case, 50 minutes have already passed, so the remaining time is 50 minutes. But wait, the question is about the next 150 minutes. Hmm, perhaps I misread.

Wait, problem states: We know the decay prob is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed. So we are to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Oh, so the next 150 minutes after the current time, which is 50 minutes into the initial 100-minute period.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the initial 100 minutes is the time frame, and the problem is considering that 50 minutes have passed, but the new time frame is 150 minutes from now.

Wait, perhaps the 100 minutes was the initial time frame, but the question is about an extension beyond that. But let me think through this.

Wait, the key point here is whether the 32% is the probability within the first 100 minutes, and now we’re looking beyond that, but considering that 50 minutes have already passed. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 minutes is a different scenario.

Wait, maybe I should model the decay probability using the decay equation. The probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So, the question says that P(100) = 0.32.

So, we have λ = (ln(1/(1 - 0.32)))/100. Let me compute that again. 1 - 0.32 is 0.68, so ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.47058) which is approximately 0.385. So λ = 0.385 / 100 ≈ 0.00385 per minute.

Wait, because we have P(t) = 1 - e^{-λ t}. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^{-100 λ} → e^{-100 λ} = 0.68 → -100 λ = ln(0.68) → λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

But ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.68) ≈ -0.4005, so λ ≈ 0.4005 / 100 ≈ 0.004005 per minute.

Now, the current situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So we're at time t = 50, and the atom hasn't decayed. We want the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, i.e., between t=50 and t=50+150=200 minutes.

Wait, but the initial 100-minute period was just a given to find λ, right? So perhaps the time frame is that the initial 100 minutes is the time given, but in the scenario, the atom is now at 50 minutes, and the question is about the next 150 minutes. So the relevant time is from t=50 to t=200, which is 150 minutes.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 minutes is the mean time, but I don't think that's the case. Let me think.

So, the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200 is P(200) - P(50).

Wait, because P(t) is the cumulative probability up to time t. So the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200 is P(200) - P(50).

But wait, we have to calculate that. Let's compute P(200) and P(50) using the λ we found.

Wait, but wait a second. Since we're given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability is what we need. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is equal to the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200, given it hasn't decayed up to t=50.

Wait, but in radioactive decay, the probability of decay is independent of the past. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if we started fresh at t=50, with the same decay constant. So the probability is P(150) - P(0), but wait, P(0) is zero, so it's just P(150) = 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Wait, but that's the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes from now. But wait, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, does that change anything? I think in radioactive decay, the probability is memoryless, so the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect the future probabilities. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute interval, regardless of past history.

Wait, so let me think again. The initial 100 minutes is just to find the decay constant. Once we have λ, the probability of decay in any subsequent time period is calculated using the same formula.

So, the problem reduces to finding the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the past. Because the decay process is memoryless, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability for the next 150 minutes.

Wait, but is that correct? Because the initial 50 minutes is part of the 100-minute period. So perhaps the way to think is that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period starting at the current time.

So, using the same λ, which is 0.004005 per minute, the probability for 150 minutes would be P(150) = 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

So, let's compute that. λ is approximately 0.004005 per minute.

150 * λ ≈ 0.60075.

e^{-0.60075} ≈ Let me compute that. e^-0.6 is about 0.5488, e^-0.60075 ≈ around 0.548.

So, 1 - 0.548 ≈ 0.452, which is about 45.2%.

Looking at the options: A is 44%, B 40%, C 52%, D 48%.

Hmm, 45.2% is closest to 44% or 48%. Wait, but perhaps my approximation is off. Let me compute more accurately.

Let me calculate λ more precisely. The initial calculation was λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100.

ln(1/0.68) = ln(1.470588235) ≈ 0.38566248.

So λ = 0.38566248 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566248 per minute.

Then, 150 * λ = 150 * 0.0038566248 ≈ 0.57849372.

Now, e^{-0.57849372} ≈ Let me compute this.

We know that e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065, e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488. 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6.

Let me use a calculator approximation.

We can write 0.5785 = 0.5 + 0.0785.

We can use the Taylor series expansion for e^{-x} around x=0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula ln(2) is about 0.6931, but perhaps just using a calculator function.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator: e^-0.5785 ≈ ?

Let me approximate it.

We can use e^-0.5 = 0.6065, e^-0.6 = 0.5488.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1, and the function decreases by about 0.6065 - 0.5488 = 0.0577 over 0.1 change in x.

So, 0.5785 is 0.0785 above 0.5. So, (0.0785 / 0.1) * 0.0577 ≈ 0.0453 decrease from 0.6065.

So, e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0453 ≈ 0.5612.

Wait, but wait, that's a rough approximation. Alternatively, perhaps using more precise methods.

Alternatively, I can use the formula that e^{-a} ≈ 1/(e^{a}).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to use an exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps using natural logarithm properties.

Alternatively, using a calculator, but I'll proceed with the approximation.

Wait, let's compute 0.5785.

Let me consider that the exponent is approximately 0.5785.

We can compute e^{-0.5785} ≈ ?

Well, let's think of it as e^{-0.57} * e^{-0.0085}.

We know e^{-0.57} is approximately e^{-0.57} ≈ Let me compute.

e^{-0.5} is ~0.6065.

e^{-0.57} = e^{-0.5} * e^{-0.07} ≈ 0.6065 * (1 - 0.07 + 0.07^2/2 - ... )

Wait, e^{-0.07} ≈ 1 - 0.07 + (0.07)^2/2 ≈ 1 - 0.07 + 0.00245 = 0.93245.

So e^{-0.57} ≈ 0.6065 * 0.93245 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.93245.

Let me compute that: 0.6 * 0.93245 = 0.55947, and 0.0065 * 0.93245 ≈ 0.00606, so total is approximately 0.55947 + 0.00606 ≈ 0.5655.

Then, e^{-0.0085} ≈ 1 - 0.0085 + (0.0085)^2/2 ≈ 0.9915 + 0.000036 ≈ 0.991536.

So e^{-0.5785} ≈ e^{-0.57} * e^{-0.0085} ≈ 0.5655 * 0.991536 ≈ 0.5655 * 0.9915.

Calculating that: 0.5655 * 0.99 is 0.5655 - 0.5655 * 0.01 = 0.5655 - 0.005655 = 0.559845.

Plus 0.5655 * 0.001536 ≈ 0.000870.

So total ≈ 0.559845 + 0.000870 ≈ 0.560715.

So e^{-0.5785} ≈ 0.5607.

So 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, which is approximately 43.93%, so around 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, the initial decay probability in 100 minutes was 32%, which gave us λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute. So 150 * λ = 0.5785, as I calculated.

So the probability is 1 - e^{-0.5785} ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, which is 43.93%, so approximately 44%, which matches option A.

But wait a moment. The question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. Does that affect the probability? Because the decay is memoryless, the probability for the next 150 minutes should be the same as if it were starting fresh, right?

Wait, another approach: The probability that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes is e^{-λ *50}. Then, the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes would be [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].

Wait, no, that's the conditional probability. Let me think. Since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before 50.

So, mathematically, it's [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].

But wait, since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval. So, conditional on not having decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability is just the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So, this would be the same as 1 - e^{-λ *150}, which is what I calculated earlier, approximately 44%.

So, the correct answer should be 44%, which is option A.

To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Substituting into the decay formula:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.4005 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.4005}{100} \approx 0.004005 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The problem asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \) and the time interval.

The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda \approx 0.004005 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 \approx 0.004005 \cdot 150 = 0.60075
\]

Now calculate \( e^{-0.60075} \). Using approximations:

\[
e^{-0.60075} \approx 0.548
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.548 = 0.452 \, \text{(or 45.2%)}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated probability of 45.2% is closest to 44%, which corresponds to option **A**.

### Final Answer:
The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it. Alright, the question is about the probability of an atom decaying over a certain time period, given that it hasn't decayed already for a while.

Wait, but wait! The total time is 100 minutes, but 50 have passed. So the remaining time is 50 minutes until the 100-minute mark. Or wait, wait, no, the question is about the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, the initial 100 minutes is the time frame for the 32% probability. But in this case, 50 minutes have already passed, so the remaining time is 50 minutes. But wait, the question is about the next 150 minutes. Hmm, perhaps I misread.

So, we have λ = (ln(1/(1 - 0.32)))/100. Let me compute that again. 1 - 0.32 is 0.68, so ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.47058) which is approximately 0.385. So λ = 0.385 / 100 ≈ 0.00385 per minute.

But ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.68) ≈ -0.4005, so λ ≈ 0.4005 / 100 ≈ 0.004005 per minute.

Now, the current situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So we're at time t = 50, and the atom hasn't decayed. We want the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, i.e., between t=50 and t=50+150=200 minutes.

Wait, but the initial 100-minute period was just a given to find λ, right? So perhaps the time frame is that the initial 100 minutes is the time given, but in the scenario, the atom is now at 50 minutes, and the question is about the next 150 minutes. So the relevant time is from t=50 to t=200, which is 150 minutes.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 minutes is the mean time, but I don't think that's the case. Let me think.

So, the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200 is P(200) - P(50).

Wait, because P(t) is the cumulative probability up to time t. So the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200 is P(200) - P(50).

But wait, we have to calculate that. Let's compute P(200) and P(50) using the λ we found.

Wait, but wait a second. Since we're given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability is what we need. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is equal to the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200, given it hasn't decayed up to t=50.

Wait, but in radioactive decay, the probability of decay is independent of the past. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as if we started fresh at t=50, with the same decay constant. So the probability is P(150) - P(0), but wait, P(0) is zero, so it's just P(150) = 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

Wait, but that's the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes from now. But wait, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, does that change anything? I think in radioactive decay, the probability is memoryless, so the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect the future probabilities. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute interval, regardless of past history.

Wait, so let me think again. The initial 100 minutes is just to find the decay constant. Once we have λ, the probability of decay in any subsequent time period is calculated using the same formula.

So, the problem reduces to finding the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, regardless of the past. Because the decay process is memoryless, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability for the next 150 minutes.

Wait, but is that correct? Because the initial 50 minutes is part of the 100-minute period. So perhaps the way to think is that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute period starting at the current time.

So, using the same λ, which is 0.004005 per minute, the probability for 150 minutes would be P(150) = 1 - e^{-λ *150}.

So, let's compute that. λ is approximately 0.004005 per minute.

150 * λ ≈ 0.60075.

e^{-0.60075} ≈ Let me compute that. e^-0.6 is about 0.5488, e^-0.60075 ≈ around 0.548.

So, 1 - 0.548 ≈ 0.452, which is about 45.2%.

Looking at the options: A is 44%, B 40%, C 52%, D 48%.

Hmm, 45.2% is closest to 44% or 48%. Wait, but perhaps my approximation is off. Let me compute more accurately.

Let me calculate λ more precisely. The initial calculation was λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100.

ln(1/0.68) = ln(1.470588235) ≈ 0.38566248.

So λ = 0.38566248 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566248 per minute.

Then, 150 * λ = 150 * 0.0038566248 ≈ 0.57849372.

Now, e^{-0.57849372} ≈ Let me compute this.

We know that e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065, e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488. 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6.

Let me use a calculator approximation.

We can write 0.5785 = 0.5 + 0.0785.

We can use the Taylor series expansion for e^{-x} around x=0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula ln(2) is about 0.6931, but perhaps just using a calculator function.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator: e^-0.5785 ≈ ?

Let me approximate it.

We can use e^-0.5 = 0.6065, e^-0.6 = 0.5488.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1, and the function decreases by about 0.6065 - 0.5488 = 0.0577 over 0.1 change in x.

So, 0.5785 is 0.0785 above 0.5. So, (0.0785 / 0.1) * 0.0577 ≈ 0.0453 decrease from 0.6065.

So, e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.0453 ≈ 0.5612.

Wait, but wait, that's a rough approximation. Alternatively, perhaps using more precise methods.

Alternatively, I can use the formula that e^{-a} ≈ 1/(e^{a}).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to use an exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps using natural logarithm properties.

Alternatively, using a calculator, but I'll proceed with the approximation.

Wait, let's compute 0.5785.

Let me consider that the exponent is approximately 0.5785.

We can compute e^{-0.5785} ≈ ?

Well, let's think of it as e^{-0.57} * e^{-0.0085}.

We know e^{-0.57} is approximately e^{-0.57} ≈ Let me compute.

e^{-0.5} is ~0.6065.

e^{-0.57} = e^{-0.5} * e^{-0.07} ≈ 0.6065 * (1 - 0.07 + 0.07^2/2 - ... )

Wait, e^{-0.07} ≈ 1 - 0.07 + (0.07)^2/2 ≈ 1 - 0.07 + 0.00245 = 0.93245.

So e^{-0.57} ≈ 0.6065 * 0.93245 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.93245.

Let me compute that: 0.6 * 0.93245 = 0.55947, and 0.0065 * 0.93245 ≈ 0.00606, so total is approximately 0.55947 + 0.00606 ≈ 0.5655.

Then, e^{-0.0085} ≈ 1 - 0.0085 + (0.0085)^2/2 ≈ 0.9915 + 0.000036 ≈ 0.991536.

So e^{-0.5785} ≈ e^{-0.57} * e^{-0.0085} ≈ 0.5655 * 0.991536 ≈ 0.5655 * 0.9915.

Calculating that: 0.5655 * 0.99 is 0.5655 - 0.5655 * 0.01 = 0.5655 - 0.005655 = 0.559845.

Plus 0.5655 * 0.001536 ≈ 0.000870.

So total ≈ 0.559845 + 0.000870 ≈ 0.560715.

So e^{-0.5785} ≈ 0.5607.

So 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, which is approximately 43.93%, so around 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, the initial decay probability in 100 minutes was 32%, which gave us λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute. So 150 * λ = 0.5785, as I calculated.

So the probability is 1 - e^{-0.5785} ≈ 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, which is 43.93%, so approximately 44%, which matches option A.

But wait a moment. The question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. Does that affect the probability? Because the decay is memoryless, the probability for the next 150 minutes should be the same as if it were starting fresh, right?

Wait, another approach: The probability that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes is e^{-λ *50}. Then, the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes would be [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].

Wait, no, that's the conditional probability. Let me think. Since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 is the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before 50.

So, mathematically, it's [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].

But wait, since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval. So, conditional on not having decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability is just the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. So, this would be the same as 1 - e^{-λ *150}, which is what I calculated earlier, approximately 44%.

So, the correct answer should be 44%, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
We are given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Substituting into the decay formula:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.4005 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.4005}{100} \approx 0.004005 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The problem asks for the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \) and the time interval.

The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda \approx 0.004005 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 \approx 0.004005 \cdot 150 = 0.60075
\]

Now calculate \( e^{-0.60075} \). Using approximations:

\[
e^{-0.60075} \approx 0.548
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.548 = 0.452 \, \text{(or 45.2%)}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated probability of 45.2% is closest to 44%, which corresponds to option **A**.

### Final Answer:
The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**.
