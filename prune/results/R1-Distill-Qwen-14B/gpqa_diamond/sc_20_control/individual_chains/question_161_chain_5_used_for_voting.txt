Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution TEM with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He's got vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment to improve the electron microscopy because fewer gas particles mean less electron scattering, right?

But despite the vacuum, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them. Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules in the vacuum state to be λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I think. Factors like pressure, temperature, and volume affect that. 

Then Mike starts the electron beam, and he notices something odd. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. The question is why. The temperature didn't change, so that's not it.

Wait, what affects the mean free path? Oh right, the main factors are pressure and temperature. But if the temperature is the same, then pressure must be the main variable here. But wait, the vacuum pumps are running, so pressure shouldn't change much, unless the electron beam somehow affects the pressure. Or maybe the beam interacts with the gas molecules in a way that changes their behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to ionize or something. If they become charged, they might interact differently with the walls or other particles. Or maybe the electrons cause the gas molecules to move more, but the temperature is the same, so that's not it.

Wait, in electron microscopy, when the electron beam hits the sample, it's moving at a high speed, and the electrons can interact with the sample. But in this case, the sample compartment has some gas. So the electrons are passing through the gas, right? So as the electrons pass through, the gas molecules might get excited or ionized.

Ionized gas molecules would have more charge, so they would exert a different influence on the electrons. But wait, how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves? Hmm.

Wait, mean free path is about the gas molecules colliding with each other or the walls. If the gas molecules are ionized, maybe they stick to the walls more, or maybe the electron beam provides some additional force, like an electric field. Oh, because the electron beam is negatively charged, maybe it creates an electric field in the sample compartment. If the gas molecules are ionized, they might experience a force due to this field.

Wait, but wouldn't that change the effective pressure? Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam somehow causes the gas to have a different behavior, like moving in such a way that the mean free path changes.

Alternatively, maybe the electrons cause the gas molecules to lose energy, leading to more frequent collisions. Or perhaps the electrons cause the gas to become a plasma, which would significantly change the mean free path.

Wait, but the question states that the temperature remained the same, so thermal effects aren't the main issue here. So it must be something else.

So, Mike's observation is that when the electron beam is on, the mean free path becomes λ2, which is different from λ1. Since the temperature is the same, what else could change the mean free path?

Hmm, the mean free path formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the mean collision diameter, and P is pressure. Wait, but if the pressure changes, that would change λ. So pressure must have changed.

But why would the pressure change? The pumps are running, and the compartment's volume is fixed. Oh, wait, when he turns on the electron beam, maybe the electrons cause the gas to heat, but the question says the temperature remained the same. So maybe some other effect.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, it might cause gas molecules to be ionized, and ionized molecules might be pumped out more efficiently. But that's about the overall pressure, not necessarily the mean free path. Alternatively, maybe the ionized molecules have different cross-sections for collisions.

Wait, if the gas molecules are ionized, their collision cross-section might change. Because when they're charged, they might interact more strongly, leading to more frequent collisions. That would decrease the mean free path.

So λ is inversely proportional to the collision cross-section (d squared). If ionization increases d, then λ would decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1. So λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but another angle: the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be more mobile. Wait, no, higher speed would mean longer mean free path, but higher speed would be due to higher temperature, which isn't the case here.

Wait, if the gas is ionized, then the mean free path might actually increase because charged particles might interact differently. Wait, no, that depends. If the ions are attracted to the walls, maybe they stick more, so they have shorter paths.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause some of the gas to be expelled, but that would lower the pressure, leading to a longer mean free path. Wait, but that would mean λ increases because pressure is lower (since λ is inversely proportional to pressure). But wait, the mean free path formula: λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2 P). So if P goes down, λ goes up. So if the pressure drops, mean free path increases.

But why would the pressure drop? Could the electron beam cause gas to be pumped out or somehow reduce the number of gas molecules?

But in the scenario, Mike is using vacuum pumps. Unless the electron beam somehow increases the pumping effect. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, the electron beam could be causing the gas molecules to become charged, making them more likely to be removed by the pumps. If the pumps are already working, and the gas is ionized, perhaps the pumps can remove them more effectively, thus lowering the pressure. Lower pressure means higher mean free path.

Wait, so if the pressure decreases when the beam is on, then λ = 1/(n P) type relation, so higher λ. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

But the question says that when the beam is on, λ changes to λ2. So which is it?

Hmm, I think I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

What's the mean free path? It's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The factors are pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules.

When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is ionized. Ionized gas (plasma) behaves differently. In a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the ions are moving in response to electric fields, which could affect their collision rates.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, the electrons in the beam might cause the gas ions to move, perhaps leading to a change in the effective pressure, but I'm not quite sure.

Wait, the initial calculation of λ1 was done under vacuum conditions, without the electron beam. When the beam is on, perhaps the gas becomes more dense in some regions, or perhaps the electron beam alters the distribution of the gas, or perhaps the ions are accelerated, leading to more frequent collisions.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules may undergo electron impact ionization. This would increase the number of ions in the compartment. But how does that affect the mean free path? Well, if there are more charged particles, maybe they interact more, leading to more collisions. That would decrease the mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

But wait, if the ionization increases the number of particles, the pressure would effectively increase (since more particles), which would decrease λ. Because λ is inversely proportional to pressure. So if ionization increases the number of gas particles, λ would decrease.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, each ionization event produces more charged particles, but the total number might not change if the ionization doesn't add more particles. Wait, no. Electron impact ionization can either create ions or neutral molecules, depending on the process. For example, in positive ionization, a molecule loses an electron and becomes positively charged. Alternatively, in negative ionization, it gains an electron. But regardless, the total number of gas particles (ions + neutrals) would stay the same. So pressure wouldn't change if the number of particles is the same.

Wait, but if the gas is neutral, the cross-section for collisions is based on neutral-neutral interactions. If the gas becomes ionized, the cross-section between ions (charged) would be different. But what's the effect on the mean free path?

The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(sqrt(2) * n * d), where n is the number density and d is the collision diameter. If the ionization changes d (i.e., the effective collision diameter), then λ would change.

Charged particles (ions) would have a larger effective diameter because their Coulomb repulsion makes them interact more strongly. So, d would be larger for ions than for neutral molecules. So the collision cross-section would be larger. If d increases, then λ decreases. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

So in that case, λ2 < λ1, which would correspond to option C.

Alternatively, another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are bombarded by high-energy electrons. This could lead to more frequent collisions between the gas molecules and the electrons. But wait, the mean free path of the gas molecules is about their collisions with each other, not with the electrons. So collisions with the electrons would be a different effect, perhaps scattering the electrons more, but not affecting the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, so the gas molecules' mean free path depends on their collisions with each other and the walls. If the electron beam doesn't change the gas pressure, then λ should stay the same. But in this problem, Mike's observation shows that λ changes.

So perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, and the ions stick to the walls. If they stick to the walls, they effectively leave the system, reducing the number of gas particles. So the number density n decreases, which would increase λ (since λ is inversely proportional to n). So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Wait, but this depends on whether the ionized gas is pumped away. If the pumps are removing the ions more efficiently, then the pressure would drop, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But in the initial setup, Mike had already created a high vacuum, so the pressure is very low. So the initial λ1 is already large. When the beam is on, if the pressure decreases (because more gas is pumped away due to ionization), λ would increase even more, so λ2 > λ1.

So in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1. But this contradicts the earlier conclusion that the collision diameter increases.

Hmm, which effect is dominant here? If the number density (n) decreases, λ increases. If the collision diameter (d) increases, λ decreases. So which effect is stronger?

In the problem statement, Mike's observation is that the mean free path is no longer λ1, so it's different. So either λ2 is larger or smaller.

The question is: what can we conclude about λ2?

The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1

Wait, the question says that Mike accurately determined λ1 based on factors like pressure, temperature, and volume. But when the electron beam is on, the mean free path is λ2, which is different.

So perhaps the electron beam causes gas to be removed. Because in ultra-high vacuum systems, electron beams can cause gas molecules to be ionized and then pumped out more effectively. So the pressure would decrease when the beam is on, leading to a longer mean free path.

So if the pressure decreases, n decreases, so λ = 1/(n * something) increases. So λ2 > λ1.

So that would mean λ2 is greater than λ1, but looking at the options, none of the options directly state λ2>λ1 except option A and D.

Option A says λ2 >=1.22 * λ1.

Wait, why 1.22? Because mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, and 1.22 might relate to some factor like sqrt(2) or something else.

Wait, the mean free path formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π d^2 P). So if other parameters are same, λ is inversely proportional to P. So if pressure changes, λ changes proportionally.

If the pressure in the compartment decreases when the beam is on, then λ increases. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

So if λ2 is larger, which options have λ2 > λ1?

Options A and D.

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

Option D: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1.

So, the question is, can we say whether λ2 is more than 1.22 times λ1 or just somewhere between λ1 and 1.22 times?

Hmm, without knowing the exact conditions, it's hard to say. Mike's observation is that it's no longer λ1. So the options are whether λ2 is greater or less than.

Wait, but the initial scenario is that the vacuum is ultra-high, so the mean free path λ1 is already very large. But when the electron beam is on, the pressure could drop further, making the mean free path even longer. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So among the options, which ones have λ2 > λ1?

Option A says λ2 >=1.22 λ1, which is a possibility. Option D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

But the question doesn't give us enough information to know if it's more than 1.22 or just a little higher. So perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct option would be either A or D.

Wait, but another approach. Perhaps the electron beam is introducing more energy into the system, causing the gas to heat up a bit. But the question says the temperature remained the same, so that shouldn't be a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to move faster, but again, same temperature would negate that.

Wait, another angle: the electron beam might increase the rate at which gas molecules are scattered by the walls, effectively changing their mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls because the beam provides some energy to them, but this seems a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionization caused by the beam leads to the gas molecules sticking to the walls more, effectively removing them from the compartment. So n decreases, λ increases.

So in this case, λ2 is larger than λ1. But how much larger?

In the absence of exact data, perhaps we can't say for certain whether λ2 is more than 1.22 times λ1 or just slightly higher. So the options don't tell us which is which.

Wait, what's the default assumption when you're using an electron beam in a vacuum? Well, ultra-high vacuum systems can have their pressure affected by the presence of the beam because of the processes like ionization and desorption.

In such cases, the pressure can drop because the ionized particles are more easily removed by the pumps. So the pressure decreases, hence λ increases.

But is the increase enough to make λ2 more than 1.22 times λ1?

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path depends on the square root of the pressure. Let me recall the formula.

The mean free path is given by λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P). So P is pressure.

If the pressure decreases by a factor, say, x, then λ increases by the same factor x.

So if the initial pressure is P1, and when the beam is on, the pressure becomes P2 = P1 / x, then λ2 = x * λ1.

So if x is greater than 1, λ2 is larger.

But without knowing the value of x, the exact factor isn't known.

But the question asks what can we conclude about λ2.

Wait, in the initial state, Mike determined λ1. Then when the beam is on, he found λ2.

If the pressure decreases when the beam is on (due to more efficient pumping of ionized gas), then λ2 would be greater than λ1.

So, the only options that have λ2 > λ1 are A and D.

The question is about whether λ2 is at least 1.22 times λ1 or just between λ1 and 1.22 times.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam leads to a decrease in the mean free path because the electrons are causing the gas molecules to be more scattered, leading to more collisions.

Wait, maybe the electron beam itself scatters the gas molecules more, which could affect the mean free path. But wait, the mean free path is about gas-gas or gas-wall collisions, not gas-electron. So the electron beam might not directly affect the mean free path, unless it affects the movement or density of the gas.

Wait, perhaps the electrons are causing the gas to heat, but the question says the temperature is the same. So that's not it.

Another thought: in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules might have a higher rate of collisions with the electrons than with each other. But that doesn't change their own mean free path. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls. If that's the case, the mean free path would decrease because the molecules are hitting the walls more often.

But why would the beam cause that? Hmm, perhaps the electrons in the beam are providing energy to the gas molecules, making them move faster, thus increasing the collision rate. But again, same temperature, so that's not it.

Wait, another approach: The mean free path in the initial state is λ1. When the beam is on, the gas is ionized, which might lead to a different collision mechanism. For example, charged particles have shorter mean free paths because they can stick to the walls or other charged particles.

So if the gas becomes ionized, the effective cross-section increases, leading to more collisions and a shorter mean free path. So λ2 is less than λ1.

But earlier I thought that if the number density decreases, λ would increase. But if the ionization doesn't change the number density, but only the cross-section, then λ decreases.

But wait, if the ionization causes some gas molecules to stick to the walls (and thus leave the system), the number density n would decrease, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be larger.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible answers.

If the conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1, the answer is C.

Alternatively, if λ2 is greater than λ1, the options are A or D.

In the scenario, when the beam is on, the mean free path changes. Since the initial setup had some gas, and the vacuum is as good as possible, perhaps the presence of the beam causes the gas to be removed more quickly, decreasing the pressure and increasing the mean free path.

If that's the case, λ2 would be larger than λ1, so options A or D.

But what does the mean free path depend on? Let me consider the formula again.

λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P)

If the pressure P decreases, λ increases. So if P2 < P1, then λ2 > λ1.

So, if the presence of the electron beam causes P to decrease, then λ2 is larger.

But why would the pressure decrease? Because the beam is causing the gas to be pumped more effectively, or because the gas is being ionized and thus removed.

Assuming that, yes, the pressure drops, then λ2 > λ1.

So which of the options matches this?

The options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, indicating a discrepancy

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1

So, either A or D.

But the question says that Mike's observation is that the mean free path is no longer equal to λ1. So λ2 could be larger or smaller, but in our analysis, it could be larger.

But without knowing the exact factor by which pressure changes, we can't say for certain if it's more than 1.22 times or just a bit higher.

Wait, 1.22 is approximately sqrt(5/2) or something? Not sure. Alternatively, 1.22 is about sqrt(1.5), but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the factor due to the ionization cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the mean free path would decrease because the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls or each other, thus reducing the mean free path. So λ2 < λ1, which would correspond to option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas is subjected to a high electric field. This might cause the gas to ionize, and the ionized particles might have different behavior, such as moving towards the walls, effectively reducing their mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam introduces more energy into the gas, causing it to expand or something. But same temperature, so same kinetic energy.

I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure of the exact physical mechanism.

Wait, another approach: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being bombarded by high-energy electrons. This could lead to more frequent collisions between gas molecules, or perhaps more scattering events that cause the gas to distribute differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam's presence leads to gas molecules being more likely to collide with the walls due to the added energy from the electrons. But temperature is constant, so maybe the collisions are more elastic or inelastic.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam increases the rate at which gas molecules are lost from the system, effectively reducing their number. So lower pressure, higher mean free path.

So, if the pressure decreases, λ increases.

But whether λ increases by more than 20% (to reach 1.22 times) is unclear.

In the absence of that information, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is different from λ1. But the options don't have that as an option. Wait, the question says it's no longer equal to λ1, so it's either higher or lower.

So, the options are C and (A or D), which suggest λ2 is lower or higher.

I'm going to have to make a best guess here. I think that the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, leading to a lower mean free path because the charged particles have a larger effective diameter, leading to more frequent collisions. So λ2 would be less than λ1, hence option C.

But another possibility is that the pressure decreases, leading to a higher mean free path. So which effect is stronger?

Wait, the initial setup had some gas particles, but the electron beam leads to their ionization, which may cause them to stick to the walls or be pumped away. If the number of gas particles decreases, pressure drops, so mean free path increases.

So, if the pressure drops, λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1, which would make the answer A or D.

But without knowing whether it's more than 1.22 or just a bit more, perhaps the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. But looking at the options, the only way λ2 is greater is in A and D.

But the question is which option fits the scenario.

Wait, another thought. The mean free path in a vacuum is given by the formula:

λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P)

But when the electron beam is on, the gas might be in a state where the mean free path is dominated by electron scattering, which could lead to a shorter path. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces a dynamic effect where the gas is more compressed or something, but I don't see how that would be.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to be more ionized, which makes the gas more conductive. But that doesn't directly affect the mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to expand, but that would require a change in temperature, which is not the case.

Hmm. I think I'm going to have to go with the conclusion that the mean free path decreases because the gas becomes ionized, leading to more frequent collisions. Therefore, λ2 < λ1, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system when an electron beam is introduced. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path as λ1 under vacuum conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2, and the task is to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**:  
   The mean free path is given by:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{k T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
   \]  
   where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is temperature, \(d\) is the collision diameter, and \(P\) is pressure. Since the temperature remains constant, changes in \(\lambda\) are due to changes in \(P\) or \(d\).

2. **Initial Setup**:  
   The system is under ultra-high vacuum (\(< 10^{-9}\) Torr), and some gas molecules remain. Mike calculates the mean free path as \(\lambda_1\), based on the pressure, temperature, and volume.

3. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:  
   When the electron beam is introduced, it can ionize the gas molecules. Ionization increases the effective collision diameter (\(d\)) due to Coulomb forces, leading to more frequent collisions between gas molecules. This would decrease the mean free path (\(\lambda\)).

4. **Pressure Considerations**:  
   While ionization could potentially alter the pressure, the question specifies that the temperature remains constant, and there is no explicit indication of a significant change in pressure. Thus, the primary factor affecting \(\lambda\) is the change in the collision diameter (\(d\)) due to ionization.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The ionization caused by the electron beam increases the effective collision diameter, leading to a decrease in the mean free path. Therefore, \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (\(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This implies an increase in the mean free path, which contradicts the analysis that ionization decreases \(\lambda\).  
- **Option B (\(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\))**: This suggests no change in the mean free path, which contradicts Mike's observation that \(\lambda\) changes.  
- **Option C (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\))**: This aligns with the analysis that ionization decreases the mean free path due to increased collision frequency.  
- **Option D (\(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\))**: This implies an increase in \(\lambda\), which is inconsistent with the scenario.

### Final Answer:
The correct conclusion is that \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\), making **Option C** the correct choice.

Answer: C
