Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this step by step.

So the question says there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think is transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that method affects the way we calculate their orbital periods. Maybe it doesn't, so I'll set that aside for now.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. Specifically, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by 1.4 times, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 2.3 times. Wait, but wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, right? Like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and albedo. Oh, and they all have the same albedo (0.3), so that should be a constant factor for all three. That might make calculations easier.

Also given are the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, which in turn is more massive than Planet3.

The question asks by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So I need to find Period3 / Period1.

I remember that Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the distance from the star and the mass of the star. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+M_planet)) ) * a³. But since the planets' masses are much smaller than the star, we can approximate M+M_planet ≈ M (the star's mass). So P² is proportional to a³/(M). But wait, in this case, the star's mass is the same for all three planets, so M cancels out when comparing planets.

Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't provide any information about the star's mass. Oh, but perhaps we don't need it because we're comparing ratios. So each planet's period depends on the cube root of a^3, so a^(3/2) over the square root of the star's mass. But since the star's mass is the same for all, it'll cancel when taking ratios.

But how do I get the distances from the star for each planet? Because equilibrium temperature is related to the distance, right? The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the planet's distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), L and σ are the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (1/D²)^(1/4), or D^(-1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). Or D ∝ 1/(T^2). Wait, let me think. Let's rearrange the formula.

Equilibrium temperature T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). Taking both sides to the 4th power: T^4 = (L (1 - a))/(16 π σ D²). So D² = (L (1 - a))/(16 π σ T^4). So D is proportional to (1/(T^2))^(1/2) = 1/(T). Wait, no, let's see: D^2 is proportional to 1/(T^4), so D is proportional to 1/(T^2). Because T is proportional to (D^(-1/2)), so D is proportional to (1/T^2).

Wait, let me make it more precise. Let's say T1 is the equilibrium temperature of Planet1. Then T1 = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D1²) ]^(1/4).

Similarly, for Planet2: T2 = [L (1 - a)/(16 π σ D2²)]^(1/4).

Dividing T1 by T2: T1/T2 = [ (D2²)/(D1²) ) ]^(1/4). So (T1/T2)^4 = (D2²/D1²). Taking square roots, (T1/T2)^2 = D2/D1. So D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, that would be because (T1/T2) = [ (D2² / D1² ) ]^0.25. So (T1/T2)^4 = D2²/D1². So D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2. Wait, maybe I have this backward? Let's see:

If D1 is the distance of Planet1, then T1 is proportional to (1/D1)^0.5. So T1 = k / D1^0.5, where k is a constant (including L, a, etc., which are same for all). So D1 = k / T1². Similarly, D2 = k / T2². So D2/D1 = (k/T2²)/(k/T1²) ) = (T1²)/(T2²) ) = (T1/T2)^2.

So the ratio of D2 to D1 is (T1/T2)^2. Wait, but the given ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4, right? Because the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1 is 1.4 times T2. So D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2 = D1 * (1.4)^2. 1.4 squared is 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Similarly, the temperature ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2 is 2.3 times T3. So D3 = D2 * (T2/T3)^2. Since T2 is 2.3 times T3, T2/T3 = 2.3. So D3 = D2 * (2.3)^2. 2.3 squared is 5.29. So D3 is 5.29 times D2.

Putting this together, since D2 is 1.96 D1, then D3 is 5.29 * 1.96 D1. Let me compute that: 5.29 * 1.96. Hmm, 5 * 2 is 10, 0.29*2 is 0.58, so 5.29 * 2 is 10.58. But wait, 1.96 is just under 2. So maybe 5.29 * 1.96 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

5.29 * 1.96:

Let me break it down: 5 * 1.96 = 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 = approx 0.5684. So total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So approximately 10.37.

So D3 ≈ 10.37 * D1.

Now, going back to Kepler's third law. The period P is proportional to sqrt(a^3/(M)), but since M is the same for all planets, P² is proportional to a³, so P is proportional to a^(3/2). Since a is the distance D, P ∝ D^(3/2).

So the ratio of Period3 to Period1 is (D3/D1)^(3/2). Since D3/D1 is 10.37, the ratio P3/P1 = (10.37)^(3/2).

Hmm, what's the cube of 10.37? Wait, 10.37^1.5 is the same as sqrt(10.37^3). Let me compute 10.37^3 first.

Wait, 10^3 is 1000. 10.37^3 = (10 + 0.37)^3. Let's compute that.

(10 + 0.37)^3 = 10^3 + 3*(10^2)*0.37 + 3*10*(0.37)^2 + (0.37)^3.

= 1000 + 3 *100 *0.37 + 3*10*(0.1369) + 0.050653.

So 1000 + 3*37=111, 3*10*0.1369=4.107, and 0.050653.

So 1000 + 111 = 1111, plus 4.107 = 1115.107, plus 0.050653 ≈ 1115.1576.

So 10.37^3 ≈ 1115.1576.

Wait, but that's not right. Wait, 10.37 is approximately 10.37, but 10.37^3 is 10.37 *10.37 *10.37. Let me compute 10.37 * 10.37 first.

10 *10 is 100, 10*.37 is 3.7, .37*10 is 3.7, 0.37*0.37 is 0.1369. So (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.

So (10 + 0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.37 + 0.37^2 = 100 + 7.4 + 0.1369 = 107.5369.

Then, multiply by 10.37 again:

107.5369 * 10.37.

Let me compute 100 *107.5369 = 10,753.69.

7 * 107.5369 = 752.7583.

0.37 * 107.5369 = approximately 107.5369 *0.3 = 32.261, 107.5369 *0.07 =7.527583. So total 39.788583.

Adding all together: 10,753.69 + 752.7583 = 11,506.4483, plus 39.788583= 11,546.2369.

Wait, that's 10.37^3 ≈ 1154.62369? No, wait, no, 10.37 cubed is 1154.62369? Wait, no, wait. Because 10^3 is 1000, and 10.37^3 would be a bit more than that, but 1154 is 10^3 * 1.154, which is about 15% more, which seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 10.37 * 10.37 *10.37 step by step.

Wait, 10.37 * 10.37 = 107.5369 as above.

Then, 107.5369 *10.37.

Breaking it down:

107.5369 *10 = 1075.369.

107.5369 *0.37 = ?

107.5369 *0.3 = 32.26107.

107.5369 *0.07 = 7.527583.

Adding those: 32.26107 +7.527583 =39.788653.

Total is 1075.369 +39.788653 = 1115.157653.

So 10.37^3 ≈ 1115.157653.

So sqrt(1115.157653) ? Because P3/P1 = (10.37)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.37^3) ≈ sqrt(1115.157653).

What's the square root of 1115? Let's see.

33^2 is 1089.

34^2 is 1156.

So sqrt(1115) is between 33 and 34. Let me compute 33.4^2: 33 *33=1089, 0.4^2=0.16, cross term 2*33*0.4=26.4. So (33.4)^2 = 33^2 + 2*33*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 1089 +26.4 +0.16= 1115.56. Oh, that's just a bit above 1115. So sqrt(1115.56)=33.4.

Our number is 1115.157653, which is a little less than 1115.56. So sqrt(1115.1576) is approximately 33.4 minus a tiny bit. Let's say about 33.38.

So P3/P1 ≈33.38. So the period of Planet3 is roughly 33.4 times longer than Planet1's period.

Wait, but wait, this is considering the distance ratios. But am I forgetting something else?

Wait, no, because we used Kepler's third law, which for a given star, the period is proportional to the distance to the 3/2 power. So that should be correct.

But wait, the problem gives us the mass ratios. Did I miss that part? Because earlier I thought I did, but the mass ratio might not directly affect the period if we are talking about the star's mass, but the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. But wait, the mass ratios given are between the planets, not the star.

Wait, the problem states: "the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35."

So Planet1's mass is 1.15 times Planet2's, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3's. So Planet1's mass is 1.15 * Planet2's. And Planet2 is 1.35 * Planet3's, so Planet1 is 1.15 * 1.35 * Planet3's mass. 1.15 *1.35 is approximately 1.5525. So Planet1 is about 1.55 times the mass of Planet3.

Wait, but how does this affect the period? Because in Kepler's law, the period depends on the orbit's parameters and the mass of the star. The planet's mass is negligible in the formula because the star's mass is much larger. So I think the mass ratios given don't directly affect the orbital period. So maybe I was right to ignore them in the calculation. So perhaps the mass data is a distractor, or maybe it's needed for another approach.

Wait, but why are the masses given then? Let me think again.

Hmm, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the mass ratios in some way. Maybe the TTV method, which relies on the gravitational interactions between the planets. TTV can give information about the masses because the planets tug on each other, causing variations in their orbits. So perhaps the masses influence the TTV signals, but in this problem, perhaps we don't need the masses because the question is about orbital periods, which are primarily determined by the distance and the star's mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the mass ratio to find the distance ratio. But I don't see an immediate connection because equilibrium temperature is based on distance and albedo, not on mass. So I think the mass ratios are extra information, perhaps to test if I get confused, but in this particular calculation, they don't affect the period. So I'll proceed as before.

So the period ratio is about 33.4 times. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I calculate the distance correctly?

Let me recap:

T1/T2 = 1.4 → D2 = (T1/T2)^2 * D1 → (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → D2 =1.96 D1.

T2/T3 =2.3 → D3 = (T2/T3)^2 * D2 → (2.3)^2=5.29 → D3=5.29 * D2 =5.29 *1.96 D1=10.3684 D1.

So D3/D1=10.3684.

P3/P1= (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^1.5.

Compute 10.3684^(3/2):

We can compute it as sqrt(10.3684^3).

10.3684^3 ≈ (10.37)^3≈1115.1576 as before.

So sqrt(1115.1576)= approx 33.38.

So P3/P1≈33.38, which is about 33.4. So option D is ~33.4, which would be the correct answer.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given data and apply Kepler's third law along with the relationship between equilibrium temperature and distance.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)

   The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star (\( T \propto 1 / \sqrt{D} \)). Thus, the distance ratio can be derived as:
   \[
   D_2 / D_1 = (T_1 / T_2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
   \]
   \[
   D_3 / D_2 = (T_2 / T_3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
   \]
   Combining these:
   \[
   D_3 / D_1 = D_3 / D_2 \cdot D_2 / D_1 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 = 10.37
   \]

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   The orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the distance \( D \) raised to the power of \( 3/2 \) (\( P \propto D^{3/2} \)). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \right)^{3/2} = (10.37)^{3/2}
   \]

3. **Calculating \( (10.37)^{3/2} \)**:
   - First, compute \( 10.37^3 \):
     \[
     10.37^3 \approx 1115.16
     \]
   - Then, take the square root:
     \[
     \sqrt{1115.16} \approx 33.4
     \]

### Final Result:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this step by step.

So the question says there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think is transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that method affects the way we calculate their orbital periods. Maybe it doesn't, so I'll set that aside for now.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. Specifically, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by 1.4 times, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 2.3 times. Wait, but wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, right? Like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and albedo. Oh, and they all have the same albedo (0.3), so that should be a constant factor for all three. That might make calculations easier.

Also given are the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, which in turn is more massive than Planet3.

The question asks by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So I need to find Period3 / Period1.

I remember that Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the distance from the star and the mass of the star. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+M_planet)) ) * a³. But since the planets' masses are much smaller than the star, we can approximate M+M_planet ≈ M (the star's mass). So P² is proportional to a³/(M). But wait, in this case, the star's mass is the same for all three planets, so M cancels out when comparing planets.

Wait, but wait, the problem doesn't provide any information about the star's mass. Oh, but perhaps we don't need it because we're comparing ratios. So each planet's period depends on the cube root of a^3, so a^(3/2) over the square root of the star's mass. But since the star's mass is the same for all, it'll cancel when taking ratios.

But how do I get the distances from the star for each planet? Because equilibrium temperature is related to the distance, right? The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the planet's distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), L and σ are the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (1/D²)^(1/4), or D^(-1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). Or D ∝ 1/(T^2). Wait, let me think. Let's rearrange the formula.

Equilibrium temperature T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). Taking both sides to the 4th power: T^4 = (L (1 - a))/(16 π σ D²). So D² = (L (1 - a))/(16 π σ T^4). So D is proportional to (1/(T^2))^(1/2) = 1/(T). Wait, no, let's see: D^2 is proportional to 1/(T^4), so D is proportional to 1/(T^2). Because T is proportional to (D^(-1/2)), so D is proportional to (1/T^2).

Wait, let me make it more precise. Let's say T1 is the equilibrium temperature of Planet1. Then T1 = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D1²) ]^(1/4).

Similarly, for Planet2: T2 = [L (1 - a)/(16 π σ D2²)]^(1/4).

Dividing T1 by T2: T1/T2 = [ (D2²)/(D1²) ) ]^(1/4). So (T1/T2)^4 = (D2²/D1²). Taking square roots, (T1/T2)^2 = D2/D1. So D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, that would be because (T1/T2) = [ (D2² / D1² ) ]^0.25. So (T1/T2)^4 = D2²/D1². So D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2. Wait, maybe I have this backward? Let's see:

If D1 is the distance of Planet1, then T1 is proportional to (1/D1)^0.5. So T1 = k / D1^0.5, where k is a constant (including L, a, etc., which are same for all). So D1 = k / T1². Similarly, D2 = k / T2². So D2/D1 = (k/T2²)/(k/T1²) ) = (T1²)/(T2²) ) = (T1/T2)^2.

So the ratio of D2 to D1 is (T1/T2)^2. Wait, but the given ratio is T1/T2 = 1.4, right? Because the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1 is 1.4 times T2. So D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2 = D1 * (1.4)^2. 1.4 squared is 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Similarly, the temperature ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2 is 2.3 times T3. So D3 = D2 * (T2/T3)^2. Since T2 is 2.3 times T3, T2/T3 = 2.3. So D3 = D2 * (2.3)^2. 2.3 squared is 5.29. So D3 is 5.29 times D2.

Putting this together, since D2 is 1.96 D1, then D3 is 5.29 * 1.96 D1. Let me compute that: 5.29 * 1.96. Hmm, 5 * 2 is 10, 0.29*2 is 0.58, so 5.29 * 2 is 10.58. But wait, 1.96 is just under 2. So maybe 5.29 * 1.96 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

5.29 * 1.96:

Let me break it down: 5 * 1.96 = 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 = approx 0.5684. So total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So approximately 10.37.

So D3 ≈ 10.37 * D1.

Now, going back to Kepler's third law. The period P is proportional to sqrt(a^3/(M)), but since M is the same for all planets, P² is proportional to a³, so P is proportional to a^(3/2). Since a is the distance D, P ∝ D^(3/2).

So the ratio of Period3 to Period1 is (D3/D1)^(3/2). Since D3/D1 is 10.37, the ratio P3/P1 = (10.37)^(3/2).

Hmm, what's the cube of 10.37? Wait, 10.37^1.5 is the same as sqrt(10.37^3). Let me compute 10.37^3 first.

Wait, 10^3 is 1000. 10.37^3 = (10 + 0.37)^3. Let's compute that.

(10 + 0.37)^3 = 10^3 + 3*(10^2)*0.37 + 3*10*(0.37)^2 + (0.37)^3.

= 1000 + 3 *100 *0.37 + 3*10*(0.1369) + 0.050653.

So 1000 + 3*37=111, 3*10*0.1369=4.107, and 0.050653.

So 1000 + 111 = 1111, plus 4.107 = 1115.107, plus 0.050653 ≈ 1115.1576.

So 10.37^3 ≈ 1115.1576.

Wait, but that's not right. Wait, 10.37 is approximately 10.37, but 10.37^3 is 10.37 *10.37 *10.37. Let me compute 10.37 * 10.37 first.

10 *10 is 100, 10*.37 is 3.7, .37*10 is 3.7, 0.37*0.37 is 0.1369. So (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.

So (10 + 0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.37 + 0.37^2 = 100 + 7.4 + 0.1369 = 107.5369.

Then, multiply by 10.37 again:

107.5369 * 10.37.

Let me compute 100 *107.5369 = 10,753.69.

7 * 107.5369 = 752.7583.

0.37 * 107.5369 = approximately 107.5369 *0.3 = 32.261, 107.5369 *0.07 =7.527583. So total 39.788583.

Adding all together: 10,753.69 + 752.7583 = 11,506.4483, plus 39.788583= 11,546.2369.

Wait, that's 10.37^3 ≈ 1154.62369? No, wait, no, 10.37 cubed is 1154.62369? Wait, no, wait. Because 10^3 is 1000, and 10.37^3 would be a bit more than that, but 1154 is 10^3 * 1.154, which is about 15% more, which seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute 10.37 * 10.37 *10.37 step by step.

Wait, 10.37 * 10.37 = 107.5369 as above.

Then, 107.5369 *10.37.

Breaking it down:

107.5369 *10 = 1075.369.

107.5369 *0.37 = ?

107.5369 *0.3 = 32.26107.

107.5369 *0.07 = 7.527583.

Adding those: 32.26107 +7.527583 =39.788653.

Total is 1075.369 +39.788653 = 1115.157653.

So 10.37^3 ≈ 1115.157653.

So sqrt(1115.157653) ? Because P3/P1 = (10.37)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.37^3) ≈ sqrt(1115.157653).

What's the square root of 1115? Let's see.

33^2 is 1089.

34^2 is 1156.

So sqrt(1115) is between 33 and 34. Let me compute 33.4^2: 33 *33=1089, 0.4^2=0.16, cross term 2*33*0.4=26.4. So (33.4)^2 = 33^2 + 2*33*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 1089 +26.4 +0.16= 1115.56. Oh, that's just a bit above 1115. So sqrt(1115.56)=33.4.

Our number is 1115.157653, which is a little less than 1115.56. So sqrt(1115.1576) is approximately 33.4 minus a tiny bit. Let's say about 33.38.

So P3/P1 ≈33.38. So the period of Planet3 is roughly 33.4 times longer than Planet1's period.

Wait, but wait, this is considering the distance ratios. But am I forgetting something else?

Wait, no, because we used Kepler's third law, which for a given star, the period is proportional to the distance to the 3/2 power. So that should be correct.

But wait, the problem gives us the mass ratios. Did I miss that part? Because earlier I thought I did, but the mass ratio might not directly affect the period if we are talking about the star's mass, but the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. But wait, the mass ratios given are between the planets, not the star.

Wait, the problem states: "the ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it is about 1.35."

So Planet1's mass is 1.15 times Planet2's, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3's. So Planet1's mass is 1.15 * Planet2's. And Planet2 is 1.35 * Planet3's, so Planet1 is 1.15 * 1.35 * Planet3's mass. 1.15 *1.35 is approximately 1.5525. So Planet1 is about 1.55 times the mass of Planet3.

Wait, but how does this affect the period? Because in Kepler's law, the period depends on the orbit's parameters and the mass of the star. The planet's mass is negligible in the formula because the star's mass is much larger. So I think the mass ratios given don't directly affect the orbital period. So maybe I was right to ignore them in the calculation. So perhaps the mass data is a distractor, or maybe it's needed for another approach.

Wait, but why are the masses given then? Let me think again.

Hmm, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the mass ratios in some way. Maybe the TTV method, which relies on the gravitational interactions between the planets. TTV can give information about the masses because the planets tug on each other, causing variations in their orbits. So perhaps the masses influence the TTV signals, but in this problem, perhaps we don't need the masses because the question is about orbital periods, which are primarily determined by the distance and the star's mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the mass ratio to find the distance ratio. But I don't see an immediate connection because equilibrium temperature is based on distance and albedo, not on mass. So I think the mass ratios are extra information, perhaps to test if I get confused, but in this particular calculation, they don't affect the period. So I'll proceed as before.

So the period ratio is about 33.4 times. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I calculate the distance correctly?

Let me recap:

T1/T2 = 1.4 → D2 = (T1/T2)^2 * D1 → (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → D2 =1.96 D1.

T2/T3 =2.3 → D3 = (T2/T3)^2 * D2 → (2.3)^2=5.29 → D3=5.29 * D2 =5.29 *1.96 D1=10.3684 D1.

So D3/D1=10.3684.

P3/P1= (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^1.5.

Compute 10.3684^(3/2):

We can compute it as sqrt(10.3684^3).

10.3684^3 ≈ (10.37)^3≈1115.1576 as before.

So sqrt(1115.1576)= approx 33.38.

So P3/P1≈33.38, which is about 33.4. So option D is ~33.4, which would be the correct answer.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given data and apply Kepler's third law along with the relationship between equilibrium temperature and distance.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)

   The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star (\( T \propto 1 / \sqrt{D} \)). Thus, the distance ratio can be derived as:
   \[
   D_2 / D_1 = (T_1 / T_2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
   \]
   \[
   D_3 / D_2 = (T_2 / T_3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
   \]
   Combining these:
   \[
   D_3 / D_1 = D_3 / D_2 \cdot D_2 / D_1 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 = 10.37
   \]

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   The orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the distance \( D \) raised to the power of \( 3/2 \) (\( P \propto D^{3/2} \)). Therefore, the ratio of the orbital periods is:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \right)^{3/2} = (10.37)^{3/2}
   \]

3. **Calculating \( (10.37)^{3/2} \)**:
   - First, compute \( 10.37^3 \):
     \[
     10.37^3 \approx 1115.16
     \]
   - Then, take the square root:
     \[
     \sqrt{1115.16} \approx 33.4
     \]

### Final Result:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
