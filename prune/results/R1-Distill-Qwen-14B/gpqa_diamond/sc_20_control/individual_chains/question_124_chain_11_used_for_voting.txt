Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. Hmm, so I need to find a higher Lorentz factor because the current one only gets a third, and we want two-thirds. So probably a higher gamma means the particles can go further, so more of them reach the detector walls.

Wait, so gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Ultra-relativistic means v is close to c, so gamma is large. But in this case, the initial gamma is 20, but only 1/3 reach the walls. So when we increase gamma, more particles should reach the walls because their lifetime is longer from the lab frame's perspective.

Wait, but the problem says the particles are fast-decaying. So their lifetime is proper time, tau. From the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the distance they can travel is v * gamma tau. Since v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic, let's say v ≈ c. Then the distance is approximately c * gamma tau.

The radius of the detector is 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the inner walls, the distance it travels must be equal to or less than the radius. Wait, no. Wait, the particles are produced at the center of the detector. So the maximum distance to the wall is 30 meters. So the particle must travel 30 meters before decaying.

So the lab frame sees the lifetime as gamma tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. Since v ≈ c, t ≈ 30 m / c. The proper lifetime is tau. So for the particle to reach the wall, we need t = gamma tau.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer: t = gamma tau. The particle will decay after time t. So the time it has to reach the wall is 30 m / c. So for the particle to reach the wall before decaying, the lab frame's lifetime must be longer than or equal to the time it takes to reach the wall. So gamma tau >= (30 m)/c.

Wait, but the particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance is 30 meters. So the time available for the particle to reach the wall is t_available = 30 m / c. The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So for the particle to reach the wall, gamma tau must be greater than or equal to t_available.

So gamma must be >= (30 m / c) / tau. But in the initial scenario, gamma is 20, and only one third of the particles reach the wall. So perhaps the initial gamma is such that gamma1 tau equals t_available. Wait, that can't be. Because if gamma tau is equal to t_available, then the particles would just reach the wall. But some of them might decay earlier, so the fraction that reaches the wall depends on the gamma.

Wait, maybe it's more about the probability. The decay is a Poisson process. The probability that a particle survives to reach the wall is exp(-t_available / tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma tau. So the survival probability P is exp(-t_available/(gamma tau)).

In the initial case, gamma is 20, and the survival probability is 1/3. So 1/3 = exp(- (30 m/c) / (20 tau)).

Wait, let me write that down. Let me denote t_available as the time it takes to reach the wall. So t_available = 30 m / c. Let me compute that value. I know that c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So 30 / 3e8 = 1e-7 seconds. So t_available is 1e-7 seconds.

So the initial condition is P = 1/3 = exp(- t_available / (gamma tau)). Gamma is 20, so 1/3 = exp( - (1e-7) / (20 tau) ). Then, to find tau, but perhaps I don't need to. Because in the second case, we need P = 2/3.

Wait, but the initial gamma is 20, and P is 1/3. So let's solve for tau.

Take natural log on both sides: ln(1/3) = - (1e-7) / (20 tau).

So ln(1/3) is -ln(3) ≈ -1.0986.

So -1.0986 = - (1e-7) / (20 tau).

Multiply both sides by -1: 1.0986 = (1e-7)/(20 tau).

Rearrange: tau = (1e-7) / (20 * 1.0986 )

Compute denominator: 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972.

So tau ≈ (1e-7) / 21.972 ≈ 4.55e-9 seconds. So the proper lifetime tau is about 4.55e-9 seconds.

Now, in the second case, we want P = 2/3. So 2/3 = exp( - t_available / (gamma_new tau) )

Take ln: ln(2/3) = - (1e-7) / (gamma_new tau )

ln(2/3) is about -0.4055.

So, -0.4055 = - (1e-7) / (gamma_new * 4.55e-9 )

Multiply both sides by -1: 0.4055 = (1e-7) / (gamma_new * 4.55e-9 )

Rearranging: gamma_new = (1e-7) / (4.55e-9 * 0.4055 )

Compute denominator: 4.55e-9 * 0.4055 ≈ (4.55 * 0.4055) e-9 ≈ 1.847e-9.

So gamma_new = 1e-7 / 1.847e-9 ≈ 54.1.

So the Lorentz factor gamma_new is approximately 54.1. Looking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, option C is 40, D is 28. So the closest is A)54.

Wait, but let me check my calculations more carefully.

Wait, in the first part, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp(- t_available/(gamma tau) )

Then, taking natural logs:

ln(1/3) = - t_available/(gamma tau)

So, ln(3) = t_available/(gamma tau)

So, gamma tau = t_available / ln(3)

Wait, no, let me correct that. Wait, ln(1/3) is negative. So:

ln(1/3) = - t_available/(gamma tau)

Which implies:

t_available/(gamma tau) = ln(3)

So,

gamma tau = t_available / ln(3)

So, gamma1 tau = t_available / ln(3)

In the first case, gamma1 is 20. So,

20 * tau = (1e-7) / ln(3)

So,

tau = (1e-7) / (20 * ln(3)) )

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

So,

tau ≈ 1e-7 / (20 * 1.0986 ) ≈ 1e-7 / 21.972 ≈ 4.55e-9 s.

Now, in the second case, the survival probability is 2/3.

So,

2/3 = exp( - t_available/(gamma_new tau) )

Take natural logs,

ln(2/3) = - t_available/(gamma_new tau)

Multiply both sides,

t_available/(gamma_new tau) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055

So,

gamma_new tau = t_available / 0.4055

But t_available is 1e-7 s.

So,

gamma_new tau = 1e-7 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.465e-7

But from the first case, gamma1 tau = 1e-7 / ln(3) ≈ 1e-7 /1.0986 ≈ 9.1e-8.

Wait, wait, another approach. Since gamma_new tau = t_available / ln(3/2).

Wait, gamma_new tau = (1e-7) / (0.4055) ≈ 2.465e-7.

But from the first case, gamma1 tau = (1e-7 ) / (1.0986) ≈ 9.1e-8.

So,

gamma_new tau = (1e-7)/(0.4055) = (1e-7) * (1/0.4055) ≈ 2.465e-7.

But since gamma1 tau = (1e-7)/(1.0986) ≈ 9.1e-8.

So,

gamma_new tau = (1e-7 ) / 0.4055 = (1e-7 ) * 2.465 ≈ 2.465e-7.

But since gamma1 tau is 9.1e-8, which is approximately 0.91e-7.

gamma_new tau = 2.465e-7 = (2.465 / 0.91) * gamma1 tau ≈ 2.708 * gamma1 tau.

So,

gamma_new = (2.708) * gamma1.

Gamma1 is 20, so 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16.

So gamma_new is approximately 54.16. So the answer is option A)54.

Wait, another way: since the probability is inversely related to gamma, because as gamma increases, t_available/(gamma tau) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, making the survival probability higher.

So when gamma increases, more particles survive to reach the wall.

So for the initial condition, 1/3 survive. We want 2/3 to survive. So the exponent goes from ln(1/3) to ln(2/3). So in the new case, the exponent is higher (less negative), so the denominator gamma tau must be larger.

We can set up the ratio.

From initial, gamma1 tau = t_available / ln(3).

In the new case, gamma2 tau = t_available / ln(3/2).

So gamma2 = gamma1 * [ ln(3) / ln(3/2) ) ]

Compute ln(3) ≈1.0986, ln(3/2)= ln(1.5)=0.4055.

So gamma2 = 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055 ) ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈54.16.

So the answer is 54, which is option A.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability of the particles and their Lorentz factor. The survival probability is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t_{\text{available}}}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where \(t_{\text{available}} = \frac{30}{c}\) is the time it takes for a particle to travel from the center of the detector to its inner walls, \(c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime of the particles. The Lorentz factor \(\gamma\) is related to the lifetime in the lab frame by \(\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \tau\).

### Step 1: Initial Condition
For the initial Lorentz factor \(\gamma_1 = 20\), the survival probability is \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}\). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t_{\text{available}}}{\gamma_1 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t_{\text{available}}}{\gamma_1 \tau}.
\]

Since \(\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\ln(3)\), we have:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{t_{\text{available}}}{\gamma_1 \tau}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\gamma_1 \tau = \frac{t_{\text{available}}}{\ln(3)}.
\]

Substituting \(t_{\text{available}} = \frac{30}{c} \approx 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}\) and \(\ln(3) \approx 1.0986\):

\[
\gamma_1 \tau = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{1.0986} \approx 9.1 \times 10^{-8}.
\]

### Step 2: Desired Condition
For the desired survival probability \(P_2 = \frac{2}{3}\), we use the survival probability formula again:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t_{\text{available}}}{\gamma_2 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t_{\text{available}}}{\gamma_2 \tau}.
\]

Since \(\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)\), we have:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{t_{\text{available}}}{\gamma_2 \tau}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\gamma_2 \tau = \frac{t_{\text{available}}}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

Substituting \(\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055\):

\[
\gamma_2 \tau = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{0.4055} \approx 2.465 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

### Step 3: Relating \(\gamma_1\) and \(\gamma_2\)
From the initial condition, \(\gamma_1 \tau = 9.1 \times 10^{-8}\). Using this, we can express \(\gamma_2\) as:

\[
\gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

Substituting \(\ln(3) \approx 1.0986\) and \(\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055\):

\[
\gamma_2 = 20 \cdot \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.708 \approx 54.16.
\]

### Final Answer
The required Lorentz factor is approximately \(54\), which corresponds to **Option A**.
