Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think through it. So the question is about the possible decay products of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The Lagrangian is provided, but I'm a bit rusty on that. Let me try to parse it.

The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this looks like a Yukawa coupling type interaction. The λ would be the coupling constant, and v is maybe the vacuum expectation value? Not sure, but the important part is that the boson X is interacting with fermions.

Wait, in the Yukawa interaction, a scalar (or boson) couples to fermions. The term would cause the boson to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So the decay X → ff̄ should be allowed if the fermion mass is less than X's mass.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the possible decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV, right? Because each fermion pair's invariant mass must be less than X's mass.

So I should list all the possible fermions that have a mass less than 3 GeV each. Because each fermion has mass m, so 2m must be less than 6 GeV, so m < 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused about the masses. Let me think about the known fermion masses. Let's list them:

Quarks:

- Up (u): about 2-5 MeV (so ~0.002 GeV)
- Down (d): similar, around 3-6 MeV
- Strange (s): ~95-100 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

Leptons:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV

So for each fermion pair, I need their combined mass to be less than 6 GeV. But wait, actually, each fermion in the pair would have a mass of m, so the threshold is 2m < m_X, which is 6 GeV. So m < 3 GeV.

So let's see which fermions have m < 3 GeV.

Quarks:

- u: 0.002 GeV → way below 3
- d: 0.006 GeV → way below
- s: ~0.095 → yes
- c: 1.5 → yes
- b: 4.5 → no, because 4.5 > 3
- t: no, way too heavy

Leptons:

- e: 0.0005 → yes
- μ: 0.105 → yes
- τ: 1.777 → yes

So possible fermion pairs would be from u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible decay channels are to pairs like b bbar, etc.

Wait, wait. If the mass of X is 6 GeV, then for a fermion pair like b bbar, each b has mass ~4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5 =9 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV. So decay into b bbar is not allowed. Because you can't produce a pair if the combined mass exceeds X's mass.

Same with top quark: way beyond. So the possible fermions are those with m < 3 GeV.

So possible pairs are:

uū, dđ, sī, cī, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

So the decay modes X → uū, dđ, sī, cī, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

But wait, the options don't have all of these. Let me look at the options.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, uū, dđ, τ+ τ-, e+ e−. Wait, but b is too heavy. So option A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B: c cbar, s sbar, uū, dđ, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e−. So this includes c, which is allowed because 2*1.5=3 <6. So yes, c cbar is allowed.

So option B includes c, which is correct. Let's see, the X mass is 6 GeV, so each c is 1.5 GeV, so 3 GeV total. So that's allowed.

But what about the tau? tau is about 1.77 GeV per particle. So 2*1.77=3.54 <6. So tau pairs are allowed.

Wait, what about the muon? 0.105 GeV, so 2*0.105 = 0.21 <6.

Similarly, the electron is negligible.

So the possible decay channels are into any fermion pair where each fermion has mass less than 3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are:

u, d, s, c, e, μ, τ.

Thus, the decay products would be:

uū, dđ, sī, cī, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

So looking at the options, the correct one should include all these except b, t, etc.

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Wait, but option D is X→b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is too heavy. So option D is incorrect because it includes b.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy, so that's not allowed. So C is incorrect.

So the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The decay X → c cbar would require that c's mass is less than 3 GeV. Charm is about 1.25 to 1.5 GeV, so yes, 2*1.5 is 3, which is less than 6, so allowed.

So why is option B correct? Let me see what each option includes.

Option A: includes b, so incorrect.
Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.
Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t. t is 173 GeV, so 2*173 >>6, so decay not allowed. So C is wrong.
Option D: includes b, so wrong.

Wait, but wait. What about the tau? Tau is ~1.77 GeV each, so 3.54 GeV total. 6 GeV is much larger than that, so decay into tau pairs is allowed.

So the correct decay channels are all the fermion pairs that have individual masses below 3 GeV. So the correct option is B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions, allowing decays into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f\bar{f} \)). For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the combined mass of the fermion pair must be less than the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f < m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
- **Quarks**:
  - \( u, d \): Masses are negligible (<< 3 GeV) — allowed.
  - \( s \): Mass \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \) — allowed.
  - \( c \): Mass \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) — allowed.
  - \( b \): Mass \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) — not allowed (since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
  - \( t \): Mass \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) — not allowed.

- **Leptons**:
  - \( e \): Mass \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) — allowed.
  - \( \mu \): Mass \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \) — allowed.
  - \( \tau \): Mass \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \) — allowed.

Thus, the allowed decay products are \( u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c}, e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct option is **B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay products of \( X \) at the lowest order.
