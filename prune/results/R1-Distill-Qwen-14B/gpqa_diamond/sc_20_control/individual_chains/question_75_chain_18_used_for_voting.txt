Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a genetics experiment where someone is trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein in mice. They modified the gene to include a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with the plasmid, but can't get the protein expressed as expected. They found a problem in the plus strand sequence of their construct.

Hmm, the options suggest possible issues like mutations, translation termination, proteolysis, or tRNA issues. I need to look at the sequence they provided to spot the issue.

Looking at the sequence, it starts with ATG, which is the start codon. That's good. Then I see the next codons. Wait, let me try to parse it. The first few codons translate to methionine, then tyrosine, histidine, etc. But what's important is whether the reading frame is correct and if there's a stop codon somewhere that's causing translation to stop early.

Wait, the sequence is given in the plus strand as a long mRNA-like sequence. But wait, waitâ€”hang on. Oh wait, no, wait. In the question, the construct was modified to add the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct would be in the plasmid as coding DNA, which would be the same as the mRNA except T instead of U.

But in the sequence provided, it's the plus strand of the construct, which I think is the coding (sense) strand. So the mRNA would be the same as this, but with T's replaced by U's.

But when looking for stop codons, we need to see if the reading frame has any early termination codons.

Wait, let's see. The sequence starts with ATG, which is Met. Then TAC is Tyr, then CCATACGATGTT... Wait, maybe it's better to split it into triplets to see the codons.

Starting from the ATG:

Wait, that's a lot. Maybe I should look for stop codons in the sequence. The possible stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA. Let me scan the sequence for these.

Looking through the sequence:

The sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, CCA, etc.

Looking for TAA: Let's see. Is there any TAA in there?

Hmm, looking through the sequence... Let's see. The original sequence is:

60. TGA (stop?) Oh wait, TGA is a stop codon. So at position 59-61, it's TGA.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the exact positions. Let me count:

Looking at the initial sequence, the entire string is 5'...3'. Let's count letters to see where TGA appears.

Looking through the sequence, I think I see TGA at a certain point. Let me find it.

Looking at the string: "...GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Hmm, looking for TGA. Let's see... I see 'TGA' in the middle.

Let me find it:

Looking at the part: ...TGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TGA. Let me see: I think after 'GGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAA', wait, maybe not. Let me look again.

Ah, here's TGA: 'TGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATG'. So the triplet at positions ...TGAA CGT..., which would be TGA followed by CGT.

Wait, that's in the middle. So the sequence is TGAAC. So the triplet is TGA, then next is CGT.

So in the coding sequence, that's a TGA codon, which is a stop. So at that point, the translation would terminate early, right?

So the presence of TGA as a stop codon in the middle would cause the ribosome to stop translation early, leading to a truncated protein. But in that case, why isn't the protein being expressed? Because the construct includes the HA tag, but perhaps the stop codon is before the HA tag.

Wait, wait a second. The HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the HA would be the first part of the protein. If the stop codon comes before, then the HA tag isn't even made, leading to no protein expression.

But wait, in the construct, the HA tag is added to the N-terminus of the GADD45G. So the sequence should start with HA coding, then GADD45G.

Wait, in the provided sequence, the start is ATG, then TAC. So the first codon is Met, then Tyrosine, etc. But if the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, perhaps the first part is the HA sequence, which should not include a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's coding sequence introduced an early stop codon. Let me think. The HA tag is a short peptide, so the DNA for it would be something like ATG for start, followed by the codons for the HA epitope.

But if in the construct, the HA adding process introduced a TGA in the wrong place, that could cause a premature stop.

Wait, but looking at the given sequence, the initial part is the HA tag? Or is this the GADD45G with HA added. Wait, the construct is GADD45G with HA at N-term. So the HA coding would be before the GADD45G coding.

Wait, perhaps the construct is HA followed by GADD45G. So the initial ATG would be the start of the HA, and then the HA sequence, then the GADD45G.

But in the given sequence, the first codon after ATG is TAC, which is Tyrosine. That's part of the HA tag. The HA tag is usually YPYDVPDYA. So the HA coding sequence would be ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT, etc.

Wait, wait, the HA tag is an epitope derived from the influenza HA. The HA tag is usually 11 amino acids, I think. So the DNA would be the start codon, followed by the codons for the HA epitope.

Looking at the provided sequence, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCg...

Wait, so the HA tag would be the first part. But if the HA has a stop codon within it, that's a problem. But wait, the HA tag shouldn't have a stop codon because it's just a short peptide. So in the HA coding DNA, the presence of a TGA would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein, perhaps not even producing the full HA tag, which would make the fusion protein not expressed properly.

Looking again, in the given sequence, the triplet TGA appears, which is a stop codon. So that could be the problem. The construct has an early stop codon, so the protein isn't produced beyond that point. Hence, the HA tag isn't expressed, and the GADD45G isn't either, leading to no overexpression.

Looking at the options, option B says "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That would align with this, as a stop codon in the middle would cause early termination.

Option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. But wait, mouse cells would have the machinery for all standard codons. UAA is a stop codon in mRNA, which would correspond to TAA in DNA on the coding strand. The construct's DNA has TGA, which is a stop codon, not TAA.

Wait, in the given sequence, the stop is TGA, which is a stop codon, so the mRNA would be UGA, which is a stop. So the presence of UGA in the mRNA would terminate translation.

So the issue is that the construct includes a TGA (stop codon) in the middle, causing early termination.

So looking at the options, option B is correct. The ribosome stops early because of a stop codon.

Wait, but why is the stop codon present? Did the cloning introduce it erroneously? Or is it part of the wild-type sequence?

Wait, the original GADD45G gene probably doesn't have an internal stop codon because it's a functional protein. So the HA tag addition may have introduced the stop codon. For example, perhaps the HA tag sequence included a TGA, which was not intended.

Wait, let's think about how the HA tag is added. The HA tag is a short peptide, so its DNA would be in frame with the GADD45G. If during the cloning, there was a mistake, such as an extra base, it could shift the reading frame and introduce a stop codon.

But in the provided sequence, the initial ATG is correct, and the codons proceed as expected until a TGA appears. So that's a problem.

So the presence of TGA in the coding sequence means the mRNA would have UGA, causing the ribosome to stop and release the nascent protein, making it not expressed properly.

So the reason for no overexpression is that the construct has a stop codon in the middle, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

So the correct answer is option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model fails to overexpress the GADD45G protein with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The provided DNA sequence of the construct is analyzed to determine the cause of the issue. The sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and includes the coding sequence for the HA tag followed by GADD45G. However, a key observation is the presence of the triplet **TGA** within the sequence, which is a stop codon. 

In the coding strand of DNA, **TGA** corresponds to the stop codon **UGA** in the mRNA. This stop codon appears prematurely in the sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early. As a result, the nascent protein is truncated, and the full-length GADD45G with the HA tag is not expressed. This explains why the protein overexpression was not observed.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: This is incorrect because the issue is not a mutation in the HA tag sequence but the presence of an unintended stop codon.
- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: This is correct because the **TGA** codon causes premature termination of translation, preventing full-length protein expression.
- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: This is incorrect because proteolysis typically occurs after the protein is fully synthesized, and there is no evidence of a linker sequence issue in the provided sequence.
- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This is incorrect because the issue is not related to the absence of a tRNA for UAA but the presence of the stop codon **TGA** in the construct.

The root cause of the problem is the premature stop codon (TGA) in the construct, which leads to early ribosome termination and prevents proper protein expression.

Answer: B

Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about a genetics experiment where someone is trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein in mice.

Looking at the initial sequence, the entire string is 5'...3'. Let's count letters to see where TGA appears.

Looking through the sequence, I think I see TGA at a certain point. Let me find it.

Hmm, looking for TGA. Let's see... I see 'TGA' in the middle.

Let me find it:

Looking at the part: ...TGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Looking for TGA. Let me see: I think after 'GGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAA', wait, maybe not. Let me look again.

Ah, here's TGA: 'TGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATG'. So the triplet at positions ...TGAA CGT..., which would be TGA followed by CGT.

Wait, that's in the middle. So the sequence is TGAAC. So the triplet is TGA, then next is CGT.

So in the coding sequence, that's a TGA codon, which is a stop. So at that point, the translation would terminate early, right?

So the presence of TGA as a stop codon in the middle would cause the ribosome to stop translation early, leading to a truncated protein. But in that case, why isn't the protein being expressed? Because the construct includes the HA tag, but perhaps the stop codon is before the HA tag.

Wait, wait a second. The HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the HA would be the first part of the protein. If the stop codon comes before, then the HA tag isn't even made, leading to no protein expression.

But wait, in the construct, the HA tag is added to the N-terminus of the GADD45G. So the sequence should start with HA coding, then GADD45G.

Wait, in the provided sequence, the start is ATG, then TAC. So the first codon is Met, then Tyrosine, etc. But if the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, perhaps the first part is the HA sequence, which should not include a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA tag's coding sequence introduced an early stop codon. Let me think. The HA tag is a short peptide, so the DNA for it would be something like ATG for start, followed by the codons for the HA epitope.

But if in the construct, the HA adding process introduced a TGA in the wrong place, that could cause a premature stop.

Wait, but looking at the given sequence, the initial part is the HA tag? Or is this the GADD45G with HA added. Wait, the construct is GADD45G with HA at N-term. So the HA coding would be before the GADD45G coding.

Wait, perhaps the construct is HA followed by GADD45G. So the initial ATG would be the start of the HA, and then the HA sequence, then the GADD45G.

But in the given sequence, the first codon after ATG is TAC, which is Tyrosine. That's part of the HA tag. The HA tag is usually YPYDVPDYA. So the HA coding sequence would be ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT, etc.

Wait, wait, the HA tag is an epitope derived from the influenza HA. The HA tag is usually 11 amino acids, I think. So the DNA would be the start codon, followed by the codons for the HA epitope.

Looking at the provided sequence, the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GCT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCg...

Wait, so the HA tag would be the first part. But if the HA has a stop codon within it, that's a problem. But wait, the HA tag shouldn't have a stop codon because it's just a short peptide. So in the HA coding DNA, the presence of a TGA would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein, perhaps not even producing the full HA tag, which would make the fusion protein not expressed properly.

Looking again, in the given sequence, the triplet TGA appears, which is a stop codon. So that could be the problem. The construct has an early stop codon, so the protein isn't produced beyond that point. Hence, the HA tag isn't expressed, and the GADD45G isn't either, leading to no overexpression.

Looking at the options, option B says "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That would align with this, as a stop codon in the middle would cause early termination.

Option D says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. But wait, mouse cells would have the machinery for all standard codons. UAA is a stop codon in mRNA, which would correspond to TAA in DNA on the coding strand. The construct's DNA has TGA, which is a stop codon, not TAA.

Wait, in the given sequence, the stop is TGA, which is a stop codon, so the mRNA would be UGA, which is a stop. So the presence of UGA in the mRNA would terminate translation.

So the issue is that the construct includes a TGA (stop codon) in the middle, causing early termination.

So looking at the options, option B is correct. The ribosome stops early because of a stop codon.

Wait, but why is the stop codon present? Did the cloning introduce it erroneously? Or is it part of the wild-type sequence?

Wait, the original GADD45G gene probably doesn't have an internal stop codon because it's a functional protein. So the HA tag addition may have introduced the stop codon. For example, perhaps the HA tag sequence included a TGA, which was not intended.

Wait, let's think about how the HA tag is added. The HA tag is a short peptide, so its DNA would be in frame with the GADD45G. If during the cloning, there was a mistake, such as an extra base, it could shift the reading frame and introduce a stop codon.

But in the provided sequence, the initial ATG is correct, and the codons proceed as expected until a TGA appears. So that's a problem.

So the presence of TGA in the coding sequence means the mRNA would have UGA, causing the ribosome to stop and release the nascent protein, making it not expressed properly.

So the reason for no overexpression is that the construct has a stop codon in the middle, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

So the correct answer is option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model fails to overexpress the GADD45G protein with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The provided DNA sequence of the construct is analyzed to determine the cause of the issue. The sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and includes the coding sequence for the HA tag followed by GADD45G. However, a key observation is the presence of the triplet **TGA** within the sequence, which is a stop codon. 

In the coding strand of DNA, **TGA** corresponds to the stop codon **UGA** in the mRNA. This stop codon appears prematurely in the sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early. As a result, the nascent protein is truncated, and the full-length GADD45G with the HA tag is not expressed. This explains why the protein overexpression was not observed.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: This is incorrect because the issue is not a mutation in the HA tag sequence but the presence of an unintended stop codon.
- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: This is correct because the **TGA** codon causes premature termination of translation, preventing full-length protein expression.
- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: This is incorrect because proteolysis typically occurs after the protein is fully synthesized, and there is no evidence of a linker sequence issue in the provided sequence.
- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This is incorrect because the issue is not related to the absence of a tRNA for UAA but the presence of the stop codon **TGA** in the construct.

The root cause of the problem is the premature stop codon (TGA) in the construct, which leads to early ribosome termination and prevents proper protein expression.
