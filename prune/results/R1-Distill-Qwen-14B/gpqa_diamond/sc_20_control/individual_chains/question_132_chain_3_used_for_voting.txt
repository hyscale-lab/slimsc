Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my aromatic NMR, but I'll think it through.

The question says we have a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm. The ratios for the aromatic signals are 1:1, and the aliphatic ones are 2:1:1.

Wait, wait, the aromatic part is two singlets, each integrating for one H each because it's a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, or maybe each singlet has an integral of 1? Because the two signals are each in 1:1 ratio. Or perhaps each of the two aromatic signals is a singlet, and each integrates to the same area, maybe one proton each. Because two singlets in the aromatic region could mean two different sets of equivalent protons, each integrating to one.

Wait, the problem says two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. So each of those two signals integrates to the same amount. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, perhaps each compound contributes one equivalent set of aromatic protons. So each aromatic compound has one set of equivalent protons that integrates to one. So each would have a single proton environment, which appears as a singlet. So each compound contributes one singlet in the aromatic region.

Wait, but wait. Maybe each has only one type of aromatic proton, each as a singlet. For example, if each compound is a para-substituted benzene, but with symmetry such that all H's are equivalent. Wait, para substitution doesn't make all H's equivalent unless it's a very symmetric substitution. Like 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene might have some symmetry. Let me think.

Wait, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is also known as 2,3,5,6-tetramethylbenzene, which is 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl, which is a symmetric structure. Let's draw that: the benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 2,3,5,6. That would make the ring symmetric across the 1-4 axis. So in such a structure, the aromatic protons would be at positions 4 and maybe 1? Wait, no, those positions are taken by the methyl groups. Wait, no, wait, if the substituents are at 2,3,5,6, then the only available positions are 1,4. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, positions are 1 through 6. If 2,3,5,6 are substituted, then positions 1 and 4 are open. So in that case, the protons at 1 and 4 would be equivalent due to the symmetry. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 1 and 4, each. But wait, that can't be because each substitution is at 2,3,5,6.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have methyl groups on positions 1,2,4,5. So that leaves positions 3 and 6 open. Now, in this structure, the ring has a plane of symmetry between positions 1 and 4. So the protons at positions 3 and 6 would be equivalent. Because position 3 and 6 are across the ring from each other, but with substituents in such a way that they are equivalent. So each of those would have the same environment. So in the NMR, those protons would show up as a singlet. So for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic protons would be at positions 3 and 6, but both equivalent, giving a singlet.

Wait, but that's only one set of aromatic H's. So that compound would give a single aromatic singlet. So if the mixture has two such compounds, each contributing a singlet, then the NMR would have two singlets in the aromatic region. Wait, but in the question, the aromatic signals are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet comes from a different compound.

Alternatively, each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, each, so two singlets in total.

Let me think about each option.

The options are:

A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, let's think about each compound's aromatic protons.

Starting with 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That's four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring at positions 1,2,3,4. So the substituents are in a row. The remaining positions are 5 and 6. So the H's would be at 5 and 6. But due to the symmetry, are they equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. Since substituents are at 1,2,3,4, the positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to substituents. Let's see: if the molecule is symmetric along the 1-4 axis, then the H at 5 and 6 may be equivalent. So the aromatic protons would be a singlet, each having one proton. So in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

What about 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene? That's substituents at 1,2,3,5. The remaining positions are 4 and 6. Are these H's equivalent? Let me see. The substituents are 1,2,3,5. So position 4 is next to 3 and 5. Position 6 is next to 1 and 5. Hmm, I don't think the H's at 4 and 6 are equivalent. So the aromatic H's would be two separate environments, each with one proton. So in NMR, two separate singlets? Or maybe as a doublet? Wait, but in the problem, each aromatic signal is a singlet. So perhaps this compound doesn't fit because it would have two sets of aromatic H's, each appearing as a singlet but with different chemical shifts. So in the NMR, we would see two singlets from this compound. But wait, the problem says the mixture has two singlets in the aromatic region. So each compound contributes one singlet.

Wait, but if one of the compounds in the mixture has two aromatic H's (as two separate singlets), and the other has one, then the total would be three. But the problem says there are two. So that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps each of the two compounds in the mixture has only one set of aromatic H's, each as a singlet. So each contributes one singlet. Then, in the NMR, the two would add up as two separate singlets, each in 1:1 ratio.

So let's check each compound:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5. Remaining H's at 3 and 6. Are they equivalent? Yes, because the structure is symmetric across the 1-4 axis. So H3 and H6 are equivalent. So this would give one singlet for the aromatic region.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. Remaining H's at 5 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me imagine: substituents are 1,2,3,4 in a row. So positions 5 and 6 are on either end. But wait, position 5 is adjacent to substituents 4 and (if any), but position 6 is adjacent to substituent 1. Hmm, perhaps they are not equivalent. Wait, no, maybe they are. Because the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center, so positions 5 and 6 are mirror images. So their H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

Wait, but if that's the case, then in the NMR, the aromatic region would have two singlets: one from each compound.

Similarly, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Remaining positions 4 and 6. Are those H's equivalent? Let me think about the symmetry. The substituents are at positions 1,2,3,5. So substituents are in a way that positions 4 and 6 are both adjacent to substituents. Let me see: position 4 is next to 3 and 5, and position 6 is next to 1 and 5. Are these environments equivalent? Probably not, because the substituents around them are different. So in this case, the aromatic H's would be two sets, each as a singlet. So for this compound, the aromatic H's would split into two signals, meaning if it's in the mixture, the aromatic region would have three signals (from each of the two compounds). But the problem states that there are two signals in the aromatic region. So any option where one of the compounds contributes two signals would be invalid.

Similarly, 1,4-diethylbenzene: substituents at 1 and 4. So the benzene ring has two ethyl groups in para positions. The remaining H's would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Are any of these equivalent? Well, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the 1-4 axis. So H2 and H6 are equivalent, and H3 and H5 are equivalent. So two sets of H's. Each set would be a pair. So how would that look in NMR? Each would be a singlet if the coupling is negligible. Or perhaps a doublet if they are coupled. Wait, but in a benzene ring, the coupling between adjacent H's can cause splitting. But in this case, each H is adjacent to two other H's, but symmetry might make the splitting into a doublet of doublets or something. Alternatively, if the substituents are such that the H's are equivalent, perhaps the coupling would be between equivalent H's, leading to a singlet. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. So in 1,4-diethylbenzene, the H's are in positions 2,3,5,6.

Let me think: positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, each being ortho to substituent 1 and meta to substituent 4. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, being meta to substituent 1 and ortho to substituent 4. So each pair (2&6, 3&5) would have the same chemical shift. So the NMR would show two singlets for the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 H's. But wait, the problem says the aromatic region has two singlets, each in a 1:1 ratio. So if each of the two compounds contributes one singlet, each integrating to one H, but in the NMR, each singlet is from both compounds. Wait, no, because the ratio is 1:1. Wait, perhaps each compound contributes one H in the aromatic region. So each contributes a singlet integrating to one H. But in the case of 1,4-diethylbenzene, perhaps it has two H's in the aromatic region, each in a symmetrical position but giving two singlets. So that would complicate the NMR, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's go back to the problem. The aromatic signals are two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. So each singlet has the same integration, implying each has one H. So each compound must have exactly one H in the aromatic region, each as a singlet. So the only way this can happen is if each compound has a single H in the aromatic region, which is equivalent to itself, hence a singlet.

Wait, that can't be because a benzene ring with four substituents can't have only one H. Wait, no, if four substituents are present, there are two H's. So perhaps each compound has two H's in the aromatic region that are equivalent, giving a singlet. So each compound contributes one singlet in the aromatic region, integrating to 2 H's. But the problem says the ratio is 1:1, which would mean that each singlet integrates to an equal amount. But in that case, each would have two H's, and the ratio between the two would be 1:1, so each singlet would be 2 H's. Hmm, but the problem says "two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio." So each singlet is of equal area. So if each compound contributes one singlet, each with 2 H's, then the ratio of the areas would be 1:1, which fits.

Wait, but then why would the aliphatic region show three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio? Because the aliphatic protons come from the substituents. So let's look at the aliphatic region. The three signals are singlets at around 2.2 ppm, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So, likely, these are CH3 groups attached to something. So 2.2 ppm is typical for CH3 groups attached to a benzene ring. For example, methyl groups as substituents.

So each compound's substituents would contribute to this.

In the case of the options, looking for two compounds that each have a certain number of methyl substituents.

Let's see:

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups. So each would contribute four CH3 groups. But wait, each CH3 is split into how many signals? Well, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. So the substituents are in positions 1,2,4,5. Are these methyl groups equivalent in any way? Let me visualize the structure. The substituents are at 1,2 (adjacent), 4,5 (also adjacent). Wait, that's like a 1,2,4,5 arrangement. So the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are across the ring from each other, and similarly, 2 and 5 are across. Hmm, so methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent due to symmetry, and similarly for 2 and 5. So that would give two types of methyl groups: two sets of two equivalent methyl groups. So in NMR, each would give a singlet. So for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, two types of methyl groups, each integrating to 2 H's. So the aliphatic region would have two signals, each a singlet, for that compound.

But wait, the problem states that the aliphatic region has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So three different CH3 groups.

Hmm, let's think again.

Looking at each option's substituents:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups. Let's see their symmetry. The substituents are 1,2,3,4, which are in a row. So the structure would have a plane of symmetry between 2 and 3. So the methyl groups at 1 and 4 would be equivalent. The methyl groups at 2 and 3 would be equivalent. So two types of methyl groups. So two singlets in the aliphatic region.

The other compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see its substituents. Positions 1,2,3,5. So the structure is such that substituents are at 1,2,3 (a row), and 5. Hmm, so is there any symmetry here? Let me imagine: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Position 4 is open, and position 6 is open. But the substituents don't seem symmetric. So the methyl groups at 1,2,3,5: Are any of them equivalent? The methyl at position 5 is adjacent to substituent 1 and 4. Wait, no, position 5 is next to 4 and 6. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it mentally. The substituents are 1,2,3,5. So position 4 is empty, position 6 is empty. The methyl groups at 1,2,3,5: Are 1 and 3 equivalent? No, because 1 is next to 2 and 6, while 3 is next to 2 and 4. Similarly, methyl at 5 is next to 4 and 6. So no symmetry here. Thus, each methyl group is in a unique environment. So four methyl groups, each as a singlet. Wait, but that's four singlets, which can't be because the aliphatic region has only three.

So option A would give two compounds, each contributing their own aliphatic signals. 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would contribute two signals (two singlets, 2 each?), and 1,2,3,5 would contribute four singlets, which is more than three. So the aliphatic region would have more than three signals, which doesn't match the problem. So option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups. As discussed earlier, this would have two types of methyl groups (equivalent pairs), giving two aliphatic signals.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups, which would have two types (equivalent pairs), giving two signals.

So in the aliphatic region, the mixture would have 2 (from first compound) + 2 (from second) = 4 signals? But the problem says three signals. So this can't be right. So option B is out.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups. As discussed earlier, this compound may have no symmetry, leading to four different methyl environments, each as a singlet. So four signals.

The other compound is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Each ethyl group has two CH2 and a CH3. Wait, but in this case, the substituents are ethyl groups at 1 and 4. So each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. The CH3 groups are at the end of the ethyl chains. So each ethyl group's CH3 would be in a unique environment. But wait, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry between 1 and 4, the ethyl groups are symmetrical. So the CH3 groups on each ethyl would be equivalent. So in the aliphatic region, the CH3 from each ethyl would be a singlet. But wait, each ethyl group would also have CH2 groups, but those are in the same environment, so their protons would be equivalent.

Wait, but the problem states that the aliphatic region has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So let's see: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups, which without symmetry would contribute four singlets. 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two equivalent CH3 groups (each ethyl's CH3 is equivalent), so that's one singlet. Additionally, the CH2 groups would be in a symmetric position, so their protons would be a singlet. So that's two more signals. So total would be four (from first compound) + two (from diethyl) = six signals. But the problem has only three. So option C is invalid.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Let's examine each compound.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5. As discussed, this has two types of methyl groups: two sets of two equivalent CH3. So two singlets in the aliphatic region, each integrating to 2 H's.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent? Let's think about their positions. 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Wait, but the substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the methyl groups at 1,2,3,5 are all in different environments. So each would be a separate singlet. So four singlets.

So in the mixture, the first compound contributes two aliphatic signals (each 2 H), and the second contributes four signals (each 1 H). So total aliphatic signals would be six, which doesn't match the problem's three. So this can't be right.

Wait, I must be missing something. Let me rethink the substituents.

Wait, perhaps in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, some methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry. Let me visualize the structure again. The substituents are at positions 1,2,3,5. So substituents are adjacent: 1-2-3, and 5 is next to 4 and 6. Hmmm. The molecule might not have any symmetry, so all four methyl groups would be in different environments, leading to four aliphatic signals.

But the problem states that the aliphatic region has three signals. So perhaps the correct compounds have substituents that lead to three types of CH3 groups in total.

Wait, perhaps each compound contributes one or two CH3 groups that combine into the three signals.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has only one type of CH3, and the other has two types. Let's think.

If one compound has two types of CH3 (two singlets), and the other has one type (one singlet), then the aliphatic region would have three signals: two from the first compound and one from the second. But wait, the ratio is 2:1:1. So perhaps the first compound contributes two signals, each integrating to 2 H's (so 2 and 2), and the second contributes one singlet integrating to 1 H. But that would give a ratio of 2:2:1, which isn't matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the first compound contributes one singlet with 2 H's, and the second contributes two singlets each with 1 H. But that would give a ratio of 2:1:1, which matches the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says the aliphatic signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So maybe one signal is for 2 H's and the others are each 1 H.

So perhaps one compound has two CH3 groups, each in the same environment (so one singlet with 2 H's), and the other compound has two different CH3 groups, each in their own environment (so two singlets, each 1 H). Then, in the mixture, the aliphatic region would have three signals: 2 H's, 1 H, and 1 H. So the ratio would be 2:1:1.

So which compounds fit this?

Looking back at the options, perhaps option D.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two types of CH3: two pairs, each pair as a singlet. So each pair would be 2 H's. So two aliphatic singlets, each 2 H's.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four CH3 groups, each in a unique environment. So four singlets, each 1 H.

But when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the aliphatic region would have 2 (from first compound) +4 (from second) = 6 signals. Which doesn't match the problem's 3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again about the aliphatic region.

The three signals at around 2.2 ppm, singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

This suggests that there are three different types of CH3 groups, with two of them integrating to 2 H's each (no, wait, the ratio is 2:1:1, so one signal is 2 H's, and the other two are 1 H each).

Wait, wait, the integrals are 2:1:1, so the total aliphatic H's would be 2 +1 +1 =4. But the molecular formula is C10H14 for each compound. Let's see: each compound has 10 carbons and 14 H's.

Each compound contributes 14 H's, but in the mixture, maybe only the aliphatic H's are being considered. Or perhaps some are in the aromatic region.

Wait, each compound is C10H14, which would have a degree of unsaturation of (10*2 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=4, which for benzene rings makes sense (one ring plus three double bonds? Wait, no: a benzene ring is three double bonds, so a single ring would account for 4 degrees (3 from the double bonds, 1 from the ring). So maybe each compound has one benzene ring. So each has six aromatic H's, but substituted with methyl groups.

Wait, maybe each compound has four substituents, each being a methyl group. So each substituent contributes three H's (CH3). So four substituents would be 12 H's. Plus the aromatic H's, which would be 2 H's (since four substituents on a benzene ring would leave two positions with H's). So 12 +2 =14 H's, which matches the formula.

Wait, but in that case, each substituent is a methyl group, so each substituent contributes a CH3. So for four substituents, four CH3 groups.

Wait, but in some cases, the substituents might have more than one CH3. Like ethyl groups. But the problem seems to involve methyl groups since the aliphatic signals are around 2.2 ppm, which is typical for CH3 attached to something (like benzene).

So, each compound has four CH3 groups. So four substituents, each a methyl group.

So, for the aliphatic region, each compound would have four CH3 groups. But the way they're arranged affects how many NMR signals they produce.

Looking back, the correct option must have two compounds, each with four CH3 groups, arranged in a way that in the mixture, the aliphatic region shows three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio.

So, let's think if any of the options fit.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5. The molecule is symmetric across the 1-4 axis. So the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent. So two types of CH3 groups. Each pair contributes a singlet. So two aliphatic signals, each integrating 2 H's.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Let's see their symmetry. Is there any symmetry that makes any methyl groups equivalent?

Wait, the substituents are 1,2,3,5. Let me think: position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Hmm, no obvious symmetry. So all four methyl groups are in different environments. So each would be a separate singlet. But wait, that's four signals, which when mixed with the two from the first compound, gives six signals, which doesn't match the problem.

So perhaps option D is incorrect.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two types of CH3 (each as a pair), so two signals, each 2 H's.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. The molecule has a plane of symmetry between 2 and 3. So the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So two types of CH3, each as a pair. So two signals, each 2 H's.

When mixed, the aliphatic region would have four signals (two from each compound), each integrating 2 H's. But the problem says three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, so this can't be.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possibility that one of the compounds has three CH3 groups and the other has two. But the molecular formula is C10H14, which for a benzene ring substituted with four methyl groups would fit (C6H5(CH3)4). So each substituent is a methyl, giving four CH3 groups per compound.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps one of the compounds has some CH3 groups that are equivalent. For example, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, there are two pairs of equivalent CH3 groups. So two signals in the aliphatic region, each integrating to 2 H's.

The other compound, let's say, has two CH3 groups that are equivalent and another two that are also equivalent. So two signals, each 2 H's. But that would give four signals in the aliphatic region, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the other compound has two pairs of equivalent CH3 groups, but when combined with the first, the pairs from the two compounds combine in a way that the total becomes three signals.

Wait, maybe one compound contributes two CH3 groups (each pair) and the other contributes one CH3 group and another. But no, that doesn't make sense because each contributes four CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some CH3 groups from the two compounds are equivalent, leading to fewer signals. For example, if both compounds have a CH3 group in the same environment, their signals would overlap, giving a single peak.

But that would require both compounds to have a CH3 group in the same position relative to the ring, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has a CH3 group that is equivalent to another from the other compound.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two pairs of CH3, each as a singlet (2 H's each).

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: four CH3 groups, perhaps two pairs. Wait, but earlier I thought there's no symmetry, but maybe I was wrong.

Wait, let me think again about 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. Is there any symmetry that makes any of the CH3 groups equivalent?

The substituents are 1,2,3,5. So substituents are at 1,2,3 (a row) and 5. Let me imagine the structure. Position 5 is adjacent to position 4 and 6. So substituents at 1,2,3,5.

Is there any symmetry here? Let me think: if I rotate the ring 120 degrees, do any substituents align? Probably not. Alternatively, is there a mirror plane that makes any substituents equivalent?

Wait, perhaps substituents at 1 and 5 are equivalent. Because position 1 and 5 are both adjacent to substituents at 2 and 4, but wait, substituent at 5 is a methyl group, and substituent at 1 is a methyl group. Let me think: position 1 is adjacent to substituents 2 and 6, but 6 isn't substituted. Position 5 is adjacent to substituent 4 (not substituted) and 6 (not substituted). Hmm, not seeing symmetry here.

Wait, perhaps substituents at 3 and 5 are not equivalent either. So each CH3 is unique. So four signals.

But then, when mixed with the other compound (which has two signals), the total would be six, which doesn't fit. So this option can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D, and I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another approach: the problem says the aromatic region has two singlets, each integrating to 1 H. So each compound must contribute one H in the aromatic region, each as a singlet. So each compound has only one H in the aromatic region. But that's impossible because a benzene ring with four substituents would have, at most, two H's (like para substitution), but in such a case, both H's are equivalent. So each would have two H's, but as a singlet.

Wait, perhaps each compound has two H's, but they are equivalent, so each gives a singlet. So each compound contributes one singlet for two H's. But the problem states that the aromatic signals are in a 1:1 ratio, meaning each singlet integrates to the same area. So if each has two H's, each singlet would integrate to 2 H's, and the ratio would be 2:2, not 1:1. That can't be.

Therefore, perhaps each compound contributes one H in the aromatic region, meaning each has only one H. But that's impossible because four substituents would leave two positions, each with a H. So each compound must have two H's in the aromatic region, each as a singlet.

Wait, but that leads me back to the earlier problem: two H's as a singlet per compound, meaning the aromatic region would have two singlets, each integrating to two H's. But the problem says the ratio is 1:1, implying each has the same area, which would require each to have the same number of H's. So maybe each has two H's, each as a singlet.

So the aromatic region would have two singlets, each integrating to two H's, so the ratio is 2:2, which isn't 1:1 as stated. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something about the aromatic region. Let's think again about the structure of each compound.

Wait, perhaps one of the compounds has two equivalent aromatic H's, giving a singlet, and the other has two equivalent aromatic H's as well, giving another singlet. So in the mixture, the aromatic region would have two singlets, each integrating to two H's. But the problem says the ratio is 1:1, which would mean each singlet has the same area, which they do since each has two H's. So the ratio would be 2:2, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound contributes one H in the aromatic region, leading to two singlets each integrating to one H, which fits a 1:1 ratio. But how?

Wait, a benzene ring with four substituents can't have just one H. There must be two H's, so that doesn't make sense.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic H's are at positions 3 and 6, which are equivalent, giving a singlet integrating to two H's.

In 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic H's are at positions 4 and 6. Wait, are they equivalent? Let me think. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the H's at 4 and 6. Are these equivalent? Let me imagine the structure.

Position 4 is next to substituent 3 and 5. Position 6 is next to substituent 1 and 5.

Wait, substituent 5 is next to positions 4 and 6. So H at 4 is adjacent to substituent 3 and 5. H at 6 is adjacent to substituent 1 and 5.

So their environments are not the same, meaning their chemical shifts would be different. So each would be a separate singlet. But that would mean that 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes two aromatic singlets, each integrating to one H. But the problem says the aromatic region has two signals in total, each a singlet. So option D can't be right because one compound would contribute two signals, leading to three in total.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should think about the aliphatic region again.

The aliphatic signals are three, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one compound contributes two types of CH3's (each as a singlet, 2 and 1 H's), and the other contributes one type (1 H's). So in the mixture, the aliphatic signals would be 2+1+1 =4 H's, but each compound has four CH3 groups. Wait, four CH3 groups would mean 12 H's in total for two compounds. But maybe the NMR is only showing some of them? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the aliphatic signals correspond to different types of CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps one compound has a CH3 group that's unique (1 H), and the other has two types: one with 2 H's and another with 1 H. So in the mixture, you'd have three signals: 2,1,1.

Let me see which option fits that.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (two types of CH3, each 2 H's), and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (four CH3 groups, each unique). But that gives four signals from the second compound, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the possibility that one of the substituents is not a methyl group but an ethyl or something else. But the molecular formula is C10H14, which would require substituents that sum up to four carbons beyond the benzene ring. So four methyl groups (each -CH3) would add four carbons, making the formula C10H14 (C6H5 + 4*CH3 = C10H14).

So substituents are methyl groups.

Wait, another possibility: maybe one of the compounds has some substituents that are not methyl. For example, option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would have ethyl groups. Let's look at option C.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: four CH3 groups, each in unique positions, leading to four aliphatic signals.

1,4-diethylbenzene: each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. The CH3 groups of the ethyls would be in equivalent environments due to the symmetry of the molecule. So their protons would be a singlet. The CH2 groups would also be equivalent, giving another singlet. So two aliphatic signals from this compound: one for the CH3 (2 H's) and one for the CH2 (4 H's, but as a singlet). Wait, no, each CH2 would have two H's, but since there are two ethyl groups, each contributing two H's, the CH2 would have a total of four H's as a singlet.

Wait, but the problem states that the aliphatic region has three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the CH3 from the ethyl groups would be a singlet integrating to 2 H's, and the CH2 groups would be a singlet integrating to 4 H's. But that would be two signals with integrals 2 and 4. Plus the four from the other compound, which doesn't fit.

So option C is out.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the correct answer as option D and see if it makes sense.

In option D, the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

For the aromatic region:

- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: H's at 3 and 6, which are equivalent, giving a singlet integrating to 2 H's.

- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: H's at 4 and 6. Are these equivalent? Let me think again. The substituents are 1,2,3,5.

Position 4 is adjacent to substituents 3 and 5. Position 6 is adjacent to substituent 1 and 5. So the environments are different, leading to two separate singlets, each integrating to 1 H. But the problem states that the aromatic region has two signals, so this can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the aromatic H's. Perhaps in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the H's at 4 and 6 are equivalent, giving a singlet.

When would that happen? Let's imagine the structure. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then positions 4 and 6 are adjacent to substituents 3 and 5, and 1 and 5, respectively. Are these positions mirror images across a plane? Perhaps if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, making H4 and H6 equivalent.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring has a plane of symmetry that makes H4 and H6 equivalent. For example, if the substituents are symmetric with respect to a certain axis.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that H4 and H6 are in equivalent positions. For example, if substituent 1 and 5 are in positions that mirror each other, then substituent 3 could mirror substituent 2, leading to H4 and H6 being equivalent.

I'm not sure, but perhaps in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, H4 and H6 are equivalent, giving a singlet.

If that's the case, then each compound would contribute one singlet in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 H's. So in the mixture, the aromatic region would have two singlets, each integrating to 2 H's. But the problem states the ratio is 1:1, meaning each has the same area. That fits, as each would have 2 H's in their respective signals.

Now, the aliphatic region:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has four CH3 groups, arranged symmetrically into two equivalent pairs. So two aliphatic signals, each integrating to 2 H's.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: if the substituents are arranged such that two of the CH3 groups are equivalent and the other two are also equivalent, then you have two aliphatic signals, each integrating to 2 H's.

Wait, but that would require the substituents to have some symmetry. For example, substituents at 1 and 5 could be equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 could be equivalent. So the CH3 groups at 1 and 5 would be equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 would be equivalent. So two aliphatic signals, each 2 H's.

When mixed, the aliphatic region would have:

- From the first compound: two signals (2 and 2 H's).

- From the second compound: two signals (2 and 2 H's).

But the problem states three signals: 2:1:1. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the second compound only has one type of CH3 group. How?

If in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, two of the substituents are equivalent, and the other two are equivalent as well. For example, substituents at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and substituents at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So two types of CH3 groups, each with two H's. So two aliphatic signals, each 2 H's.

So the aliphatic region would have:

- From first compound: two signals (2 and 2 H's).

- From second compound: two signals (2 and 2 H's).

But the problem states three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. So this doesn't fit either.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the two compounds have the same number of CH3 groups, but their arrangement leads to some CH3 groups being equivalent when mixed.

Wait, another thought: the three signals in the aliphatic region could be due to one compound having two CH3 groups that are each unique (so two signals) and the other compound having one CH3 group (so one signal). But that would require the second compound to have only one CH3 group, which can't be because it's a tetramethyl compound.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe one of the compounds has three CH3 groups and the other has one. But again, that doesn't fit the molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is option D, and I'm just not seeing why.

So, let's recap:

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Aromatic region:

- Each compound contributes one singlet in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2 H's. So two singlets, each 2 H's. The problem says the signals are in a 1:1 ratio, which would mean each has the same area, which fits.

Aliphatic region:

- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two types of CH3 groups, each as a singlet with 2 H's.

- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two types of CH3 groups, each as a singlet with 2 H's.

So in the mixture, the aliphatic region would have four signals: two from each compound, each 2 H's. But the problem says three signals with a 2:1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of signals. Another possibility: the substituents in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene may have some symmetry I'm not considering. For example, maybe the substituents at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent, leading to two types of CH3 groups in the aliphatic region. So two signals, each 2 H's.

So the aliphatic region from both compounds would have:

- From first compound: two signals (2 and 2 H's).

- From second compound: two signals (2 and 2 H's).

But the problem states three signals. So still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the substituents in the second compound is such that a CH3 group is in a unique environment, while others are equivalent.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a scenario where one of the substituents in the second compound is adjacent to two other substituents, making it equivalent to another.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the CH3 groups in the second compound is between two substituents, making it equivalent to another.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think the correct answer must be option D, as it's the only one where each compound contributes one aromatic singlet, fitting the two signals in the aromatic region. The aliphatic region may have three signals due to some symmetry I'm not seeing, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

So, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining which two aromatic compounds are present in a 1:1 mixture based on the given NMR data. The molecular formula for both compounds is C10H14, and the NMR spectrum shows two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm (2:1:1 ratio). The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Region**:  
   - The two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio indicate that each compound contributes one set of equivalent aromatic protons, integrating to one H each.  
   - This implies that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton environment, which must be symmetric.

2. **Aliphatic Region**:  
   - The three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest the presence of three distinct types of CH3 groups.  
   - One signal integrates to 2 H's, while the other two integrate to 1 H each.

3. **Molecular Formula (C10H14)**:  
   - Each compound is a benzene ring with four substituents, likely methyl groups (-CH3), as the aliphatic signals at ~2.2 ppm are characteristic of methyl groups attached to an aromatic ring.
