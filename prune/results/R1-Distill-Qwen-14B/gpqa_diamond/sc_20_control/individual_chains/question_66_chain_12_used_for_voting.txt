Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I've heard a bit about this before. Let me think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A) 1 and 2, B) 3 and 4, C) 1, 2,4, D)1,3,4.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible operators that can be constructed from the Standard Model fields, respecting certain symmetries. The idea is that any beyond the Standard Model physics can be encoded in these higher-dimensional operators.

So, which symmetries are built-in? Well, Lorentz symmetry is a big one, right? Because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT must respect that too. So operators must be Lorentz invariant. So that rules out any symmetry that depends on Lorentz symmetry being broken.

What about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The Standard Model and hence SMEFT must respect it. So operators should be Poincare invariant. So both Lorentz (1) and Poincare (2) are required. So that would mean the operators must respect both, so options A, C, or maybe another.

Wait, but wait. Because Poincare includes translations, and SMEFT is an effective theory, the operators are written with fields and derivatives, but SMEFT is valid at low energies, so maybe higher-dimensional operators are Poincare invariant. But I think the SMEFT operators are constructed to be invariant under the Poincare group, so yes, they must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP and CPT? I remember that SMEFT doesn't necessarily enforce CP symmetry. Because the SM itself doesn't have CP as a symmetry, right? The SM has some CP violation. So SMEFT allows for CP violation, so the operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 might not be a required symmetry.

But wait, what about CPT symmetry? Oh, right, the CPT theorem states that in quantum field theories, the combination of C, P, and T must be a symmetry. If a theory is Lorentz invariant, then it must respect CPT symmetry. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, then it automatically respects CPT. So 4 must be true.

So putting it together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct options are 1,2,4. Looking at the options, C is 1,2,4. But wait, the options given are:

A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait again. I think I might have mixed up something. Let me think again. Are Poincare and Lorentz symmetries separate? Or is Poincare a subset? No, Poincare includes translations, so it's a larger symmetry group. So if you respect Poincare, you automatically respect Lorentz as a subgroup. But when constructing operators in SMEFT, they must be Poincare invariant. Because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all the operators must transform properly under Poincare.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So, for all operators in SMEFT, they must be invariant under Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily under CP. So the correct answer includes 1, 2, and 4.

So looking at the options, only option C includes 1,2,4. So the answer is C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect certain symmetries imposed by the Standard Model. These symmetries ensure the validity and consistency of the theory. 

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (1):** SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT extends it while maintaining this symmetry. Operators are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (2):** Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory built from Standard Model fields, its operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry (3):** CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by SMEFT operators. The Standard Model already violates CP symmetry in certain sectors (e.g., the CKM quark mixing matrix), and SMEFT allows for CP-violating operators. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement.

4. **CPT Symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must respect the combined CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it automatically respects CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C) 1,2,4**.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect certain symmetries imposed by the Standard Model. These symmetries ensure the validity and consistency of the theory. 

1. **Lorentz Symmetry (1):** SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT extends it while maintaining this symmetry. Operators are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry (2):** Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory built from Standard Model fields, its operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry (3):** CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by SMEFT operators. The Standard Model already violates CP symmetry in certain sectors (e.g., the CKM quark mixing matrix), and SMEFT allows for CP-violating operators. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement.

4. **CPT Symmetry (4):** The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must respect the combined CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it automatically respects CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C) 1,2,4**.
