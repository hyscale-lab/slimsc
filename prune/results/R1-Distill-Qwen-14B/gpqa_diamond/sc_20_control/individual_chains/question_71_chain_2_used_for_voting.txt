Okay, I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets in a system of five exoplanets. These planets are discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I don't think that detail is super relevant here. More important is that they're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a specific ratio. The periods are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for the five planets, labeled Planet_1 to Planet_5.

The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that factor will cancel out in the calculation.

I recall that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula I remember is:

Te = T_star * ( (L_star / (16 * π * σ * D^2 )) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

Te = T_eff * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( L / (16πσ D²) )^(1/4 )

Wait, maybe I should simplify. The equilibrium temperature (Te) is proportional to ( (L) / (D^2) )^(1/4 ), assuming same star and albedo. Because A is the same here, so it won't affect the ratio.

So the formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te ∝ sqrt( (L / D²) )^(1/2) → Wait, no, let's get this right.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that L = 4πR²σT^4, where R is the star's radius and T is its effective temperature.

But in this case, each planet's equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The equilibrium temperature formula is more accurately:

Te^4 = (L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ D² )

So, Te = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ D² ) ]^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo (A), the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the ratio of (L/(D²))^(1/4 ), but since L is the same for both (same star), the ratio simplifies to (D1/D2)^(-1/2), where D is the distance of each planet from the star.

Wait, no: Let's compute the ratio Te4 / Te2. 

Te4 / Te2 = [ (D2 / D4 )^(1/2) ]

Because, when you take the ratio, the L and (1-A) terms cancel out because they are the same for both. So:

Te4/Te2 = [ (D2 / D4) ) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, no, because in the formula, Te is proportional to (1/D)^(1/2). So if D increases, Te decreases.

Wait, let's write the formula for each planet:

Te ∝ (1/(D))^(1/2)

So, Te = k * (1/D)^0.5, where k is a constant.

Then, Te4 / Te2 = (D2 / D4)^(0.5)

Because:

Te4 = k * (1/D4)^0.5
Te2 = k * (1/D2)^0.5

So Te4/Te2 = (D2/D4)^(0.5)

But wait, what are D2 and D4? D is the orbital distance of each planet from the star.

But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance, which means their orbital periods are related in a ratio. So, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So, Planet_1 has period P1 = 1 unit, Planet_2 P2 = 2 units, Planet_3 P3=2.5, Planet_4 P4=3.5, Planet_5 P5=5.

But how does the period relate to the distance? Using Kepler's third law, which for a star with mass M, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed.

Assuming all planets orbit the same star and their orbits are circular, Kepler's third law can be written as:

P^2 = (4π²/GM) * a^3

So, a^3 ∝ P^2 → a ∝ P^(2/3)

So, the semi-major axis (distance from star) is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, for each planet, D ∝ P^(2/3).

Therefore, D2 = k * P2^(2/3), D4 = k * P4^(2/3), where k is a proportionality constant.

So, D2/D4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

So, the ratio Te4/Te2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3)

Wait, let's recalculate:

Te4/Te2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2)

D2/D4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

So,

Te4/Te2 = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3)

Because (2/3)*(1/2) = 1/3.

So, Te4/Te2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)

What are P2 and P4? From the given ratios, P2 is 2 units, P4 is 3.5 units.

So,

P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So, Te4/Te2 = (4/7)^(1/3)

Let me compute (4/7)^(1/3)

4 is 2^2, 7 is prime. So cube root of (4/7) is approximately what?

We know that cube of 0.7 is about 0.343. Wait, wait, that's not right. Let me think.

Wait, 0.7^3 is 0.343. 0.8^3 is 0.512.

But 4/7 is approximately 0.5714.

Wait, what's 0.82^3? Let me calculate:

0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724. 0.6724 * 0.82 ≈ 0.551. Hmm, that's about 0.551, which is a bit less than 0.5714.

What about 0.83^3?

0.83^3: 0.83 *0.83 is 0.6889. 0.6889 *0.83 ≈ 0.5717.

Oh, that's close to 0.5714. So, cube root of (4/7) is approximately 0.83.

So, Te4/Te2 ≈ 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because I could have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, the steps again:

Te ∝ (1/D)^0.5 → Te ∝ D^(-0.5)

Since D ∝ P^(2/3), then D is proportional to P^(2/3), so 1/D ∝ P^(-2/3).

So, Te ∝ (P^(-2/3))^0.5 → Te ∝ P^(-1/3)

So, the temperature is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, Te is proportional to P^(-1/3).

So, Te4/Te2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3)

Because Te4 is proportional to P4^(-1/3), Te2 is proportional to P2^(-1/3). So the ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So yes, the same calculation as before.

So, 2 / 3.5 is 4/7 → (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio of Planet_4's temperature to Planet_2's is about 0.83, so option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) is proportional to \( \left( \frac{1}{D} \right)^{1/2} \), where \( D \) is the orbital distance from the star. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are given in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. 

From Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \( D \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Thus, the ratio of distances \( D_2/D_4 \) is proportional to \( \left( P_2/P_4 \right)^{2/3} \). Substituting this into the temperature ratio formula, we find:

\[
\frac{T_e4}{T_e2} = \left( \frac{D_2}{D_4} \right)^{1/2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), the ratio \( P_2/P_4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 \). Taking the cube root of \( 4/7 \), we find:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

I recall that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula I remember is:

Te = T_star * ( (L_star / (16 * π * σ * D^2 )) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

Te = T_eff * ( (1 - A) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( L / (16πσ D²) )^(1/4 )

Wait, maybe I should simplify. The equilibrium temperature (Te) is proportional to ( (L) / (D^2) )^(1/4 ), assuming same star and albedo. Because A is the same here, so it won't affect the ratio.

So the formula for equilibrium temperature is:

The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that L = 4πR²σT^4, where R is the star's radius and T is its effective temperature.

But in this case, each planet's equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The equilibrium temperature formula is more accurately:

Te^4 = (L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ D² )

So, Te = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ D² ) ]^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo (A), the ratio of their temperatures will depend on the ratio of (L/(D²))^(1/4 ), but since L is the same for both (same star), the ratio simplifies to (D1/D2)^(-1/2), where D is the distance of each planet from the star.

Wait, no: Let's compute the ratio Te4 / Te2. 

Te4 / Te2 = [ (D2 / D4 )^(1/2) ]

Because, when you take the ratio, the L and (1-A) terms cancel out because they are the same for both. So:

Te4/Te2 = [ (D2 / D4) ) ]^(1/4 )

Wait, no, because in the formula, Te is proportional to (1/D)^(1/2). So if D increases, Te decreases.

Wait, let's write the formula for each planet:

Te ∝ (1/(D))^(1/2)

So, Te = k * (1/D)^0.5, where k is a constant.

Then, Te4 / Te2 = (D2 / D4)^(0.5)

Because:

Te4 = k * (1/D4)^0.5
Te2 = k * (1/D2)^0.5

So Te4/Te2 = (D2/D4)^(0.5)

But wait, what are D2 and D4? D is the orbital distance of each planet from the star.

But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance, which means their orbital periods are related in a ratio. So, the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So, Planet_1 has period P1 = 1 unit, Planet_2 P2 = 2 units, Planet_3 P3=2.5, Planet_4 P4=3.5, Planet_5 P5=5.

But how does the period relate to the distance? Using Kepler's third law, which for a star with mass M, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed.

Assuming all planets orbit the same star and their orbits are circular, Kepler's third law can be written as:

P^2 = (4π²/GM) * a^3

So, a^3 ∝ P^2 → a ∝ P^(2/3)

So, the semi-major axis (distance from star) is proportional to P^(2/3).

So, for each planet, D ∝ P^(2/3).

Therefore, D2 = k * P2^(2/3), D4 = k * P4^(2/3), where k is a proportionality constant.

So, D2/D4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

So, the ratio Te4/Te2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2) = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3)

Wait, let's recalculate:

Te4/Te2 = (D2/D4)^(1/2)

D2/D4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3)

So,

Te4/Te2 = [ (P2/P4)^(2/3) ]^(1/2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3)

Because (2/3)*(1/2) = 1/3.

So, Te4/Te2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3)

What are P2 and P4? From the given ratios, P2 is 2 units, P4 is 3.5 units.

So,

P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So, Te4/Te2 = (4/7)^(1/3)

Let me compute (4/7)^(1/3)

4 is 2^2, 7 is prime. So cube root of (4/7) is approximately what?

We know that cube of 0.7 is about 0.343. Wait, wait, that's not right. Let me think.

Wait, 0.7^3 is 0.343. 0.8^3 is 0.512.

But 4/7 is approximately 0.5714.

Wait, what's 0.82^3? Let me calculate:

0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724. 0.6724 * 0.82 ≈ 0.551. Hmm, that's about 0.551, which is a bit less than 0.5714.

What about 0.83^3?

0.83^3: 0.83 *0.83 is 0.6889. 0.6889 *0.83 ≈ 0.5717.

Oh, that's close to 0.5714. So, cube root of (4/7) is approximately 0.83.

So, Te4/Te2 ≈ 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because I could have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, the steps again:

Te ∝ (1/D)^0.5 → Te ∝ D^(-0.5)

Since D ∝ P^(2/3), then D is proportional to P^(2/3), so 1/D ∝ P^(-2/3).

So, Te ∝ (P^(-2/3))^0.5 → Te ∝ P^(-1/3)

So, the temperature is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, Te is proportional to P^(-1/3).

So, Te4/Te2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3)

Because Te4 is proportional to P4^(-1/3), Te2 is proportional to P2^(-1/3). So the ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So yes, the same calculation as before.

So, 2 / 3.5 is 4/7 → (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio of Planet_4's temperature to Planet_2's is about 0.83, so option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital distance. The equilibrium temperature \( T_e \) is proportional to \( \left( \frac{1}{D} \right)^{1/2} \), where \( D \) is the orbital distance from the star. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are given in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. 

From Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \( D \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Thus, the ratio of distances \( D_2/D_4 \) is proportional to \( \left( P_2/P_4 \right)^{2/3} \). Substituting this into the temperature ratio formula, we find:

\[
\frac{T_e4}{T_e2} = \left( \frac{D_2}{D_4} \right)^{1/2} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), the ratio \( P_2/P_4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 \). Taking the cube root of \( 4/7 \), we find:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:
