Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which happens when the molecule has chirality. Chirality requires the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. But wait, there's also another possibility with other structures like allenes or compounds with internal planes of symmetry. Let me go through each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. So, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a chlorine on the first carbon and a methyl on the second. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but wait but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting, 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait no, that's butane. Oh wait, no, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is ClC=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, so that's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's Cl–C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. So 1 and 2 positions. So 1-chloro is on the first carbon (the double bond starts there), and 2-methyl is on the second. So the structure would be Cl–C(CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Or wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? But that's not possible since but-1-ene only has four carbons. Wait, maybe it's CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but that can't be because of the double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but that's a single bond, not a double bond. Wait, the question says but-1-ene, which is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 2. So position 1 is CH2Cl, and position 2 is CH(CH3). Wait, but that's impossible because the double bond is between 1 and 2. Oh wait, so the structure would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second, which has a methyl group. So it's Cl–C=CH(CH3)–CH2CH3? No, because that would make it but-1-ene, meaning four carbons in total. Wait, maybe it's Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's (Z)-configured. But the key is, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. The first carbon (the one with Cl) is connected to Cl, a double bond (so two carbons), and two other groups. Wait, wait, but in an alkene, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons. Wait, no, wait. For but-1-ene, structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one of the H's on the first CH2. Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So, 1-chloro would be ClCH2–CHCH2CH3? But that would make ClCH2–CH2CH2CH3, but that's single bonds, but we have a double bond. Oh wait, no, the structure is CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3, but that's butane. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that's a three-carbon chain, but but is four carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substitution wrong. Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would be on the second carbon, making it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. But wait, that's 2-methylbut-1-ene. So the 1-chloro would be on the first carbon, making it Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2CH3? No, that can't be. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back.

Wait, but the key is whether this compound has a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps it doesn't. Because in the double bond, the substituents might not be four different groups. Let me think. At the first carbon, it's Cl, then double bonded to the second carbon. So the first carbon is bonded to Cl, two H's, and the double bond. So that's only three substituents, so it can't be a chiral center. The second carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a CH2CH3 group, and two parts of the double bond. So again, not four substituents. So no chiral centers. So this compound doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it's not optically active. Unless there's another possibility, like maybe if the molecule is planar or has some symmetry, but I don't think so. So this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Next compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me try to visualize. Hexahydro suggests a six-membered ring, but the substituents complicate things. Methanoisobenzofuran implies a bicyclic structure, perhaps with two rings fused. The substituent is chloromethylene (–CH2Cl?), but wait, methylene is –CH2–, but chloromethylene would be –ClCH2–, but perhaps as a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double bond with Cl, like –CHCl–CH2–? Not sure. Anyway, the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Given the (3aR,7aS,E) designation, there are stereogenic centers, so perhaps the molecule has multiple stereocenters. The E designation might indicate a double bond configuration, but the presence of R and S suggests chiral centers. So this compound is likely to be chiral, hence optically active. So this one does exhibit optical activity.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So with substituents on C2 and C3. 2,3-dimethyl would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) have CH(CH3) groups. So C2 has: COOH, CH(CH3), CH2 (from the adjacent C3), and another CH(CH3) from C3? Wait no, wait. Let me think: The structure of succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So the four carbons are: COOH-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when we have 2R and 3S, each of those carbons now has a methyl group. So for C2: groups are COOH (from C1), CH3 (methyl), CH2CH2COOH, and another group. Wait, no. Let me think: C2 in succinic acid is CH2. When it's 2R,3S-dimethyl, C2 becomes CH(CH3) and C3 becomes CH(CH3). So the groups attached to C2 are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), CH(CH3) (from C3), and another CH2 group from C1? Wait, no. Let me draw it. The structure is COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents. For C2: COOH on one side, CH(CH3), another CH(CH3) on the other side, and a methyl group. Wait, no. No, in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group. So for C2, the four substituents are: -CH(CH3), -COOH (from C1), -CH(CH3) (from C3), and the other substituent is a hydrogen? No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: COOH (C1), CH(CH3), CH(CH3) (C3), and a hydrogen? No, that would only be three groups. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) is two substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Each CH(CH3) is a carbon attached to three groups: two from the chain and the methyl. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) is a carbon connected to the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3) and the methyl. Wait, no, no, the structure is (CH2) groups with methyl substituents. Let me think again. C2 is attached to C1 (which is COOH), a methyl group, and C3. So C2 has two substituents besides the two adjacent carbons. Wait, no, C2 is CH(CH3) connected to C1 and C3. So that's two substituents (CH(CH3)), but each CH has three bonds. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps each of the central carbons has four substituents. Let me think about C2:

C2 is connected to:

- C1 (which is COOH),

- a methyl group,

- C3,

- and a hydrogen? Or another group? Wait, no, because the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each CH(CH3) is a central carbon attached to C1 and C3, and a methyl group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but that's four substituents. So each of C2 and C3 has four substituents, but are they all different?

Let me list the four groups on C2:

1. COOH (from C1)

2. CH(CH3) (from C3)

3. Methyl group (CH3)

4. Hydrogen (H)

Wait, but that's only three groups. Wait, no, no. Wait, each CH(CH3) would be -CH2- with a methyl branch. No, wait, 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3). So each of those carbons has four substituents: the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3), a CH3 group, and another substituent. Wait, but that would be four different groups? Or is there a possibility of symmetry?

Wait, for C2: attached groups are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), a methyl group, and another CH3? Or perhaps more accurately, the substituents on C2 are:

- COOH (from C1),

- CH(CH3) (from C3),

- CH3 (methyl),

- and another CH3? No, wait. I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 in this molecule is a chiral center. Because each has four different substituents. Let me think: For C2:

1. C1: COO-

2. C3: CH(CH3)

3. CH3 (methyl group)

4. Hydrogen (if any).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let's imagine the structure:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each CH(CH3) has the following groups attached:

- The carbonyl group (C1: OOC-),

- The next CH(CH3) (C3),

- A methyl group,

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, so on C2, the groups are:

- OOC- (from C1),

- CH(CH3) (C3),

- CH3,

- H.

So four different groups? OOC- is a carboxylic acid group, CH(CH3) is a branch, CH3, and H. So yes, four different groups, making C2 a chiral center. Similarly, C3 has:

- OOC- (from C3),

Wait, no, C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH(CH3)), C4 (which is COOH), and has a methyl group and a hydrogen. So same substituents as C2. So each of C2 and C3 has four different substituents. Therefore, each is a chiral center. So the molecule has two chiral centers. Now, the configuration is (2R,3S), which is a specific arrangement. So this molecule is chiral and will have optical activity. So this compound is optically active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Structure is the same as before, HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, wait. No, because in succinic acid, the substituents are on C2 and C3. So in this case, substituents are 2,3-dimethyl, same as the previous compound, but the configuration is (2R,3R). So each of the central carbons has four different substituents, so they're chiral centers. Does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me see. If both are R configuration, could the molecule be meso? Because sometimes when two stereocenters are present, if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound and not chiral. For example, tartaric acid in its meso form. So in this case, if the two chiral centers are R and R, is there a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is symmetrical around the center between C2 and C3. If both C2 and C3 are R, then perhaps the molecule is not meso. Wait, wait. For a meso compound, the configuration of the stereocenters must be opposite. For example, in meso-tartaric acid, it's (R,S) configuration, making it achiral because of the plane of symmetry. But in this case, if both are R, then the configuration would be (R,R). So would that create a plane of symmetry? Let me think. If you have the two stereocenters with the same configuration, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? I think no, because the arrangement of substituents would mirror across the center. Wait, no, if it's (R,R), the arrangement would be such that the groups are in the same positions on each side. So it's actually a diastereomer of the (R,S) which is the meso form. So in this case, (R,R) would not be a meso compound. So the molecule would have chirality because the two stereocenters are same, so no symmetry. Therefore, it's chiral and optically active. So this compound also exhibits optical activity.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. Meso compounds have identical stereocenters but with a plane of symmetry. So, for a molecule with two stereocenters, if they are mirror images, the molecule is meso. So for (2R,3S), if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be meso. But in the case of (2R,3R), if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule is chiral. So in the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid with (2R,3R) configuration, is it a meso compound or not? Let me imagine the structure. The two central carbons are both R configuration. So, each has the same arrangement of substituents. So the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry because the substituents on both sides are arranged in the same way, leading to no symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and optically active. So this compound is optically active.

Wait, but wait, hold on. Ah, I think I'm confusing the possibilities. Let me think about the actual structure. If you have a molecule with two stereocenters, and the configurations are same, like (R,R), then the molecule is chiral and thus optically active. But if the configurations are opposite, like (R,S), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso and not chiral. So in the third compound, the configuration is (2R,3S). So let's see if that's a meso form. If the substituents on each stereocenter are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical, then it's meso. So (R,S) would have the same groups mirrored. But in our case, both stereocenters have the same substituents: each has a methyl, a hydrogen, a COOH, and a CH(CH3). Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think about the substituents again. For C2, the substituents are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), methyl, and hydrogen. For C3, substituents are CH(CH3) (from C2), COOH (from C4), methyl, and hydrogen. So if the configurations are (R,S), then the arrangement would be such that the substituents are mirror images. So in that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be meso. But in our case, the third compound is (2R,3S), which would be a meso compound. Wait, but in the third compound, the configuration is (2R,3S), which would make it a meso form, hence achiral. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Hmm, so let me clarify.

Wait, the third compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Let me think about the arrangement. If the two stereocenters are R and S, and the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would be a meso compound. So this molecule would have an internal plane of symmetry and thus not be chiral. So it would not exhibit optical activity. But wait, earlier I thought it was chiral. Wait, I'm getting confused now. Let me think of tartaric acid as an example. In meso-tartaric acid, the configuration is (R,S), and the molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. So similarly, (2R,3S) in this molecule would be a meso form, hence not chiral. Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical activity. But wait, the fourth compound has (2R,3R) configuration, which would not have a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral and optically active.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me summarize:

- Compound 3: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Since configurations are opposite, and the molecule is symmetrical, it's a meso compound, so no optical activity.

- Compound 4: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Configurations are same, no plane of symmetry, so it's chiral, hence optically active.

So I'll correct my earlier assessment: Compound 3 is meso, not chiral, so no optical activity. Compound 4 is chiral, so yes.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the OH at position 1 and the double bond between C3 and C4. Now, the ring has six carbons. Does this molecule have a chiral center? The OH is on C1. So what are the substituents on C1? The OH, two CH2 groups (assuming the ring is regular), and the adjacent carbon (C2). Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So C1 has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from the ring), and

- a CH group (from C2).

Wait, no. Let me think of the ring structure. In cyclohexene, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. The OH is on C1. So C1 is connected to C6 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups from C2 and C6,

- and the other substituent is the ring. Hmm. Wait, no, each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons (C1 is connected to C2 and C6), and two CH2 groups. Wait, but in a cyclohexene, if the ring is chair conformation, some substituents are axial and others equatorial. But regardless, the key is whether C1 has four different substituents. The substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6), each with their own substituents,

- and the ring's position. Wait, perhaps C1 is attached to:

- OH,

- a CH2 group (from C2),

- a CH2 group (from C6),

- and another group. Wait, that's not making sense. Alternatively, perhaps C1 has:

Group 1: OH,

Group 2: CH2 (from C2, which is CH2 connected to C3),

Group 3: CH2 (from C6, which is connected to C5),

Group 4: The ring's position (like a CH2 connected to the ring). Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps C1 has four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups, and a CH group. Wait, no. Let me think again. Each carbon in the ring has two adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So C1 has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, but that would make four substituents. Wait, no. So C1 has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and a hydrogen. So substituents would be OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and H. Are any of these the same? If C2 and C6 are similar in structure, then the substituents may not all be different. So would C1 have four different substituents? Let's see: OH, CH2 (from C2, which is -CH2-CH2-CH2- etc.), CH2 (from C6, which is connected to C5), and H. Are the two CH2 groups different? If the ring is symmetric, perhaps C2 and C6 have similar substituents, making the two CH2 groups identical. Therefore, C1 would have three substituents: OH, two identical CH2 groups, and H. So that's three different groups, meaning C1 is not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. So (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would not be chiral, which seems contradictory because the question states it's (R) configuration. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the ring has substituents that make C1 a chiral center. Let me think again. If the ring is not symmetric, maybe C2 and C6 have different substituents. Wait, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the ring structure would have substituents as follows: C1 has OH, C2, C6; C3 and C4 are double-bonded, C5 and C6 are single-bonded. So, perhaps C1 is connected to two different CH2 groups. For example, C2 is connected to a CH2 that is connected to the double bond, and C6 is connected to a CH2 that's connected to C5. If these are different, then C1 would have four different substituents, making it a chiral center. But without knowing the exact substitution, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the ring is not symmetrical, leading to C1 being a chiral center. So (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have a chiral center, making it optically active. So this compound exhibits optical activity.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So it's a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. All three are s configuration. Now, let's check for a chiral center. Each of these positions (1,3,5) is a stereocenter if they have four different substituents. But in a cyclohexane ring, substituents can be arranged symmetrically. Let's see: each OH is on a carbon that's connected to two other ring carbons and two substituents. So for C1, substituents are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and another substituent, which might be a CH (from C2 and C6's connections). But wait, perhaps the substituents on each of these positions are not all different. For C1, if the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen, then it's not a chiral center. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each of these positions (1,3,5) has four different groups, making them chiral centers. However, the molecule as a whole might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetric, it could be achiral despite having stereocenters. So let's imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups at 1,3,5 positions. If all are s configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if you have a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on 1,3,5, and all are s, then the molecule might be symmetrical when rotated 120 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to an internal plane of symmetry. For example, in 1,3,5-trihydroxy cyclohexane, the molecule could be symmetric along the axis passing through the center of the ring, making it achiral. So even with three stereocenters, the molecule could be meso or have internal symmetry. Therefore, it may not be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps it is chiral. Hmm, it's a bit tricky. Another approach: if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, it's achiral. But if not, it's chiral. So, in this case, with three OH groups at 1,3,5 positions and all s configurations, would the molecule be chiral? I think yes, because each substituent is in a unique position, and there's no plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is achiral because of symmetry. Let me think about it: if you have substituents at 1,3,5 positions, and they are all the same (OH), then the molecule might be symmetric if the configurations are the same. Wait, but each OH is on a carbon that is in a different position in the ring. Wait, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion. For example, if each OH is opposite another, but in this case, 1,3,5 are spaced every other carbon. Hmm, perhaps in this arrangement, the molecule is symmetric. If the molecule has a center of inversion, then it would be achiral. So, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration makes the molecule have a center of inversion, making it achiral. Therefore, this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's chiral because each stereocenter is arranged in a way that creates chirality. I think I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I should proceed and come back.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure is (cyclopentyl) connected to a butanone. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl?

Wait, but butanone is (CH3)2CO, but in this case, the substituents are different. Let me think: butan-1-one is (CH3)CH2CO-. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, which is butanone as (CH2)2CHCO-. Wait, but butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO, which is impossible, perhaps I'm getting the naming wrong. Alternatively, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but that's probably not possible. Wait, butanone is actually (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone, but that's 2-butanone. So 1-butanone would be CH3CH2CH2CO, but that's not a common structure because it's not stable. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, but regardless, the key is whether there's a chiral center. Let me look for any carbon with four different substituents. The carbonyl group is at position 1, so the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

So the carbonyl is at the end. The adjacent carbon (C2) is CH2. Then C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2-cyclopentyl.

So looking for any chiral centers.

- C2: attached to O=C, two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3). So substituents: O=C, CH2 (from C1), CH(CH3), and CH2 (from C3). So four substituents. Are they all different? O=C is a carbonyl group, CH2 from C1, CH(CH3) from C3, and CH2 from C4. Wait, no, because C2 is connected to C1 (O=C-CH2-), C3 (CH2-CH(CH3)-), and the other substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

So the carbonyl is on C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2 connected to cyclopentyl.

So for each carbon:

C1: O=C attached to C2 (CH2).

C2: attached to O=C (from C1), two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3), and a CH(CH3) from C3. So substituents: O=C, two CH2, and CH(CH3). Are any of these same? The two CH2 groups are same. So C2 has substituents: O=C, two CH2, and CH(CH3). That's three different groups, so C2 is not a chiral center.

C3: attached to CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3), CH2 (from C4), and cyclopentyl (from C4). So substituents: CH2 (C2), CH(CH3), CH2 (C4), and cyclopentyl. Are all four different? Yes. So C3 is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule has a chiral center. So it's optically active.

Now, let's recap each compound's optical activity:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral center. Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Has chiral centers. Optically active. Count as 1.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound (same groups mirrored). Not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral. Optically active. Count as 2.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Has a chiral center. Optically active. Count as 3.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: If symmetric, no. If not, yes. I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps each OH is on a carbon that has four different substituents, so each is a chiral center. But the molecule as a whole may have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a meso compound. Let me think: 1,3,5-triol with all s configurations. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is achiral. So maybe it's not optically active. So count as no.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Has a chiral center. Optically active. Count as 4.

So the total is 4 optically active compounds: numbers 2,4,5,7.

Wait, but let's recount:

Compounds that are optically active:

2. Yes

4. Yes

5. Yes

7. Yes.

So that's four.

Wait, but earlier I thought that (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (number 5) has a chiral center. Let me confirm. The structure is cyclohexane with an OH on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and another group. Are any of these the same? If the ring is such that C2 and C6 have the same substituents, then the substituents on C1 would be OH, two same CH2 groups, and another substituent (like a CH group). Wait, if the substituents are not all different, then C1 isn't a chiral center. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C1 is not a chiral center. If that's the case, then number 5 wouldn't be optically active. So let's reevaluate.

(5) (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: If C1 isn't a chiral center, then no optical activity. But the question gives the configuration as (R), which implies a chiral center. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. So if C1 is a chiral center, then the compound is optically active.

So back to the count: 2,4,5,7 are active. That's four.

Wait, but in the initial assessment, I thought compound 3 is a meso compound, so not optically active. Compound 6, I thought maybe not active. So the count is 4.

Looking back:

Which option has 4? The options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So the correct answer would be D)4.

To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or exhibits chirality through other structural features, such as a lack of internal symmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond, and the substituents on the double-bonded carbons are not all different. The carbons in the double bond cannot be chiral centers. Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   The compound contains stereocenters indicated by the (3aR,7aS) notation. These stereocenters make the molecule chiral, and the (E) designation for the double bond does not introduce symmetry. Thus, this compound is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters. Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the previous compound, this has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the (2R,3R) configuration lacks internal symmetry, making the molecule chiral and optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 creates a chiral center, as C1 is bonded to four different groups: OH, two distinct ring carbons, and a hydrogen. This makes the compound chiral and optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each of these positions is a stereocenter. However, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral overall. Thus, it does not exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbon at position 3 (C3) is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group, a cyclopentyl group, and two distinct carbons from the chain. This makes C3 a chiral center, and the compound is optically active.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 4, 5, and 7. This gives a total of **4 optically active compounds**.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which happens when the molecule has chirality. Chirality requires the presence of a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. But wait, there's also another possibility with other structures like allenes or compounds with internal planes of symmetry. Let me go through each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. So, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a chlorine on the first carbon and a methyl on the second. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but wait but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting, 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait no, that's butane. Oh wait, no, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is ClC=CHCH2CH3? No, wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, so that's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's Cl–C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. So 1 and 2 positions. So 1-chloro is on the first carbon (the double bond starts there), and 2-methyl is on the second. So the structure would be Cl–C(CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Or wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? But that's not possible since but-1-ene only has four carbons. Wait, maybe it's CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but that can't be because of the double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but that's a single bond, not a double bond. Wait, the question says but-1-ene, which is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the substituents are at positions 1 and 2. So position 1 is CH2Cl, and position 2 is CH(CH3). Wait, but that's impossible because the double bond is between 1 and 2. Oh wait, so the structure would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second, which has a methyl group. So it's Cl–C=CH(CH3)–CH2CH3? No, because that would make it but-1-ene, meaning four carbons in total. Wait, maybe it's Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CHCl=CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's (Z)-configured. But the key is, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. The first carbon (the one with Cl) is connected to Cl, a double bond (so two carbons), and two other groups. Wait, wait, but in an alkene, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons. Wait, no, wait. For but-1-ene, structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one of the H's on the first CH2. Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So, 1-chloro would be ClCH2–CHCH2CH3? But that would make ClCH2–CH2CH2CH3, but that's single bonds, but we have a double bond. Oh wait, no, the structure is CH2Cl–CH2–CH2–CH3, but that's butane. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, the structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that's a three-carbon chain, but but is four carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substitution wrong. Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would be on the second carbon, making it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. But wait, that's 2-methylbut-1-ene. So the 1-chloro would be on the first carbon, making it Cl–CH2–C(CH3)=CH2CH3? No, that can't be. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back.

Wait, but the key is whether this compound has a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps it doesn't. Because in the double bond, the substituents might not be four different groups. Let me think. At the first carbon, it's Cl, then double bonded to the second carbon. So the first carbon is bonded to Cl, two H's, and the double bond. So that's only three substituents, so it can't be a chiral center. The second carbon is bonded to a methyl group, a CH2CH3 group, and two parts of the double bond. So again, not four substituents. So no chiral centers. So this compound doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it's not optically active. Unless there's another possibility, like maybe if the molecule is planar or has some symmetry, but I don't think so. So this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Next compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me try to visualize. Hexahydro suggests a six-membered ring, but the substituents complicate things. Methanoisobenzofuran implies a bicyclic structure, perhaps with two rings fused. The substituent is chloromethylene (–CH2Cl?), but wait, methylene is –CH2–, but chloromethylene would be –ClCH2–, but perhaps as a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double bond with Cl, like –CHCl–CH2–? Not sure. Anyway, the key is whether the molecule has a chiral center. Given the (3aR,7aS,E) designation, there are stereogenic centers, so perhaps the molecule has multiple stereocenters. The E designation might indicate a double bond configuration, but the presence of R and S suggests chiral centers. So this compound is likely to be chiral, hence optically active. So this one does exhibit optical activity.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So with substituents on C2 and C3. 2,3-dimethyl would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) have CH(CH3) groups. So C2 has: COOH, CH(CH3), CH2 (from the adjacent C3), and another CH(CH3) from C3? Wait no, wait. Let me think: The structure of succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So the four carbons are: COOH-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when we have 2R and 3S, each of those carbons now has a methyl group. So for C2: groups are COOH (from C1), CH3 (methyl), CH2CH2COOH, and another group. Wait, no. Let me think: C2 in succinic acid is CH2. When it's 2R,3S-dimethyl, C2 becomes CH(CH3) and C3 becomes CH(CH3). So the groups attached to C2 are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), CH(CH3) (from C3), and another CH2 group from C1? Wait, no. Let me draw it. The structure is COOH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents. For C2: COOH on one side, CH(CH3), another CH(CH3) on the other side, and a methyl group. Wait, no. No, in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group. So for C2, the four substituents are: -CH(CH3), -COOH (from C1), -CH(CH3) (from C3), and the other substituent is a hydrogen? No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: COOH (C1), CH(CH3), CH(CH3) (C3), and a hydrogen? No, that would only be three groups. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) is two substituents. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Each CH(CH3) is a carbon attached to three groups: two from the chain and the methyl. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) is a carbon connected to the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3) and the methyl. Wait, no, no, the structure is (CH2) groups with methyl substituents. Let me think again. C2 is attached to C1 (which is COOH), a methyl group, and C3. So C2 has two substituents besides the two adjacent carbons. Wait, no, C2 is CH(CH3) connected to C1 and C3. So that's two substituents (CH(CH3)), but each CH has three bonds. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps each of the central carbons has four substituents. Let me think about C2:

C2 is connected to:

- C1 (which is COOH),

- a methyl group,

- C3,

- and a hydrogen? Or another group? Wait, no, because the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each CH(CH3) is a central carbon attached to C1 and C3, and a methyl group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but that's four substituents. So each of C2 and C3 has four substituents, but are they all different?

Let me list the four groups on C2:

1. COOH (from C1)

2. CH(CH3) (from C3)

3. Methyl group (CH3)

4. Hydrogen (H)

Wait, but that's only three groups. Wait, no, no. Wait, each CH(CH3) would be -CH2- with a methyl branch. No, wait, 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3). So each of those carbons has four substituents: the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3), a CH3 group, and another substituent. Wait, but that would be four different groups? Or is there a possibility of symmetry?

Wait, for C2: attached groups are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), a methyl group, and another CH3? Or perhaps more accurately, the substituents on C2 are:

- COOH (from C1),

- CH(CH3) (from C3),

- CH3 (methyl),

- and another CH3? No, wait. I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps each of C2 and C3 in this molecule is a chiral center. Because each has four different substituents. Let me think: For C2:

1. C1: COO-

2. C3: CH(CH3)

3. CH3 (methyl group)

4. Hydrogen (if any).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let's imagine the structure:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Each CH(CH3) has the following groups attached:

- The carbonyl group (C1: OOC-),

- The next CH(CH3) (C3),

- A methyl group,

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, so on C2, the groups are:

- OOC- (from C1),

- CH(CH3) (C3),

- CH3,

- H.

So four different groups? OOC- is a carboxylic acid group, CH(CH3) is a branch, CH3, and H. So yes, four different groups, making C2 a chiral center. Similarly, C3 has:

- OOC- (from C3),

Wait, no, C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH(CH3)), C4 (which is COOH), and has a methyl group and a hydrogen. So same substituents as C2. So each of C2 and C3 has four different substituents. Therefore, each is a chiral center. So the molecule has two chiral centers. Now, the configuration is (2R,3S), which is a specific arrangement. So this molecule is chiral and will have optical activity. So this compound is optically active.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Structure is the same as before, HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, wait. No, because in succinic acid, the substituents are on C2 and C3. So in this case, substituents are 2,3-dimethyl, same as the previous compound, but the configuration is (2R,3R). So each of the central carbons has four different substituents, so they're chiral centers. Does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me see. If both are R configuration, could the molecule be meso? Because sometimes when two stereocenters are present, if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound and not chiral. For example, tartaric acid in its meso form. So in this case, if the two chiral centers are R and R, is there a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is symmetrical around the center between C2 and C3. If both C2 and C3 are R, then perhaps the molecule is not meso. Wait, wait. For a meso compound, the configuration of the stereocenters must be opposite. For example, in meso-tartaric acid, it's (R,S) configuration, making it achiral because of the plane of symmetry. But in this case, if both are R, then the configuration would be (R,R). So would that create a plane of symmetry? Let me think. If you have the two stereocenters with the same configuration, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry? I think no, because the arrangement of substituents would mirror across the center. Wait, no, if it's (R,R), the arrangement would be such that the groups are in the same positions on each side. So it's actually a diastereomer of the (R,S) which is the meso form. So in this case, (R,R) would not be a meso compound. So the molecule would have chirality because the two stereocenters are same, so no symmetry. Therefore, it's chiral and optically active. So this compound also exhibits optical activity.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. Meso compounds have identical stereocenters but with a plane of symmetry. So, for a molecule with two stereocenters, if they are mirror images, the molecule is meso. So for (2R,3S), if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be meso. But in the case of (2R,3R), if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule is chiral. So in the case of 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid with (2R,3R) configuration, is it a meso compound or not? Let me imagine the structure. The two central carbons are both R configuration. So, each has the same arrangement of substituents. So the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry because the substituents on both sides are arranged in the same way, leading to no symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and optically active. So this compound is optically active.

Wait, but wait, hold on. Ah, I think I'm confusing the possibilities. Let me think about the actual structure. If you have a molecule with two stereocenters, and the configurations are same, like (R,R), then the molecule is chiral and thus optically active. But if the configurations are opposite, like (R,S), and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso and not chiral. So in the third compound, the configuration is (2R,3S). So let's see if that's a meso form. If the substituents on each stereocenter are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical, then it's meso. So (R,S) would have the same groups mirrored. But in our case, both stereocenters have the same substituents: each has a methyl, a hydrogen, a COOH, and a CH(CH3). Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think about the substituents again. For C2, the substituents are COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), methyl, and hydrogen. For C3, substituents are CH(CH3) (from C2), COOH (from C4), methyl, and hydrogen. So if the configurations are (R,S), then the arrangement would be such that the substituents are mirror images. So in that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be meso. But in our case, the third compound is (2R,3S), which would be a meso compound. Wait, but in the third compound, the configuration is (2R,3S), which would make it a meso form, hence achiral. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Hmm, so let me clarify.

Wait, the third compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Let me think about the arrangement. If the two stereocenters are R and S, and the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would be a meso compound. So this molecule would have an internal plane of symmetry and thus not be chiral. So it would not exhibit optical activity. But wait, earlier I thought it was chiral. Wait, I'm getting confused now. Let me think of tartaric acid as an example. In meso-tartaric acid, the configuration is (R,S), and the molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. So similarly, (2R,3S) in this molecule would be a meso form, hence not chiral. Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical activity. But wait, the fourth compound has (2R,3R) configuration, which would not have a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral and optically active.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me summarize:

- Compound 3: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Since configurations are opposite, and the molecule is symmetrical, it's a meso compound, so no optical activity.

- Compound 4: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Configurations are same, no plane of symmetry, so it's chiral, hence optically active.

So I'll correct my earlier assessment: Compound 3 is meso, not chiral, so no optical activity. Compound 4 is chiral, so yes.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the OH at position 1 and the double bond between C3 and C4. Now, the ring has six carbons. Does this molecule have a chiral center? The OH is on C1. So what are the substituents on C1? The OH, two CH2 groups (assuming the ring is regular), and the adjacent carbon (C2). Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So C1 has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from the ring), and

- a CH group (from C2).

Wait, no. Let me think of the ring structure. In cyclohexene, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. The OH is on C1. So C1 is connected to C6 and C2. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups from C2 and C6,

- and the other substituent is the ring. Hmm. Wait, no, each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons (C1 is connected to C2 and C6), and two CH2 groups. Wait, but in a cyclohexene, if the ring is chair conformation, some substituents are axial and others equatorial. But regardless, the key is whether C1 has four different substituents. The substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6), each with their own substituents,

- and the ring's position. Wait, perhaps C1 is attached to:

- OH,

- a CH2 group (from C2),

- a CH2 group (from C6),

- and another group. Wait, that's not making sense. Alternatively, perhaps C1 has:

Group 1: OH,

Group 2: CH2 (from C2, which is CH2 connected to C3),

Group 3: CH2 (from C6, which is connected to C5),

Group 4: The ring's position (like a CH2 connected to the ring). Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps C1 has four substituents: OH, two CH2 groups, and a CH group. Wait, no. Let me think again. Each carbon in the ring has two adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So C1 has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, but that would make four substituents. Wait, no. So C1 has:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and a hydrogen. So substituents would be OH, CH2 (C2), CH2 (C6), and H. Are any of these the same? If C2 and C6 are similar in structure, then the substituents may not all be different. So would C1 have four different substituents? Let's see: OH, CH2 (from C2, which is -CH2-CH2-CH2- etc.), CH2 (from C6, which is connected to C5), and H. Are the two CH2 groups different? If the ring is symmetric, perhaps C2 and C6 have similar substituents, making the two CH2 groups identical. Therefore, C1 would have three substituents: OH, two identical CH2 groups, and H. So that's three different groups, meaning C1 is not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center. So (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would not be chiral, which seems contradictory because the question states it's (R) configuration. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the ring has substituents that make C1 a chiral center. Let me think again. If the ring is not symmetric, maybe C2 and C6 have different substituents. Wait, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the ring structure would have substituents as follows: C1 has OH, C2, C6; C3 and C4 are double-bonded, C5 and C6 are single-bonded. So, perhaps C1 is connected to two different CH2 groups. For example, C2 is connected to a CH2 that is connected to the double bond, and C6 is connected to a CH2 that's connected to C5. If these are different, then C1 would have four different substituents, making it a chiral center. But without knowing the exact substitution, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the ring is not symmetrical, leading to C1 being a chiral center. So (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have a chiral center, making it optically active. So this compound exhibits optical activity.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So it's a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. All three are s configuration. Now, let's check for a chiral center. Each of these positions (1,3,5) is a stereocenter if they have four different substituents. But in a cyclohexane ring, substituents can be arranged symmetrically. Let's see: each OH is on a carbon that's connected to two other ring carbons and two substituents. So for C1, substituents are:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),

- and another substituent, which might be a CH (from C2 and C6's connections). But wait, perhaps the substituents on each of these positions are not all different. For C1, if the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen, then it's not a chiral center. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each of these positions (1,3,5) has four different groups, making them chiral centers. However, the molecule as a whole might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetric, it could be achiral despite having stereocenters. So let's imagine the cyclohexane ring with OH groups at 1,3,5 positions. If all are s configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Let me think: if you have a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on 1,3,5, and all are s, then the molecule might be symmetrical when rotated 120 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to an internal plane of symmetry. For example, in 1,3,5-trihydroxy cyclohexane, the molecule could be symmetric along the axis passing through the center of the ring, making it achiral. So even with three stereocenters, the molecule could be meso or have internal symmetry. Therefore, it may not be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps it is chiral. Hmm, it's a bit tricky. Another approach: if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, it's achiral. But if not, it's chiral. So, in this case, with three OH groups at 1,3,5 positions and all s configurations, would the molecule be chiral? I think yes, because each substituent is in a unique position, and there's no plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is achiral because of symmetry. Let me think about it: if you have substituents at 1,3,5 positions, and they are all the same (OH), then the molecule might be symmetric if the configurations are the same. Wait, but each OH is on a carbon that is in a different position in the ring. Wait, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion. For example, if each OH is opposite another, but in this case, 1,3,5 are spaced every other carbon. Hmm, perhaps in this arrangement, the molecule is symmetric. If the molecule has a center of inversion, then it would be achiral. So, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration makes the molecule have a center of inversion, making it achiral. Therefore, this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's chiral because each stereocenter is arranged in a way that creates chirality. I think I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I should proceed and come back.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure is (cyclopentyl) connected to a butanone. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl?

Wait, but butanone is (CH3)2CO, but in this case, the substituents are different. Let me think: butan-1-one is (CH3)CH2CO-. Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, which is butanone as (CH2)2CHCO-. Wait, but butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO, which is impossible, perhaps I'm getting the naming wrong. Alternatively, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but that's probably not possible. Wait, butanone is actually (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone, but that's 2-butanone. So 1-butanone would be CH3CH2CH2CO, but that's not a common structure because it's not stable. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, but regardless, the key is whether there's a chiral center. Let me look for any carbon with four different substituents. The carbonyl group is at position 1, so the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

So the carbonyl is at the end. The adjacent carbon (C2) is CH2. Then C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2-cyclopentyl.

So looking for any chiral centers.

- C2: attached to O=C, two CH2 groups, and a CH(CH3). So substituents: O=C, CH2 (from C1), CH(CH3), and CH2 (from C3). So four substituents. Are they all different? O=C is a carbonyl group, CH2 from C1, CH(CH3) from C3, and CH2 from C4. Wait, no, because C2 is connected to C1 (O=C-CH2-), C3 (CH2-CH(CH3)-), and the other substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

So the carbonyl is on C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2 connected to cyclopentyl.

So for each carbon:

C1: O=C attached to C2 (CH2).

C2: attached to O=C (from C1), two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3), and a CH(CH3) from C3. So substituents: O=C, two CH2, and CH(CH3). Are any of these same? The two CH2 groups are same. So C2 has substituents: O=C, two CH2, and CH(CH3). That's three different groups, so C2 is not a chiral center.

C3: attached to CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3), CH2 (from C4), and cyclopentyl (from C4). So substituents: CH2 (C2), CH(CH3), CH2 (C4), and cyclopentyl. Are all four different? Yes. So C3 is a chiral center. Therefore, this molecule has a chiral center. So it's optically active.

Now, let's recap each compound's optical activity:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral center. Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Has chiral centers. Optically active. Count as 1.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Meso compound (same groups mirrored). Not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Chiral. Optically active. Count as 2.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Has a chiral center. Optically active. Count as 3.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: If symmetric, no. If not, yes. I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps each OH is on a carbon that has four different substituents, so each is a chiral center. But the molecule as a whole may have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a meso compound. Let me think: 1,3,5-triol with all s configurations. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is achiral. So maybe it's not optically active. So count as no.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Has a chiral center. Optically active. Count as 4.

So the total is 4 optically active compounds: numbers 2,4,5,7.

Wait, but let's recount:

Compounds that are optically active:

2. Yes

4. Yes

5. Yes

7. Yes.

So that's four.

Wait, but earlier I thought that (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol (number 5) has a chiral center. Let me confirm. The structure is cyclohexane with an OH on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and another group. Are any of these the same? If the ring is such that C2 and C6 have the same substituents, then the substituents on C1 would be OH, two same CH2 groups, and another substituent (like a CH group). Wait, if the substituents are not all different, then C1 isn't a chiral center. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C1 is not a chiral center. If that's the case, then number 5 wouldn't be optically active. So let's reevaluate.

(5) (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: If C1 isn't a chiral center, then no optical activity. But the question gives the configuration as (R), which implies a chiral center. So perhaps I was wrong earlier. So if C1 is a chiral center, then the compound is optically active.

So back to the count: 2,4,5,7 are active. That's four.

Wait, but in the initial assessment, I thought compound 3 is a meso compound, so not optically active. Compound 6, I thought maybe not active. So the count is 4.

Looking back:

Which option has 4? The options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So the correct answer would be D)4.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or exhibits chirality through other structural features, such as a lack of internal symmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond, and the substituents on the double-bonded carbons are not all different. The carbons in the double bond cannot be chiral centers. Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   The compound contains stereocenters indicated by the (3aR,7aS) notation. These stereocenters make the molecule chiral, and the (E) designation for the double bond does not introduce symmetry. Thus, this compound is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters. Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the previous compound, this has two stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the (2R,3R) configuration lacks internal symmetry, making the molecule chiral and optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on C1 creates a chiral center, as C1 is bonded to four different groups: OH, two distinct ring carbons, and a hydrogen. This makes the compound chiral and optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Each of these positions is a stereocenter. However, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral overall. Thus, it does not exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbon at position 3 (C3) is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group, a cyclopentyl group, and two distinct carbons from the chain. This makes C3 a chiral center, and the compound is optically active.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers 2, 4, 5, and 7. This gives a total of **4 optically active compounds**.
