Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, what's the deal with these symmetries? I remember that in physics, especially in field theories, symmetries are crucial. The Standard Model (SM) respects certain symmetries, and SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates higher-dimensional operators preserving these symmetries.

First, Lorentz Symmetry. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? Because the Standard Model is Lorentz-invariant and SMEFT extends it, so all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is definitely in.

Next, Poincaré Symmetry. Wait, Poincaré includes Lorentz plus translations. But SMEFT is a quantum field theory, so it inherently includes Poincaré symmetry. Do the operators have to respect Poincaré? Well, operators are local, so they should be built respecting the Poincaré algebra. So I think both Lorentz and Poincaré are respected. But wait, isn't Poincaré a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz? So if an operator respects Poincaré, it also respects Lorentz. But wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator is a part of a Poincaré-invariant theory, it must respect that. So 2 is also correct.

Then, CP symmetry. The SM has approximate CP symmetry, but SMEFT operators can violate it. Wait, but does the SMEFT require operators to respect CP? I don't think so. Because operators can have terms that break CP. For example, some higher-dimensional operators can involve phases that are not protected by symmetries, leading to CP violation. So option 3, CP, isn't necessarily respected by all operators.

CPT symmetry. The SM respects CPT, and in an effective theory like SMEFT, all terms should respect CPT. Because the underlying theory (like the SM) has CPT symmetry, and SMEFT is built upon it. So any operator in SMEFT must preserve CPT. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it together, which symmetries must all operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincaré (2), and CPT (4). So looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Wait, the options say:

A) 1,2

B) 3,4

C) 1,2,4

D) 1,3,4

So the correct answer would include 1,2, and 4, which is option C. But wait, earlier I thought Poincaré symmetry is automatically included because the theory is local, so do the operators have to respect Poincaré or is it a given of the theory's setup?

Alternatively, maybe operators are constructed in a way that respects Poincaré. Because Poincaré includes translations as well, which would affect the momentum of the state, but the operators are constructed to be local, so maybe Poincaré is built in. So all operators must respect Lorentz (1), because they are Lorentz scalars or tensors, etc. Poincaré (2) is also required because the theory is a QFT with translation invariance. So both 1 and 2 are correct. But wait, Poincaré is more than Lorentz; it includes translations. But SMEFT includes all the terms as local operators, so maybe operators must respect Poincaré.

But wait, in the SMEFT framework, the operators are classified according to their Lorentz structure. They are all renormalizable in terms of being Lorentz-invariant. So each operator is a Lorentz scalar, which implies they respect Lorentz symmetry. But do they also respect Poincaré? Poincaré is more general, including translations, which are about the global symmetry. But operators in the theory are local, so their form doesn't change under translations. So perhaps all operators must respect Poincaré as well. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are Lorentz, Poincaré, and CPT.

Wait, wait, but the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So which ones are mandatory?

Wait, another angle: Poincaré symmetry is part of the foundation of the theory. The SMEFT is based on a Poincaré-invariant theory, so all operators must respect that. So yes, 2 is correct.

So the correct answer is 1, 2, 4. So option C.

To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the role of each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is an extension of the Standard Model (SM), which is Lorentz-invariant. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because they are constructed as Lorentz scalars or tensors. Thus, Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental requirement.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since SMEFT is a quantum field theory, it inherently respects Poincaré symmetry. Operators in SMEFT are local and do not explicitly depend on translation symmetry, but the framework ensures that Poincaré symmetry is preserved. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected by all operators.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM has approximate CP symmetry, but SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP symmetry. For example, certain higher-dimensional operators can involve phases that are not protected by CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, being an effective theory built on the SM, also respects CPT symmetry. All operators in SMEFT must preserve CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 1, 2, 4**.
