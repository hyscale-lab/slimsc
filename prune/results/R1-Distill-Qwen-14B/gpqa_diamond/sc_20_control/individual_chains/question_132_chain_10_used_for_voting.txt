Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture. Let me take it step by step.

The problem says the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

First, I should probably look at the molecular formula. C10H14. Hmm, aromatic compounds with that formula. Let me think about possible structures. Benzene rings with substituents, maybe methyl groups? Because the NMR has signals around 2.2 ppm, which are probably CH3 groups attached to something, like maybe aromatic rings or other substituents.

Wait, wait. The options given are all tetramethylbenzenes except one. Let me check: options A, B, D are all tetramethylbenzenes, except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl would mean more carbons per substituent, but let me see the molecular formula.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. So each compound is C10H14. Let's see: 1,4-diethylbenzene would be C8H10 plus two ethyl groups (each C2H5). Wait, benzene is C6H6, each ethyl is C2H5, so 1,4-diethyl would be C6 + 2*(C2) = C10, and H: 6 (from benzene) + 2*(5) = 16? Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene in diethyl would be substituted at two positions. Each ethyl is C2H5. So benzene has six carbons, two ethyl groups (each two carbons) makes C6 + 2*2 = C10. Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl group is -C2H5; each substitution replaces one H on benzene. So each ethyl adds 5 H. So two ethyls: 2*(5) =10. But benzene without substituents has 6 H, but with two substituents, it's 6-2 =4 H. So total H would be 4 + 10 =14. So molecular formula would be C10H14. Oh, so that fits. So 1,4-diethylbenzene is possible.

So the other options are tetramethylbenzenes. Let's think about that.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The aromatic region shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in 1:1 ratio. So each aromatic ring is giving one singlet, and both are present in equal amounts.

Wait, but wait. If the compounds have different substitution patterns, their aromatic protons might split into different signals. But why are there only two singlets? Because each compound has only one type of aromatic proton. So each of the two compounds has equivalent aromatic protons, meaning their rings are symmetric, leading to only one set of protons each. So each compound contributes one singlet, and since they are in 1:1 ratio, the signals are in 1:1 ratio.

So each compound must have a fully symmetric aromatic ring, leading to equivalent aromatic protons. So which of the options fit that?

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: Let's visualize the structure. If you have methyl groups at 1,2,4,5 positions. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1,2,4,5 would be adjacent? Or wait, let me think: numbering a benzene ring, 1 and 2 are adjacent, then 4 is across from 1? Hmm, perhaps it's a para-substituted in some way, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's two para-substituted groups.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the symmetry. If the substituents are symmetric, the aromatic protons will be equivalent.

For example, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5. Wait, but that would be every other position, so maybe the structure is such that there's a plane of symmetry. Let me try drawing it.

Positions 1,2,4,5: so if I imagine the benzene ring, positions 1 and 2 are next to each other. Then position 4 is across from position 1 (since in benzene, position 1 and 4 are para). So the methyl groups would be at 1,2,4,5. So 1 and 4 are para, but then 2 and 5 are also adjacent. Hmm, maybe the ring isn't symmetric enough.

Alternatively, another structure: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Wait, that's four methyl groups in a row? Which would make it a highly symmetric structure. Because the ring would have methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. That's a contiguous four substituents, which is equivalent to 1,2,3,4-tetra, which would actually be a very symmetric structure. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, four substituents in a row would make the ring have a certain symmetry. Let me think about substituents at 1,2,3,4: so that's positions 1,2,3,4. Then positions 5 and 6 are empty. So this would be a 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which is actually the same as 1,2,3,4-substituted.

Wait, but benzene is a ring, so 1,2,3,4 are four consecutive positions. Wait, no, that's not possible because benzene has six positions. Wait, 1,2,3,4 are four positions in a row, but that's four in a ring. But in a benzene ring, that would place the substituents every other position. Wait, no, it's four consecutive positions, which would make a symmetric structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like a 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Wait, that's a different arrangement. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about each option's symmetry.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5.

1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. So the substituents are in four consecutive positions. That would make the aromatic ring have substituents in a way that leaves positions 5 and 6 without substituents. But wait, that's four substituents, so perhaps the ring is symmetric. Let me try to imagine it. If the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then the ring would have substituents on four adjacent carbons, leaving positions 5 and 6 empty. Would that make the remaining aromatic protons equivalent?

Wait, no, because in such a structure, the two empty positions are adjacent. So looking at the ring, positions 5 and 6 are adjacent. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 5 and 6. Wait, but if substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are next to substituents at position 4 and position 1 respectively. So the protons at 5 and 6 would be adjacent to methyl groups. Are they equivalent?

Wait, perhaps in this structure, the ring has symmetry. Let me think: the substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So the ring would have substituents in four consecutive positions. So the ring would have a plane of symmetry. If I draw this, positions 1,2,3,4 are all substituted. So the remaining positions are 5 and 6. But since substituents are at 4 and 1, which are adjacent, would the positions 5 and 6 be equivalent? Maybe not. Hmm, perhaps the structure would have two sets of equivalent protons. But wait, the NMR shows only two singlets, so each compound in the mixture must have only one type of aromatic proton.

Wait, but if each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, then each would give a single peak in the spectrum. But the problem says that the aromatic protons give two singlets in a 1:1 ratio, meaning each compound contributes one singlet, and their peaks are in 1:1 ratio.

So each compound must have only one type of aromatic proton, i.e., all aromatic protons are equivalent. That would mean that each aromatic compound is highly symmetric, leading to only one set of equivalent aromatic protons.

Which of the options satisfy that?

Looking at 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's imagine the structure: substituents at 1,2,4,5.

Wait, that would mean that substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 are empty. Let me visualize: positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 4 and 5 are adjacent, but wait, in a benzene ring, 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 4 is across from 1. So 1,2,4,5 would be substituents in such a way that the ring has a certain symmetry. Maybe this structure has two substituents on each of two adjacent positions, leading to symmetry across a certain axis.

Wait, perhaps the structure is like this: substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 4 and 5 are adjacent but across from 1 and 2. So, the ring would have a symmetry where opposite substituents are present. Wait, maybe it's like having substituents at 1,2,4,5, which would form a sort of 'X' symmetry. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted structure, but with two substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the aromatic ring has two pairs of substituents, which are symmetrical, leading to equivalent protons.

Another way to approach this is to consider that for a benzene ring with multiple substituents, the aromatic protons will be equivalent only if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, leading to all aromatic protons being equivalent.

So which of the options have all aromatic protons equivalent?

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl: substituents at four consecutive positions, so the ring would have substituents at 1,2,3,4. That leaves positions 5 and 6 empty. Are the aromatic protons at 5 and 6 equivalent? Let me think: the substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So the H at 5 is adjacent to substituents at 4 and 6, but wait, substituents are at 4, so H at 5 would be next to substituent at 4. Similarly, H at 6 is next to substituent at 1 and substituent at 5 (but position 5 is H). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me imagine the positions.

If substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then the structure is a row of four substituents. So the positions 5 and 6 would be adjacent. H at 5 is next to substituent at 4, and H at 6 is next to substituent at 1. So, are H5 and H6 equivalent? I think not because their neighboring substituents are different. H5 is next to substituent at 4 and H6 is next to substituent at 1. So they would not be equivalent, leading to two different aromatic signals. But the NMR shows only two singlets, but each from each compound. So if each compound contributes one singlet, then each must have only one type of aromatic H.

Hmm, so perhaps 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene doesn't fit because it would have two types of aromatic H.

Wait, another thought: Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene is such that the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Let me think about it. Suppose the substituents are at 1,2,4,5. Then, looking at the ring, substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So, positions 3 and 6 are empty. Are the aromatic H at 3 and 6 equivalent? Well, let me imagine the molecule: substituents at 1 and 2 are adjacent. Substituents at 4 and 5 are adjacent. So, substituents are in a way that positions 1,2,4,5 are each adjacent to each other in a sort of square arrangement around the benzene ring. So the ring would have a plane of symmetry between substituents 2 and 5, perhaps, leading to H3 and H6 being equivalent. Because substituents are symmetrically placed, H3 and H6 would be mirror images of each other. So their chemical shifts would be the same, leading to a singlet.

Wait, that's possible. So 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have two equivalent aromatic H (at positions 3 and 6), giving a singlet at around 6.7 ppm.

Similarly, the other compound would also need to have all aromatic H equivalent. So which of the other options fit that?

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Let's see if the aromatic H are equivalent. Substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the empty positions are 4 and 6. Are H4 and H6 equivalent? Let's imagine the structure. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So positions 4 and 6 are empty. Are H4 and H6 adjacent to substituents in a symmetric way?

Wait, substituent at 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Substituent at 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Substituent at 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. So H4 is next to substituents at 3 and 5. H6 is next to substituents at 1 and 5. So perhaps H4 and H6 are not equivalent because the substituents adjacent to them are different. So this would lead to two different aromatic signals, which doesn't fit the NMR data. So perhaps 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene doesn't have all equivalent aromatic H.

Wait, so maybe the correct compounds are those where each has only one type of aromatic H.

Option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl: substituents at 1,2,3,4. So the empty positions are 5 and 6. H5 is next to substituent 4, and H6 is next to substituent 1. Are these H's equivalent? Because substituents at 1 and 4 are both methyl groups, and the positions are symmetric. Wait, but substituent 1 is next to H6, and substituent 4 is next to H5. So in this case, H5 is adjacent to substituent 4, while H6 is adjacent to substituent 1. Are those substituents the same? Yes, both are methyl groups. So perhaps H5 and H6 are equivalent because the substituents next to them are both methyl groups and the structure is symmetric.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, substituents at 1 and 4 are para to each other. So substituents at 1 and 4 are opposite each other. So if substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then substituents 1 and 4 are both methyl groups. So the ring would have a symmetry that makes H5 and H6 equivalent.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. Positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. So the substituents are in positions 1,2,3,4. So the ring would look like this: positions 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 and 6 are H.

Now, looking at H5 and H6: H5 is between substituents at 4 and 5 (wait, substituent at 4 is methyl, and substituent at 5 is H). Wait, no, substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So H5 is between substituents at 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). H6 is between substituents at 1 (methyl) and 5 (H).

Hmm, but I'm trying to imagine if the structure is symmetric enough to make H5 and H6 equivalent. Because substituents at 1 and 4 are both methyl and opposite each other, perhaps the ring has a plane of symmetry that makes H5 and H6 equivalent. So in that case, both H5 and H6 would have the same chemical shift, leading to a singlet.

If that's the case, then 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet in the aromatic region.

Similarly, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet, as discussed earlier.

So if the mixture is these two compounds, each would contribute a singlet, and their signals would be in a 1:1 ratio, matching the NMR data.

Now, looking at the other part of the spectrum: three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

These are likely CH3 groups attached to something. Let's consider the structure of each compound and count the number of distinct CH3 groups.

For 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: each substituent is a methyl group. But how many equivalent methyl groups are there?

If the structure is symmetric, then some methyl groups may be equivalent. Let's think: the substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So the methyl groups at 1 and 4 might be equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 might be equivalent.

Wait, no. Because the substituents are in four consecutive positions, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps all four methyl groups are equivalent due to the symmetry.

Wait, if the substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then the molecule might have a symmetry that makes the methyl groups in pairs equivalent. Let me try to imagine this.

In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are adjacent to two methyl groups each. Are they equivalent? Or perhaps the structure is such that the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent.

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so if the substituents are arranged in a square around the ring, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent, leading to two types of methyl groups.

Wait, but for 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, each substituent is at adjacent positions. So the structure would actually have a plane of symmetry between substituents 2 and 3, but not sure. Alternatively, the molecule might have a C2 axis, making groups at 1 and 3 equivalent, and 2 and 4 equivalent.

So, in the NMR, each pair would give a singlet, but if there are two types, then two methyl signals. But our NMR shows three signals at 2.2 ppm, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So each compound would contribute some methyl signals.

Wait, perhaps for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substituents are at 1,2,4,5. How many distinct methyl groups are there?

In this structure, substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So the methyl groups at 1 and 2 are adjacent, and the methyl groups at 4 and 5 are adjacent. Does this lead to any equivalent methyl groups?

If the structure has a plane of symmetry, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Because substituents 1 and 5 are across from each other, and 2 and 4 are across as well. So in that case, there are two types of methyl groups: those at 1 and 5, and those at 2 and 4. So each would give a singlet. So in the NMR, each would appear as a singlet, but in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, but wait. The three signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. That suggests three different types of methyl groups, each appearing as a singlet.

Hmm, perhaps the other compound has more than two types of methyl groups.

Wait, let's think about 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. If substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then the methyl groups are in positions 1,2,4,5. Are any of these equivalent?

If the structure has a plane of symmetry, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. So each pair would give a singlet. So this compound would have two types of methyl groups.

Similarly, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have two types of methyl groups: those at 1 and 3, and those at 2 and 4.

But the NMR shows three signals, each a singlet, in a 2:1:1 ratio. That suggests that the two compounds together contribute three different types of methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps one of the compounds has two types of methyl groups and the other has one, or perhaps one has three types, but that's unlikely.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option B says the two compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

So for 1,2,4,5, substituents are at 1,2,4,5.

If in this compound, methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent, then this would give two singlets for the methyl groups.

Similarly, the other compound, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, would have substituents at 1,2,3,4. If this structure has methyl groups at 1,2,3,4, then perhaps the groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent, leading to two singlets.

So in total, the mixture would have four singlets, but the NMR shows only three. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has only one type of methyl group, and the other has two, leading to three signals in total.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged so that one of the compounds has three types of methyl groups. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has all four methyl groups equivalent. That would give a single singlet. Then the other compound, 1,2,4,5, has two types of methyl groups, giving two singlets. So in total, three singlets (1 from the first compound, 2 from the second), but how do their integration ratios work?

The NMR shows the methyl signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, which sums to four parts. Hmm, maybe the first compound contributes two singlets, integrating as 2 and 1, and the second contributes another 1?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the integration ratios. The three signals are at 2.2 ppm, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the total area would be 2+1+1=4. That suggests four CH3 groups in total, but wait, each molecule is C10H14, which, for a tetramethylbenzene, would have four CH3 groups.

Wait, wait, wait. Each compound is C10H14. So, each has four methyl groups, because a benzene ring (C6H6) plus four methyl groups (each CH3 adds 1 C and 3 H). So six carbons from benzene plus four from methyl groups equals ten. H would be 6 (benzene) + 4*3 (methyl) = 18 H, but the formula is C10H14, which has 14 H. So that can't be right. Wait, I must have miscalculated.

Wait, let me calculate the H for tetramethylbenzene. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is CH3. So each substitution replaces one H on benzene.

So, for a tetramethylbenzene, the formula would be C6 + 4*(CH3) = C10. H would be 6 -4 (since each substitution replaces one H) + 4*3 (each CH3 has 3 H). So H = 6-4 +12 = 14. So yes, each compound is C10H14. So each has four methyl groups.

So each molecule contributes four methyl groups, but perhaps some are equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

So, for 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, how many unique methyl groups are there? Let me imagine the structure again.

If substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then the methyl groups at 1 and 3 would be equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 would be equivalent. So two types of methyl groups, each appearing as a singlet. So in the NMR, two signals, each integrating to two groups.

Similarly, for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5. So the methyl groups at 1 and 5 may be equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 may be equivalent. So two types of methyl groups, each as a singlet, integrating as two each.

So if the two compounds are present in 1:1 ratio, then the total methyl signals would be:

From 1,2,3,4: two signals, each integrating as (2 methyl groups per molecule) * (1/2 of the mixture) = 2*(2)*(0.5) = 2 each? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of signals and their ratios.

Each compound has four methyl groups. But the way they are arranged determines how many signals are observed.

If both compounds have two types of methyl groups each, then in the mixture, you'd have four signals. But the NMR shows three, so perhaps one of the compounds has only one type of methyl group, and the other has two, leading to three signals in total.

But wait, can a tetramethylbenzene have all four methyl groups equivalent?

Hmm, perhaps if the substituents are arranged symmetrically in such a way that all four methyl groups are equivalent.

Wait, for example, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Wait, no, that's not symmetric. Or perhaps 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl is more symmetric.

Wait, perhaps 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has a structure where all four methyl groups are equivalent. Let me think: substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So the ring has a four-fold symmetry, making all methyl groups equivalent.

Wait, in that case, the methyl groups would all appear as a single peak, integrating to four.

But looking back, the NMR shows three signals, each a singlet, in 2:1:1 ratio. So total of 4 parts.

Wait, perhaps one compound has two types of methyl groups (each integrating as two and two), and the other has one type (integrating as four). But that doesn't fit with a 2:1:1 ratio.

Alternatively, maybe one compound has two types of methyl groups (each as two), and the other has three types, but that's impossible because it's tetramethyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think again about the NMR signals.

The three signals at 2.2 ppm are all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the total number of CH3 groups is 2+1+1=4, which makes sense because each molecule has four CH3 groups, and the mixture is 1:1, so total CH3 is 4 (each molecule has four, but the ratio is 1:1, so each contributes two each; but wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

Wait, each molecule has four CH3 groups. So in a 1:1 mixture, each contributes four. So the total number of CH3 in the NMR would be 8, but that's not directly relevant. The integration in the NMR indicates the ratio of the signals. So the three signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps two of them are from one compound, and one from the other.

Wait, perhaps one compound has two types of CH3 groups, each with two equivalent groups, and the other has one type with four equivalent groups. Then the signals would be (2a, 2b) and (4c). But the NMR shows three signals, each a singlet, in 2:1:1. That would sum to 4, but in the NMR, the areas would be 2:1:1, so perhaps the first compound contributes two signals (each 2), and the second contributes one (1), but that sums to 5, which doesn't match. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Let me try another approach. Let's look at the options and see which combinations of compounds would give the correct NMR data.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Each of these has two types of methyl groups.

So, for 1,2,4,5: let's say it has two methyl signals, each integrating to two groups (so 2 and 2).

For 1,2,3,4: two methyl signals, each integrating to two groups.

But since they are in a 1:1 ratio, the total signals would be four, each integrating as 2 (from each compound's two signals). But the NMR shows three signals. So that can't be right.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

So, 1,2,4,5 has two types of methyl groups (2 each), and 1,2,3,5 has... let's see, substituents at 1,2,3,5. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent?

Substituents at 1,2,3,5: methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. Are any of these equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. Substituents at 1,2,3,5 are adjacent, except 5 is next to 4, which is H. Wait, perhaps in this structure, the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are not equivalent, but perhaps the methyl groups at 2 and 5 are equivalent if the structure has a certain symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps this structure has three types of methyl groups. Let me count:

Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and substituent at 6 (H).

Methyl at 2: adjacent to 1 and 3.

Methyl at 3: adjacent to 2 and 4 (H).

Methyl at 5: adjacent to 4 (H) and 6.

Hmm, not seeing a lot of symmetry here. So perhaps this compound has three types of methyl groups, giving three singlets. But that might complicate the NMR.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are in symmetric positions, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are in another symmetric pair.

Wait, substituent 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Substituent 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. So substituent 1 is near 2, substituent 5 is near 6. If the structure is symmetric across a certain axis, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 3 are equivalent.

So 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would have two types of methyl groups: 1&5 and 2&3.

So, in the NMR, this would give two singlets, each integrating to two groups.

So, in option D, the two compounds would be 1,2,4,5 (two methyl signals, each 2 groups) and 1,2,3,5 (two methyl signals, each 2 groups). So the NMR would show four signals, but the problem states three. So option D doesn't fit.

Option A: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5.

1,2,3,4 would have two methyl signals. 1,2,3,5 would have how many? Let's see: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Are any of the methyl groups equivalent? Perhaps 1 and 3 are equivalent, and 2 and 5 are equivalent. So two methyl signals. So in the mixture, four signals. Doesn't fit.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene has substituents at 1 and 4 as ethyl groups. So the structure would have ethyl groups at para positions.

But wait, the molecular formula for diethylbenzene would be C8H10 + 2*(C2H5) → C10H18? No, wait, benzene is C6H6, each ethyl is C2H5. So diethyl would be C6 + 2*(C2) = C10. H would be 6 (benzene) + 2*(5) (each ethyl) - 2 (since each substitution removes one H) → 6 + 10 - 2 =14. Oh, wait, but the question says each compound is C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have formula C6H6 + 2*(C2H5) → C10H12. Wait, wait, each substitution of benzene (C6H6) with ethyl (-C2H5) would replace one H. So two substitutions would replace two H's. So H would be 6 - 2 + (2 * 5) = 6 -2 +10=14. So yes, C10H14.

So the NMR would need to account for 1,4-diethylbenzene and another compound.

1,4-diethylbenzene would have ethyl groups at 1 and 4. The aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Are these equivalent?

In 1,4-diethylbenzene, the substituents are at para positions. So the H at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the H at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the aromatic region would show two doublets (since they're adjacent to substituents), but wait, that's not matching the NMR data which shows two singlets. Because each compound in the mixture contributes a singlet.

So if one of the compounds is 1,4-diethylbenzene, which has two sets of aromatic H (each set as a doublet), the NMR would have more than two signals, which doesn't fit the data. So option C is probably incorrect.

Wait, but the problem states that the aromatic region has two singlets. So each compound must have only one type of aromatic H.

So, 1,4-diethylbenzene would not fit because it would have two sets of aromatic H, meaning two aromatic signals, each a doublet, not singlets. So the mixture would have four aromatic signals (two from each compound), which doesn't match the given data of two singlets.

So option C is likely incorrect.

Now, going back to option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Each of these has two types of methyl groups, so together they would contribute four signals. But the NMR shows three. So this can't be right.

Wait, but perhaps one of the compounds has a triplet of methyl groups that are equivalent. Hmm.

Another angle: perhaps in the 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are arranged in such a way that two are equivalent and the other two are in a different symmetry, leading to two signals. Similarly, the other compound has three methyl groups in one symmetry and one in another. But that doesn't make sense for a tetramethyl.

Wait, perhaps 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has two pairs of equivalent methyl groups. So in the NMR, it would contribute two signals. The other compound, 1,2,4,5, also contributes two signals. So in the mixture, the total would be four. But the NMR shows three. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the symmetry. Maybe one of the compounds contributes three signals, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one of the compounds has a single type of methyl group. Wait, how?

If a tetramethylbenzene has all four methyl groups equivalent, then it would contribute a single methyl signal. So in that case, the other compound would contribute two signals, leading to three in total.

Which of the compounds would have all four methyl groups equivalent?

Looking at 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: no, that's not symmetric enough.

Wait, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5. If arranged symmetrically, perhaps all four methyl groups are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a four-fold symmetry, making all four methyl groups equivalent.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted structure, but no, that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has all four methyl groups in a symmetric arrangement, making them equivalent.

Wait, substituents at 1,2,3,4: that's four consecutive positions, which might not allow all methyl groups to be equivalent.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the compounds are 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (which would have two types of methyl groups) and 1,4-diethylbenzene (which would have no methyl groups, but ethyl groups instead).

Wait, but 1,4-diethylbenzene has no methyl groups. So the NMR would have methyl signals only from the tetramethyl compound. But the problem states that the other part of the NMR has three signals at 2.2 ppm, suggesting multiple CH3 groups.

Wait, that's not right. So option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene, which would contribute no CH3 groups, so the three signals at 2.2 ppm would have to come entirely from the tetramethyl compound. But the tetramethyl compound has four CH3 groups. If it has two types of CH3 groups, each integrating as two, the NMR would have two signals. But the problem states three signals. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. The three signals at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps two of the signals are from one compound and one from the other.

Let's think: If one compound has three types of methyl groups and the other has one, that would give four signals. But that's not matching the three.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,4,5 has two types of methyl groups, each as two groups. 1,2,3,5 has three types of methyl groups? No, probably two types. Wait, substituents at 1,2,3,5.

If the structure is such that methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent, then this would give two methyl signals, each integrating as two.

So, the two compounds would each give two methyl signals, leading to four in total. But the NMR shows three. So perhaps one of the compounds contributes two signals and the other contributes one.

Wait, perhaps one of the compounds has two types of methyl groups (each as two groups), and the other has one type (four groups), leading to three signals.

But how can a compound have four equivalent methyl groups? Only if all substituents are at symmetric positions.

Looking again at 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: could all four methyl groups be equivalent?

If the substituents are at 1,2,4,5, perhaps the structure has a plane of symmetry that makes all four methyl groups equivalent. So, in that case, the NMR would show a single methyl signal integrating for four groups.

If the other compound is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, which has two types of methyl groups, each as two groups, then the NMR would have three signals: one from the first compound (4 groups), and two from the second (each 2 groups). But the NMR shows three signals, but in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, the integration ratio is 2:1:1. So perhaps the first compound contributes a signal integrating to two methyl groups, and the other contributes two signals, each integrating to one. But how?

Wait, perhaps the first compound (1,2,4,5) has two types of methyl groups, each as one group. But that doesn't make sense because it has four methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the first compound contributes two methyl groups, and the second contributes two types, each as one group. But that doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to visualize each option.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Each has four methyl groups.

Assuming 1,2,4,5 has two types of methyl groups: two at positions that are equivalent, and two others that are also equivalent.

Similarly, 1,2,3,5 has two types of methyl groups.

So in the mixture, we'd have four signals, which doesn't match the NMR data.

But the NMR has three signals. So this can't be the answer.

Now, thinking about the options again, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Because the two compounds in this option would have different substitution patterns, leading to the right number of signals.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggests that the aromatic protons would each give a singlet, so each compound must have only one type of aromatic H.

Only 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5 would have that symmetry.

Wait, I'm so confused. Maybe I should think about each option's structure and their NMR.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5.

Aromatic H: positions 3 and 6. Are they equivalent? Yes, because substituents are symmetric. So one singlet in the aromatic region.

Methyl groups: substituents at 1,2,4,5. Are there any equivalent methyl groups? If substituents at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent, then two signals.

Similarly, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5.

Aromatic H: positions 4 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let's see. The substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the H at 4 is between substituents at 3 and 5. H at 6 is between substituents at 1 and 5. Are these environments equivalent? Perhaps not. So maybe this compound doesn't have equivalent aromatic H, which would mean it doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, but the NMR data shows two singlets in the aromatic region. So each compound must contribute one singlet. So 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would have to have all aromatic H equivalent, which is not the case here. So this option is invalid.

So the only option that fits is option B: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,4.

Each would have one aromatic singlet, contributing to two in total.

As for the methyl groups: 1,2,4,5 would have two methyl signals (each integrating as two), and 1,2,3,4 would have two methyl signals (each integrating as two). So in the NMR, four signals, which doesn't match the three observed.

But the NMR shows three. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the two compounds in option D have different numbers of methyl groups. Wait, no, both are tetramethyl.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has three types of methyl groups. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: look for the correct answer.

The problem states that the aromatic region has two singlets, each in 1:1 ratio.

The methyl region has three singlets in 2:1:1 ratio.

So, the two compounds must have between them three types of methyl groups. So one compound has two types (a and b), and the other has one type (c), leading to three signals.

But each compound has four methyl groups.

So, for example:

Compound 1: two types of methyl groups, a and b, each with two groups → two signals (each integrating as two).

Compound 2: one type of methyl group, c, with four groups → one signal, integrating as four.

But the NMR shows three signals in 2:1:1 ratio, which sums to four. So perhaps the integrations are 2,1,1.

Wait, that doesn't sum to four. 2+1+1=4. Hmm, but each molecule contributes four methyl groups. So the mixture is 1:1, so each contributes four. So the signals should integrate to four.

So perhaps the three signals are in 2:1:1, which adds up to four. So the first signal is 2, the second is 1, and the third is 1, meaning 2+1+1=4.

So, how can this happen? Perhaps one compound contributes two signals (2 and 2), and the other contributes one (0?), which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps one compound contributes a triplet of signals, but that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps one compound has two types of methyl groups, each integrating as 2, and the other has one type, integrating as 0. No, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the two compounds have the following:

Compound A: two types of methyl groups, each as two and two → two signals, each integrating as two.

Compound B: one type of methyl group as four → one signal, integrating as four.

But the NMR shows three signals, so perhaps Compound B's methyl group is not observed? No, that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of which options could fit the NMR data.

The correct answer is likely option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Because:

- Each would have one aromatic singlet, giving two in total.

- For the methyl groups:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two types (say, a and b), each two groups → two signals.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: three types? Or two types.

Wait, perhaps 1,2,3,5 has two types, each two groups. So the mixture would have four signals, but the NMR shows three. So this can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has three types of methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps 1,2,3,5 has three types of methyl groups: a (1), b (2), c (3 and 5). No, that's two types: substituents at 1 and 3 may be equivalent, and substituents at 2 and 5 may be equivalent.

So, two types of methyl groups, each as two → two signals.

So the mixture would have four signals, which doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess.

The correct answer is likely option D: 1,2,4,5 and 1,2,3,5.

Because:

Each has one aromatic singlet.

For methyl groups, perhaps one compound contributes two signals (2 each), and the other contributes one (four), but that would give three signals in a 2:2:4 ratio, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the three signals are from one compound contributing two signals (2 and 2) and the other contributing one (0), but that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps one compound has two signals (2 and 2) and the other has one (0), but that can't happen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one of the compounds has three methyl groups that are all equivalent, and the fourth is different.

But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D because the substituents' arrangement leads to three methyl signals.

But I'm not fully confident.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct.

But I'm not making progress. I'll have to conclude with what I think is the most plausible option.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture, both with the molecular formula **C10H14**, based on their **1H NMR spectrum**. The spectrum shows:

1. **Aromatic region**: Two singlets around **6.7 ppm** in a **1:1 ratio**, indicating that each compound contributes one singlet.
2. **Methyl region**: Three singlets around **2.2 ppm** in a **2:1:1 ratio**, suggesting three distinct types of methyl groups with the given integration.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Region**:
   - Each compound must have **equivalent aromatic protons**, leading to a single singlet for each compound. This implies that the compounds are highly symmetric.
   - Only compounds with fully symmetric substitution patterns can satisfy this condition.

2. **Methyl Region**:
   - The three singlets in a **2:1:1 ratio** suggest that the two compounds together contribute three distinct types of methyl groups. Each compound has four methyl groups, but due to symmetry, some may be equivalent.

3. **Molecular Formula**:
   - Each compound is **C10H14**, consistent with a benzene ring (C6H6) and four methyl groups (C4H12). Substitution reduces the number of hydrogens on the benzene ring.

### Evaluation of Options:
#### **Option A**: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at 1, 2, 3, and 4 are consecutive, creating a symmetric structure. This compound has **equivalent aromatic protons** (positions 5 and 6), contributing a single singlet.
  - Methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent, leading to **two methyl signals**.
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at 1, 2, 3, and 5 create a less symmetric structure. Aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent, so this compound would contribute **two aromatic signals**, which contradicts the NMR data.
- **Conclusion**: This option is invalid because one compound does not satisfy the single aromatic singlet requirement.

#### **Option B**: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at 1, 2, 4, and 5 are symmetric. Aromatic protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent, contributing a single singlet.
  - Methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent, leading to **two methyl signals**.
- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at 1, 2, 3, and 4 are consecutive, creating a symmetric structure. Aromatic protons at positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, contributing a single singlet.
  - Methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent, leading to **two methyl signals**.
- **Conclusion**: This option is invalid because the mixture would produce **four methyl signals** (two from each compound), whereas the NMR shows only three.

#### **Option C**: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at 1, 2, 3, and 5 create a less symmetric structure. Aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent, so this compound would contribute **two aromatic signals**, which contradicts the NMR data.
- **1,4-diethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at 1 and 4 are para, creating a symmetric structure. Aromatic protons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 are equivalent, contributing a single singlet.
  - This compound has no methyl groups, so it does not contribute to the methyl region.
- **Conclusion**: This option is invalid because one compound does not satisfy the single aromatic singlet requirement, and the methyl region would not match the observed data.

#### **Option D**: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at 1, 2, 4, and 5 are symmetric. Aromatic protons at positions 3 and 6 are equivalent, contributing a single singlet.
  - Methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent, leading to **two methyl signals**.
- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**:
  - Substituents at 1, 2, 3, and 5 create a symmetric structure. Aromatic protons at positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, contributing a single singlet.
  - Methyl groups at 1 and 3 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent, leading to **two methyl signals**.
- **Conclusion**: This option is invalid because the mixture would produce **four methyl signals** (two from each compound), whereas the NMR shows only three.

### Final Answer:
After evaluating all options, none perfectly match the NMR data. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** is the most plausible, as it satisfies the aromatic region requirement and aligns with the symmetry of the compounds.

**Answer: D**
