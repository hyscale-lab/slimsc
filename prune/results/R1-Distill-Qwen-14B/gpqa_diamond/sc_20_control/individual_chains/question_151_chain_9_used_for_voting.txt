Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, the state of a system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And there's this observable P, which is a matrix operator. I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. So, in quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by an operator, and when you measure it, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the component of the state vector in the corresponding eigenspace.

But wait, the question specifically asks for the probability of measuring 0. So first, I probably need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, then project the state onto that eigenvector and find the probability.

Let me write down matrix P. The first row has elements (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, no, I think I misread that. The observable P's rows are as follows:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Hmm, so P is a 3x3 matrix. I'll have to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. But wait, since we're looking for eigenvalue 0, maybe I can solve (P - 0I) v = 0, i.e., P v = 0.

So, the matrix P is:

[ 0       1/√2     0     ]
[1/√2    0       1/√2   ]
[ 0       1/√2    0     ]

I need to find non-trivial solutions to P v = 0. Let's write the equations:

From the first row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0.

From the second row: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0. Since v2 is zero, this equation becomes (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

From the third row: 0*v1 + (1/√2)v2 + 0*v3 = 0. Since v2=0, this equation is 0=0, which doesn't add any new info.

So the solutions are in terms of v1. Let v1 = a, then v2=0, v3= -a. So the eigenvectors for eigenvalue 0 are of the form a*(1, 0, -1). Wait, let me check: v3 is -v1, so if v1 is a, v3 is -a, and v2 is 0. So the eigenvector is [a, 0, -a]^T. So any scalar multiple of (1, 0, -1) is an eigenvector for eigenvalue 0.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized. So the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is (1, 0, -1) normalized. Let's compute its norm. The squared norm is (1)^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 = 2. So normalized, it's (1/√2, 0, -1/√2)^T.

So the eigenspace for eigenvalue 0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Now, the state of the system is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). I need to find the projection of this state onto the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. The probability is the square of the absolute value of this projection.

Wait, but wait. The state might not be normalized. Let me check. The given state is (-1, 2, 1). Let's calculate its norm squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1+4+1=6. So norm is sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))^T.

But perhaps the calculation can be done without normalizing, as the probability is the inner product squared times the state's norm, but I'm not sure. Wait, more accurately, the probability is |<e|ψ>|², where e is the normalized eigenvector and ψ is the state.

Wait, but the state might not be normalized. So perhaps I should normalize it first.

Wait, the state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T.

The eigenvector for P=0 is |e> = (1, 0, -1)^T, but normalized. Wait, the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

So the inner product <e|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Calculating that: (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1) = (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Let me recalculate that. No, wait:

Wait, the inner product is:

e₁ * ψ₁ + e₂ * ψ₂ + e₃ * ψ₃

Which is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + (0)*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.

So that's (-1)/(sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1)/(sqrt(2)) = (-2)/(sqrt(2)) = -sqrt(2).

So the absolute value squared is | -sqrt(2) |^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

But wait, that would give a probability of 2. But probabilities can't be more than 1. Hmm, that's a red flag. What's wrong here?

Oh wait, I think I messed up. Because I took the inner product of the normalized eigenvector and the original state, which isn't normalized. So the correct approach is to compute the inner product as (e | ψ), where e is normalized, and ψ is the original, potentially unnormalized, state. Then the probability is |<e|ψ>|² divided by the norm squared of ψ. Or wait, no: the probability is |<e| (ψ / ||ψ|| ) |².

Wait, no. The state |ψ> is given, and to find the probability of getting 0, we first normalize |ψ>, then compute the inner product with the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability is |<e|ψ>|², where |e> is the normalized eigenvector. Because when you have an observable, the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector in the state.

So let's proceed correctly.

First, the eigenvector for eigenvalue 0 is |e> = (1,0,-1)^T, but normalized. So |e> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

The state |ψ> is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

The inner product <e| ψ_normalized> is (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1/sqrt(2) ) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

Let me compute each term:

First term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) = -1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) = -1/sqrt(12) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).

Third term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) = -1/(sqrt(12)) = -1/(2*sqrt(3)).

The middle term is 0.

So adding the first and third terms: [ -1/(2 sqrt(3)) ) ] + [ -1/(2 sqrt(3)) ) ] = - (2)/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = -1/sqrt(3).

So the absolute value squared is ( -1/sqrt(3) )^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I missed a negative sign somewhere, but when taking the absolute value, it doesn't matter. So the inner product is -1/sqrt(3), and the square is 1/3. So the probability is 1/3.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the eigenvalue \( 0 \). The state of the system is given as the column vector \((-1, 2, 1)^T\), and the observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Find the eigenvectors of \( P \) for eigenvalue \( 0 \)
To find the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalue \( 0 \), we solve \( P v = 0 \). Writing the equations:

1. From the first row: \( 0 \cdot v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 + 0 \cdot v_3 = 0 \implies v_2 = 0 \).
2. From the second row: \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_1 + 0 \cdot v_2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_3 = 0 \implies v_1 + v_3 = 0 \implies v_3 = -v_1 \).
3. From the third row: \( 0 \cdot v_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} v_2 + 0 \cdot v_3 = 0 \), which is automatically satisfied since \( v_2 = 0 \).

Thus, the eigenvectors for eigenvalue \( 0 \) are of the form \( v = a(1, 0, -1)^T \), where \( a \) is a scalar. Normalizing this eigenvector, we get:

\[
|e\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Normalize the state vector
The given state vector is \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is:

\[
\| \psi \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
| \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the probability
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is given by:

\[
P(0) = | \langle e | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle |^2.
\]

The inner product \( \langle e | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle e | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
\langle e | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle e | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + 0 + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The absolute value squared is:

\[
| \langle e | \psi_{\text{normalized}} \rangle |^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
