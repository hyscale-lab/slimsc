Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each providing possible A and B reagents.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably an addition reaction. Wait, but NaCN is involved. Oh right, I think it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when ketones or aldehydes react with cyanide ions. The mechanism involves the addition of CN- to the carbonyl, followed by protonation.

So for the first reaction, the reagent is probably a source of CN- and a proton source. NaCN provides the cyanide ions, but the reaction would require acidic conditions to protonate after the addition. So reagent A is likely an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A and B) or maybe something else. Wait, but sometimes in such reactions, a strong acid like sulfuric acid is used, but in the options, the only acid I see is H3O+ and maybe HCl.

Wait, but let me think. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would add across the carbonyl, making a new carbon with the CN group and an OH group. So the product structure makes sense.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So the reaction is a hydrocyanation or cyanohydrin formation. The conditions for this typically involve an acid catalyst. So A is probably an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+, C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm.

Wait, H3O+ is a strong acid, but sometimes in some reactions, a weaker acid might be used. Alternatively, maybe a sulfonic acid is used, like H2SO4 or HSO4^-? NaHSO3 would provide H+ and HSO3^-; but wait, HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+? Hmm.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A must be an acid. So options A and B have A as H3O+; options C and D have A as NaHSO3. So possible candidates are A and B or C and D.

Wait, but why would NaHSO3 be used here? NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I know that bisulfite can be used in some addition reactions, like with aldehydes and ketones to form bisulfite adducts, which can then be used in other reactions. But in this case, the reaction is with NaCN. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't a simple addition but involves some other mechanism.

Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution? But butan-2-one is a ketone, which isn't typically involved in SN reactions. So probably it's addition.

So back to the first reaction. The product is a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. So an acid catalyst is needed. So A must be an acid. So options A and B are the possible choices, since their A is H3O+.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

So the first reaction requires H3O+ as the acid, so either A or B could be correct. Now, moving to the second reaction to figure out B.

The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and B (H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

Wait, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, under acidic conditions, you can hydrolyze a nitrile to a carboxylic acid by treating it with H2O and HCl (like HCl in aqueous conditions, maybe heat). Alternatively, using a base might give a different product, like an amide or something else.

So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. So to go from -CN to -COOH, we probably need strong acidic conditions. The reagent B is given as H2O, but the reaction conditions (like acid or base) are determined by the reagent.

Wait, the question says the reagent is B, which is H2O. Wait, that can't be right because H2O alone wouldn't do much. So perhaps the reagent B is a catalyst, like an acid or base.

Wait, but the problem states that the second reaction uses reagent B (H2O) and gives the product. So maybe the reagent B is the acid used in the hydrolysis. Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me recheck: the question says "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) →...". So B is H2O, but perhaps it's in the presence of an acid or base. Hmm, maybe I misinterpret.

Wait, the problem says the reagents are A and B. For the first reaction, A is used. For the second, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So the reagents must be in the presence of H2O and another reagent, which is B. Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says the second reaction uses reagent B and H2O. Or is B the reagent, and H2O is part of the reaction? Let me read the question again.

"Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.

Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product.

Reaction 2: [something] + B (H2O) → product."

Oh, wait, no. Let me reread that.

The second reaction is: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → product.

Ah, so reagent B is used with H2O. So in reaction 2, the reagent is B, and the conditions involve H2O. So perhaps, B is an acid or base that facilitates the reaction in water.

So for the second reaction, we're converting a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. The typical reagents for this are either strong acid (like HCl, H2SO4) and water, possibly under heat. Alternatively, using a base might not work directly, but sometimes with other conditions.

So the reagent B must be an acid, because the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid under acidic conditions. So in the options, B is either HCl (option A), CH3COOH (option B), HCl (option C), or CH3COOH (option D).

In the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then for the second reaction, B must be HCl (option A or C) or CH3COOH (B or D).

Wait, but in the first reaction, we're using NaCN and an acid (H3O+), so for the second reaction, the reagent B would be HCl or another acid.

Looking at the options, option A's B is HCl. Option D's B is CH3COOH.

So, for the second reaction, the correct reagent is HCl (acid) in H2O (maybe aqueous HCl and heat).

Which option has A as H3O+ and B as HCl? That's option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the possible steps again.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → cyanohydrin.

Second reaction: nitrile + H2O and HCl → carboxylic acid.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but what about options C and D? Let me think again.

If A is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ (because NaHSO3 dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^-; HSO3^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become SO3^2- or H2O. Hmm, but does NaHSO3 act as an acid in the first reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid. But I thought that the cyanohydrin formation requires an acid like H3O+.

Wait, but maybe NaHSO3 is a mild acid and would work as well. Let me think about it. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid and often used in such reactions, but if NaHSO3 is an option, would it suffice?

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses H3O+ because it's a stronger acid, which would be more effective in protonating the intermediate.

So, in the first reaction, I think H3O+ is the correct acid. So A must be H3O+.

Then looking at the options, which have A as H3O+? Options A and B.

Now, in the second reaction, the reagent B is HCl or CH3COOH.

Which one is suitable for the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid?

I think typically, you use a strong acid like HCl with water and heat. For example, hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done under acidic conditions, often with HCl and heat. So reagent B should be HCl (like option A or C).

Wait, but in option A, B is HCl, which matches that. So, putting it all together, option A has A as H3O+ and B as HCl.

Wait, but let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when we hydrolyze the nitrile, we need to make sure that any other functional groups (like the hydroxyl) are compatible. In this case, the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the nitrile. But I don't think that affects the hydrolysis, which would target the nitrile group.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more specific. The nitrile is at the end? No, in the product, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is nitrile → COOH.

So the reagent B must be HCl, as in option A.

So the correct answer would be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure about the first reaction. Could A be NaHSO3 instead?

NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. I'm trying to recall: is NaHSO3 used in the formation of cyanohydrins? I thought that the typical reagent is an acid like H2SO4, HCl, or H3O+.

Alternatively, maybe bisulfite is used in some kind of addition, but I don't recall that for cyanohydrins. So I think H3O+ is correct, making option A the likely answer.

But wait, let me think about the steps again.

First reaction: butan-2-one → reacts with NaCN and A → produces cyanohydrin.

The reaction of ketones with CN- under acidic conditions gives the cyanohydrin. So the acid is needed to protonate the CN-? Or perhaps the acid helps in the attack. I think the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, facilitating the attack by CN-.

So, without a strong acid, the reaction might not proceed efficiently. So perhaps H3O+ is the right choice.

So, yes, reagent A must be H3O+, making options A or B the candidates.

But then, reagent B must be HCl.

So, the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves selecting suitable reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where a ketone reacts with CN⁻ in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid facilitates the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic and allowing CN⁻ to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and is commonly used for such reactions. NaHSO₃, while capable of providing H⁺, is less typical for this reaction compared to H₃O⁺. Therefore, A is likely H₃O⁺.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This reaction typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as HCl in aqueous solution. CH₃COOH, being a weaker acid, is less effective for this transformation. Thus, B is likely HCl.

From the options provided:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  

Based on the analysis, **Option A** is the correct choice, as it provides the appropriate reagents for both reactions.

**Answer: A**
