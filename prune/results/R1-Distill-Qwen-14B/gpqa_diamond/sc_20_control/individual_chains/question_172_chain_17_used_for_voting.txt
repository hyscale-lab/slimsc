Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're assuming the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means the usual blackbody radiation and Boltzmann distribution apply here.

Wait, so excitation levels relate to the thermal energy of the stars. In LTE, the population of energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula for the ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the excited state is higher, so E2 is higher than E1. The ratio n2/n1 would then depend on exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.

So, for star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Let me define n1 as the population in the excited state for star_1, and n2 for star_2. So, n1 (star_1) = 2 * n2 (star_2).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ratio is given as twice as excited. So maybe n1 (excited) for star_1 is twice as much as n1 for star_2? Or is the ratio of excited to lower state different?

Wait, no, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps the excitation refers to the number of atoms in the excited state. So, the ratio n_excited1 / n_excited2 = 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) for each star. Hmm.

But let's clarify. Let me denote for each star, the ratio of the excited state population to the lower state. So for star_1: (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = R1. For star_2: R2 = (n_upper2)/(n_lower2). The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, no. The question says that the excited level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, are we talking about the same energy level? Or is the ratio of the populations in the same level between the stars?

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the same energy level for both stars. No, wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, so that's the ΔE for each. So each star's atoms have the same energy level difference.

So for each star, the ratio of atoms in the upper energy level to the lower level is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, R1 = (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ). Similarly, R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ) for star_2.

But the problem says that star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2 in that specific level. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is R1 = 2 * R2. So, exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me write that equation:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. Let me do that.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, let's rearrange terms. Let's move the terms involving ΔE and T to the left.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ] = ln(2)

Which is the same as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, wait. Let me compute the expression inside the brackets. [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ]

That's equal to ( -T2 + T1 ) / (T1 T2) ) = ( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 )

So substituting back, the equation becomes:

(ΔE / k) * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Let me write that as:

( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / ΔE )

Wait, but do I know the value of ΔE and k? Wait, the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Let me recall that k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, wait a minute. ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE equals k. So ΔE = k.

So, substituting ΔE = k into the equation:

( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / (k) )

Which simplifies to:

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, that's interesting. So the equation we have is:

ln(2) = ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

Wait, let me see. From the previous step:

ΔE/(k) = (k)/(k) ) = 1.

So ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) * 1 = ln(2)

So yeah, the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

Hmm, let me look at the options. Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's the equation I derived.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the question says that the excited in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But R is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So R1 = 2 R2

So exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking ln both sides: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Which rearranges to:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE / k:

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait a second, this is a different arrangement. So I think I might have made a mistake earlier in moving the terms.

Wait, let me redo the algebra:

Starting from:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

But wait, let me re-derive:

Starting from exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] ) = 2

Taking natural log:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Which is:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

So,

(ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

Since ΔE = k (since delta E is 1.38e-23 and k is 1.38e-23 J/K), then:

k/k * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is that the excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. Assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann distribution applies, and the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant (\(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)) and \(T\) is the temperature of the star.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of populations in the excited state to the lower state are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that \(R_1 = 2R_2\). Substituting these expressions into the given ratio:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\) and simplifying:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k\), this equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the equation given in option D. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
