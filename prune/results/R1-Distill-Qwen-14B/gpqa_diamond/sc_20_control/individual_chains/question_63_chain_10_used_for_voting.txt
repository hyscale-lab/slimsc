Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that the molecule absorbs to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

Alright, the molecule is in its fundamental state. So I guess that means the lowest energy state. When it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state. But wait, what states are we talking about here? The model mentioned is the rotation-vibration model, which probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the next vibrational state or the next rotational state? Or maybe it's about a transition considering both? Oh, wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I'm thinking that refers to the next state in the energy hierarchy, which might involve either a vibrational or rotational transition. But in the quantum models, vibrational transitions are usually higher in energy than rotational ones. So for the lowest possible energy increase, the photon would need to cause the minimal energy jump.

Wait, but the fundamental state for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model is typically the ground vibrational state with the lowest rotational energy level (like J=0 for the rigid rotor). So the next state with the lowest possible energy might be the next vibrational state (v=1) but keeping the same rotational state, or perhaps just the next rotational state (J=1) in the same vibrational level. Hmm. Which one requires less energy?

Vibrational transitions usually have higher energy because the vibrational energy levels are spaced further apart than rotational ones. So if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), the next possible state with minimal energy would probably be a transition from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1. Because that's a lower energy change than going to v=1, J=0. Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the next energy level up, which would be the lowest possible higher energy state.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. The problem is about the photon's momentum. So I need to calculate the energy of the photon and then find its momentum.

Photons have energy E = hν, and momentum p = E/c, since for photons, p = hν/c.

So I need to find the energy difference between the current state and the next state. Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps it's moving from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next energy state, which I think is the J=1 state in the same vibrational level. Because the vibrational energy levels are higher. So the energy change would be due to a rotational transition, not a vibrational one.

Alternatively, maybe it's a transition that includes both vibrational and rotational changes, but that's probably not the case for the minimal energy. So I think it's a pure rotational transition.

Wait, but the question includes both rotational and vibrational aspects, so perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which accounts for bond length variation during vibration. Hmm.

Wait, the problem gives me the molecular bond length R, the angular frequency w of vibration, and the masses. So perhaps the energy difference is the sum of the rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, but wait. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher energy state, which could be either J=1 (same vibrational state) or v=1 (same rotational state). But which one has a lower energy difference?

The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. For J=0 to J=1, the energy increases from 0 to (ħ²/(2I)) (1*2) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (v), for v =0,1,2..., so the first transition to v=1 would be an energy change of h w.

So which is smaller: the energy needed for the rotational transition (E_rot_diff) or the vibrational (E_vib)?

So I need to compute both and see.

First, let's compute E_rot_diff. I is the moment of inertia, which is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈ 18/11 ≈ 1.636 amu. Wait, 40/22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 + 2 =22, so 20*2=40. 40/22 is 20/11, which is approximately 1.818 amu.

But the bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R².

But wait, amu (atomic mass units) need to be converted into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(22) amu = (40/22) amu ≈ (20/11) amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

So μ in kg is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818 * 1.6605) * 1e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.818 *1.6605.

1.8 * 1.6605 = approx 2.9889, and 0.018 *1.6605 ≈ 0.0299. So total is about 3.0188e-27 kg.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 20 amu is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg. Similarly, 2 amu is 3.321e-27 kg. The reduced mass μ is (20 * 2)/(20 +2) = (40)/(22) = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu. So μ in kg is 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605 is about 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Then, the rotational energy difference when J goes from 0 to 1.

E_rot_diff = ( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) * (ħ²/(2I)).

Wait, no. For J=0, E_rot = 0. For J=1, E_rot = ( ħ²/(2I) ) * 1*(1+1) ) = 2 ħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So E_rot_diff is ħ²/(I).

Compute ħ²/(I).

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) (J² s²).

Wait, but I think a better approach would be to calculate it numerically.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I is 1.2072e-46 kg m².

So ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.2072e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step.

1.0545718e-34 squared is (1.0545718)^2 = approx 1.112, so 1.112e-68 J² s².

Divide by 1.2072e-46 kg m²: 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2072) * 1e-22 ≈ approx 0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

So E_rot_diff is approximately 9.21e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w (ground state) and E_vib for v=1 is 3/2 h w (but wait, no, vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = h w.

Given that w is 4e14 rad/s.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

So ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So comparing E_rot_diff (9.21e-23 J) and E_vib (2.65e-19 J), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon must have energy equal to the rotational transition's energy, not the vibrational.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. So the next possible energy level would either be v=0, J=1 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the next state the molecule would move to when absorbing a photon with the minimal energy.

So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition energy, E_rot_diff = 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, that's a very small energy. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference. Let me recalculate I and E_rot_diff carefully.

Wait, μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

Then I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

E_rot_diff = ħ²/(2I) * [J(J+1) for J=1 minus J=0].

Wait, the formula for rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J (J+1).

So for J=0, E_rot is 0.

For J=1, E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 1*2 = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

So E_rot_diff = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2072e-46).

Let me compute that.

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Divided by 1.2072e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2072) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

So yes, earlier calculation is correct.

Now, comparing to ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition is E=9.21e-23 J, which is way less than the vibrational.

So the photon's energy must be 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. So since E_photon = hν, and p = E/c, where c is the speed of light.

So p = E_photon / c.

So E_photon is 9.21e-23 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns range. Oh wait, 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s, so the units are consistent.

Wait, 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options given are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. Hmm, that's much larger than my calculation.

So something is wrong here. Where did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the transition. Maybe it's not a rotational transition but a vibrational transition. Because the options are way larger than what I calculated for the rotational transition.

Wait, let's recalculate the vibrational energy.

ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 1.4e-28.

Option C is 1.1e-27.

Option A is 1.9e-28.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly matching.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute h w again.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 / (3e8) ≈ 8.8347e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.9e-28. But that's about half of my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate μ.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) =40/22 = 20/11 = approx 1.818 amu.

Wait, but maybe the calculation should use the exact value of mu in kg.

1.818 amu → 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Compute 1.818 * 1.6605e-27:

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute:

1.6605 * 1.8 = 3.0 (approx 3.0), 1.6605 *0.018= 0.029889.

So sum is around 3.029889.

So 3.029889e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² =3.029889e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

I =3.029889e-27 *4e-20 =1.211955e-46 kg m².

So E_rot_diff = ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.211955e-46.

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator:1.211955e-46.

So E_rot =1.112e-68 / 1.211955e-46 = approx 9.17e-23 J.

Which is about the same as before.

So the rotational transition energy is 9.17e-23 J, which gives a photon momentum of 9.17e-23 /3e8 ≈3.057e-31 kg m/s → 3.06e-31 N s.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating which transition is the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to a transition where the molecule goes from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1), regardless of J. But if that's the case, the energy required is h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, which gives a photon momentum of 8.83e-28 kg m/s, about 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). Hmm, none match exactly. So perhaps I made an error elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the transition that changes both rotational and vibrational states in a way that minimizes the energy, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a combination of rotational and vibrational transitions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state, which could be the first vibrational excited state (v=1) but with J=0. So that would require the photon's energy to be h w.

Wait, but let's see, 8.83e-28 Ns is close to option D (1.4e-28) or option A (1.9e-28). Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h*w.

Wait, let me compute h*w again.

h =6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value).

w=4e14 rad/s.

h * w =6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = (6.62607015 *4) *1e-20 =26.5042806e-20 J.

Wait, 6.62607e-34 *4e14 = 26.50428e-20 J? No, wait, 1e-34 *1e14 =1e-20, yes. So 6.62607e-34 *4e14 = 26.50428e-20 J →2.650428e-19 J.

Wait, that's correct.

So p = 2.650428e-19 J / (3e8 m/s) =8.83476e-28 kg m/s →8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28 → about half of 8.83e-28.

Hmm, maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is twice the vibrational energy, but that doesn't make sense. The vibrational ground state is (v=0) and the first excited state is (v=1), so the energy difference is h w.

Wait, unless the model includes the zero-point energy, but I think the energy difference is still h w.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which includes bond length variation. So the moment of inertia isn't constant but varies with vibration. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy calculation for the transition.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is treated as a harmonic oscillator for vibration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but in the same vibrational state. But earlier calculation shows that the energy is 9.2e-23 J, which is less than the vibrational transition. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the options given are around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Let me compute 8.83e-28 Ns compared to the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 → about 2.14 times smaller than my calculation.

B)2.3e-27 → about 26 times larger.

C)1.1e-27 → about 12.5 times larger.

D)1.4e-28 → about 6.3 times smaller.

Hmm. So none match exactly. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy?

Wait, perhaps the model expects the energy to be the sum of the vibrational and rotational contributions. But that's only if the transition is a combination, but the question states "the next state with the lowest possible energy." I think that implies the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the rotational transition.

But since the options don't have the value I calculated, perhaps I messed up the model. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy of the photon as the sum of both transitions. But that would be a higher energy, which doesn't make sense for the minimal transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I incorrectly assumed the transition is purely vibrational. Maybe the correct approach is to calculate the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that would be for a transition where both change, but that's not the case for the minimal energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next possible state, which could be v=0, J=1 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon must have that energy. But as per my calculation, that gives 9.2e-23 J, which is way below the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Another possibility: perhaps the model uses the non-rigid rotor, which combines both rotational and vibrational aspects, but I'm not sure how that would change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational energy difference and see if that gives one of the options. Let me compute p for the vibrational transition.

ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s →8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 2 times smaller. Hmm.

Wait, what if the problem considered the reduced mass incorrectly? Let me recheck the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, no, the reduced mass was correctly calculated as μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 =20/11 amu.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the moment of inertia to be calculated using the individual masses, not the reduced mass. But that can't be right, because the moment of inertia for a diatomic is μ R².

Wait, perhaps the model used in the problem is the rigid rotor, and only rotation is considered, but that isn't the case, as the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually considering a transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0, which would be the vibrational transition, requiring energy h w.

So the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 N s, but none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the answer in terms of the options given.

Looking at options:

Option A:1.9e-28 Ns.

Option D:1.4e-28 Ns.

Option B:2.3e-27.

Option C:1.1e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h*w.

Wait, let me compute 6.626e-34 *4e14 again.

6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-20 =26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J. So that seems correct.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 Ns.

Hmm, that's approximately 8.8e-28.

But none of the options are exactly that. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) which is about 2.1 times smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be the energy difference between v=0, J=0 and v=1, J=1. But that would require a photon with higher energy, which doesn't make sense for the minimal next state.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the vibrational energy. Wait, vibrational energy is quantized as E_vib = (v +1/2) h w. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using a different model, such as the Einstein oscillator model, where the energy levels are quantized as E_vib = h w (v +1/2). So the transition from v=0 to v=1 would require an energy of h w. But that brings me back to the same calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the photon's momentum is hbar * angular frequency divided by c. Because sometimes, when dealing with angular frequency, the momentum is p = ħ ω / c.

Wait, let's calculate that.

p = ħ ω / (c).

Wait, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So p = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 / 3e8.

Compute numerator: 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 =4.218287e-20.

Divide by 3e8: 4.218287e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s →1.406e-28 N s.

Ah, that's about 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

So perhaps I was supposed to calculate it this way, using p=ħω/c.

But wait, photon momentum is E/c. E = hν, but since ν = ω/(2π), E = h ν = ħ ω.

So p= E/c = (ħ ω)/c.

Ah, that's correct.

So p = (1.0545718e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (3e8 m/s).

Calculating numerator: 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 =4.218287e-20 J s * rad/s.

But J is kg m²/s², so J s is kg m²/s.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the numbers.

So 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = (1.0545718 *4) * 1e-20 =4.218287e-20.

Divide by 3e8: 4.218287e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg m/s →1.406e-28 Ns.

So that's approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

So that's the correct approach. So earlier mistake was calculating E as h w, but perhaps the correct formula for photon momentum is p = ħ w / c.

So the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The goal is to calculate the momentum of the photon needed for the molecule to move to the next state with the smallest energy increase.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
  \]  
  Converting to kg:  
  \[
  \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.029 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

- **Angular frequency of vibration**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu R^2 = (3.029 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.211 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
  \]

### Energy Transitions:
1. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \cdot \left[ J'(J'+1) - J(J+1) \right].
   \]  
   For \( J=0 \to J=1 \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \cdot 2 = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.211 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This value is far smaller than the options provided, so the rotational transition is unlikely to be the intended answer.

2. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( v=0 \) to \( v=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This value is closer to the options but does not match exactly.

3. **Alternative Calculation Using \( \hbar \omega / c \)**:  
   Photon momentum can also be expressed as:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):  
   \[
   p = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14})}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent result with the given options is obtained using \( p = \hbar \omega / c \), yielding a photon momentum of approximately \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \).

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that the molecule absorbs to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

Alright, the molecule is in its fundamental state. So I guess that means the lowest energy state. When it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state. But wait, what states are we talking about here? The model mentioned is the rotation-vibration model, which probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the next vibrational state or the next rotational state? Or maybe it's about a transition considering both? Oh, wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So I'm thinking that refers to the next state in the energy hierarchy, which might involve either a vibrational or rotational transition. But in the quantum models, vibrational transitions are usually higher in energy than rotational ones. So for the lowest possible energy increase, the photon would need to cause the minimal energy jump.

Wait, but the fundamental state for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model is typically the ground vibrational state with the lowest rotational energy level (like J=0 for the rigid rotor). So the next state with the lowest possible energy might be the next vibrational state (v=1) but keeping the same rotational state, or perhaps just the next rotational state (J=1) in the same vibrational level. Hmm. Which one requires less energy?

Vibrational transitions usually have higher energy because the vibrational energy levels are spaced further apart than rotational ones. So if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0), the next possible state with minimal energy would probably be a transition from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1. Because that's a lower energy change than going to v=1, J=0. Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the next energy level up, which would be the lowest possible higher energy state.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think. The problem is about the photon's momentum. So I need to calculate the energy of the photon and then find its momentum.

Photons have energy E = hν, and momentum p = E/c, since for photons, p = hν/c.

So I need to find the energy difference between the current state and the next state. Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps it's moving from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next energy state, which I think is the J=1 state in the same vibrational level. Because the vibrational energy levels are higher. So the energy change would be due to a rotational transition, not a vibrational one.

Alternatively, maybe it's a transition that includes both vibrational and rotational changes, but that's probably not the case for the minimal energy. So I think it's a pure rotational transition.

Wait, but the question includes both rotational and vibrational aspects, so perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which accounts for bond length variation during vibration. Hmm.

Wait, the problem gives me the molecular bond length R, the angular frequency w of vibration, and the masses. So perhaps the energy difference is the sum of the rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, but wait. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next higher energy state, which could be either J=1 (same vibrational state) or v=1 (same rotational state). But which one has a lower energy difference?

The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. For J=0 to J=1, the energy increases from 0 to (ħ²/(2I)) (1*2) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (v), for v =0,1,2..., so the first transition to v=1 would be an energy change of h w.

So which is smaller: the energy needed for the rotational transition (E_rot_diff) or the vibrational (E_vib)?

So I need to compute both and see.

First, let's compute E_rot_diff. I is the moment of inertia, which is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈ 18/11 ≈ 1.636 amu. Wait, 40/22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 + 2 =22, so 20*2=40. 40/22 is 20/11, which is approximately 1.818 amu.

But the bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R².

But wait, amu (atomic mass units) need to be converted into kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(22) amu = (40/22) amu ≈ (20/11) amu ≈ 1.818 amu.

So μ in kg is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818 * 1.6605) * 1e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.818 *1.6605.

1.8 * 1.6605 = approx 2.9889, and 0.018 *1.6605 ≈ 0.0299. So total is about 3.0188e-27 kg.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 20 amu is 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg. Similarly, 2 amu is 3.321e-27 kg. The reduced mass μ is (20 * 2)/(20 +2) = (40)/(22) = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu. So μ in kg is 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 1.81818 * 1.6605 is about 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Then, the rotational energy difference when J goes from 0 to 1.

E_rot_diff = ( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) * (ħ²/(2I)).

Wait, no. For J=0, E_rot = 0. For J=1, E_rot = ( ħ²/(2I) ) * 1*(1+1) ) = 2 ħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

So E_rot_diff is ħ²/(I).

Compute ħ²/(I).

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) (J² s²).

Wait, but I think a better approach would be to calculate it numerically.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I is 1.2072e-46 kg m².

So ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.2072e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step.

1.0545718e-34 squared is (1.0545718)^2 = approx 1.112, so 1.112e-68 J² s².

Divide by 1.2072e-46 kg m²: 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2072) * 1e-22 ≈ approx 0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

So E_rot_diff is approximately 9.21e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w (ground state) and E_vib for v=1 is 3/2 h w (but wait, no, vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = h w.

Given that w is 4e14 rad/s.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

So ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So comparing E_rot_diff (9.21e-23 J) and E_vib (2.65e-19 J), the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon must have energy equal to the rotational transition's energy, not the vibrational.

Wait, but wait. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. So the next possible energy level would either be v=0, J=1 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the next state the molecule would move to when absorbing a photon with the minimal energy.

So the photon's energy should match the rotational transition energy, E_rot_diff = 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, that's a very small energy. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy difference. Let me recalculate I and E_rot_diff carefully.

Wait, μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27.

1.818 * 1.6605 is approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

Then I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

E_rot_diff = ħ²/(2I) * [J(J+1) for J=1 minus J=0].

Wait, the formula for rotational energy is E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J (J+1).

So for J=0, E_rot is 0.

For J=1, E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * 1*2 = ħ²/(I).

So ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

So E_rot_diff = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2072e-46).

Let me compute that.

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Divided by 1.2072e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.2072e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2072) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

So yes, earlier calculation is correct.

Now, comparing to ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition is E=9.21e-23 J, which is way less than the vibrational.

So the photon's energy must be 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. So since E_photon = hν, and p = E/c, where c is the speed of light.

So p = E_photon / c.

So E_photon is 9.21e-23 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns range. Oh wait, 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s, so the units are consistent.

Wait, 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options given are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. Hmm, that's much larger than my calculation.

So something is wrong here. Where did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the transition. Maybe it's not a rotational transition but a vibrational transition. Because the options are way larger than what I calculated for the rotational transition.

Wait, let's recalculate the vibrational energy.

ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 J s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, the momentum p is E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 1.4e-28.

Option C is 1.1e-27.

Option A is 1.9e-28.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly matching.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute h w again.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 / (3e8) ≈ 8.8347e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.9e-28. But that's about half of my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate μ.

Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) =40/22 = 20/11 = approx 1.818 amu.

Wait, but maybe the calculation should use the exact value of mu in kg.

1.818 amu → 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Compute 1.818 * 1.6605e-27:

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute:

1.6605 * 1.8 = 3.0 (approx 3.0), 1.6605 *0.018= 0.029889.

So sum is around 3.029889.

So 3.029889e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² =3.029889e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

I =3.029889e-27 *4e-20 =1.211955e-46 kg m².

So E_rot_diff = ħ²/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.211955e-46.

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator:1.211955e-46.

So E_rot =1.112e-68 / 1.211955e-46 = approx 9.17e-23 J.

Which is about the same as before.

So the rotational transition energy is 9.17e-23 J, which gives a photon momentum of 9.17e-23 /3e8 ≈3.057e-31 kg m/s → 3.06e-31 N s.

But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I'm miscalculating which transition is the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to a transition where the molecule goes from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1), regardless of J. But if that's the case, the energy required is h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, which gives a photon momentum of 8.83e-28 kg m/s, about 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). Hmm, none match exactly. So perhaps I made an error elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the transition that changes both rotational and vibrational states in a way that minimizes the energy, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a combination of rotational and vibrational transitions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state, which could be the first vibrational excited state (v=1) but with J=0. So that would require the photon's energy to be h w.

Wait, but let's see, 8.83e-28 Ns is close to option D (1.4e-28) or option A (1.9e-28). Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h*w.

Wait, let me compute h*w again.

h =6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value).

w=4e14 rad/s.

h * w =6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = (6.62607015 *4) *1e-20 =26.5042806e-20 J.

Wait, 6.62607e-34 *4e14 = 26.50428e-20 J? No, wait, 1e-34 *1e14 =1e-20, yes. So 6.62607e-34 *4e14 = 26.50428e-20 J →2.650428e-19 J.

Wait, that's correct.

So p = 2.650428e-19 J / (3e8 m/s) =8.83476e-28 kg m/s →8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28 → about half of 8.83e-28.

Hmm, maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is twice the vibrational energy, but that doesn't make sense. The vibrational ground state is (v=0) and the first excited state is (v=1), so the energy difference is h w.

Wait, unless the model includes the zero-point energy, but I think the energy difference is still h w.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which includes bond length variation. So the moment of inertia isn't constant but varies with vibration. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy calculation for the transition.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is treated as a harmonic oscillator for vibration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but in the same vibrational state. But earlier calculation shows that the energy is 9.2e-23 J, which is less than the vibrational transition. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is expecting the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the options given are around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns. Let me compute 8.83e-28 Ns compared to the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 → about 2.14 times smaller than my calculation.

B)2.3e-27 → about 26 times larger.

C)1.1e-27 → about 12.5 times larger.

D)1.4e-28 → about 6.3 times smaller.

Hmm. So none match exactly. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy?

Wait, perhaps the model expects the energy to be the sum of the vibrational and rotational contributions. But that's only if the transition is a combination, but the question states "the next state with the lowest possible energy." I think that implies the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the rotational transition.

But since the options don't have the value I calculated, perhaps I messed up the model. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy of the photon as the sum of both transitions. But that would be a higher energy, which doesn't make sense for the minimal transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I incorrectly assumed the transition is purely vibrational. Maybe the correct approach is to calculate the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that would be for a transition where both change, but that's not the case for the minimal energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next possible state, which could be v=0, J=1 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon must have that energy. But as per my calculation, that gives 9.2e-23 J, which is way below the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state in terms of quantum numbers, but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Another possibility: perhaps the model uses the non-rigid rotor, which combines both rotational and vibrational aspects, but I'm not sure how that would change the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational energy difference and see if that gives one of the options. Let me compute p for the vibrational transition.

ΔE_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s →8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about 2 times smaller. Hmm.

Wait, what if the problem considered the reduced mass incorrectly? Let me recheck the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, no, the reduced mass was correctly calculated as μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 =20/11 amu.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the moment of inertia to be calculated using the individual masses, not the reduced mass. But that can't be right, because the moment of inertia for a diatomic is μ R².

Wait, perhaps the model used in the problem is the rigid rotor, and only rotation is considered, but that isn't the case, as the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually considering a transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0, which would be the vibrational transition, requiring energy h w.

So the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 N s, but none of the options match exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the answer in terms of the options given.

Looking at options:

Option A:1.9e-28 Ns.

Option D:1.4e-28 Ns.

Option B:2.3e-27.

Option C:1.1e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h*w.

Wait, let me compute 6.626e-34 *4e14 again.

6.626e-34 *4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-20 =26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J. So that seems correct.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 Ns.

Hmm, that's approximately 8.8e-28.

But none of the options are exactly that. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) which is about 2.1 times smaller.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be the energy difference between v=0, J=0 and v=1, J=1. But that would require a photon with higher energy, which doesn't make sense for the minimal next state.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the vibrational energy. Wait, vibrational energy is quantized as E_vib = (v +1/2) h w. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using a different model, such as the Einstein oscillator model, where the energy levels are quantized as E_vib = h w (v +1/2). So the transition from v=0 to v=1 would require an energy of h w. But that brings me back to the same calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the photon's momentum is hbar * angular frequency divided by c. Because sometimes, when dealing with angular frequency, the momentum is p = ħ ω / c.

Wait, let's calculate that.

p = ħ ω / (c).

Wait, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So p = 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 / 3e8.

Compute numerator: 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 =4.218287e-20.

Divide by 3e8: 4.218287e-20 /3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s →1.406e-28 N s.

Ah, that's about 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

So perhaps I was supposed to calculate it this way, using p=ħω/c.

But wait, photon momentum is E/c. E = hν, but since ν = ω/(2π), E = h ν = ħ ω.

So p= E/c = (ħ ω)/c.

Ah, that's correct.

So p = (1.0545718e-34 J s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (3e8 m/s).

Calculating numerator: 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 =4.218287e-20 J s * rad/s.

But J is kg m²/s², so J s is kg m²/s.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the numbers.

So 1.0545718e-34 *4e14 = (1.0545718 *4) * 1e-20 =4.218287e-20.

Divide by 3e8: 4.218287e-20 /3e8 =1.406e-28 kg m/s →1.406e-28 Ns.

So that's approximately 1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

So that's the correct approach. So earlier mistake was calculating E as h w, but perhaps the correct formula for photon momentum is p = ħ w / c.

So the answer is option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the ground vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The goal is to calculate the momentum of the photon needed for the molecule to move to the next state with the smallest energy increase.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
  \]  
  Converting to kg:  
  \[
  \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.029 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

- **Angular frequency of vibration**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu R^2 = (3.029 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.211 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
  \]

### Energy Transitions:
1. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( J=0 \) to \( J=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \cdot \left[ J'(J'+1) - J(J+1) \right].
   \]  
   For \( J=0 \to J=1 \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} \cdot 2 = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.211 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This value is far smaller than the options provided, so the rotational transition is unlikely to be the intended answer.

2. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( v=0 \) to \( v=1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This value is closer to the options but does not match exactly.

3. **Alternative Calculation Using \( \hbar \omega / c \)**:  
   Photon momentum can also be expressed as:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\hbar \omega}{c}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):  
   \[
   p = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14})}{3 \times 10^8} = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
   \]  
   This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent result with the given options is obtained using \( p = \hbar \omega / c \), yielding a photon momentum of approximately \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \).
