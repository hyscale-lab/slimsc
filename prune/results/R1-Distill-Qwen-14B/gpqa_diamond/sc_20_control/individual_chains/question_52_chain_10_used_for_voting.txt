Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. 

Wait, the star's properties are given. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting. So when the star has spots, its photosphere is cooler overall.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes—no spots vs. spots.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy states is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, the ratio being considered is N1/N2, I think. Because when the Teff changes, the ratio would change based on temperature. Because the ratio depends exponentially on 1/T. 

So when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases. Let me model this. Let's denote T1 as 6000 K (no spots) and T2 as 5500 K (spots).

The ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Wait, wait. No, correction: the Boltzmann factor is (E2 - E1) in the exponent. So if E2 is higher than E1, then higher temperatures would lead to more population in the higher level because exp(-ΔE/(kT)) is smaller.

Wait no, wait. Let me think. The Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), right? So if E2 > E1, then the higher the temperature, the closer the ratio approaches 1. Because at higher T, the exponent becomes less negative, so the denominator in N2/N1 (since N2 is higher level) is smaller.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because the Boltzmann distribution is N_i = N_total * (g_i) * exp( -E_i/(k T) ). So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

So when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes larger (since T is in denominator), so the exponential term increases. So N1/N2 increases, meaning the ratio gets bigger when T decreases. But wait, in the question, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, the observed ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, T is lower, and the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when T is higher.

Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Because according to the equation, when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So the exponential term increases, so N1/N2 increases. So if N1/N2 is higher when the star has spots (since T is lower), but the problem says the observed ratio decreases. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I got the ratio inverted. Maybe the ratio is N2/N1 instead of N1/N2.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T goes down, the ratio goes down. So if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T decreases, N2/N1 would decrease because the exponent would be (E2-E1)/(k T), which is larger, making the exponential factor larger. So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me re-derive.

The Boltzmann distribution: N_i = N * (g_i) * exp(-E_i/(k T)).

So for two levels, 1 and 2, their populations are N1 and N2.

So N1 = N * g1 * exp(-E1/(k T))

N2 = N * g2 * exp(-E2/(k T))

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1 (which is usual for excited state), then when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp that is smaller. So N1/N2 decreases with increasing T.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think numerically. Suppose E2-E1 is positive, say 1000 K in terms of energy (but wait, E is in ergs or something, but T in K. So for example, suppose E2-E1 = 10,000 K * k (so this is something similar to E= k T when T=10,000 K). Then, at T=6000 K, (E2-E1)/(kT)= 10000 /6000 ≈ 1.6667. Exponential of that is about 5.29.

At T=5500 K, (E2-E1)/(k T)= 10000/5500≈1.818. Exponential is about 6.15.

So N1/N2 is proportional to exp(1.6667) and exp(1.818). So N1/N2 is higher at lower T, because the exponent is higher.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (N1/N2) decreases. But according to this, when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher. So perhaps the ratio that's being measured is N2/N1 instead. Because if the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, that would imply when T decreases, the ratio (N2/N1) decreases.

Wait, let's think again. If the ratio being observed is N1/N2, then when the spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio N1/N2 is higher than when T=6000 K. Because as T decreases, N1/N2 increases. So if the observed ratio is decreasing when spots are present, that would mean the ratio is N2/N1, which at lower T is lower.

Ah, perhaps the problem refers to N2/N1. Let me read the problem again: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels". So it's ratio could be N1/N2 or N2/N1, depending on how they're considering it. The problem says this ratio decreases when the star has spots, so when T decreases. 

So, if the ratio is N1/N2, then as T decreases, N1/N2 increases—so the observed ratio would increase, which contradicts the problem statement. Alternatively, if the ratio is N2/N1, then as T decreases, N2/N1 would decrease, which fits the observation.

So the correct ratio to consider is N2/N1. Because when the star has spots, the Teff is lower, and N2/N1 is lower. Therefore, the observed ratio (N2/N1) is lower when the spots are present.

Now, the question is, what is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So the factor is (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_spots.

But wait, let me clarify: the factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = [(N2/N1)_6000] / [(N2/N1)_5500].

Because the question says, "when the star does not have spots" compared to "when it has spots"—so the factor is (no spots) divided by (spots), meaning how much bigger is the ratio when there are no spots.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when going from no spots (higher T) to spots (lower T), the ratio (which we now think is N2/N1) decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

So we need to compute (N2/N1)_6000 / (N2/N1)_5500.

But wait, according to the Boltzmann equation, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So the ratio depends on (E2-E1) and T.

Wait, but the question also gives the wavelength corresponding to the transition between the two levels: 1448 Angstroms. So we can find the energy difference between the two levels. Because the energy of a photon is E = hc / λ.

So, E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So, E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = let's compute this.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Now, to get E in terms of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38e-23 J/K), we can compute E/(k) to get the temperature equivalent.

E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.95e4 K. So approximately 10^5 K.

Wait, but the temperatures we're dealing with are 6000 K and 5500 K, which are much lower. Hmmm. So the energy difference is much larger than the thermal energies at these temperatures. So, that suggests that the ratio N2/N1 is very small, as higher energy states are sparsely populated.

But regardless, we can proceed with the calculation.

So, the two temperatures are T1 = 6000 K and T2 = 5500 K.

The ratio (N2/N1) is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Since E2-E1 is positive (as E2 is higher), the exponent is negative.

Wait, but in the calculation, we have E = hc/λ. Wait, wait a second. Because when an electron transitions from level 2 to level 1, it emits a photon of wavelength 1448 Å. So E2-E1 = hc/λ. So yes, that's correct.

So substituting the numbers:

E = hc/λ ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 99417 K ≈ 99,417 K.

So, E/(k) ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Now, when T is 6000 K, (E/k)/T = 9.94e4 /6e3 ≈ 16.567.

Similarly, when T is 5500 K, (E/k)/T = 9.94e4 /5.5e3 ≈ 18.07.

So, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is -(E/(k*T)).

So, for T1 = 6000 K: exponent = -9.94e4 /6e3 ≈ -16.567.

For T2 =5500 K: exponent = -9.94e4/5.5e3 ≈ -18.07.

So, the ratio (N2/N1) for T1: proportional to exp(-16.567).

For T2: exp(-18.07).

To find the factor by which the ratio changes, we compute (N2/N1)_T1 / (N2/N1)_T2 = [exp(-16.567) / exp(-18.07)] = exp( (-16.567) + 18.07 ) = exp(1.503).

What's exp(1.503)? Let's compute that. Approximately, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, and e^0.003 is about 1.003, so 4.4817 * 1.003 ≈ 4.496.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. The exponent is 1.503.

We can calculate e^1.503:

We know that e^1 = 2.71828, e^0.5 ≈ 1.6487, so e^1.5 = e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.4817.

Now, e^1.503 is e^(1.5 + 0.003) = e^1.5 * e^0.003 ≈ 4.4817 * (1 + 0.003 + (0.003)^2/2) ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0030045 ≈ 4.4817 + 4.4817 * 0.0030045.

4.4817 * 0.003 is approx 0.013445.

So, 4.4817 + 0.013445 ≈ 4.4951.

So, approximately 4.495.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches this.

So the factor is about 4.5 times.

So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels, \( N_2/N_1 \), under the given conditions. The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Energy Difference**: The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), the energy difference is calculated as:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to temperature units using \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{E}{k} \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,417 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Temperatures**: When the star has no spots, \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \).

3. **Ratio of Ratios**: The factor by which the ratio \( N_2/N_1 \) changes is given by:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
   \]

### Calculation:
Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = 99,417 \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right).
\]
\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = \frac{-500}{33,000,000} \approx -0.00001515.
\]
\[
\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) \approx 99,417 \times (-0.00001515) \approx -1.503.
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.503) \approx 0.222.
\]

### Interpretation:
The factor by which the ratio \( N_2/N_1 \) changes is approximately \( 1 / 0.222 \approx 4.5 \). This matches option **C**.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. 

Wait, the star's properties are given. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting. So when the star has spots, its photosphere is cooler overall.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes—no spots vs. spots.

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy states is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, the ratio being considered is N1/N2, I think. Because when the Teff changes, the ratio would change based on temperature. Because the ratio depends exponentially on 1/T. 

So when the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases. Let me model this. Let's denote T1 as 6000 K (no spots) and T2 as 5500 K (spots).

The ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Wait, wait. No, correction: the Boltzmann factor is (E2 - E1) in the exponent. So if E2 is higher than E1, then higher temperatures would lead to more population in the higher level because exp(-ΔE/(kT)) is smaller.

Wait no, wait. Let me think. The Boltzmann factor is exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), right? So if E2 > E1, then the higher the temperature, the closer the ratio approaches 1. Because at higher T, the exponent becomes less negative, so the denominator in N2/N1 (since N2 is higher level) is smaller.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because the Boltzmann distribution is N_i = N_total * (g_i) * exp( -E_i/(k T) ). So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

So when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes larger (since T is in denominator), so the exponential term increases. So N1/N2 increases, meaning the ratio gets bigger when T decreases. But wait, in the question, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, the observed ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, T is lower, and the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when T is higher.

Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Because according to the equation, when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So the exponential term increases, so N1/N2 increases. So if N1/N2 is higher when the star has spots (since T is lower), but the problem says the observed ratio decreases. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I got the ratio inverted. Maybe the ratio is N2/N1 instead of N1/N2.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T goes down, the ratio goes down. So if the ratio is N2/N1, then when T decreases, N2/N1 would decrease because the exponent would be (E2-E1)/(k T), which is larger, making the exponential factor larger. So N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me re-derive.

The Boltzmann distribution: N_i = N * (g_i) * exp(-E_i/(k T)).

So for two levels, 1 and 2, their populations are N1 and N2.

So N1 = N * g1 * exp(-E1/(k T))

N2 = N * g2 * exp(-E2/(k T))

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1 (which is usual for excited state), then when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp that is smaller. So N1/N2 decreases with increasing T.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think numerically. Suppose E2-E1 is positive, say 1000 K in terms of energy (but wait, E is in ergs or something, but T in K. So for example, suppose E2-E1 = 10,000 K * k (so this is something similar to E= k T when T=10,000 K). Then, at T=6000 K, (E2-E1)/(kT)= 10000 /6000 ≈ 1.6667. Exponential of that is about 5.29.

At T=5500 K, (E2-E1)/(k T)= 10000/5500≈1.818. Exponential is about 6.15.

So N1/N2 is proportional to exp(1.6667) and exp(1.818). So N1/N2 is higher at lower T, because the exponent is higher.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (N1/N2) decreases. But according to this, when T is lower, N1/N2 is higher. So perhaps the ratio that's being measured is N2/N1 instead. Because if the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present, that would imply when T decreases, the ratio (N2/N1) decreases.

Wait, let's think again. If the ratio being observed is N1/N2, then when the spots are present (T=5500 K), the ratio N1/N2 is higher than when T=6000 K. Because as T decreases, N1/N2 increases. So if the observed ratio is decreasing when spots are present, that would mean the ratio is N2/N1, which at lower T is lower.

Ah, perhaps the problem refers to N2/N1. Let me read the problem again: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

Wait, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels". So it's ratio could be N1/N2 or N2/N1, depending on how they're considering it. The problem says this ratio decreases when the star has spots, so when T decreases. 

So, if the ratio is N1/N2, then as T decreases, N1/N2 increases—so the observed ratio would increase, which contradicts the problem statement. Alternatively, if the ratio is N2/N1, then as T decreases, N2/N1 would decrease, which fits the observation.

So the correct ratio to consider is N2/N1. Because when the star has spots, the Teff is lower, and N2/N1 is lower. Therefore, the observed ratio (N2/N1) is lower when the spots are present.

Now, the question is, what is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So the factor is (N2/N1)_no_spots / (N2/N1)_spots.

But wait, let me clarify: the factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = [(N2/N1)_6000] / [(N2/N1)_5500].

Because the question says, "when the star does not have spots" compared to "when it has spots"—so the factor is (no spots) divided by (spots), meaning how much bigger is the ratio when there are no spots.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when going from no spots (higher T) to spots (lower T), the ratio (which we now think is N2/N1) decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

So we need to compute (N2/N1)_6000 / (N2/N1)_5500.

But wait, according to the Boltzmann equation, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So the ratio depends on (E2-E1) and T.

Wait, but the question also gives the wavelength corresponding to the transition between the two levels: 1448 Angstroms. So we can find the energy difference between the two levels. Because the energy of a photon is E = hc / λ.

So, E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So, E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = let's compute this.

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Now, to get E in terms of k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant (1.38e-23 J/K), we can compute E/(k) to get the temperature equivalent.

E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 9.95e4 K. So approximately 10^5 K.

Wait, but the temperatures we're dealing with are 6000 K and 5500 K, which are much lower. Hmmm. So the energy difference is much larger than the thermal energies at these temperatures. So, that suggests that the ratio N2/N1 is very small, as higher energy states are sparsely populated.

But regardless, we can proceed with the calculation.

So, the two temperatures are T1 = 6000 K and T2 = 5500 K.

The ratio (N2/N1) is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Since E2-E1 is positive (as E2 is higher), the exponent is negative.

Wait, but in the calculation, we have E = hc/λ. Wait, wait a second. Because when an electron transitions from level 2 to level 1, it emits a photon of wavelength 1448 Å. So E2-E1 = hc/λ. So yes, that's correct.

So substituting the numbers:

E = hc/λ ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

E/(k) = (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 99417 K ≈ 99,417 K.

So, E/(k) ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Now, when T is 6000 K, (E/k)/T = 9.94e4 /6e3 ≈ 16.567.

Similarly, when T is 5500 K, (E/k)/T = 9.94e4 /5.5e3 ≈ 18.07.

So, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is -(E/(k*T)).

So, for T1 = 6000 K: exponent = -9.94e4 /6e3 ≈ -16.567.

For T2 =5500 K: exponent = -9.94e4/5.5e3 ≈ -18.07.

So, the ratio (N2/N1) for T1: proportional to exp(-16.567).

For T2: exp(-18.07).

To find the factor by which the ratio changes, we compute (N2/N1)_T1 / (N2/N1)_T2 = [exp(-16.567) / exp(-18.07)] = exp( (-16.567) + 18.07 ) = exp(1.503).

What's exp(1.503)? Let's compute that. Approximately, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, and e^0.003 is about 1.003, so 4.4817 * 1.003 ≈ 4.496.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. The exponent is 1.503.

We can calculate e^1.503:

We know that e^1 = 2.71828, e^0.5 ≈ 1.6487, so e^1.5 = e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.71828 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.4817.

Now, e^1.503 is e^(1.5 + 0.003) = e^1.5 * e^0.003 ≈ 4.4817 * (1 + 0.003 + (0.003)^2/2) ≈ 4.4817 * 1.0030045 ≈ 4.4817 + 4.4817 * 0.0030045.

4.4817 * 0.003 is approx 0.013445.

So, 4.4817 + 0.013445 ≈ 4.4951.

So, approximately 4.495.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches this.

So the factor is about 4.5 times.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels, \( N_2/N_1 \), under the given conditions. The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Energy Difference**: The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), the energy difference is calculated as:
   \[
   E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to temperature units using \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), we find:
   \[
   \frac{E}{k} \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,417 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Temperatures**: When the star has no spots, \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \).

3. **Ratio of Ratios**: The factor by which the ratio \( N_2/N_1 \) changes is given by:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{N_2}{N_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
   \]

### Calculation:
Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = 99,417 \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right).
\]
\[
\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = \frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \times 5500} = \frac{-500}{33,000,000} \approx -0.00001515.
\]
\[
\frac{E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) \approx 99,417 \times (-0.00001515) \approx -1.503.
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.503) \approx 0.222.
\]

### Interpretation:
The factor by which the ratio \( N_2/N_1 \) changes is approximately \( 1 / 0.222 \approx 4.5 \). This matches option **C**.
