Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step. 

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. They say that Ay is a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. So I can write this out as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c, we get:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Wait, but actually, in quantum mechanics, spin matrices are often represented using Pauli matrices. Let me think, the Pauli Y matrix is usually [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly S here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. Then, the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) times the Pauli Y matrix. 

But wait, in angular momentum, the spin operators are often written as S = ħ/2 * sigma, where sigma are the Pauli matrices. So the usual spin Y component would be S_y = ħ/(2) * sigma_y. Hmm, so in this case, Ay is given as c * S, which is (h/(4π)) * sigma_y. Let me compute what c is in terms of ħ. Since ħ is h/(2π), so h is 2πħ. Then c = (2πħ)/(4π) ) = ħ/2. Oh, so c is ħ/2. So Ay is (ħ/2) * sigma_y. So that's the standard S_y matrix, right? Because S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So Ay is the spin Y component operator for spin-1/2 particles.

So the eigenvalue equation is Ay |φ> = a |φ>. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues a should be ± ħ/2. Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute it properly.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute that matrix. Let's compute each element:

First row: (h/(4π)) * [0, -i] → [0, -i h/(4π) ]

Second row: (h/(4π)) * [i, 0] → [i h/(4π), 0 ]

Alternatively, since sigma_y is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. So when Ay is (h/(4π)) sigma_y, the eigenvalues would be ± (h/(4π)) * 1 = ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait, that's not right because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by a scalar, the eigenvalues get scaled by that scalar. So yes, the eigenvalues of Ay would be ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but earlier I thought that S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y, which would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Let me check that. ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). Oh, so that's matching! Because if Ay is (h/(4π)) sigma_y, then the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) multiplied by ±1, which gives ± h/(4π) = ± ħ/2, since ħ is h/(2π). Wait, no: ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So yes, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is equal to ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what they say.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, and real are ±h/(4π). Wait, but eigenvalues of Ay are real, because spin components are Hermitian operators, so their eigenvalues must be real. So any option that suggests imaginary parts in the eigenvalues must be wrong. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, eigenvalues are real, so this option's statement about imaginary parts is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az. Hmm. Let me think. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenfunctions of S_y are not the same as those for S_z. But S^2 is the square of the spin operator, which commutes with all components, so the eigenfunctions of S_y are also eigenfunctions of S^2. Because S^2 is diagonal in any basis, including the S_y basis. So C's first part is correct: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A².

But the second part: not eigenfunctions of Az? Well, in the eigenbasis of S_y, the S_z operator doesn't have the same eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of S_y are not eigenfunctions of S_z. So the statement in option C is correct. So C could be the right answer.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, which in this case is 2-dimensional, so two eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (eigenvectors) of the operator. So option D says that, so it's correct. But wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's consider each option.

Wait, but let's look again. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so it's a spin-1/2 system. It's a Hermitian operator, so it'll have two real eigenvalues. The eigenvectors will form an orthogonal basis. So the eigenfunctions φ are the eigenvectors of Ay, which form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So option D's statement is correct, because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So D is a correct statement.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C is correct. So now I'm confused. Let's reevaluate.

The question is: which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, the calculation involves finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A is the angular momentum operator, which for spin is S, then A² would be S², which for spin-1/2 is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I, where I is the identity matrix. So yes, any eigenstate of S_y is also an eigenstate of S². So C's first part is correct. The second part: not eigenfunctions of Az. Because S_x, S_y, S_z don't share eigenstates except in trivial cases, so yes, the eigenfunctions of S_y are not eigenfunctions of S_z. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So yes, D is correct as well.

Wait, but looking at the options, I have to choose which statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct, but I'm not sure yet. Let's think about all options.

Wait, looking back at option A: it says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But eigenvalues are real, so they can't have imaginary parts. So A is wrong.

Option B: Im part ±1/2, real ±1. But as I calculated, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which is real. So B is wrong.

So the only possible correct options are C and D.

Now, let's think about option D: the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two in number and orthogonal. Thus, they form a basis for the space. So yes, the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

So could both C and D be correct? Or is only one correct?

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So I'll evaluate each option's validity.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So since A² is (S·S) which commutes with all components, and the eigenfunctions of S_y are eigenfunctions of S². So yes, the first part is correct. The second part: they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Correct, because the eigenfunctions of S_y don't satisfy S_z |φ> = s_z |φ>, except for specific cases, which don't apply here. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. As the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct, so both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, in the problem statement, the operator Ay is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So option D's statement is correct.

So both C and D could be correct, but maybe only one of them is.

Wait, looking at option C: "the eigenfunctions of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." So the statement is that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is the square of the spin operator, which commutes with all components, any eigenstate of S_y is also an eigenstate of S². So the first part of C is correct.

The second part: but not eigenfunctions of Az. Correct, because S_y and S_z don't share eigenfunctions except in specific cases (like when the state is a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't possible unless it's a state with definite S² and Sz, but even then, S_x, S_y, S_z don't share eigenstates except for special cases).

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Because the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

So both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps C is correct and D is correct. But the question is which one is correct.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Wait, D seems correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So I'm a bit torn between C and D.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to see.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So to find eigenvalues, I need to solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π)) * (-i) ],
  [ (h/(4π)) * i , (h/(4π)) * 0 ] ]

Which is:

[ [0, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), 0 ] ]

The eigenvalues are found by solving:

(0 - a)(0 - a) - ( -i h/(4π) ) (i h/(4π) ) = 0

Compute:

a^2 - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ] = 0

(-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.

So:

a^2 - (1) (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) = 0 → a^2 = h^2/(16 π^2) → a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So these are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

So the eigenvalues are a = ± ħ/2, since ħ = h/(2π).

Now, the eigenvectors: for a = h/(4π), which is ħ/2.

We have to solve (Ay - a I) v = 0.

So matrix becomes:

[ [ -a , -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -a ] ]

Substituting a = h/(4π), which is ħ/2.

So the matrix is:

[ [ -h/(4π), -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -h/(4π) ] ]

Which simplifies to:

[ [-a, -i a ],
  [i a, -a ] ]

Assuming a = h/(4π).

Now, to find the eigenvectors, we can take any non-trivial solution.

Taking the first row:

- a v1 - i a v2 = 0 → v1 = (-i) v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly for a = -h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

[ [ a, -i a ],
  [i a, a ] ]

Row 1: a v1 - i a v2 = 0 → v1 = i v2.

So eigenvectors proportional to [i, 1].

So the eigenfunctions are proportional to these vectors, which form a basis for the 2D space. So D is correct, as the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² is S², which for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2)^2 I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue (3ħ²/4) if it's spin 3/2? Wait, no. Wait, for spin 1/2, S² is (ħ/2)^2 I, so its eigenvalue is (ħ/2)^2 * 2 * (1/2)(1/2 +1)). Wait, no. S² for spin s is s(s+1) ħ^2. So for s=1/2, S² = (1/2)(3/2) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2. So any state is an eigenstate of S² with value 3ħ²/4. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² (since any vector is). So the first part of C is correct.

The second part: they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Correct, because if a state is an eigenstate of S_y, it's not an eigenstate of S_z (unless the state is a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't possible for different components except in specific cases, which don't apply here). So option C's statement is correct.

So now, which options are correct? Both C and D seem correct, but that can't be the case since it's a multiple-choice question, probably only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I have to read the options again. Let me look at option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two functions that form a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct? But I have to choose between the options.

Wait, the question is which statements are correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one is correct. Let me reevaluate each option.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

So if both C and D are correct, but the options don't have an option that says both, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the matrix Ay is not Hermitian? Let's check. For an operator to be Hermitian, its matrix must be equal to its conjugate transpose.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let's compute its conjugate transpose.

The conjugate of each element:

0 remains 0.

- i becomes +i.

i becomes -i.

So the conjugate matrix is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Then, the transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements. So the conjugate transpose would be [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as the original matrix. So Ay is Hermitian, which makes sense because angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

So this confirms that Ay is Hermitian, and the eigenvalues are real, as we found.

Looking back, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which is the same as ± ħ/2 since ħ = h/(2π).

Now, considering the options again:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh. No, eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is real and ± h/(4π). So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Correct.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Correct.

So, both C and D are correct statements. But the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about option D again. The statement is: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." The matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, perhaps the correct statements are C and D, but the options don't allow that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about option D. The statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix operator has these eigenvectors as its basis. So yes, D is correct.

But the options are A, B, C, D. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and D are correct, but that's not the case. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that C is correct.

Wait, no, C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. As A² is (S·S) which is a scalar operator, any state is an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part, not eigenfunctions of Az, is correct as well. So C is correct.

So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. But in the given options, both C and D are possible, but I have to choose which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the eigenvalues are real and not complex. So option A and B are wrong. Option C and D are correct, but perhaps the question allows only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible answers.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So when I'm calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which of these statements is true.

Option C: the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So during the calculation, I find that the eigenfunctions form a basis (so D is correct) and that any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A² but not Az. So both C and D are correct. But the options don't have an option that combines both.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a detail in the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.

Wait, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and c is h/(4π). So S is the Pauli Y matrix, and Ay is (h/(4π)) * S. So Ay is (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

Now, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are real. So any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A² (since A² is S², which is (ħ/2)^2 * I, so any vector is an eigenstate with eigenvalue (ħ/2)^2 * 2 (since for spin 1/2, s=1/2, s(s+1) = 3/4, so S² = (3ħ^2/4) I? Wait, no, wait S² is ħ^2 s(s+1). So for s=1/2, S² = ħ^2 (1/2)(1/2 +1) )= ħ^2 (3/4) ) = (3/4) ħ^2 I. So A² is (3/4) ħ^2 I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct.

So the correct statements would be option C and D. But in the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read again: the operator Ay is given as c·S, where c = h/(4π), and S is the matrix given. So Ay is (h/(4π)) * S. Which, as I thought, is (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So when looking at the options:

Option A: the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, which can't be right.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1, which is also wrong.

So A and B are incorrect.

Between C and D, perhaps both are correct, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, no, let me think again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D are correct statements. But perhaps only one is correct in the options.

Hmm, perhaps C is correct because the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is another component. But D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

Wait, but the question gives only one correct option. I must have made a mistake. Let me go back.

Wait, another approach: the matrix Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors, which are orthogonal. So the eigenfunctions are an orthonormal basis. So option D is correct.

Which option is correct: perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, when I find the eigenvectors, I can see that they form a basis. So D is correct.

But I'm also thinking that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az, so C is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation, which would include the fact that the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az.

Alternatively, if I have to choose between the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible options again.

The options are:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real.

B) Imaginary ±1/2, real ±1. No, eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π).

C) Eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

D) Eigenfunctions are the basis of the operator.

So, both C and D are correct.

Wait, but in the options, all are independent. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But looking back, the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about the correct statements. The correct eigenvalues are real, so A and B are out.

So between C and D. Both are correct, but perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: in the problem statement, the matrix S is given, and the operator is Ay = c S. So I'm to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So during the calculation, I find that the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are real. The eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct. Also, since the operator is Hermitian, the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

But the question is which statement during the calculation is correct. So, perhaps all the correct statements are either C or D.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the answer as option C.

But wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, but are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \cdot S \), the eigenvalues are found to be \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which is equivalent to \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) since \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors corresponding to \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \) are proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), respectively. These eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the 2-dimensional space.

3. **Analysis of the Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real.
   - **Option B:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is a scalar operator (\( A^2 = \frac{3\hbar^2}{4} I \)) and commutes with all components, making any eigenstate of \( A_y \) also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, eigenstates of \( A_y \) are not eigenstates of \( A_z \) due to the angular momentum algebra.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the 2-dimensional space.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for a single correct statement during the calculation, the most relevant choice is **Option C**, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is central to the problem.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step. 

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. They say that Ay is a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. So I can write this out as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c, we get:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Wait, but actually, in quantum mechanics, spin matrices are often represented using Pauli matrices. Let me think, the Pauli Y matrix is usually [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly S here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. Then, the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) times the Pauli Y matrix. 

But wait, in angular momentum, the spin operators are often written as S = ħ/2 * sigma, where sigma are the Pauli matrices. So the usual spin Y component would be S_y = ħ/(2) * sigma_y. Hmm, so in this case, Ay is given as c * S, which is (h/(4π)) * sigma_y. Let me compute what c is in terms of ħ. Since ħ is h/(2π), so h is 2πħ. Then c = (2πħ)/(4π) ) = ħ/2. Oh, so c is ħ/2. So Ay is (ħ/2) * sigma_y. So that's the standard S_y matrix, right? Because S_y = (ħ/2) sigma_y. So Ay is the spin Y component operator for spin-1/2 particles.

So the eigenvalue equation is Ay |φ> = a |φ>. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues a should be ± ħ/2. Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute it properly.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me compute that matrix. Let's compute each element:

First row: (h/(4π)) * [0, -i] → [0, -i h/(4π) ]

Second row: (h/(4π)) * [i, 0] → [i h/(4π), 0 ]

Alternatively, since sigma_y is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1. So when Ay is (h/(4π)) sigma_y, the eigenvalues would be ± (h/(4π)) * 1 = ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait, that's not right because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by a scalar, the eigenvalues get scaled by that scalar. So yes, the eigenvalues of Ay would be ± (h/(4π)).

Wait, but earlier I thought that S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y, which would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Let me check that. ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). Oh, so that's matching! Because if Ay is (h/(4π)) sigma_y, then the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) multiplied by ±1, which gives ± h/(4π) = ± ħ/2, since ħ is h/(2π). Wait, no: ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So yes, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is equal to ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues a are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see what they say.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, and real are ±h/(4π). Wait, but eigenvalues of Ay are real, because spin components are Hermitian operators, so their eigenvalues must be real. So any option that suggests imaginary parts in the eigenvalues must be wrong. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, eigenvalues are real, so this option's statement about imaginary parts is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az. Hmm. Let me think. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenfunctions of S_y are not the same as those for S_z. But S^2 is the square of the spin operator, which commutes with all components, so the eigenfunctions of S_y are also eigenfunctions of S^2. Because S^2 is diagonal in any basis, including the S_y basis. So C's first part is correct: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A².

But the second part: not eigenfunctions of Az? Well, in the eigenbasis of S_y, the S_z operator doesn't have the same eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of S_y are not eigenfunctions of S_z. So the statement in option C is correct. So C could be the right answer.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space, which in this case is 2-dimensional, so two eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions (eigenvectors) of the operator. So option D says that, so it's correct. But wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So let's consider each option.

Wait, but let's look again. The matrix Ay is 2x2, so it's a spin-1/2 system. It's a Hermitian operator, so it'll have two real eigenvalues. The eigenvectors will form an orthogonal basis. So the eigenfunctions φ are the eigenvectors of Ay, which form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So option D's statement is correct, because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So D is a correct statement.

Wait, but earlier I thought option C is correct. So now I'm confused. Let's reevaluate.

The question is: which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, the calculation involves finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A is the angular momentum operator, which for spin is S, then A² would be S², which for spin-1/2 is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I, where I is the identity matrix. So yes, any eigenstate of S_y is also an eigenstate of S². So C's first part is correct. The second part: not eigenfunctions of Az. Because S_x, S_y, S_z don't share eigenstates except in trivial cases, so yes, the eigenfunctions of S_y are not eigenfunctions of S_z. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So yes, D is correct as well.

Wait, but looking at the options, I have to choose which statement is correct.

Wait, but the question is, which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct, but I'm not sure yet. Let's think about all options.

Wait, looking back at option A: it says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But eigenvalues are real, so they can't have imaginary parts. So A is wrong.

Option B: Im part ±1/2, real ±1. But as I calculated, the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which is real. So B is wrong.

So the only possible correct options are C and D.

Now, let's think about option D: the eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. The matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two in number and orthogonal. Thus, they form a basis for the space. So yes, the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

So could both C and D be correct? Or is only one correct?

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So I'll evaluate each option's validity.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So since A² is (S·S) which commutes with all components, and the eigenfunctions of S_y are eigenfunctions of S². So yes, the first part is correct. The second part: they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Correct, because the eigenfunctions of S_y don't satisfy S_z |φ> = s_z |φ>, except for specific cases, which don't apply here. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix Ay. As the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct, so both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, in the problem statement, the operator Ay is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So option D's statement is correct.

So both C and D could be correct, but maybe only one of them is.

Wait, looking at option C: "the eigenfunctions of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az." So the statement is that the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is the square of the spin operator, which commutes with all components, any eigenstate of S_y is also an eigenstate of S². So the first part of C is correct.

The second part: but not eigenfunctions of Az. Correct, because S_y and S_z don't share eigenfunctions except in specific cases (like when the state is a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't possible unless it's a state with definite S² and Sz, but even then, S_x, S_y, S_z don't share eigenstates except for special cases).

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. Because the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

So both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps C is correct and D is correct. But the question is which one is correct.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Wait, D seems correct because the eigenvectors form a basis. So I'm a bit torn between C and D.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to see.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So to find eigenvalues, I need to solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay is:

[ [ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π)) * (-i) ],
  [ (h/(4π)) * i , (h/(4π)) * 0 ] ]

Which is:

[ [0, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), 0 ] ]

The eigenvalues are found by solving:

(0 - a)(0 - a) - ( -i h/(4π) ) (i h/(4π) ) = 0

Compute:

a^2 - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ] = 0

(-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1.

So:

a^2 - (1) (h^2/(16 π^2)) ) = 0 → a^2 = h^2/(16 π^2) → a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So these are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

So the eigenvalues are a = ± ħ/2, since ħ = h/(2π).

Now, the eigenvectors: for a = h/(4π), which is ħ/2.

We have to solve (Ay - a I) v = 0.

So matrix becomes:

[ [ -a , -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -a ] ]

Substituting a = h/(4π), which is ħ/2.

So the matrix is:

[ [ -h/(4π), -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -h/(4π) ] ]

Which simplifies to:

[ [-a, -i a ],
  [i a, -a ] ]

Assuming a = h/(4π).

Now, to find the eigenvectors, we can take any non-trivial solution.

Taking the first row:

- a v1 - i a v2 = 0 → v1 = (-i) v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly for a = -h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

[ [ a, -i a ],
  [i a, a ] ]

Row 1: a v1 - i a v2 = 0 → v1 = i v2.

So eigenvectors proportional to [i, 1].

So the eigenfunctions are proportional to these vectors, which form a basis for the 2D space. So D is correct, as the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² is S², which for spin-1/2 is (ħ/2)^2 I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue (3ħ²/4) if it's spin 3/2? Wait, no. Wait, for spin 1/2, S² is (ħ/2)^2 I, so its eigenvalue is (ħ/2)^2 * 2 * (1/2)(1/2 +1)). Wait, no. S² for spin s is s(s+1) ħ^2. So for s=1/2, S² = (1/2)(3/2) ħ^2 = (3/4) ħ^2. So any state is an eigenstate of S² with value 3ħ²/4. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² (since any vector is). So the first part of C is correct.

The second part: they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Correct, because if a state is an eigenstate of S_y, it's not an eigenstate of S_z (unless the state is a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't possible for different components except in specific cases, which don't apply here). So option C's statement is correct.

So now, which options are correct? Both C and D seem correct, but that can't be the case since it's a multiple-choice question, probably only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I have to read the options again. Let me look at option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two functions that form a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct? But I have to choose between the options.

Wait, the question is which statements are correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one is correct. Let me reevaluate each option.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

So if both C and D are correct, but the options don't have an option that says both, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the matrix Ay is not Hermitian? Let's check. For an operator to be Hermitian, its matrix must be equal to its conjugate transpose.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let's compute its conjugate transpose.

The conjugate of each element:

0 remains 0.

- i becomes +i.

i becomes -i.

So the conjugate matrix is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Then, the transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements. So the conjugate transpose would be [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the same as the original matrix. So Ay is Hermitian, which makes sense because angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

So this confirms that Ay is Hermitian, and the eigenvalues are real, as we found.

Looking back, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which is the same as ± ħ/2 since ħ = h/(2π).

Now, considering the options again:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh. No, eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is real and ± h/(4π). So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Correct.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Correct.

So, both C and D are correct statements. But the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about option D again. The statement is: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." The matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, perhaps the correct statements are C and D, but the options don't allow that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about option D. The statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix operator has these eigenvectors as its basis. So yes, D is correct.

But the options are A, B, C, D. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and D are correct, but that's not the case. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that C is correct.

Wait, no, C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. As A² is (S·S) which is a scalar operator, any state is an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part, not eigenfunctions of Az, is correct as well. So C is correct.

So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. But in the given options, both C and D are possible, but I have to choose which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C because the eigenvalues are real and not complex. So option A and B are wrong. Option C and D are correct, but perhaps the question allows only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible answers.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So when I'm calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which of these statements is true.

Option C: the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So during the calculation, I find that the eigenfunctions form a basis (so D is correct) and that any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A² but not Az. So both C and D are correct. But the options don't have an option that combines both.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a detail in the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.

Wait, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and c is h/(4π). So S is the Pauli Y matrix, and Ay is (h/(4π)) * S. So Ay is (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

Now, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are real. So any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A² (since A² is S², which is (ħ/2)^2 * I, so any vector is an eigenstate with eigenvalue (ħ/2)^2 * 2 (since for spin 1/2, s=1/2, s(s+1) = 3/4, so S² = (3ħ^2/4) I? Wait, no, wait S² is ħ^2 s(s+1). So for s=1/2, S² = ħ^2 (1/2)(1/2 +1) )= ħ^2 (3/4) ) = (3/4) ħ^2 I. So A² is (3/4) ħ^2 I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct.

So the correct statements would be option C and D. But in the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read again: the operator Ay is given as c·S, where c = h/(4π), and S is the matrix given. So Ay is (h/(4π)) * S. Which, as I thought, is (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So when looking at the options:

Option A: the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, which can't be right.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1, which is also wrong.

So A and B are incorrect.

Between C and D, perhaps both are correct, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, no, let me think again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D are correct statements. But perhaps only one is correct in the options.

Hmm, perhaps C is correct because the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az, which is another component. But D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

Wait, but the question gives only one correct option. I must have made a mistake. Let me go back.

Wait, another approach: the matrix Ay is 2x2, so it has two eigenvalues and two eigenvectors, which are orthogonal. So the eigenfunctions are an orthonormal basis. So option D is correct.

Which option is correct: perhaps the correct answer is option C or D.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation, when I find the eigenvectors, I can see that they form a basis. So D is correct.

But I'm also thinking that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az, so C is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation, which would include the fact that the eigenfunctions are not eigenfunctions of Az.

Alternatively, if I have to choose between the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible options again.

The options are:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh, real ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real.

B) Imaginary ±1/2, real ±1. No, eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π).

C) Eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

D) Eigenfunctions are the basis of the operator.

So, both C and D are correct.

Wait, but in the options, all are independent. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But looking back, the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about the correct statements. The correct eigenvalues are real, so A and B are out.

So between C and D. Both are correct, but perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: in the problem statement, the matrix S is given, and the operator is Ay = c S. So I'm to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So during the calculation, I find that the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are real. The eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct. Also, since the operator is Hermitian, the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

But the question is which statement during the calculation is correct. So, perhaps all the correct statements are either C or D.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the answer as option C.

But wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az, but are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:
1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \cdot S \), the eigenvalues are found to be \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which is equivalent to \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) since \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \). These eigenvalues are real, as expected for a Hermitian operator.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors corresponding to \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \) are proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) and \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), respectively. These eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the 2-dimensional space.

3. **Analysis of the Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real.
   - **Option B:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is a scalar operator (\( A^2 = \frac{3\hbar^2}{4} I \)) and commutes with all components, making any eigenstate of \( A_y \) also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, eigenstates of \( A_y \) are not eigenstates of \( A_z \) due to the angular momentum algebra.
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is also correct because the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the 2-dimensional space.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for a single correct statement during the calculation, the most relevant choice is **Option C**, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is central to the problem.

ANSWER: C
