Okay, let's try to figure out what this compound is based on the spectroscopic data provided. So, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, the molecular ion is usually the molecular weight, but sometimes isotopic peaks can come into play. Chlorine has a significant isotopic abundance, so maybe the molecular formula includes Cl. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests the presence of an -OH group or maybe an amide or something else with strong hydrogen bonding. But the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 indicates a carbonyl group. Carbonyls like ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, or maybe esters. Wait, but carboxylic acid O-H would show a broad peak, but the IR here has a broad peak which could be an -OH, but the carbonyl is strong. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but their carbonyl is usually around 1700, and maybe a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe an ester or an acid chloride.

Wait, but looking at the options, some are benzoic acids or chloro compounds. Let's check each option.

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring at the para position, and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) attached. The molecular weight would be the benzene ring (78) plus Cl (35.5), COOH (44 + 1 for the acid, but wait COOH is 44 g/mol, but the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: C (12*7)=84, H (5)=5, Cl (35.5), O (2*16)=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Oh, but the molecular ion is at 156. That's close, but maybe the exact mass could vary or perhaps it's considering another structure. Alternatively, maybe the other peak at 158 is the molecular ion plus something else, perhaps a chlorine isotope.

Wait, chlorine has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and 25% for 37Cl. So, if the molecular ion is at 156 (M), then the M+2 peak would be 158, which is exactly what's given—32% relative abundance. So that makes sense. The molecular ion is M (about 75% abundance), and M+2 is 32%. Since 37Cl is 25%, the relative intensity would be about 25% for M+2. But the peak is 32%, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid: C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the exact mass. 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5 for Cl, and 2*16=32. Sum: 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So the molecular ion is at m/z 156.5, but in the data, it's given as 156. So perhaps it's rounded or maybe the exact mass isn't crucial here. The M+2 is 158, which would correspond to two Cl atoms? Or wait, no, with Cl having only one in the molecule. Wait, maybe the molecular formula is different.

Wait, let's think about the other options. Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, and molecular weight is 156.5. So, the molecular ion would be at 156 or 157? Wait, because 156.5 would round to 157, but the data says 156. Hmm, perhaps I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, wait. Let's compute 4-chlorobenzoic acid again. The formula is C7H5ClO2. So:

Carbon: 7 * 12 = 84
Hydrogen:5 *1=5
Chlorine:35.5
Oxygen: 2*16=32
Total: 84+5=89; 89+35.5=124.5; 124.5 +32=156.5. So the exact mass is 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at 156.5, which would appear as two peaks: the base peak at 156 (M) for 35Cl (75% abundance), and the M+2 at 158 (37Cl, 25% abundance). The question says the molecular ion is at 156 (100%), but that might be the base peak, but the other peak is at 158 (32%). Wait, 32% is less than 25% would suggest. Hmm, maybe that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, and the M+2 is 158, which is 32% of the molecular ion. Hmm, maybe the calculation is different.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula has two chlorines. Let's check option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So molecular formula would be C6H5COClO? Wait, no. Let me think: phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as 4-chlorobenzoic acid. So same molecular weight. So that can't help differentiate yet.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s,1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d,2H). So, the singlet at 11 ppm is probably an -OH proton, but wait, that's high. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but 11 is even higher. Or maybe a carboxylic acid -OH, but in DMSO or something, the OH might be a broad peak, but in the NMR given, it's a singlet. Wait, if the sample is in DMSO-d6, the OH might be exchanged and show as a broad peak, but in the data, it's a singlet, which suggests no splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps an aldehyde proton.

Wait, the singlet at 11 ppm is probably an -OH or an aldehyde. Let me think: in benzoic acid, the -COOH proton is a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But in NMR, a broad peak might not appear as a singlet, but perhaps in this case, it's a sharp singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. So, option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Its structure would have a Cl, a hydroxyl group, and an aldehyde. So, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. But in the data, it's 11 ppm, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, another option is that the singlet is an -OH from a phenol. But a phenol OH is usually around 5 ppm, but in some cases, under certain conditions, it can be downfield. But 11 ppm is more like a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde.

Looking back at the IR: the broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 could be an -OH stretch, which would be consistent with a carboxylic acid or phenol. But the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl. So, probably a carboxylic acid, since esters have carbonyls around 1740 or so, but benzoic acid is around 1680-1720. Wait, the IR in the data is 1720, which is a bit higher than typical benzoic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid chloride, which has a carbonyl around 1800 cm^-1, but 1720 is lower. Hmm.

Wait, if the compound is a phenyl chloroformate (option C), its structure would be Cl-CO-O-C6H5. The carbonyl would be around 1750 cm^-1, but the given IR is 1720, which is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, but the IR would then be around 1740.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR peaks. The 8.02 and 7.72 ppm as doublets. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, perhaps two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H, meaning a para-substituted benzene. So, the substituents are in the para positions. Let's consider the options.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure would have Cl and COOH in para positions. The benzoic acid group would cause the ring protons to be deshielded. The H NMR would show a doublet for the two H adjacent to the COOH group and another doublet for the H adjacent to Cl. But wait, in benzoic acid, the protons ortho to COOH are typically deshielded and appear around 8 ppm. For example, in para-substituted benzoic acids, the two protons next to the substituent would be a doublet. So, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two H adjacent to Cl would be at a certain shift, and the two H adjacent to COOH would be at another. So the NMR would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H, and maybe a singlet elsewhere.

But looking at the data, the NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm. If that's an -OH, then maybe it's a COOH group. So, the singlet would be the -OH, and the two doublets would be the aromatic protons. So, the -COOH group would cause the adjacent protons to appear around 8.02 ppm as a doublet (since they're next to COOH), and the other two protons adjacent to Cl would be at 7.72 as a doublet. That fits with the NMR data.

So, the structure would be 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's check the molecular weight again. C7H5ClO2: 7*12=84, 5=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So molecular ion is 156.5, but the data says 156 (100%), which is M. The M+2 would be 158, and the abundance is 32%, which is a bit higher than the 25% expected for one Cl. Hmm, but maybe because the molecular ion is a doublet (M and M+2), but wait, for one Cl, M is 35Cl (75% abundance), and M+2 is 37Cl (25%), so the peak at 158 should be 25% of the base peak. But the data says 32%, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps it's not the correct option.

Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula includes two Cl atoms. Let's look at the other options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as the other options. But the aldehyde group would have a proton at around 9-10 ppm. The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which could be the aldehyde. But then, the H next to aldehyde would be another set. Also, the IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1720 cm^-1, which fits an aldehyde. Wait, aldehyde carbonyls are around 1720-1750 cm^-1. So that fits. But the IR also has a broad peak, which could be the -OH from the hydroxy group. So, in this case, the structure would have both -CHO and -OH groups. Wait, but the NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm. Let me think: the aldehyde proton is usually a singlet. So in the structure, the aldehyde would be at position 2, and the hydroxy at position 3. So, the aromatic protons would be in a particular pattern. The NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. But if substituents are at 2 and 3 positions, the ring would have more complex splitting. So perhaps that's not matching.

Alternatively, let's consider option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at ortho position to COOH. The aromatic protons would be in a different pattern. The NMR given has two doublets, each 2H, which suggests that the substituents are in the para positions. So, 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have Cl and COOH in para. So the substituents are on positions 1 and 4. The aromatic protons would then be two sets of doublets. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option D), Cl is on position 2, COOH on position 1. The aromatic protons would be in different positions, perhaps a triplet and a doublet or something else. So, the NMR given with two doublets each 2H suggests a para-substituted structure, making option B more likely.

Back to the molecular formula. Wait, all four options have the same molecular formula? Let me check:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So, C7H5ClO2.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid: C7H5ClO2.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate: Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So, C7H5ClO2.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid: C7H5ClO2.

So all have the same molecular formula. So, the molecular weight is 156.5, which matches the molecular ion at 156. The M+2 at 158 (32%) is a bit confusing. But perhaps it's more about the NMR and IR.

The IR has a strong peak at 1720, which could be a carbonyl. If it's a benzoic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe a bit higher. For an acid chloride, it would be higher, like 1800. So 1720 is more like a benzoic acid. Alternatively, an ester would have higher wavenumbers, like 1740. Hmm.

In the NMR, the singlet at 11 ppm: if it's a benzoic acid, the -OH is usually broad, but in this case, it's a sharp singlet, which is confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton. But then the IR should show a peak around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. Wait, the IR given shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which could be the O-H stretch and possibly C-H stretch for aldehyde. But the 1720 is the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a phenol with an ester group. But let me think again.

Another point: in the 1H NMR, the singlet at 11 ppm. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would appear as a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But why is it a singlet here? Could it be because the solution is in DMSO, where the exchange is rapid, but sometimes the proton appears as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the -OH is de-shielded and appears as a sharp peak. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the singlet is an aldehyde proton, the IR should have a peak around 2800 cm^-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, which is usually a strong, sharp peak. The IR given doesn't mention that. So maybe the aldehyde is not present.

Wait, the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a wide range, which could suggest an -OH group, possibly in a carboxylic acid or phenol. The strong sharp peak at 1720 is the carbonyl.

So, combining this with the NMR: two doublets in aromatic region and a singlet at 11 ppm. Let's think about 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The -COOH would give a broad peak in IR, and the singlet in NMR would be the -OH. The aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, which fits.

But wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons adjacent to the COOH group are more deshielded and appear downfield. So, the two protons next to COOH would be around 8.0 ppm, and the two next to Cl would be around 7.5 ppm. Which matches the NMR data: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So that seems to fit.

So, the molecular ion is 156, the M+2 is 158, which is 32% abundance. Wait, but earlier I thought that would be 25% for Cl. Maybe the molecular ion is at 156, which is M (Cl-35), and the 158 is M+2 (Cl-37). The abundance would be 25% (since Cl has 25% 37Cl). But the data says 32%, which is higher than 25%. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 156 (the base peak) and the other peak is 158 (M+2), which is 32% of the base. That would mean that the 37Cl is 32% of the 35Cl. But natural abundance for 37Cl is about 24.2%, so that's close enough. Maybe the percentages are approximate.

So, putting it all together, the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** (100%) and a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** (32%) suggest the presence of chlorine, as chlorine isotopes (35Cl at 75% and 37Cl at 25%) typically produce such patterns. The molecular weight of 156 corresponds to the formula **C₇H₅ClO₂**, which matches all the given options.

### IR Analysis:
- The **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid or phenol.
- The **sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹** corresponds to a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid or an ester.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- The **singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H)** is characteristic of a carboxylic acid -OH proton, which is typically deshielded and appears in this region.
- The two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)** suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring, where the protons adjacent to the substituents are split into doublets.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - This compound contains both an aldehyde (-CHO) and a hydroxyl (-OH) group. However, the NMR data does not support this structure because the aldehyde proton typically appears as a singlet around 9-10 ppm, and the aromatic splitting pattern would be more complex due to the substituents at positions 2 and 3. Additionally, the IR data does not strongly support the presence of an aldehyde.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**  
   - This compound has a para-substituted benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. The NMR data fits well: the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons adjacent to the COOH and Cl substituents, respectively. The singlet at 11.0 ppm matches the -OH proton of the carboxylic acid. The IR data also aligns, with the broad peak corresponding to the -OH stretch and the sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponding to the carbonyl group. The molecular ion peak at 156 and the M+2 peak at 158 are consistent with the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes.

3. **Option C: Phenyl Chloroformate**  
   - This compound contains a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-). While the molecular formula matches, the IR data does not support this structure because the carbonyl stretch for an acid chloride typically appears at a higher wavenumber (~1800 cm⁻¹), whereas the given IR peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹. Additionally, the NMR data does not indicate the presence of an ester or acid chloride.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic Acid**  
   - This compound has a meta-substituted benzene ring with a chlorine atom and a carboxylic acid group. The NMR data does not support this structure because the aromatic proton splitting pattern would differ from the observed two doublets. The para-substitution observed in the NMR data is inconsistent with the ortho substitution in this compound.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data, including the molecular ion peak, IR, and NMR, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular formula, isotopic pattern, and splitting in the NMR all align with this structure.

**Answer: B**
