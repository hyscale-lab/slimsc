Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, is calculated based on the formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But in this case, we're dealing with a reaction, so I need to consider what happens to the starting material first.

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, meaning it has a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents on the ring are a formyl group (OCHO, actually, wait, formyl is -CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (which is a CH2CH2 group, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-) at position 5. Oh wait, no, wait: 5-vinylcyclohex would have the vinyl group attached to carbon 5.

Wait, no, the structure is cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Then, the substituents are at positions 2 (formyl) and 5 (vinyl). So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond, and two substituents.

So the molecule has a cyclohexene ring (which is a six-membered ring with a double bond), a formyl group (CHO), and a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), no, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure is something like:

- The cyclohexene ring: C1-C2-C3=C4-C5-C6.
- At C2, there's a formyl group: so C2 is connected to OCHO (as a substituent).
- At C5, there's a vinyl group: so C5 is connected to CH2CH2, but wait, no, the vinyl is CH2=CH–. So the substituent is a CH2CH2 group with a double bond between the first and second carbon of the substituent.

Wait, no, the vinyl group is a substituent like -CH2-CH2–? Or is it -CH2-CH2– with a double bond? Oh wait, no, vinyl is -CH2-CH2 but in reality, it's -CH2-CH2– with the double bond in the substituent: the vinyl group is CH2=CH– attached to the cyclohexene ring.

So the starting molecule has three rings or double bonds? Let me count the degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, to calculate the DoU of the starting compound. DoU is based on the formula: each ring or double bond contributes 1 degree, each triple bond 2, etc.

So the starting compound: let's think about the formula. Let's figure out the molecular formula.

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- Cyclohexene: C6H10O (since cyclohexene is C6H10, but wait, carboxylic acid would have an additional O and H.

Wait, the full formula: let's see.

The cyclohexene ring is C6H9 (since cyclohexene is C6H10, but with substituents, perhaps). Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure:

It's a cyclohexene ring (so six carbons, one double bond), and then two substituents: at position 2, a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH–).

So the parent ring is cyclohexene (C6H10). But wait, when you have substituents on the ring, the formula changes.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the full structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents: at position 2, a formyl group (CHO), at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH–), and at another position (probably position 1?), a carboxylic acid group (COOH). Wait, no, the numbering might be different.

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Wait, no. Wait, the numbering is such that the substituents have the lowest possible numbers. Let me think about the structure again.

Cyclohex-3-ene means the double bond is between C3 and C4. The substituents are:

- At C2: formyl group (CHO)
- At C5: vinyl group (CH2=CH–)
- Also, the carboxylic acid group is at position 1, I suppose? Because the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the COOH is at position 1.

Wait, no, the numbering would be done to give the substituents the lowest numbers. So the COOH is at position 1, the formyl (CHO) at position 2, and the vinyl at position 5.

So the ring has three substituents: COOH at 1, CHO at 2, and CH2CH2 (with a double bond in the substituent) at 5.

Wait, to write the structure, perhaps it's more efficient to think of it as:

- Carbon 1: COOH group (–COOH)
- Carbon 2: CHO group (–CHO)
- Carbon 5: CH2–CH2 group, but wait, the vinyl is CH2=CH– attached to carbon 5.

So, the substituent on C5 is a vinyl group, which is a double bond in the substituent.

So, the molecule has:

1. Cyclohexene ring (so one double bond)
2. Formyl group (CHO) at C2 (which is a double bond in the substituent)
3. Vinyl group (CH2=CH–) at C5 (another double bond)
4. Carboxylic acid group (COOH) at C1.

Wait, but the COOH doesn't contribute any double bonds because it's a carboxylic acid, which is a single bond (well, the COOH has a double bond in the carbonyl group, but that's part of the functional group.

So, how many double bonds in total in the starting compound?

Let me count:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 double bond
- Formyl group: the CHO has a double bond (C=O)
- Vinyl group: the substituent has a double bond (CH2=CH–)
- The COOH group: the carbonyl is another double bond.

Wait, but the COOH is part of the main chain, not a substituent. So, let's count all the double bonds.

So, the starting molecule has:

- 1 (from cyclohexene) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 4 double bonds?

Wait, no. Wait, the COOH's carbonyl is a double bond, so that's another one. So 4 double bonds in the molecule.

Wait, but wait, the cyclohexene is a ring with one double bond, then the substituents: formyl (CHO) brings a carbonyl (another double bond), the vinyl substituent (CH2=CH–) brings another double bond, and the COOH group has a carbonyl (another double bond). So that's four double bonds.

But wait, what about rings? The cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring. So that's one ring and one double bond, which counts as two degrees of unsaturation each, but wait, a ring and a double bond in the same molecule would contribute?

Wait, no. Each ring or double bond contributes one degree of unsaturation. So a ring is one, a double bond is one, each triple bond is two, etc.

Wait, the starting molecule's structure:

- Cyclohexene (six-membered ring, which is a ring → 1 DoU)
- The double bond in the ring (but that's part of the ring's structure, so maybe it's already counted as the ring's DoU. Wait, no. Wait, a cyclohexene has both a ring and a double bond, but how does that count?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens and N is nitrogens. Since this compound doesn't have any X or N, the formula simplifies to (2C + 2 - H)/2.

But perhaps I should calculate the molecular formula and then compute the DoU.

So, let's find the molecular formula of the starting compound.

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- Cyclohexene: C6H10 (but with substituents)
- At position 2: formyl group (CHO) → contributes O and adds one C
- At position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH–) → adds two C's and one double bond
- At position 1 (assuming): COOH group → adds O2, H, and COOH has a formula of -COOH → which is -C(O)OH, so the formula is C: +1, O: +2, H: +1 (since the COOH is -COOH, which is -C(O)OH; but in the parent ring, perhaps it's at position 1, so the substituent is -COOH.

Wait, maybe it's easier to count each part:

Cyclohexene ring: 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens.

Each substituent:

- Formyl group (CHO): 1 C, 1 O, 1 H. So adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H.

Wait, the substituent is at C2, so the structure would be: CH2(OH)CO... No, wait, the substituent is CHO, so it's a -CHO group attached to C2. That adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H.

Wait, but the substituent is a formyl group, which is -CHO, so for the substituent: C=O is part of it. So each formyl group adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H (since it's -CHO).

Similarly, the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2– but with a double bond: it's -CH2-CH2– attached to C5, but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH–. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons.

So the substituent adds 2 carbons, 3 hydrogens (because the substituent is CH2-CH2, but in reality, the group is CH2=CH–, which has two carbons and three hydrogens: CH2=CH–, attached to the ring.

Wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH2–, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2–, but that's not possible, because that would be a single bond. Oh wait, no: vinyl is -CH2-CH2– but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So it's CH2=CH–, so the substituent adds two carbons and three hydrogens (since each CH2 has two Hs except where the double bond is). Wait, let me think: the structure is -CH2-CH2– but with double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2–? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH–, which has two carbons and two Hs on each carbon? Let me count:

- The substituent is -CH2-CH2– but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's CH2=CH–, so the substituent has two carbons, each with two Hs except where the double bond is. So the substituent's formula is C2H3 (since each carbon in the double bond has one H each: CH2=CH– would have two H on the first carbon and one on the second, but wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the substituent is CH2=CH– attached to the ring. So the group is CH2=CH–, thus contributing two carbons, three hydrogens (since the first CH2 has two H, the CH has one H).

Wait, no. The substituent is -CH2-CH2– but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's CH2=CH– as the substituent. So the substituent is CH2=CH–, which is C2H3.

Wait, but that's incorrect. The structure is CH2=CH–, so each CH2 group has two Hs except where the double bond is. Let me count the Hs:

The substituent is CH2=CH– attached to the cyclohexene ring. So, the substituent is:

CH2–CH2– becomes CH2=CH–, so the substituent is -CH2-CH2– but with a double bond between the two carbons. So, the substituent is CH2=CH–, which is -CH2CH2– but with a double bond. So, the substituent has two carbons and three hydrogens? Because the first carbon (attached to the ring) has two H (CH2), and the second carbon (from the substituent) has one H (since it's CH–), but wait, no. Wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH2–, but in the vinyl form, it's -CH2-CH2– with a double bond. So for each substituent, the formula is C2H3?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach the molecular formula step by step.

The parent cyclohexene has 6 carbons and 10 hydrogens. Now, the substituents:

1. Formyl group at C2: -CHO. So adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H.

But wait, the cyclohexene has a ring, so each substituent is added as a side chain. So, the formyl group is at position 2, which will replace a hydrogen on the ring. So the formula for the substituent is CHO: contributing 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H.

2. Vinyl group at C5: -CH2=CH–. So adds 2 C's, 3 H's (because CH2=CH– has 2 C and 3 H: CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H → total 3 H).

3. The carboxylic acid group at position 3 (or whatever position), which is -COOH. That adds 2 O and 2 H (since COOH is -C(O)OH, so the formula is O2H2 for the substituent, but wait, the COOH group is -COOH, which is -C(O)OH. So, the substituent adds 2 O and 2 H?

Wait, but the COOH is a functional group attached to the ring. So, the substituent is -COOH, which has formula C: 1, O: 2, H: 2 (since COOH is -C(O)OH: the carbonyl O, the hydroxyl O, and two H's on the OH).

Wait, but the parent ring is cyclohexene, so when substituents are added, each replaces a H. So, the starting formula would be:

Parent: C6H10.

Each substituent:

- Formyl: CHO → adds 1 C, 1 O, 1 H.

- Vinyl: CH2=CH– → adds 2 C, 3 H.

- COOH: COOH → adds 1 C, 2 O, 2 H.

So, putting it all together:

Total C: 6 (parent) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 10 C.

Total H: 10 (parent) - 3 (since three substituents each replace a H) + 1 (CHO) + 3 (vinyl) + 2 (COOH) = Let's see:

Parent H: 10.

Each substituent replaces a H, so -3 H.

CHO adds 1 H, vinyl adds 3 H, COOH adds 2 H.

So total H: 10 -3 +1 +3 +2 = 13.

O: 1 (from CHO) + 0 (from vinyl) + 2 (from COOH) = 3 O.

Wait, the COOH is -COOH, which has two O's but also the O from the ring's COOH. Wait, perhaps I should recount.

Wait, the COOH group is -COOH, which is O=C(OH)–O? No, wait, COOH is -COOH, which is O=C(OH)–.

So, each COOH substituent contributes two O's.

So, the substituents contribute:

CHO: 1 O.

COOH: 2 O.

Vinyl: 0 O.

So total O: 1 (CHO) + 2 (COOH) = 3 O.

So the molecular formula is C10H13O3.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me check:

Parent: C6H10.

CHO adds +1 C, +0 H (since it replaces a H, but adds another H in the CHO group. Wait, perhaps I should think that each substituent adds as follows:

Each substituent is attached to the ring, replacing a hydrogen. So the parent has 10 H.

Each substituent adds (their own H) minus the H they replaced.

So for each substituent:

CHO: has 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H. So when attached, the ring loses one H (replaced), but the substituent adds 1 H. So net H change: 0.

Vinyl group: substituent is CH2=CH–, which has 3 H (CH2=CH– has 2 H on first C and 1 H on the second). So when attached, it replaces one H on the ring. So net H: 3 -1 = +2 H.

COOH: substituent is -COOH, which has 2 H (the hydroxyl group). So when attached, it replaces one H on the ring. So net H: 2 -1 = +1 H.

So total H from substituents:

CHO: 0.

Vinyl: +2.

COOH: +1.

Parent H: 10.

Total H: 10 + 0 +2 +1 =13.

So the molecular formula is C10H13O3.

Wait, but the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecular formula is C10H10O3.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substituent H counts.

Wait, the substituents each replace a H on the ring. So for each substituent, the net H change is (substituent H) -1.

So:

CHO: substituent has 1 H (CHO has H on the C of the formyl group). So net H change: 1 –1 = 0.

Vinyl: substituent has 3 H (CH2=CH– has 3 H: CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H). So net H change: 3 –1 = +2.

COOH: substituent has 2 H (the hydroxyl group and the other H). So net H change: 2 –1 = +1.

Total H: 10 (parent) + 0 + 2 +1 = 13.

So, formula is C10H13O3.

Wait, but if the cyclohexene ring has 10 H originally, adding substituents, but perhaps I'm missing some double bonds.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond, so it's C6H10. Then, adding substituents:

Each substituent adds their H, but considering the initial H.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula is C10H10O3.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the structure more carefully.

But perhaps I should proceed to the reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Red phosphorus and HI is a reagent I remember is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no. Or wait, maybe it's used for the dehydrohalogenation? Or wait, perhaps it's used for the elimination reaction.

Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the presence of HI for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but in some cases, like in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but perhaps more importantly, I think that when you have a compound with a carbonyl group, such as an aldehyde or ketone, and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it might undergo a reaction called the Riemer-Tiemann reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation or some kind of addition.

Wait, but in this case, the starting compound has a formyl group (CHO) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH–). Let me think about how each would react.

Wait, the formyl group is an aldehyde. Treating an aldehyde with HI and red phosphorus... Hmm, I'm trying to remember. Oh wait, I think that when an aldehyde is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a reaction called the von Braun degradation, which converts the aldehyde into an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde group (CHO) in the presence of HI and red phosphorus would be converted into a CH2I group.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used to convert carbonyl groups into CH2 groups. So, for example, a ketone (RCOR') would be converted into RCH2R'.

But wait, wait, in the case of an aldehyde (RCHO), I think that under these conditions, it would be converted into RCH2– group. So the CHO would become CH2I perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think that this is a condition that leads to the addition of iodide across double bonds.

Wait, so in the starting compound, we have a cyclohexene ring (with a double bond), a formyl group (CHO), and a vinyl group (CH2=CH–). So, the starting molecule has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and another in the vinyl substituent. The formyl group has a carbonyl double bond, and the COOH also has a carbonyl.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think that this is the condition used for the hydrohalogenation or possibly the addition of iodide across double bonds.

Wait, but wait, another thought: when you have a conjugated diene and treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it can lead to diiodination. But in this case, the starting compound has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond) and a vinyl substituent (another double bond), so perhaps the molecule has conjugated double bonds.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexene has a double bond between C3 and C4, the vinyl substituent has a double bond between the attached C and the next one (so between C5 and C6?), and the formyl group has a double bond between C2 and O.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has conjugated double bonds: the cyclohexene's double bond and the vinyl group's double bond.

If these are conjugated, then adding HI and red phosphorus might lead to the addition of iodide across both double bonds.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but here, perhaps it's more about the addition to alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition of HI to the double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diiodination of the double bonds.

Wait, but the problem is that the starting molecule has multiple double bonds. So when treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps each double bond would add iodide.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact reaction pathway. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus and HI is a mixture that's sometimes used for the Michael reaction, but more commonly, it's used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Wait, but in this case, the starting compound doesn't have a nitrile group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation of the double bonds. So, each double bond would add iodide.

For example, in the presence of HI, alkenes can undergo addition reactions. So, if the starting compound has two double bonds (cyclohexene and vinyl), each would add HI.

But wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH–. Adding HI would convert it into CH2I-CH2I? Or perhaps into CH2I-CH2–, but with two additions.

Wait, but with excess HI, perhaps each double bond would add twice, leading to diiodination.

Wait, but in the case of a conjugated diene, the addition of HI would be more controlled, but in this case, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring with one double bond and a vinyl substituent with another double bond. So perhaps each double bond would add HI, leading to dihydroxy iodide addition.

But in any case, the product would have the double bonds saturated with addition of HI.

Wait, but let me think about the reagents again: red phosphorus and HI. Another possibility is that the aldehyde group (CHO) would undergo a reaction. For example, in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, the aldehyde could be converted into a primary alcohol (CH2OH) via a reaction called the von Braun reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde would add HI across the carbonyl group, leading to a geminal diiodide.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the possible reactions each functional group undergoes.

1. The cyclohexene ring's double bond: would undergo addition of HI, leading to vicinal diiodide (i.e., the ring would become a cyclohexane with two adjacent iodine atoms).

2. The vinyl group's double bond: would also undergo addition of HI, leading to a vicinal diiodide in the substituent.

3. The formyl group's carbonyl (CHO): would undergo addition of HI. Since the carbonyl is an aldehyde, adding HI would give a geminal diiodide (CH(I)OH?), but perhaps under certain conditions, it would hydrolyze further.

Wait, but if the reaction is with excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the carbonyl groups (both the aldehyde and the COOH) would be involved.

Wait, but the COOH group is a carboxylic acid. How would that react with HI and red phosphorus?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a complete cleavage of the double bonds, leading to the formation of diols or diiodides.

But perhaps I should approach this step by step.

The reaction is between 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid and red phosphorus with excess HI.

Step 1: Identify the functional groups in the starting material.

- Cyclohexene ring (double bond)
- Formyl group (CHO)
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH–)
- Carboxylic acid group (COOH)

Step 2: Determine what each functional group does in the presence of HI and red phosphorus.

1. Cyclohexene's double bond: Alkenes can undergo addition reactions with HI. The addition would proceed via the acid-catalyzed mechanism, adding HI across the double bond to form a vicinal diiodide.

2. Vinyl group's double bond: Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) would undergo addition of HI, leading to CH2I-CH2I.

Wait, but with excess HI, perhaps multiple additions could occur, but in reality, each double bond would add once.

3. Formyl group (CHO): Aldehydes can react with HI to form gem-dihalides. Alternatively, under certain conditions, they might undergo addition, but I'm not certain about the exact product.

4. Carboxylic acid group (COOH): In the presence of HI, the COOH might undergo some reaction. For example, it could be converted into an acid iodide, but in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's more likely to undergo a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions are such that the carboxylic acid group is unaffected, as the reagents are more focused on the double bonds and aldehyde.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about the behavior of the COOH group under these conditions. Let me think again about the reagents. Red phosphorus is often used as a reducing agent. For example, in the hydrolysis of nitriles, red phosphorus and HI can convert nitriles into amines. Alternatively, for carbonyl groups, red phosphorus might facilitate their reduction.

Wait, another possibility: the aldehyde (CHO) and the COOH group are both carbonyl-containing groups. In the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps these groups would be reduced.

Wait, that's a possibility. For example, the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to CH2OH (a primary alcohol), and the COOH group would be reduced to CH2OH as well, perhaps.

Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids are usually reduced to primary alcohols, yes. So, if the COOH group is reduced to CH2OH, and the CHO group is also reduced to CH2OH.

So, considering that, the reaction would involve the hydrogenation of the double bonds (addition of HI across each) and the reduction of the carbonyl groups (CHO and COOH).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if red phosphorus and HI are used for such reductions. Let me try to recall: I think that red phosphorus is used in the presence of HI to effect the hydrolysis of nitriles, but perhaps it's also used in other reductions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a diiodination of the double bonds. So, each double bond would add HI, leading to diiodides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the opening of the epoxide, but the starting material isn't an epoxide.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about each functional group's transformation:

1. Cyclohexene ring (double bond): If the double bond is saturated by HI addition, the ring becomes cyclohexane with two adjacent iodide atoms (vicinal diiodide).

2. Vinyl group (CH2=CH–): The double bond would add HI, converting it into CH2I-CH2I.

3. Formyl group (CHO): The carbonyl could add HI, forming CH(I)OH, which under certain conditions may hydrolyze to CH2OH.

4. COOH group: The carboxylic acid could be converted to an acid iodide, but perhaps under these conditions, it's more likely to be reduced, or perhaps it's protonated and then iodide substitution occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group remains unchanged. Because HI is a strong acid, perhaps the COOH group would be deprotonated, but red phosphorus might not affect it.

Alternatively, perhaps the COOH group is reduced to CH2OH.

But I'm not entirely certain about the fate of the COOH and CHO groups. Let's try to proceed with the assumption that the double bonds are fully saturated.

So, the starting molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl substituent.

Each would add HI, so:

- The cyclohexene (ring) becomes a cyclohexane with two adjacent I atoms (vicinal diiodide).
- The vinyl substituent (CH2=CH–) becomes CH2I-CH2I.

Additionally, the formyl group (CHO) might undergo a reaction. If it's converted to CH2OH, that's a primary alcohol.

The COOH group might be reduced to CH2OH as well.

Let me consider the structure after the reaction.

Assuming:

- The cyclohexene double bond is saturated, adding two I atoms across it. So the ring becomes cyclohexane with two adjacent I atoms.

- The vinyl substituent's double bond is saturated, adding I atoms to become CH2I-CH2I.

- The CHO group is reduced to CH2OH.

- The COOH group is reduced to CH2OH.

So, the product would be:

- A cyclohexane ring with two I atoms attached to adjacent carbons.

- At position 2, a CH2OH group.

- At position 5, a CH2I-CH2I group.

- At the position where COOH was (say, position 1), a CH2OH group.

Wait, but the original substituents were at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (vinyl), and position 3 (COOH) perhaps. Or maybe position 1.

Wait, perhaps in the product, the substituents are:

- At position 2: CH2OH (from CHO)
- At position 5: CH2I-CH2I (from vinyl)
- At position 1 (or wherever the COOH was): CH2OH (from COOH)

But perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong, but that’s less important for the index of hydrogen deficiency.

Now, the product's structure would be a cyclohexane (no double bonds in the ring), two substituted groups: CH2OH at position 2, CH2I-CH2I at 5, and CH2OH at position 1.

But wait, the starting compound had a cyclohexene ring (so double bond), which after reaction would be fully saturated (single bond), so that double bond is gone.

The vinyl group's double bond would also be gone, replaced by CH2I-CH2I.

The CHO and COOH groups would be converted to CH2OH.

So, now the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bonds)
- No remaining alkenes (since both double bonds were saturated)
- No aldehyde or carboxylic acid groups (they were converted to CH2OH)

So, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (6-membered, single bonds only) → 1 ring (so 1 DoU)
- Any other rings? No.
- Any double bonds? No alkenes left.
- Any triple bonds? No.
- Any rings or double bonds in substituents? Let's see:

The substituents are:

- CH2OH (no rings or double bonds)
- CH2I-CH2I (no double bonds)
- CH2OH (no rings or double bonds)

So, the product is a cyclohexane with three substituents, but no double bonds anywhere.

But wait, the product would have a cyclohexane ring, which is a single ring → 1 DoU.

Wait, but what about any other rings? No, all substituents are single bonds.

Now, the index of hydrogen deficiency is the sum of the number of rings plus the number of double bonds. So, in the product, there's only one ring (cyclohexane), so the DoU is 1.

But wait, wait. Do any substituents contribute to the DoU? For instance, if any substituents have rings or double bonds, each would add to the DoU.

In this case, the substituents are:

- CH2OH: no DoU.
- CH2I-CH2I: single bonds → no DoU.
- Another CH2OH: no DoU.

So the only DoU comes from the cyclohexane ring, which is one.

But wait, in the reaction, any new double bonds formed? I thought all double bonds were saturated.

So the product would have a DoU of 1.

But wait, the starting material had a cyclohexene ring (DoU 1), a formyl group (CHO: DoU 1), a vinyl group (CH2=CH–: DoU 1), and a COOH group (DoU 1, because of the carbonyl). So the starting material's DoU would be 4.

But the product's DoU is 1, because only the cyclohexane ring remains.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the starting material's formula is C10H13O3, giving a DoU of (2*10 +2 -13)/2 = (22-13)/2=9/2=4.5, which can't be right because DoU must be an integer.

Wait, perhaps my earlier calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate the DoU.

Formula of starting material: C10H13O3.

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X=0, N=0.

So (2*10 +2 -13)/2 = (22-13)/2 = 9/2 =4.5 → which isn't possible, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C10H10O3.

Let me recalculate:

If the formula is C10H10O3.

Then DoU = (2*10 +2 -10)/2 = (22-10)/2 =12/2=6.

Hmm, but I thought the formula was C10H13O3 earlier, but perhaps that's incorrect.

Wait, let me approach it again. The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The parent is cyclohexene: C6H10.

Each substituent:

- CHO: adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H (but replaces a H on the ring)
- Vinyl: adds 2 C, 3 H (but replaces a H on the ring)
- COOH: adds 1 C, 2 O, and 2 H (but replaces a H on the ring)

So, parent: C6H10.

CHO: +1C, +0H (since it adds 1 H and replaces 1 H)
Vinyl: +2C, +2H (since it adds 3 H and replaces 1 H → net +2)
COOH: +1C, +1H (since it adds 2 H and replaces 1 H → net +1)

So total C: 6+1+2+1=10.

H: 10 (parent) +0 (CHO) +2 (vinyl) +1 (COOH) =13.

Wait, so formula is C10H13O3.

DoU = (2*10 +2 -13)/2 = (22-13)/2=9/2=4.5 → which is impossible, so I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is a substituent that doesn't add as many H.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl substituent adds 2 H: because it's CH2=CH–, which has 3 H total, but when attached to the ring, it would add 3 H and lose 1 → net +2 H.

Wait, but the formula comes out to 13 H, which gives a fractional DoU. That can't be right.

Hmm, maybe the correct formula is C10H10O3, which would give DoU =6.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's DoU is 4.

But perhaps the product's DoU is 1, as I thought earlier.

So, the product's structure is a cyclohexane (1 ring) and no double bonds, so DoU is 1.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.

So the answer would be A) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The DoU is calculated as:

\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H - X + N}{2}
\]

where \(C\), \(H\), \(X\), and \(N\) are the number of carbon, hydrogen, halogen, and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Since the molecule contains no halogens or nitrogen, the formula simplifies to:

\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H}{2}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the starting compound
The starting compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following structural features:
- A cyclohexene ring (six-membered ring with one double bond).
- A formyl group (\(-CHO\)) at position 2.
- A vinyl group (\(-CH=CH-\)) at position 5.
- A carboxylic acid group (\(-COOH\)) at position 3.

#### Functional groups and their contributions to DoU:
1. **Cyclohexene ring**: Contains one double bond, contributing 1 DoU.
2. **Formyl group (\(-CHO\))**: Contains a carbonyl group (\(C=O\)), contributing 1 DoU.
3. **Vinyl group (\(-CH=CH-\))**: Contains a double bond, contributing 1 DoU.
4. **Carboxylic acid group (\(-COOH\))**: Contains a carbonyl group (\(C=O\)), contributing 1 DoU.

Thus, the starting compound has a total of **4 degrees of unsaturation**.

### Step 2: Reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI
The reaction conditions involve red phosphorus and excess HI, which typically lead to the following transformations:
1. **Saturation of double bonds**: Both the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group undergo addition of HI, converting their double bonds into single bonds.
2. **Reduction of carbonyl groups**: The formyl group (\(-CHO\)) and the carboxylic acid group (\(-COOH\)) are reduced to primary alcohols (\(-CH_2OH\)).

#### Product structure:
- The cyclohexene ring becomes a cyclohexane ring (no double bonds).
- The vinyl group (\(-CH=CH-\)) becomes \(-CH_2-CH_2-\) after saturation.
- The formyl group (\(-CHO\)) becomes \(-CH_2OH\).
- The carboxylic acid group (\(-COOH\)) becomes \(-CH_2OH\).

The final product is a cyclohexane ring with three substituents:
1. A primary alcohol (\(-CH_2OH\)) at position 2.
2. A primary alcohol (\(-CH_2OH\)) at position 3 (originally the carboxylic acid group).
3. A saturated vinyl group (\(-CH_2-CH_2-\)) at position 5.

### Step 3: Calculate the DoU of the product
The product contains:
- A cyclohexane ring (1 ring, contributing 1 DoU).
- No double bonds in the ring or substituents.
- No carbonyl groups.

Thus, the product has a total of **1 degree of unsaturation**.

### Final Answer:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.
