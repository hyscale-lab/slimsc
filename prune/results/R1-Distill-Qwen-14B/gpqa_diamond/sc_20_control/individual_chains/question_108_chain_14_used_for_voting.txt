Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. It mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. I'm supposed to compare the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are about whether ⟨H⟩ is much greater than, much less than, about equal to, or just greater than ΔE.

Alright, first things first, I should probably figure out what the paramagnetic coupling term is. Paramagnetism is related to the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction, I think, is given by the Zeeman term. The Zeeman energy is proportional to the magnetic quantum number m and the magnetic field B. The formula I remember is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

Wait, the magnetic moment μ is related to the orbital angular momentum L. Oh right, the orbital magnetic moment μ_L is given by μ_L = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L/(ħ)) ), but more simply, μ_L = (μ_B) * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So yeah, the energy due to the magnetic field is H = -μ_L · B. Since B is along Oz, the magnetic moment's projection onto B is mμ_B B. But wait, the sign depends on the direction. If the magnetic moment is aligned with B, it's lower energy, so H would be negative. But I think the magnitude is what's important here.

So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ is proportional to m μ_B B. But wait, the problem says m is small. So m could be 0, ±1, etc. But since B is 1 T, which is a significant field, I wonder how that scales.

Now, what's the transition energy ΔE for the hydrogen atom? The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is around the Balmer series. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let me calculate that. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So hc is roughly 1.986e-25 J·m. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. So ΔE = (1.986e-25 J·m) / (0.4861e-6 m) ≈ 4.086e-19 J. Let me convert that into electron volts because I'm more familiar with those units. Since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE ≈ (4.086e-19 J)/(1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, that seems a bit high. Wait, no, the Balmer series is about transitions from higher energy levels to n=2. The energy levels for hydrogen are E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E is about -3.4 eV. For n=3 or higher, the energies are higher (less negative), so the transition energy would be the difference between two levels.

Wait, the wavelength 0.4861 μm is specific. Let me think: that's the wavelength for the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=2 to n=1? Wait, no, H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, right? Let me check. The Balmer series starts at n=3 to n=2, which has a wavelength of about 656 nm, wait wait, no, 0.4861 μm is 486 nm, which is the Balmer beta line, from n=4 to n=2, I think. Or maybe n=3 to n=2? Hmm, I might be getting confused. Anyway, the exact value might not matter because I need to compare orders of magnitude.

So the transition energy ΔE is approximately a few eV. Let's say around 1.5 eV or so. Because E_n for n=2 is -3.4 eV, and for n=3 it's -1.5 eV. The transition from n=3 to n=2 would have energy ΔE ≈ 1.9 eV (since ΔE = E_final - E_initial = (-3.4) - (-1.5) = -1.9 eV, but the magnitude is 1.9 eV).

Now, the paramagnetic term ⟨H⟩ is given by the Zeeman term. So H = μ_B * m * B. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So for small m (like m=1 or 0), let's take m=1. Then ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * B. So μ_B is ~9.27e-24 J/T multiplied by B=1 T. So ⟨H⟩ ≈ 9.27e-24 J. Let's convert that to eV: 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 9.27e-24 J is approx (9.27e-24)/(1.6e-19) eV ≈ 5.8e-5 eV. So about 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, but wait! The hydrogen transition energy was about 1.9 eV, right? And the paramagnetic term is about 0.000058 eV. So the paramagnetic term is way smaller. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

So the options are: A says they're equal, B says ⟨H⟩ is much bigger, C says much smaller, D says bigger. So the correct answer would be C, ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Wait, but wait again. Are there any factors I'm missing? Like, does orbital quantum number l affect this? Oh, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, but in the hydrogen atom, for each l, m can be -l to +l. But the problem says m is small, so perhaps m=1 or 0. But the calculation we did used m=1, so the result holds.

Wait, but wait another thing. The paramagnetic term is H = μ_B * B * m. But is that the correct expression? Or is there a different expression because it's the orbital magnetic moment?

Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (eħ)/(2m_e) * L_z / ħ. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of angular momentum. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For orbital magnetism, μ = (μ_B) * (L/ħ) * ħ, so μ = μ_B * L_z, where L_z is in units of ħ. So H = -μ_B * B * m, since m is the z-component of L in units of ħ. So H is proportional to m. But in this problem, m is small, so the expectation value is small.

Hmm, but that's correct. So our calculation with m=1 gives the paramagnetic term. So 5.8e-5 eV is much smaller than 1.9 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and their magnitudes.

The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is given by:

\[
H = -\mu_L \cdot B = -\mu_B m B
\]

where \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton (\( \mu_B \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \)), \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For small \( m \) (e.g., \( m = 1 \)), the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is:

\[
\langle H \rangle = \mu_B B \approx (9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T})(1 \, \text{T}) = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting this to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\langle H \rangle \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Next, the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom is calculated using the wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \). The energy of the photon is given by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \, \text{J} \approx 4.086 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.086 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \, \text{eV} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Comparing the two values, \( \langle H \rangle \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \) is vastly smaller than \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \). Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

The correct answer is:

**C) \(\left\langle H\right\rangle \ll \Delta E\)**
