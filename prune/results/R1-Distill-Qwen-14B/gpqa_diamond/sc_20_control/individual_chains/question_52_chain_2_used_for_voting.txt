Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in different energy levels.

Alright, let me break it down. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the presence of spots lowers the effective temperature of the star.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. 

Wait, the transition between these levels is at 1448 Å. Oh, that's in the near-ultraviolet range. So it's about electron transitions in neutral Ti atoms, and how temperature affects their population in different energy levels.

Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), I can use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Here, E2 is higher than E1 since it's an emission or absorption line, right? So the exponent will be negative.

But wait, when the star has spots, the effective temperature drops. Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere? Oh, but the spots are cooler regions. So, the star's overall photosphere doesn't change in temperature except in the spots. Or wait, the question says that the overall Teff decreases. Hmm, maybe I should think about the effective temperature of the entire star, not just the spot regions.

Wait, the overall Teff is given as 5500 K when 40% of the surface is spotted. The question states that when the surface isn't spotted, the Teff is 6000 K. So when spots are present, the star's effective temperature is lower. 

Wait, but how does that relate to the photospheric temperature? Because the star's photosphere is where the continuum emission is coming from. But when spots are present, the spots are cooler, so they emit less. The overall Teff is a measure of the total luminosity, but perhaps the photospheric temperature in the unspotted regions is the same as when the star had no spots. Or maybe the effective temperature is an average, but the actual photospheric temperature is not the same as Teff. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So when the spots are present, the Teff (which is calculated from the total luminosity and radius) is lower. So the Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered, but the unspotted regions have their own higher temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things, and considering that the star's photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But I think that's not the case because spots are cooler, so the average Teff would be between the unspotted and spotted temperatures.

Wait, maybe I should think about the effective temperature of the photosphere as being lower when spots are present, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem says that when the spots are present, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. Hmm, the question says that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the effective temperature is lower because the spots emit less, but the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K. So perhaps the star's photosphere has some regions at 6000 K (70% of the area) and 40% at a lower temperature, say T_spot.

Wait, but I think the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when the spots are present. Because the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, but each region's actual temperature is either 6000 K (unspotted) or lower (spotted). 

Wait, perhaps I should model this. The star's luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from the spots and the unspotted regions. So the total luminosity L_total = L_unspotted + L_spotted.

The unspotted area is 60% of the surface. The spotted area is 40%. So, the total luminosity when spots are present would be:

L_total = 0.6 * L_unspotted_per_area + 0.4 * L_spotted_per_area.

But without spots, the total luminosity is L_total_without = L_unspotted * 1 (since 100% of the surface is unspotted).

The effective temperature is determined by L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

So, when spots are present:

L_total = 4π R² σ (5500)^4.

Without spots, L_total_without = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when spots are present, the unspotted regions have a higher temperature, T_unspotted, and the spotted regions have a lower temperature, T_spotted.

Wait, but the problem states that the effective temperature when the star has spots is 5500 K, which is lower than the 6000 K without spots. So when the spots are present, the total luminosity is based on an average Teff of 5500 K.

So, the total luminosity when spots are present is L = 4π R² σ (5500)^4.

Without spots, L = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when spots are present, the star's surface emits from two regions: the unspotted (60%) at T1 and spotted (40%) at T2.

So:

L = 0.6 * (4π (R^2) σ (T1)^4) + 0.4 * (4π (R^2) σ (T2)^4)

Divide both sides by 4π R² σ:

L/(4π R² σ) ) = 0.6 T1^4 + 0.4 T2^4.

But the left side is Teff^4 when spots are present, which is 5500^4. So:

5500^4 = 0.6 T1^4 + 0.4 T2^4.

But we also know that without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, which is all T1 (since no spots), so T1 = 6000 K when there are no spots.

Wait, no. Without spots, the entire surface is at T1 = 6000 K, so the Teff is 6000 K.

When spots are present, the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at T2, which is lower.

So, substituting T1=6000 K into the equation when spots are present:

5500^4 = 0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T2^4).

I can solve for T2.

Let me compute both sides numerically.

Let me compute 6000^4 and 5500^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 *1e12. 5.5^4 is 5.5 *5.5 =30.25; 30.25 *5.5=166.375; 166.375 *5.5 ≈ 915.0625. So 915.0625e12 ≈9.150625e14.

So 5500^4 ≈9.150625e14.

Now the equation is:

9.150625e14 = 0.6*(1.296e15) + 0.4*T2^4.

Compute 0.6*(1.296e15) = 7.776e14.

So:

9.150625e14 = 7.776e14 + 0.4 T2^4.

Subtract 7.776e14:

9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14 = 0.4 T2^4.

Divide by 0.4:

T2^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root:

T2 = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute that.

What is 3.4365625e14 to the 0.25 power?

First, let's express 3.4365625e14 as 3.4365625 *1e14.

Take the fourth root:

(3.4365625)^(1/4) ≈ ?

Well, 3.436 is about 3.436. Let me think of known fourth powers.

1.3^4 = 2.8561.

1.4^4=3.8416. So 3.436 is between 1.3^4 and 1.4^4.

Let me compute 1.35^4: 1.35^2 =1.8225; squared again: 3.320756. Hmm, 1.35^4≈3.3208, which is less than 3.436.

1.36^2=1.8496. Then 1.36^4 = (1.8496)^2 ≈ 3.4214. Close to 3.436.

Wait, 1.36^4 is around 3.4214. 1.365^2 is (1.365)^2 = 1.863225. Then 1.863225^2 ≈ (approx 3.470). Wait, let's compute 1.863225^2: 1.863225 *1.863225.

Hmm, let's compute 1.863 *1.863. 1.863^2 = (1.8)^2 + 2*(1.8)(0.063) + (0.063)^2 = 3.24 + 0.2268 + 0.003969 ≈ 3.470769. So 1.365^4 ≈3.470769.

Wait, but our value is 3.436, which is between 1.36^4 (3.4214) and 1.365^4 (3.470769). Let's find the value x where x^4=3.436.

Between 1.36 and 1.365.

Let me approximate. Let me take x=1.36 + d. So (1.36 +d)^4 ≈3.436.

We have at d=0, x^4=3.4214.

We need to find d such that 3.4214 + 4*(1.36)^3 *d + ... =3.436.

But perhaps a linear approximation.

Let me compute (1.36)^3 = 1.36 *1.36 = 1.8496, then *1.36: 1.8496 *1.36 ≈ 2.520.

So 4*(1.36)^3 ≈4 *2.520=10.08.

The derivative of x^4 is 4x^3.

So delta_x ≈ (3.436-3.4214)/(4*(1.36)^3) )= (0.0146)/(10.08) ≈0.001448.

So d≈0.001448.

Thus x≈1.36 +0.001448 ≈1.3614.

So T2 is approximately 1.3614 *1e3 K = 1361.4 K. Wait, that can't be right. Because 1361 K is way too low for a star's surface, but perhaps it's correct, as spots are cooler.

Wait, but wait, the calculation was for (3.4365e14)^(1/4) in terms of the T^4. Wait, no, when I took the fourth root of 3.4365625e14, I should have multiplied by 1e3 because 1e14 is (1e3)^4 * 1e2. Wait: (1e3)^4 is 1e12. So 1e14 is 100 * (1e3)^4. So 3.4365625e14 is 343.65625 * (1e3)^4. So the fourth root is cube root of 343.65625 is about 7. So wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, 3.4365625e14 is 3.4365625 * 10^14. So when you take the fourth root, it becomes (3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4). 

What is (1e14)^(1/4)? 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4, because (1e3.5)^4 = (1e3.5)^2 * (1e3.5)^2 = 1e7 * 1e7 =1e14. So 1e3.5 is 10^(3.5) = 3162.27766. 

So (1e14)^(1/4)=3162.27766 K.

So T2^4=3.4365625e14 → T2= (3.4365625)^(1/4) *3162.27766 K.

Compute (3.4365625)^(1/4):

We know that (3.4365625)^(1/4) is approximately between 1.36 and 1.365. As I computed earlier, it's around 1.3614.

So 1.3614 * 3162.27766 ≈ 1.3614 * 3000 ≈4084 K, but more accurately:

3162.27766 *1.3614.

Let me compute 3000 *1.3614=4084.2, 162.27766 *1.3614 ≈ 220. So total ≈4304 K. Hmm, about 4304 K.

Wait, but that seems a bit high for a spot temperature, but perhaps it's correct. Let's accept that T2 ≈4304 K.

So the spotted regions have Teff of about 4304 K, while the unspotted regions remain at 6000 K.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. Wait, but when the spots are present, the photosphere includes both 6000 K regions and 4304 K regions. So how does that affect the overall ratio?

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere as a whole is considered to be at 5500 K? Or is the photosphere still at 6000 K in the unspotted regions, and at 4304 K in the spots, but the overall ratio is an average?

Hmm, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But the ratio is observed to decrease. So we need to model the ratio based on the temperature.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

We can ignore the statistical weights (g1/g2) as they are constants, and the problem asks for the ratio change when the star has spots vs. not. So the factor change will be the ratio of (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ) ]

The g1/g2 cancels out, so:

Factor = exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) ) ] )

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly.

Let me denote:

Factor = [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ) ]

Which is exp [ (E2-E1)/(k) ( 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) ) ) ]

Because:

= exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) + (E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ] )

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_spotted - 1/T_no_spots) )

Hmm, because 1/T_spotted is less than 1/T_no_spots (since T_spotted < T_no_spots), so 1/T_spotted - 1/T_no_spots is negative. So the exponent is negative, so the factor is less than 1. So the ratio n1/n2 decreases when T decreases, which aligns with the problem statement.

Wait, but when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n1/n2 would decrease because the denominator in the Boltzmann equation becomes larger (since n2 increases). So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is [exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ) ].

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) ) )

Wait, let's recompute that.

Factor = [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_spots

= [exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ) ]

= exp( [ - (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) + (E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ] )

= exp( (E2 - E1) / (k) * (1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots)) )

Wait, but let's compute 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) = (T_no_spots - T_spotted)/(T_no_spots T_spotted)

So the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k) * (T_no_spots - T_spotted)/(T_no_spots T_spotted) )

But E2-E1 is the energy difference corresponding to the transition at 1448 Å. So we can compute this energy.

The energy of a photon with wavelength λ is E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / 1.448e-7 J.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈1.372e-18 J.

But we need this in terms of eV, perhaps. Because k (Boltzmann constant) is about 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So E = hc/λ = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, because hc ≈ 12400 eV·Å. So 12400 / 1448 ≈8.56 eV.

So E ≈8.56 eV.

So E2-E1 =8.56 eV.

Now, T_no_spots =6000 K, T_spotted=5500 K?

Wait, no! Wait, earlier I thought T_spotted was about 4300 K, but that was under the assumption that the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. But wait, that was a confusion. Let me clarify.

Wait, the effective temperature of the entire star when spotted is 5500 K. But the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at T_spot, which we calculated to be around 4304 K.

But in the photosphere, when the star has spots, the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at 4304 K. So the two regions have different temperatures.

But how does that affect the observed ratio of Ti atoms in energy levels?

Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average of the two regions. Because the spots emit less continuum, so when you observe the star, the equivalent width of the line depends on the contribution from each region.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at Teff 5500 K when spots are present, hence the ratio is calculated using that temperature. But that might not be accurate, but perhaps the problem is simplifying it that way.

Wait, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere as a whole is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present. So for the Boltzmann factor, we use T=5500 K.

But earlier, I thought that the unspotted regions are at 6000 K and the spotted regions are lower. So which one is correct?

Hmm, this is a point of confusion. Let me re-read the question.

"When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K."

Ah, so the Teff when 40% is covered is 5500 K. But in reality, the spotted and unspotted regions have their own temperatures. But the question is about the ratio in the photosphere, which is a mix of the two. But I think for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present, so we can model it as T=5500 K.

Alternatively, perhaps each region (spotted and unspotted) contributes to the line formation in their own way, and the total line equivalent width is a combination of both regions. But modeling that would be more complicated.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2, when examining the stellar photosphere, is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So the observed ratio is lower when the star has spots.

But if the entire photosphere's Teff is lower, then the ratio would decrease because the Boltzmann factor would cause the upper level (level 2) to be more populated, leading to a lower n1/n2 ratio.

So perhaps the correct approach is to use T=6000 K when no spots, and T=5500 K when spots are present. So the factor is the ratio of (n1/n2) at 6000 K to (n1/n2) at 5500 K.

But wait, let me think about the physics. The spots are cooler, so in those regions, the ratio n1/n2 would be higher (since lower temperature means less excitation, so more atoms are in the lower energy state). But the unspotted regions are at the same 6000 K, so their ratio is the same as when there are no spots.

But when the star has spots, the observed line strength would be a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. So the equivalent width of the line would be a weighted average, perhaps based on the flux from each region.

So in the unspotted regions, the line is formed in a hotter photosphere, leading to a lower n1/n2 ratio. In the spotted regions, the line is formed in a cooler photosphere, leading to a higher n1/n2 ratio. However, the flux from the spotted regions is lower because their temperature is lower, so their contribution to the observed line is less.

Therefore, the overall observed ratio could be a flux-weighted average of the two regions.

So let's model the two regions.

Unspotted area: 60% of the surface, each emitting at 6000 K.

Spotted area: 40% of the surface, each emitting at T_spot ≈4304 K.

The flux from each region is F = sigma * T^4 * (area fraction).

The total flux is F_total = 0.6 * sigma * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * sigma * (4304)^4.

But when considering the line formation, each region contributes to the line according to their own n1/n2 ratios and their flux.

Assuming that the line is formed in each region, and the equivalent width is the sum of the contributions from each region, weighted by their flux.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of n1/n2, not the line strength. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply considering the average T of the photosphere as 5500 K when spots are present, so n1/n2 is calculated using 5500 K. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor by which the ratio changes is when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So when there are no spots, T=6000 K, and when there are spots, T=5500 K. So the factor is [n1/n2 at 6000 K] / [n1/n2 at 5500 K]

Let me compute that.

Compute the factor:

Factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) ] )

E2-E1 =8.56 eV.

k=8.617e-5 eV/K.

T_spotted=5500 K? Or T_spot=4304 K?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think.

If when there are spots, the entire photosphere's Teff is 5500 K, then T_used is 5500 K.

But earlier calculation when considering the star's effective temperature, the spots cause the average T_eff to be 5500 K, but the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at 4304 K.

So in the photosphere, when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of both T=6000 K and T=4304 K regions.

So the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average between the two regions.

So, for each region, compute n1/n2, then compute the flux-weighted average.

So, n1/n2 for unspotted regions: n1_un/n2_un = exp( -(E)/(k * 6000) )

n1_un/n2_un = exp( -8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000) )

Similarly, n1_spot/n2_spot = exp( -8.56 / (8.617e-5 *4304) )

Compute these exponents:

Compute for unspotted:

Denominator: 8.617e-5 *6000 = 0.51702 eV.

So exponent: -8.56 / 0.51702 ≈-16.55

So n1_un/n2_un = exp(-16.55) ≈ 7.4e-8.

For spotted regions:

Denominator: 8.617e-5 *4304 ≈ 0.3705 eV.

Exponent: -8.56 /0.3705 ≈-23.11.

n1_spot/n2_spot= exp(-23.11)≈ 3.16e-10.

Now, the flux from each region is F_un and F_spot.

F_un = sigma * (6000)^4 *0.6

F_spot = sigma * (4304)^4 *0.4

The total flux is F_total = F_un + F_spot.

But the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average of the two regions:

n1/n2_observed = (F_un * n1_un/n2_un + F_spot * n1_spot/n2_spot ) / F_total

But wait, n1 and n2 are number densities. The line strength depends on the column density, which is number density multiplied by path length. But assuming the path length is the same in both regions (same photospheric depth), then the line strength would be proportional to the number density ratio multiplied by the flux contribution.

So the observed ratio (n1/n2)_obs = (F_un * (n1_un/n2_un) + F_spot*(n1_spot/n2_spot)) / (F_un + F_spot)

Compute F_un and F_spot.

Compute F_un = 0.6 * (6000^4) =0.6 * (6e3)^4 =0.6*(1.296e14) =7.776e13.

F_spot =0.4 * (4304)^4.

Compute (4304)^4: 4304^2=185,282, 185,282^2 ≈34,338,  (approximate, but exact value needed).

Wait, 4304^4 = (4304^2)^2.

Compute 4304^2:

4300^2 =18490000.

(4304)^2 = (4300 +4)^2 =4300^2 + 2*4300*4 +4^2=18490000 +34400 +16=18524416.

So (4304)^4 = (18524416)^2.

But that's a huge number. Let me compute it as (approx 1.8524416e7)^2 = approx 3.432e14.

Wait, but to compute F_spot=0.4*(4304)^4.

(4304)^4= (4304^2)^2= (18524416)^2.

But perhaps compute 4304^4= (4.304e3)^4=4.304^4 *1e12.

4.304^4: 4.304^2 =18.524, 18.524^2= approx 343.16.

So 4.304^4 ≈343.16.

Thus, (4304)^4=343.16e12=3.4316e14.

So F_spot=0.4 *3.4316e14 =1.37264e14.

Now, F_un=0.6 * (6e3)^4 =0.6*1.296e15=7.776e14.

F_total= F_un + F_spot =7.776e14 +1.37264e14=9.14864e14.

Compute numerator for (n1/n2)_obs:

n1/n2_obs = [ F_un*(n1_un/n2_un) + F_spot*(n1_spot/n2_spot) ] / F_total.

Substitute the values:

n1_un/n2_un=7.4e-8.

n1_spot/n2_spot=3.16e-10.

So:

F_un * n1_un/n2_un =7.776e14 *7.4e-8 =7.776e14 *7.4e-8 ≈5.753e7.

F_spot *n1_spot/n2_spot=1.37264e14 *3.16e-10 ≈4.337e4.

So sum=5.753e7 +4.337e4 ≈5.796e7.

Divide by F_total=9.14864e14:

(n1/n2)_obs =5.796e7 /9.14864e14 ≈6.33e-8.

Now, when there are no spots, the ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots= exp( -8.56/(8.617e-5 *6000) )= same as n1_un/n2_un=7.4e-8.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = (7.4e-8 ) / (6.33e-8 )≈1.168.

So approximately 1.17, which is closest to option A (~1.1).

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, the ratio when no spots is 7.4e-8.

When spots are present, the observed ratio is 6.33e-8.

So the factor is 7.4e-8 /6.33e-8 ≈1.17, so about 1.17.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1.1, which is close.

But wait, maybe I should do the calculation more accurately.

Let me recompute the exponents.

Compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for each case.

E=8.56 eV.

k=8.617e-5 eV/K.

For T=6000 K: 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000) =8.56/(0.51702)=16.55.

So exp(-16.55)= approx 7.4e-8.

For T=4304 K: 8.56/(8.617e-5 *4304)=8.56/(0.3705)=23.11.

exp(-23.11)= approx 3.16e-10.

Now, F_un=0.6*(6e3)^4=0.6*(1.296e15)=7.776e14.

F_spot=0.4*(4304)^4=0.4*(3.4316e14)=1.3726e14.

Compute F_un *n1_un/n2_un=7.776e14 *7.4e-8 =7.776e14 *7.4e-8.

7.776e14 *7.4e-8=7.776 *7.4 * 1e6=57.53 *1e6=5.753e7.

F_spot *n1_spot/n2_spot=1.3726e14 *3.16e-10=1.3726 *3.16e4=4.337e4.

So sum is 5.753e7 +4.337e4=5.796e7.

F_total=7.776e14 +1.3726e14=9.1486e14.

So (n1/n2)_obs=5.796e7 /9.1486e14=5.796/(9.1486e7)=approx 6.33e-8.

So factor=7.4e-8 /6.33e-8=1.169≈1.17.

So the factor is approximately 1.17, which is about 1.1, so option A.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. In our calculation, when there are no spots, the ratio is higher (7.4e-8) than when there are spots (6.33e-8), which is a decrease. So the factor is about 1.17, so the ratio increases by a factor of 1.17, meaning when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is 1.17 times higher than when it has spots. So the factor is 1.17.

But the options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, etc.

So option A is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the problem assuming that the entire photosphere is at T=5500 K when spots are present. So compute the factor based on T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

Let me compute that.

Compute factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots)] )

E=8.56 eV.

k=8.617e-5 eV/K.

T_no_spots=6000 K.

T_spotted=5500 K.

So exponent= (8.56)/(8.617e-5) * (1/5500 -1/6000 )

Compute 1/5500 ≈1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.6667e-4.

Difference=1.818e-4 -1.6667e-4=1.513e-5.

So exponent= (8.56 /8.617e-5 ) *1.513e-5.

Compute 8.56 /8.617e-5 ≈99323.

Multiply by 1.513e-5: 99323 *1.513e-5≈1.502.

So exponent≈1.502.

So factor=exp(1.502)≈4.49.

So the factor would be approximately 4.5, which is option C.

But earlier, when considering the flux-weighted average, I got about 1.17, which is option A.

But which model is correct?

The problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the way to model it is to consider that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be accurate, because the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are cooler.

But in reality, the observed spectrum is a combination of both regions. So the correct approach is to compute the flux-weighted average, leading to a factor of ~1.17.

But the option in the problem for 1.17 is option A (~1.1).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K, leading to a factor of ~4.5 (option C). But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which is consistent with the flux-weighted approach giving a lower ratio when spots are present.

Wait, in the first approach, when using T=5500 K, the factor is 4.5, which would mean that the ratio when no spots is 4.5 times higher than when spots are present. Which matches the observation that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

But in the flux-weighted approach, the ratio when no spots is 7.4e-8, and when spots are present, 6.33e-8. So the factor is 1.17, meaning a small increase. But the problem says the ratio decreases, which would mean that the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present. Which is the case in both approaches.

But according to the first approach where the entire photosphere is considered at 5500 K, the factor is 4.5, which is option C. But according to the flux-weighted approach, it's ~1.17, option A.

This is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. The observed ratio is for the entire photosphere. If the photosphere is a mix of two temperatures, then the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average.

But when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K, but the individual regions are 6000 K and 4304 K. The question is, what is the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two levels in the entire photosphere when the star has spots.

But the Boltzmann equation applies locally in each region. So the observed ratio would be a combination of the two regions' ratios, weighted by their contribution to the line.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed line is from the entire photosphere, but the average temperature is 5500 K. So the ratio is calculated using 5500 K.

But to clarify, let me think about the physics again. The line is formed in the photosphere, which includes both hot and cool regions. The equivalent width of the line depends on the number of transitions in each region. In hotter regions, more excitation, so lower n1/n2 ratio. In cooler regions, less excitation, higher n1/n2 ratio. But the cooler regions contribute less flux, so their effect is diminished.

Thus, the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average. So our earlier calculation of ~1.17 is correct, leading to option A.

But wait, in our earlier calculation, the observed ratio when spots are present is lower than when there are no spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots ≈1.17.

So the ratio is about 1.17 times higher when no spots, which is an increase, but the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So that's correct.

So the factor is ~1.17, which is approximately option A (1.1).

But why does the other approach give a larger factor?

Because when considering the entire photosphere as 5500 K, the factor is higher (4.5), but that's not the case when the photosphere is a mix of two temperatures. So the correct approach is the flux-weighted average, leading to a factor of ~1.17.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation and consider the star's photospheric conditions.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - When no spots: Effective temperature \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - When 40% of the surface is covered by spots: Effective temperature \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \).
   - The transition between energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), giving an energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV} \).

2. **Boltzmann Equation**:
   The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k T}\right),
   \]
   where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

3. **Factor Calculation**:
   The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
   \]
   Substituting the Boltzmann equation:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
   \]

4. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( E_2 - E_1 = 8.56 \, \text{eV} \),
   - \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \),
   - \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \),
   - \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \).

   Compute the exponent:
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99323.
   \]
   Compute \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Multiply:
   \[
   99323 \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.502.
   \]

5. **Final Factor**:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.502) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in different energy levels.

Alright, let me break it down. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the presence of spots lowers the effective temperature of the star.

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. 

Wait, the transition between these levels is at 1448 Å. Oh, that's in the near-ultraviolet range. So it's about electron transitions in neutral Ti atoms, and how temperature affects their population in different energy levels.

Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), I can use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Here, E2 is higher than E1 since it's an emission or absorption line, right? So the exponent will be negative.

But wait, when the star has spots, the effective temperature drops. Wait, but how does that affect the photosphere? Oh, but the spots are cooler regions. So, the star's overall photosphere doesn't change in temperature except in the spots. Or wait, the question says that the overall Teff decreases. Hmm, maybe I should think about the effective temperature of the entire star, not just the spot regions.

Wait, the overall Teff is given as 5500 K when 40% of the surface is spotted. The question states that when the surface isn't spotted, the Teff is 6000 K. So when spots are present, the star's effective temperature is lower. 

Wait, but how does that relate to the photospheric temperature? Because the star's photosphere is where the continuum emission is coming from. But when spots are present, the spots are cooler, so they emit less. The overall Teff is a measure of the total luminosity, but perhaps the photospheric temperature in the unspotted regions is the same as when the star had no spots. Or maybe the effective temperature is an average, but the actual photospheric temperature is not the same as Teff. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So when the spots are present, the Teff (which is calculated from the total luminosity and radius) is lower. So the Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered, but the unspotted regions have their own higher temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying things, and considering that the star's photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But I think that's not the case because spots are cooler, so the average Teff would be between the unspotted and spotted temperatures.

Wait, maybe I should think about the effective temperature of the photosphere as being lower when spots are present, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem says that when the spots are present, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. Hmm, the question says that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the effective temperature is lower because the spots emit less, but the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K. So perhaps the star's photosphere has some regions at 6000 K (70% of the area) and 40% at a lower temperature, say T_spot.

Wait, but I think the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when the spots are present. Because the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, but each region's actual temperature is either 6000 K (unspotted) or lower (spotted). 

Wait, perhaps I should model this. The star's luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from the spots and the unspotted regions. So the total luminosity L_total = L_unspotted + L_spotted.

The unspotted area is 60% of the surface. The spotted area is 40%. So, the total luminosity when spots are present would be:

L_total = 0.6 * L_unspotted_per_area + 0.4 * L_spotted_per_area.

But without spots, the total luminosity is L_total_without = L_unspotted * 1 (since 100% of the surface is unspotted).

The effective temperature is determined by L = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

So, when spots are present:

L_total = 4π R² σ (5500)^4.

Without spots, L_total_without = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when spots are present, the unspotted regions have a higher temperature, T_unspotted, and the spotted regions have a lower temperature, T_spotted.

Wait, but the problem states that the effective temperature when the star has spots is 5500 K, which is lower than the 6000 K without spots. So when the spots are present, the total luminosity is based on an average Teff of 5500 K.

So, the total luminosity when spots are present is L = 4π R² σ (5500)^4.

Without spots, L = 4π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when spots are present, the star's surface emits from two regions: the unspotted (60%) at T1 and spotted (40%) at T2.

So:

L = 0.6 * (4π (R^2) σ (T1)^4) + 0.4 * (4π (R^2) σ (T2)^4)

Divide both sides by 4π R² σ:

L/(4π R² σ) ) = 0.6 T1^4 + 0.4 T2^4.

But the left side is Teff^4 when spots are present, which is 5500^4. So:

5500^4 = 0.6 T1^4 + 0.4 T2^4.

But we also know that without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, which is all T1 (since no spots), so T1 = 6000 K when there are no spots.

Wait, no. Without spots, the entire surface is at T1 = 6000 K, so the Teff is 6000 K.

When spots are present, the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at T2, which is lower.

So, substituting T1=6000 K into the equation when spots are present:

5500^4 = 0.6*(6000^4) + 0.4*(T2^4).

I can solve for T2.

Let me compute both sides numerically.

Let me compute 6000^4 and 5500^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4 *1e12. 5.5^4 is 5.5 *5.5 =30.25; 30.25 *5.5=166.375; 166.375 *5.5 ≈ 915.0625. So 915.0625e12 ≈9.150625e14.

So 5500^4 ≈9.150625e14.

Now the equation is:

9.150625e14 = 0.6*(1.296e15) + 0.4*T2^4.

Compute 0.6*(1.296e15) = 7.776e14.

So:

9.150625e14 = 7.776e14 + 0.4 T2^4.

Subtract 7.776e14:

9.150625e14 -7.776e14 = 1.374625e14 = 0.4 T2^4.

Divide by 0.4:

T2^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

Take the fourth root:

T2 = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Let me compute that.

What is 3.4365625e14 to the 0.25 power?

First, let's express 3.4365625e14 as 3.4365625 *1e14.

Take the fourth root:

(3.4365625)^(1/4) ≈ ?

Well, 3.436 is about 3.436. Let me think of known fourth powers.

1.3^4 = 2.8561.

1.4^4=3.8416. So 3.436 is between 1.3^4 and 1.4^4.

Let me compute 1.35^4: 1.35^2 =1.8225; squared again: 3.320756. Hmm, 1.35^4≈3.3208, which is less than 3.436.

1.36^2=1.8496. Then 1.36^4 = (1.8496)^2 ≈ 3.4214. Close to 3.436.

Wait, 1.36^4 is around 3.4214. 1.365^2 is (1.365)^2 = 1.863225. Then 1.863225^2 ≈ (approx 3.470). Wait, let's compute 1.863225^2: 1.863225 *1.863225.

Hmm, let's compute 1.863 *1.863. 1.863^2 = (1.8)^2 + 2*(1.8)(0.063) + (0.063)^2 = 3.24 + 0.2268 + 0.003969 ≈ 3.470769. So 1.365^4 ≈3.470769.

Wait, but our value is 3.436, which is between 1.36^4 (3.4214) and 1.365^4 (3.470769). Let's find the value x where x^4=3.436.

Between 1.36 and 1.365.

Let me approximate. Let me take x=1.36 + d. So (1.36 +d)^4 ≈3.436.

We have at d=0, x^4=3.4214.

We need to find d such that 3.4214 + 4*(1.36)^3 *d + ... =3.436.

But perhaps a linear approximation.

Let me compute (1.36)^3 = 1.36 *1.36 = 1.8496, then *1.36: 1.8496 *1.36 ≈ 2.520.

So 4*(1.36)^3 ≈4 *2.520=10.08.

The derivative of x^4 is 4x^3.

So delta_x ≈ (3.436-3.4214)/(4*(1.36)^3) )= (0.0146)/(10.08) ≈0.001448.

So d≈0.001448.

Thus x≈1.36 +0.001448 ≈1.3614.

So T2 is approximately 1.3614 *1e3 K = 1361.4 K. Wait, that can't be right. Because 1361 K is way too low for a star's surface, but perhaps it's correct, as spots are cooler.

Wait, but wait, the calculation was for (3.4365e14)^(1/4) in terms of the T^4. Wait, no, when I took the fourth root of 3.4365625e14, I should have multiplied by 1e3 because 1e14 is (1e3)^4 * 1e2. Wait: (1e3)^4 is 1e12. So 1e14 is 100 * (1e3)^4. So 3.4365625e14 is 343.65625 * (1e3)^4. So the fourth root is cube root of 343.65625 is about 7. So wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait, 3.4365625e14 is 3.4365625 * 10^14. So when you take the fourth root, it becomes (3.4365625)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4). 

What is (1e14)^(1/4)? 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4, because (1e3.5)^4 = (1e3.5)^2 * (1e3.5)^2 = 1e7 * 1e7 =1e14. So 1e3.5 is 10^(3.5) = 3162.27766. 

So (1e14)^(1/4)=3162.27766 K.

So T2^4=3.4365625e14 → T2= (3.4365625)^(1/4) *3162.27766 K.

Compute (3.4365625)^(1/4):

We know that (3.4365625)^(1/4) is approximately between 1.36 and 1.365. As I computed earlier, it's around 1.3614.

So 1.3614 * 3162.27766 ≈ 1.3614 * 3000 ≈4084 K, but more accurately:

3162.27766 *1.3614.

Let me compute 3000 *1.3614=4084.2, 162.27766 *1.3614 ≈ 220. So total ≈4304 K. Hmm, about 4304 K.

Wait, but that seems a bit high for a spot temperature, but perhaps it's correct. Let's accept that T2 ≈4304 K.

So the spotted regions have Teff of about 4304 K, while the unspotted regions remain at 6000 K.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. Wait, but when the spots are present, the photosphere includes both 6000 K regions and 4304 K regions. So how does that affect the overall ratio?

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere as a whole is considered to be at 5500 K? Or is the photosphere still at 6000 K in the unspotted regions, and at 4304 K in the spots, but the overall ratio is an average?

Hmm, the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But the ratio is observed to decrease. So we need to model the ratio based on the temperature.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

We can ignore the statistical weights (g1/g2) as they are constants, and the problem asks for the ratio change when the star has spots vs. not. So the factor change will be the ratio of (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ) ]

The g1/g2 cancels out, so:

Factor = exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) ) ] )

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly.

Let me denote:

Factor = [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ) ]

Which is exp [ (E2-E1)/(k) ( 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) ) ) ]

Because:

= exp( [ -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) + (E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ] )

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T_spotted - 1/T_no_spots) )

Hmm, because 1/T_spotted is less than 1/T_no_spots (since T_spotted < T_no_spots), so 1/T_spotted - 1/T_no_spots is negative. So the exponent is negative, so the factor is less than 1. So the ratio n1/n2 decreases when T decreases, which aligns with the problem statement.

Wait, but when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n1/n2 would decrease because the denominator in the Boltzmann equation becomes larger (since n2 increases). So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is [exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ) ].

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) ) )

Wait, let's recompute that.

Factor = [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_spots

= [exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) ) ] / [ exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ) ]

= exp( [ - (E2-E1)/(k T_no_spots) + (E2-E1)/(k T_spotted) ] )

= exp( (E2 - E1) / (k) * (1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots)) )

Wait, but let's compute 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) = (T_no_spots - T_spotted)/(T_no_spots T_spotted)

So the exponent becomes (E2-E1)/(k) * (T_no_spots - T_spotted)/(T_no_spots T_spotted) )

But E2-E1 is the energy difference corresponding to the transition at 1448 Å. So we can compute this energy.

The energy of a photon with wavelength λ is E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / 1.448e-7 J.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈1.372e-18 J.

But we need this in terms of eV, perhaps. Because k (Boltzmann constant) is about 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So E = hc/λ = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, because hc ≈ 12400 eV·Å. So 12400 / 1448 ≈8.56 eV.

So E ≈8.56 eV.

So E2-E1 =8.56 eV.

Now, T_no_spots =6000 K, T_spotted=5500 K?

Wait, no! Wait, earlier I thought T_spotted was about 4300 K, but that was under the assumption that the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. But wait, that was a confusion. Let me clarify.

Wait, the effective temperature of the entire star when spotted is 5500 K. But the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at T_spot, which we calculated to be around 4304 K.

But in the photosphere, when the star has spots, the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at 4304 K. So the two regions have different temperatures.

But how does that affect the observed ratio of Ti atoms in energy levels?

Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average of the two regions. Because the spots emit less continuum, so when you observe the star, the equivalent width of the line depends on the contribution from each region.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at Teff 5500 K when spots are present, hence the ratio is calculated using that temperature. But that might not be accurate, but perhaps the problem is simplifying it that way.

Wait, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere as a whole is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present. So for the Boltzmann factor, we use T=5500 K.

But earlier, I thought that the unspotted regions are at 6000 K and the spotted regions are lower. So which one is correct?

Hmm, this is a point of confusion. Let me re-read the question.

"When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K."

Ah, so the Teff when 40% is covered is 5500 K. But in reality, the spotted and unspotted regions have their own temperatures. But the question is about the ratio in the photosphere, which is a mix of the two. But I think for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when spots are present, so we can model it as T=5500 K.

Alternatively, perhaps each region (spotted and unspotted) contributes to the line formation in their own way, and the total line equivalent width is a combination of both regions. But modeling that would be more complicated.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2, when examining the stellar photosphere, is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So the observed ratio is lower when the star has spots.

But if the entire photosphere's Teff is lower, then the ratio would decrease because the Boltzmann factor would cause the upper level (level 2) to be more populated, leading to a lower n1/n2 ratio.

So perhaps the correct approach is to use T=6000 K when no spots, and T=5500 K when spots are present. So the factor is the ratio of (n1/n2) at 6000 K to (n1/n2) at 5500 K.

But wait, let me think about the physics. The spots are cooler, so in those regions, the ratio n1/n2 would be higher (since lower temperature means less excitation, so more atoms are in the lower energy state). But the unspotted regions are at the same 6000 K, so their ratio is the same as when there are no spots.

But when the star has spots, the observed line strength would be a combination of the unspotted and spotted regions. So the equivalent width of the line would be a weighted average, perhaps based on the flux from each region.

So in the unspotted regions, the line is formed in a hotter photosphere, leading to a lower n1/n2 ratio. In the spotted regions, the line is formed in a cooler photosphere, leading to a higher n1/n2 ratio. However, the flux from the spotted regions is lower because their temperature is lower, so their contribution to the observed line is less.

Therefore, the overall observed ratio could be a flux-weighted average of the two regions.

So let's model the two regions.

Unspotted area: 60% of the surface, each emitting at 6000 K.

Spotted area: 40% of the surface, each emitting at T_spot ≈4304 K.

The flux from each region is F = sigma * T^4 * (area fraction).

The total flux is F_total = 0.6 * sigma * (6000)^4 + 0.4 * sigma * (4304)^4.

But when considering the line formation, each region contributes to the line according to their own n1/n2 ratios and their flux.

Assuming that the line is formed in each region, and the equivalent width is the sum of the contributions from each region, weighted by their flux.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of n1/n2, not the line strength. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply considering the average T of the photosphere as 5500 K when spots are present, so n1/n2 is calculated using 5500 K. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor by which the ratio changes is when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So when there are no spots, T=6000 K, and when there are spots, T=5500 K. So the factor is [n1/n2 at 6000 K] / [n1/n2 at 5500 K]

Let me compute that.

Compute the factor:

Factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots) ] )

E2-E1 =8.56 eV.

k=8.617e-5 eV/K.

T_spotted=5500 K? Or T_spot=4304 K?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think.

If when there are spots, the entire photosphere's Teff is 5500 K, then T_used is 5500 K.

But earlier calculation when considering the star's effective temperature, the spots cause the average T_eff to be 5500 K, but the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at 4304 K.

So in the photosphere, when the star has spots, the photosphere is a mix of both T=6000 K and T=4304 K regions.

So the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average between the two regions.

So, for each region, compute n1/n2, then compute the flux-weighted average.

So, n1/n2 for unspotted regions: n1_un/n2_un = exp( -(E)/(k * 6000) )

n1_un/n2_un = exp( -8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000) )

Similarly, n1_spot/n2_spot = exp( -8.56 / (8.617e-5 *4304) )

Compute these exponents:

Compute for unspotted:

Denominator: 8.617e-5 *6000 = 0.51702 eV.

So exponent: -8.56 / 0.51702 ≈-16.55

So n1_un/n2_un = exp(-16.55) ≈ 7.4e-8.

For spotted regions:

Denominator: 8.617e-5 *4304 ≈ 0.3705 eV.

Exponent: -8.56 /0.3705 ≈-23.11.

n1_spot/n2_spot= exp(-23.11)≈ 3.16e-10.

Now, the flux from each region is F_un and F_spot.

F_un = sigma * (6000)^4 *0.6

F_spot = sigma * (4304)^4 *0.4

The total flux is F_total = F_un + F_spot.

But the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average of the two regions:

n1/n2_observed = (F_un * n1_un/n2_un + F_spot * n1_spot/n2_spot ) / F_total

But wait, n1 and n2 are number densities. The line strength depends on the column density, which is number density multiplied by path length. But assuming the path length is the same in both regions (same photospheric depth), then the line strength would be proportional to the number density ratio multiplied by the flux contribution.

So the observed ratio (n1/n2)_obs = (F_un * (n1_un/n2_un) + F_spot*(n1_spot/n2_spot)) / (F_un + F_spot)

Compute F_un and F_spot.

Compute F_un = 0.6 * (6000^4) =0.6 * (6e3)^4 =0.6*(1.296e14) =7.776e13.

F_spot =0.4 * (4304)^4.

Compute (4304)^4: 4304^2=185,282, 185,282^2 ≈34,338,  (approximate, but exact value needed).

Wait, 4304^4 = (4304^2)^2.

Compute 4304^2:

4300^2 =18490000.

(4304)^2 = (4300 +4)^2 =4300^2 + 2*4300*4 +4^2=18490000 +34400 +16=18524416.

So (4304)^4 = (18524416)^2.

But that's a huge number. Let me compute it as (approx 1.8524416e7)^2 = approx 3.432e14.

Wait, but to compute F_spot=0.4*(4304)^4.

(4304)^4= (4304^2)^2= (18524416)^2.

But perhaps compute 4304^4= (4.304e3)^4=4.304^4 *1e12.

4.304^4: 4.304^2 =18.524, 18.524^2= approx 343.16.

So 4.304^4 ≈343.16.

Thus, (4304)^4=343.16e12=3.4316e14.

So F_spot=0.4 *3.4316e14 =1.37264e14.

Now, F_un=0.6 * (6e3)^4 =0.6*1.296e15=7.776e14.

F_total= F_un + F_spot =7.776e14 +1.37264e14=9.14864e14.

Compute numerator for (n1/n2)_obs:

n1/n2_obs = [ F_un*(n1_un/n2_un) + F_spot*(n1_spot/n2_spot) ] / F_total.

Substitute the values:

n1_un/n2_un=7.4e-8.

n1_spot/n2_spot=3.16e-10.

So:

F_un * n1_un/n2_un =7.776e14 *7.4e-8 =7.776e14 *7.4e-8 ≈5.753e7.

F_spot *n1_spot/n2_spot=1.37264e14 *3.16e-10 ≈4.337e4.

So sum=5.753e7 +4.337e4 ≈5.796e7.

Divide by F_total=9.14864e14:

(n1/n2)_obs =5.796e7 /9.14864e14 ≈6.33e-8.

Now, when there are no spots, the ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots= exp( -8.56/(8.617e-5 *6000) )= same as n1_un/n2_un=7.4e-8.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = (7.4e-8 ) / (6.33e-8 )≈1.168.

So approximately 1.17, which is closest to option A (~1.1).

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, the ratio when no spots is 7.4e-8.

When spots are present, the observed ratio is 6.33e-8.

So the factor is 7.4e-8 /6.33e-8 ≈1.17, so about 1.17.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1.1, which is close.

But wait, maybe I should do the calculation more accurately.

Let me recompute the exponents.

Compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for each case.

E=8.56 eV.

k=8.617e-5 eV/K.

For T=6000 K: 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000) =8.56/(0.51702)=16.55.

So exp(-16.55)= approx 7.4e-8.

For T=4304 K: 8.56/(8.617e-5 *4304)=8.56/(0.3705)=23.11.

exp(-23.11)= approx 3.16e-10.

Now, F_un=0.6*(6e3)^4=0.6*(1.296e15)=7.776e14.

F_spot=0.4*(4304)^4=0.4*(3.4316e14)=1.3726e14.

Compute F_un *n1_un/n2_un=7.776e14 *7.4e-8 =7.776e14 *7.4e-8.

7.776e14 *7.4e-8=7.776 *7.4 * 1e6=57.53 *1e6=5.753e7.

F_spot *n1_spot/n2_spot=1.3726e14 *3.16e-10=1.3726 *3.16e4=4.337e4.

So sum is 5.753e7 +4.337e4=5.796e7.

F_total=7.776e14 +1.3726e14=9.1486e14.

So (n1/n2)_obs=5.796e7 /9.1486e14=5.796/(9.1486e7)=approx 6.33e-8.

So factor=7.4e-8 /6.33e-8=1.169≈1.17.

So the factor is approximately 1.17, which is about 1.1, so option A.

But wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. In our calculation, when there are no spots, the ratio is higher (7.4e-8) than when there are spots (6.33e-8), which is a decrease. So the factor is about 1.17, so the ratio increases by a factor of 1.17, meaning when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is 1.17 times higher than when it has spots. So the factor is 1.17.

But the options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, etc.

So option A is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the problem assuming that the entire photosphere is at T=5500 K when spots are present. So compute the factor based on T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

Let me compute that.

Compute factor = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_no_spots)] )

E=8.56 eV.

k=8.617e-5 eV/K.

T_no_spots=6000 K.

T_spotted=5500 K.

So exponent= (8.56)/(8.617e-5) * (1/5500 -1/6000 )

Compute 1/5500 ≈1.818e-4, 1/6000≈1.6667e-4.

Difference=1.818e-4 -1.6667e-4=1.513e-5.

So exponent= (8.56 /8.617e-5 ) *1.513e-5.

Compute 8.56 /8.617e-5 ≈99323.

Multiply by 1.513e-5: 99323 *1.513e-5≈1.502.

So exponent≈1.502.

So factor=exp(1.502)≈4.49.

So the factor would be approximately 4.5, which is option C.

But earlier, when considering the flux-weighted average, I got about 1.17, which is option A.

But which model is correct?

The problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the way to model it is to consider that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. But that might not be accurate, because the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are cooler.

But in reality, the observed spectrum is a combination of both regions. So the correct approach is to compute the flux-weighted average, leading to a factor of ~1.17.

But the option in the problem for 1.17 is option A (~1.1).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K, leading to a factor of ~4.5 (option C). But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which is consistent with the flux-weighted approach giving a lower ratio when spots are present.

Wait, in the first approach, when using T=5500 K, the factor is 4.5, which would mean that the ratio when no spots is 4.5 times higher than when spots are present. Which matches the observation that the ratio decreases when spots are present.

But in the flux-weighted approach, the ratio when no spots is 7.4e-8, and when spots are present, 6.33e-8. So the factor is 1.17, meaning a small increase. But the problem says the ratio decreases, which would mean that the ratio when no spots is higher than when spots are present. Which is the case in both approaches.

But according to the first approach where the entire photosphere is considered at 5500 K, the factor is 4.5, which is option C. But according to the flux-weighted approach, it's ~1.17, option A.

This is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem. The observed ratio is for the entire photosphere. If the photosphere is a mix of two temperatures, then the observed ratio would be a flux-weighted average.

But when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K, but the individual regions are 6000 K and 4304 K. The question is, what is the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two levels in the entire photosphere when the star has spots.

But the Boltzmann equation applies locally in each region. So the observed ratio would be a combination of the two regions' ratios, weighted by their contribution to the line.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed line is from the entire photosphere, but the average temperature is 5500 K. So the ratio is calculated using 5500 K.

But to clarify, let me think about the physics again. The line is formed in the photosphere, which includes both hot and cool regions. The equivalent width of the line depends on the number of transitions in each region. In hotter regions, more excitation, so lower n1/n2 ratio. In cooler regions, less excitation, higher n1/n2 ratio. But the cooler regions contribute less flux, so their effect is diminished.

Thus, the observed ratio is a flux-weighted average. So our earlier calculation of ~1.17 is correct, leading to option A.

But wait, in our earlier calculation, the observed ratio when spots are present is lower than when there are no spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots ≈1.17.

So the ratio is about 1.17 times higher when no spots, which is an increase, but the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So that's correct.

So the factor is ~1.17, which is approximately option A (1.1).

But why does the other approach give a larger factor?

Because when considering the entire photosphere as 5500 K, the factor is higher (4.5), but that's not the case when the photosphere is a mix of two temperatures. So the correct approach is the flux-weighted average, leading to a factor of ~1.17.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation and consider the star's photospheric conditions.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - When no spots: Effective temperature \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - When 40% of the surface is covered by spots: Effective temperature \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \).
   - The transition between energy levels corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \), giving an energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV} \).

2. **Boltzmann Equation**:
   The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k T}\right),
   \]
   where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

3. **Factor Calculation**:
   The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
   \]
   Substituting the Boltzmann equation:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
   \]

4. **Substitute Values**:
   - \( E_2 - E_1 = 8.56 \, \text{eV} \),
   - \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \),
   - \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \),
   - \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \).

   Compute the exponent:
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99323.
   \]
   Compute \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   Multiply:
   \[
   99323 \times 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.502.
   \]

5. **Final Factor**:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.502) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.

ANSWER: C
