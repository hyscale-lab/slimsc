Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I remember that when a conducting sphere is grounded, it means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can move freely. But wait, wait, if the sphere is conducting and grounded, does that mean it can't hold any charge? Or can it accumulate induced charges?

Oh right! When you bring a charge near a conducting sphere, charges are induced on the sphere. But since it's grounded, the induced charges can leave the sphere and go into the ground. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the sphere is neutral to begin with, and you bring a charge q near it, the induced charges would be such that the sphere's surface remains at zero potential, because it's grounded. Or maybe I should think about image charges.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. For a conducting sphere, the method of images can be used. When a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere create an image charge inside. But in the case of a grounded sphere, the potential at the surface is zero because it's connected to ground. So the image charge method applies, but the image charge would be inside the sphere.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the method of images for a grounded sphere: when a charge q is placed outside, the image charge is inside the sphere. The image charge is such that the potential at the surface due to both the charge and the image is zero. Because the sphere is conducting, the surface must be an equipotential, and since it's grounded, that potential is zero.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think about the potential energy. The system's potential energy would be the work done in assembling the charges. So when you bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere's center, you have to consider both the work you do and the work done by the induced charges.

Alternatively, another approach: the potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system. So that would involve the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which might help.

Wait, another thought: the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere at the surface must sum to zero.

Let me think about the image charge approach. For a conducting sphere, the image charge q' would be located at a point inside the sphere. The location depends on the radius R of the sphere and the distance d of the charge q from the center.

The image charge q' is given by a formula. I think the image charge for a sphere of radius R and a charge q at distance d (d > R) from the center will have a magnitude of (R/d) * q, but let me check. Wait, image charge for a conducting sphere: when a charge q is outside (d > R), the image charge q' is inside the sphere, and the distance from the center to the image is r' = R² / d. Because the image is inside, the distance is R²/d, and the image charge is negative if q is positive.

Wait, more accurately, the image charge is given by q' = (R^2 / d) * q / (d - R) ? No, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

In the method of images for a sphere, the image charge is at a distance r from the center, where r = R² / d. So for a charge q at distance d from the center of a sphere of radius R, the image charge q' would be located at a distance r = R²/d from the center, on the same line as q and the center. The image charge is negative if q is positive, I think.

Wait, the formula for the image charge when a point charge is outside a conducting sphere is q' = (R^2 / d) * q / (d - R)? Or is it q' = (R^2 / d^2) q? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the potential at the surface due to q and then find the image charge that would make the potential zero.

The potential at the surface (radius R) due to the charge q is V = k q / (d), since the distance from q to the surface is d - R if q is outside. Wait no, because the charge q is placed d away from the center, so the distance from q to any point on the sphere's surface would vary, but the potential due to a point charge depends on the distance from the charge to the point.

Wait no, the potential at the surface of the sphere due to charge q is k q / (distance from q to the surface point). But how does that average out?

Alternatively, since the sphere is conducting, the image charge method says that the potential due to the charge q and the image charge q' should be zero at the sphere's surface. So the image charge would be placed inside the sphere.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is given by q' = (R^2 / d^2) q. Because the image charge is inside the sphere, so the distance from q to the image is d - R²/d.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the potential at the surface. The potential due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere must be zero. But since it's a conducting sphere, the induced charges would arrange themselves so that the potential on the surface is zero.

But maybe another approach is better. Think about the potential energy as the work done in assembling the system. The system consists of the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

So, the potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, plus the work done in bringing the induced charges into place.

Wait, but the sphere is conducting and grounded, so any induced charges can flow into the ground. Wait, no. If the sphere is initially neutral, when you bring a charge q near it, the induced charges would be +q and -q on the sphere, but since it's grounded, the -q would leave into the ground. So the sphere would end up with a charge +q? No, that can't be right, because the sphere was neutral. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a positive charge q is placed near a neutral conducting sphere, electrons in the sphere are attracted towards the near side, leaving the far side positively charged. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess electrons can leave the sphere, but wait, the sphere was neutral. So when you bring a positive charge q near the sphere, the sphere's electrons move to the near side, making that side negative. Since the sphere is connected to ground, the electrons can flow into the ground, but wait—no, the sphere itself was neutral. So the induced charge on the sphere would be such that the net charge remains zero.

Wait, no. Because when you bring a charge q near the sphere, the charges in the sphere redistribute. If q is positive, the electrons in the sphere are attracted towards the near side, making that side negative, and the far side positive. But since the sphere is conducting, the positive charge on the far side can't stay there because the sphere is neutral; but wait, the sphere was neutral, so the induced charges would be such that the sphere remains neutral. But because the charge q is outside, the sphere's induced charge would be zero? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall: a conducting sphere in electrostatic equilibrium has charges on the surface. If it's neutral, then any external charge induces a redistribution of the charges on the sphere, but the total charge remains zero. But wait, when you bring a charge q near a neutral conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere are such that the sphere's surface has a negative charge on the near side and a positive charge on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the electrons can leave the sphere, but wait, the sphere was neutral. So if the sphere loses electrons, it would have a positive charge. But that can't be because it was neutral. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the sphere's net charge remains zero, but the induced charges are such that the surface charge density is adjusted. But I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should think instead about the potential energy.

The potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system. So bringing the charge q from infinity to a distance d, and then considering the work done by the induced charges.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can flow into the ground, so maybe the sphere doesn't have any net charge. Wait, no—because when you bring a charge near the sphere, the induced charges can flow, but the sphere's net charge remains zero.

Wait, let's think of it this way: when you bring a charge q close to a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere's surface develops induced charges. Because the sphere is a conductor, the charges will redistribute such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero (since it's grounded). So the potential due to the external charge q plus the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere must be zero at the sphere's surface.

Wait, but the induced charges are on the sphere's surface, so maybe the sphere's induced charges can be treated as a single image charge inside the sphere. That way, the potential at the surface due to q and the image charge is zero.

So the image charge q' is located at a distance r from the center, where r = (R²)/d. And its magnitude would be (R/d) times q. So q' = (R^2 / d) * (something). Wait, maybe I should calculate the potential at the surface of the sphere.

The potential at the surface due to q is V_q = k q / (d - R). Wait, no, because the distance from q to the surface is (d - R) if d > R. But wait, for a sphere, the potential due to an external charge is the same as if all the charge were at the center, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the potential due to q at the surface is k q / (d), because the charge is outside, and the potential inside a conductor is constant. Wait, no, the potential on the surface is due to both q and the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the surface is zero.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the potential energy. The potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system. There are two charges contributing: the external charge q, and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which might mean that the work done by the induced charges is zero. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done in bringing q to its position, considering the potential created by the induced charges.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energy of the charge q in the potential created by the sphere, plus the potential energy of the induced charges on the sphere in their own potential. But since the sphere is conducting, the internal potential energy of the induced charges would be zero (because the induced charges are in electrostatic equilibrium, their potential energy is zero).

Wait, but the potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system, so you have to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, and the work done against the electric field created by the sphere (the induced charges). But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, so the potential at the point where q is placed is just the potential due to the induced charges.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about the image charge method. The image charge is used to find the potential or force due to induced charges. So the potential energy U of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and its image charge. Because the image charge represents the effect of the induced charges.

So, the image charge q' is inside the sphere, located at a distance r from the center, where r = R²/d. The charge q is at distance d, and the image charge is at r = R²/d. So the distance between q and q' is d - r = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

The potential energy between q and q' would be U = (1/2) k (q)(q') / (distance between them). But wait, since the image charge is a result of the induced charges, perhaps the actual potential energy is half of that, because the induced charges are due to q, and the image is a way to model their effect.

Wait, the image charge approach says that the potential outside the sphere is the same as if the image charge were present. So the potential energy of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and the image charge q', divided by two because each pair is counted twice.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about this. Let me try to think again. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, so the system's potential energy would be the work done to bring q from infinity to distance d, considering the presence of q'.

Wait, the formula for the image charge is q' = (R^2 / d^2) q. Because when you have a charge q at a distance d from the center of a sphere of radius R, the image charge is q' = (R²/d²) q, located at a distance R²/d from the center.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me look up the formula—oh wait, I can't look it up, I have to rely on memory. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. So the potential due to q and the induced charges at the sphere's surface must be zero.

The potential due to q at the surface is k q/(d), and the potential due to the induced charges (which we model as q') would be k q' / (R), but that seems off. Alternatively, maybe the image charge is inside, so the potential due to the image charge at the surface is k q' / (R), but that would have to cancel out the potential from q.

Wait, if the surface is at zero potential, then the potential due to q plus the potential due to the induced charges (modeled as q') must equal zero at the surface. So:

k q / d + k q' / R = 0.

Solving for q':

q' = -(k q R)/(d k) )= - (q R)/d.

Wait, that can't be right because the image charge should be inside the sphere. Let me think again.

Wait, the distance from the image charge to the surface would be R, since it's located at R²/d away from the center. So the distance between the image charge and a point on the surface is R²/d + (R - R²/d) ??? No, perhaps it's better to compute the distance from the image charge to the surface point.

Wait, perhaps I should model the potential due to the image charge at the surface. The image charge is at a distance r = R²/d from the center, and the surface is at radius R. So the distance from the image charge to any point on the surface varies, but the potential at the surface due to the image charge would be the same as the potential due to a point charge located at r inside the sphere.

Wait, no, maybe the potential due to the image charge at the surface is the same as if the charge were located at the center, because for a sphere, potentials due to charges inside are as if all the charge were at the center. Hmm, that's a property of conductors in electrostatics.

So, the potential at the surface due to the image charge q' would be k q' / R.

Then, the sum of potentials at the surface from q and q' is zero:

k q / d + k q' / R = 0.

So,

q' / R = - q / d.

So,

q' = - (q R) / d.

Wait, but the image charge is inside the sphere, so the correct formula for q' would have a negative sign if q is positive. That makes sense. So the image charge is negative, located at a distance of R²/d inside the sphere.

So now, the potential energy U of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and the image charge q'.

The distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

The potential energy would be U = (1/2) k q q' / (distance between them).

But wait, since q' is an image charge, the actual potential energy is the work done in bringing q into position considering the induced charges. Alternatively, the potential energy is (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the separation.

So substituting q' = - q R / d and r = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) * k * q * (- q R/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ].

Simplify denominator:

(d² - R²)/d = (d² - R²)/d

So,

U = (1/2) * k * (- q² R/d) * [d/(d² - R²)] )

The d in numerator and denominator cancel:

U = (1/2) * k * (- q² R) / (d² - R²).

Which is:

U = - (k q² R) / [ 2 (d² - R²) ) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2), and option D is - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R²).

Hmm, I have - (k q² R)/(2 (d² - R²)), which matches option D except for the R in the numerator.

Wait, did I make a mistake in calculating q'? Because earlier I said q' = - q R / d, but perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, let's go back. The condition for the potential at the surface being zero is:

(V due to q) + (V due to induced charges) = 0.

But the induced charges on the sphere can be modeled as a single image charge q' located at r = R²/d inside the sphere. The potential at the surface due to q' is k q' / R, because for a sphere, the potential inside due to charges outside is as if the charges are at the center.

Wait, no. The potential at the surface due to the image charge q' located at r would be as if q' were at the center. So the potential would be k q' / R.

So,

k q / d + k q' / R = 0.

So,

q' = - ( q R ) / d.

So that part seems correct.

But perhaps the distance between q and q' is not (d^2 - R^2)/d. Let me calculate it.

The charge q is at a distance d from the center. The image charge q' is at a distance r = R²/d from the center, along the same line.

So the separation between q and q' is d - r = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So that's correct.

So putting it all together, U = (1/2) * k * q * q' / (separation).

Substituting q' = - q R / d,

U = (1/2) * k * q * (- q R/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify denominator:

( d² - R² ) / d = (d - R)(d + R)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) * k * (- q² R/d) * [ d / (d² - R²) ) ]

The d in numerator and denominator cancel out, so:

U = (1/2) * k * (- q² R) / (d² - R² )

Which simplifies to:

U = - (k q^2 R) / [ 2 (d² - R^2) ]

Looking at the options, option D is U= - (1/2) k q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2 ), which matches exactly what I have here. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but looking back, none of the options have a R in the numerator except options C and D. Option C has R squared in the numerator, and D has R.

Wait, so my calculation gives U = - (k q^2 R)/(2 (d² - R^2)), which is exactly what option D says.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential energy U is the work done in bringing q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, the potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charges would be the same as the potential due to the image charge q', which we found earlier. So the potential at q's position is V = k q' / (d - r), where r is the distance from the center to q' (R^2/d). So d - r = (d^2 - R^2)/d.

But q' is located at R^2/d from the center, so the distance between q and q' is (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So the potential at q due to q' is V = k q' / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ].

Which is V = (k q') d / (d^2 - R^2).

The potential energy U is q times this potential:

U = q * V = q * (k q' d ) / (d^2 - R^2).

But since q' = - q R / d,

U = q * (k (- q R/d ) * d ) / (d^2 - R^2 )

Simplify:

U = [ q * (-k q R) ] / (d^2 - R^2 )

Which is:

U = - k q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2 )

But wait, this is different from earlier because I'm not dividing by 2. Hmm, but in the image method, do I have to account for the energy by considering both bringing the charges and the interaction between them?

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the potential energy is the work done in bringing q from infinity, which is the integral of the electric field due to the sphere's charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the point where q is placed is the same as the potential due to the image charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy U is (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the separation between q and q'.

Wait, in the image charge method, the potential energy is considered as the sum of the energies between each pair of charges. But since q' is an image charge, not a real charge, perhaps the actual potential energy is (1/2) times the potential energy calculated using the image charge.

So, using the earlier approach, the potential energy would be (1/2) * k q q' / r.

Which is (1/2) * k (q) (- q R/d) / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ]

Simplify:

(1/2) * k (- q² R/d) * d / (d^2 - R^2 )

The d's cancel, leading to (1/2) * (-k q² R) / (d² - R^2 )

So U = - (k q² R ) / [ 2 (d² - R^2 ) ]

Which is option D.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is grounded, meaning its surface potential is zero. The induced charges on the sphere can be modeled using the method of images, where the induced charges are represented by an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Image Charge Calculation**:  
   The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( r = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is given by:
   \[
   q' = -\frac{q R}{d}.
   \]
   The negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite sign of \( q \).

2. **Potential Energy Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done in assembling the charge \( q \) and its image charge \( q' \). The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is:
   \[
   \text{Separation} = d - r = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}.
   \]
   The potential energy is given by:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{k q q'}{\text{Separation}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{q R}{d} \) and the separation, we get:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{k q \left(-\frac{q R}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
   \]

3. **Simplification**:  
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{-k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]
   Thus, the potential energy of the system is:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The derived expression matches **Option D**, which is:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The net potential energy of the system is given by **Option D**.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I remember that when a conducting sphere is grounded, it means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can move freely. But wait, wait, if the sphere is conducting and grounded, does that mean it can't hold any charge? Or can it accumulate induced charges?

Oh right! When you bring a charge near a conducting sphere, charges are induced on the sphere. But since it's grounded, the induced charges can leave the sphere and go into the ground. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the sphere is neutral to begin with, and you bring a charge q near it, the induced charges would be such that the sphere's surface remains at zero potential, because it's grounded. Or maybe I should think about image charges.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. For a conducting sphere, the method of images can be used. When a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere create an image charge inside. But in the case of a grounded sphere, the potential at the surface is zero because it's connected to ground. So the image charge method applies, but the image charge would be inside the sphere.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the method of images for a grounded sphere: when a charge q is placed outside, the image charge is inside the sphere. The image charge is such that the potential at the surface due to both the charge and the image is zero. Because the sphere is conducting, the surface must be an equipotential, and since it's grounded, that potential is zero.

Wait, another thought: the induced charges on the sphere would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere at the surface must sum to zero.

Let me think about the image charge approach. For a conducting sphere, the image charge q' would be located at a point inside the sphere. The location depends on the radius R of the sphere and the distance d of the charge q from the center.

The image charge q' is given by a formula. I think the image charge for a sphere of radius R and a charge q at distance d (d > R) from the center will have a magnitude of (R/d) * q, but let me check. Wait, image charge for a conducting sphere: when a charge q is outside (d > R), the image charge q' is inside the sphere, and the distance from the center to the image is r' = R² / d. Because the image is inside, the distance is R²/d, and the image charge is negative if q is positive.

Wait, more accurately, the image charge is given by q' = (R^2 / d) * q / (d - R) ? No, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

In the method of images for a sphere, the image charge is at a distance r from the center, where r = R² / d. So for a charge q at distance d from the center of a sphere of radius R, the image charge q' would be located at a distance r = R²/d from the center, on the same line as q and the center. The image charge is negative if q is positive, I think.

Wait, the formula for the image charge when a point charge is outside a conducting sphere is q' = (R^2 / d) * q / (d - R)? Or is it q' = (R^2 / d^2) q? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the potential at the surface due to q and then find the image charge that would make the potential zero.

The potential at the surface (radius R) due to the charge q is V = k q / (d), since the distance from q to the surface is d - R if q is outside. Wait no, because the charge q is placed d away from the center, so the distance from q to any point on the sphere's surface would vary, but the potential due to a point charge depends on the distance from the charge to the point.

Wait no, the potential at the surface of the sphere due to charge q is k q / (distance from q to the surface point). But how does that average out?

Alternatively, since the sphere is conducting, the image charge method says that the potential due to the charge q and the image charge q' should be zero at the sphere's surface. So the image charge would be placed inside the sphere.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is given by q' = (R^2 / d^2) q. Because the image charge is inside the sphere, so the distance from q to the image is d - R²/d.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the potential at the surface. The potential due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere must be zero. But since it's a conducting sphere, the induced charges would arrange themselves so that the potential on the surface is zero.

But maybe another approach is better. Think about the potential energy as the work done in assembling the system. The system consists of the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

So, the potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, plus the work done in bringing the induced charges into place.

Wait, but the sphere is conducting and grounded, so any induced charges can flow into the ground. Wait, no. If the sphere is initially neutral, when you bring a charge q near it, the induced charges would be +q and -q on the sphere, but since it's grounded, the -q would leave into the ground. So the sphere would end up with a charge +q? No, that can't be right, because the sphere was neutral. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a positive charge q is placed near a neutral conducting sphere, electrons in the sphere are attracted towards the near side, leaving the far side positively charged. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess electrons can leave the sphere, but wait, the sphere was neutral. So when you bring a positive charge q near the sphere, the sphere's electrons move to the near side, making that side negative. Since the sphere is connected to ground, the electrons can flow into the ground, but wait—no, the sphere itself was neutral. So the induced charge on the sphere would be such that the net charge remains zero.

Wait, no. Because when you bring a charge q near the sphere, the charges in the sphere redistribute. If q is positive, the electrons in the sphere are attracted towards the near side, making that side negative, and the far side positive. But since the sphere is conducting, the positive charge on the far side can't stay there because the sphere is neutral; but wait, the sphere was neutral, so the induced charges would be such that the sphere remains neutral. But because the charge q is outside, the sphere's induced charge would be zero? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall: a conducting sphere in electrostatic equilibrium has charges on the surface. If it's neutral, then any external charge induces a redistribution of the charges on the sphere, but the total charge remains zero. But wait, when you bring a charge q near a neutral conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere are such that the sphere's surface has a negative charge on the near side and a positive charge on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the electrons can leave the sphere, but wait, the sphere was neutral. So if the sphere loses electrons, it would have a positive charge. But that can't be because it was neutral. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the sphere's net charge remains zero, but the induced charges are such that the surface charge density is adjusted. But I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should think instead about the potential energy.

The potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system. So bringing the charge q from infinity to a distance d, and then considering the work done by the induced charges.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can flow into the ground, so maybe the sphere doesn't have any net charge. Wait, no—because when you bring a charge near the sphere, the induced charges can flow, but the sphere's net charge remains zero.

Wait, let's think of it this way: when you bring a charge q close to a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere's surface develops induced charges. Because the sphere is a conductor, the charges will redistribute such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero (since it's grounded). So the potential due to the external charge q plus the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere must be zero at the sphere's surface.

Wait, but the induced charges are on the sphere's surface, so maybe the sphere's induced charges can be treated as a single image charge inside the sphere. That way, the potential at the surface due to q and the image charge is zero.

So the image charge q' is located at a distance r from the center, where r = (R²)/d. And its magnitude would be (R/d) times q. So q' = (R^2 / d) * (something). Wait, maybe I should calculate the potential at the surface of the sphere.

The potential at the surface due to q is V_q = k q / (d - R). Wait, no, because the distance from q to the surface is (d - R) if d > R. But wait, for a sphere, the potential due to an external charge is the same as if all the charge were at the center, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the potential due to q at the surface is k q / (d), because the charge is outside, and the potential inside a conductor is constant. Wait, no, the potential on the surface is due to both q and the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the surface is zero.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the potential energy. The potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system. There are two charges contributing: the external charge q, and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, which might mean that the work done by the induced charges is zero. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done in bringing q to its position, considering the potential created by the induced charges.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energy of the charge q in the potential created by the sphere, plus the potential energy of the induced charges on the sphere in their own potential. But since the sphere is conducting, the internal potential energy of the induced charges would be zero (because the induced charges are in electrostatic equilibrium, their potential energy is zero).

Wait, but the potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system, so you have to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, and the work done against the electric field created by the sphere (the induced charges). But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero, so the potential at the point where q is placed is just the potential due to the induced charges.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about the image charge method. The image charge is used to find the potential or force due to induced charges. So the potential energy U of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and its image charge. Because the image charge represents the effect of the induced charges.

So, the image charge q' is inside the sphere, located at a distance r from the center, where r = R²/d. The charge q is at distance d, and the image charge is at r = R²/d. So the distance between q and q' is d - r = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

The potential energy between q and q' would be U = (1/2) k (q)(q') / (distance between them). But wait, since the image charge is a result of the induced charges, perhaps the actual potential energy is half of that, because the induced charges are due to q, and the image is a way to model their effect.

Wait, the image charge approach says that the potential outside the sphere is the same as if the image charge were present. So the potential energy of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and the image charge q', divided by two because each pair is counted twice.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure about this. Let me try to think again. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, so the system's potential energy would be the work done to bring q from infinity to distance d, considering the presence of q'.

Wait, the formula for the image charge is q' = (R^2 / d^2) q. Because when you have a charge q at a distance d from the center of a sphere of radius R, the image charge is q' = (R²/d²) q, located at a distance R²/d from the center.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me look up the formula—oh wait, I can't look it up, I have to rely on memory. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. So the potential due to q and the induced charges at the sphere's surface must be zero.

The potential due to q at the surface is k q/(d), and the potential due to the induced charges (which we model as q') would be k q' / (R), but that seems off. Alternatively, maybe the image charge is inside, so the potential due to the image charge at the surface is k q' / (R), but that would have to cancel out the potential from q.

Wait, if the surface is at zero potential, then the potential due to q plus the potential due to the induced charges (modeled as q') must equal zero at the surface. So:

k q / d + k q' / R = 0.

Solving for q':

q' = -(k q R)/(d k) )= - (q R)/d.

Wait, that can't be right because the image charge should be inside the sphere. Let me think again.

Wait, the distance from the image charge to the surface would be R, since it's located at R²/d away from the center. So the distance between the image charge and a point on the surface is R²/d + (R - R²/d) ??? No, perhaps it's better to compute the distance from the image charge to the surface point.

Wait, perhaps I should model the potential due to the image charge at the surface. The image charge is at a distance r = R²/d from the center, and the surface is at radius R. So the distance from the image charge to any point on the surface varies, but the potential at the surface due to the image charge would be the same as the potential due to a point charge located at r inside the sphere.

Wait, no, maybe the potential due to the image charge at the surface is the same as if the charge were located at the center, because for a sphere, potentials due to charges inside are as if all the charge were at the center. Hmm, that's a property of conductors in electrostatics.

So, the potential at the surface due to the image charge q' would be k q' / R.

Then, the sum of potentials at the surface from q and q' is zero:

k q / d + k q' / R = 0.

So,

q' / R = - q / d.

So,

q' = - (q R) / d.

Wait, but the image charge is inside the sphere, so the correct formula for q' would have a negative sign if q is positive. That makes sense. So the image charge is negative, located at a distance of R²/d inside the sphere.

So now, the potential energy U of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and the image charge q'.

The distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

The potential energy would be U = (1/2) k q q' / (distance between them).

But wait, since q' is an image charge, the actual potential energy is the work done in bringing q into position considering the induced charges. Alternatively, the potential energy is (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the separation.

So substituting q' = - q R / d and r = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) * k * q * (- q R/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ].

Simplify denominator:

(d² - R²)/d = (d² - R²)/d

So,

U = (1/2) * k * (- q² R/d) * [d/(d² - R²)] )

The d in numerator and denominator cancel:

U = (1/2) * k * (- q² R) / (d² - R²).

Which is:

U = - (k q² R) / [ 2 (d² - R²) ) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2), and option D is - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R²).

Hmm, I have - (k q² R)/(2 (d² - R²)), which matches option D except for the R in the numerator.

Wait, did I make a mistake in calculating q'? Because earlier I said q' = - q R / d, but perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, let's go back. The condition for the potential at the surface being zero is:

(V due to q) + (V due to induced charges) = 0.

But the induced charges on the sphere can be modeled as a single image charge q' located at r = R²/d inside the sphere. The potential at the surface due to q' is k q' / R, because for a sphere, the potential inside due to charges outside is as if the charges are at the center.

Wait, no. The potential at the surface due to the image charge q' located at r would be as if q' were at the center. So the potential would be k q' / R.

So,

k q / d + k q' / R = 0.

So,

q' = - ( q R ) / d.

So that part seems correct.

But perhaps the distance between q and q' is not (d^2 - R^2)/d. Let me calculate it.

The charge q is at a distance d from the center. The image charge q' is at a distance r = R²/d from the center, along the same line.

So the separation between q and q' is d - r = d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So that's correct.

So putting it all together, U = (1/2) * k * q * q' / (separation).

Substituting q' = - q R / d,

U = (1/2) * k * q * (- q R/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify denominator:

( d² - R² ) / d = (d - R)(d + R)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) * k * (- q² R/d) * [ d / (d² - R²) ) ]

The d in numerator and denominator cancel out, so:

U = (1/2) * k * (- q² R) / (d² - R² )

Which simplifies to:

U = - (k q^2 R) / [ 2 (d² - R^2) ]

Looking at the options, option D is U= - (1/2) k q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2 ), which matches exactly what I have here. So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but looking back, none of the options have a R in the numerator except options C and D. Option C has R squared in the numerator, and D has R.

Wait, so my calculation gives U = - (k q^2 R)/(2 (d² - R^2)), which is exactly what option D says.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charges. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential energy U is the work done in bringing q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

But since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, the potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charges would be the same as the potential due to the image charge q', which we found earlier. So the potential at q's position is V = k q' / (d - r), where r is the distance from the center to q' (R^2/d). So d - r = (d^2 - R^2)/d.

But q' is located at R^2/d from the center, so the distance between q and q' is (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So the potential at q due to q' is V = k q' / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ].

Which is V = (k q') d / (d^2 - R^2).

The potential energy U is q times this potential:

U = q * V = q * (k q' d ) / (d^2 - R^2).

But since q' = - q R / d,

U = q * (k (- q R/d ) * d ) / (d^2 - R^2 )

Simplify:

U = [ q * (-k q R) ] / (d^2 - R^2 )

Which is:

U = - k q^2 R / (d^2 - R^2 )

But wait, this is different from earlier because I'm not dividing by 2. Hmm, but in the image method, do I have to account for the energy by considering both bringing the charges and the interaction between them?

Wait, perhaps the correct way is that the potential energy is the work done in bringing q from infinity, which is the integral of the electric field due to the sphere's charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the potential at the point where q is placed is the same as the potential due to the image charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy U is (1/2) k q q' / r, where r is the separation between q and q'.

Wait, in the image charge method, the potential energy is considered as the sum of the energies between each pair of charges. But since q' is an image charge, not a real charge, perhaps the actual potential energy is (1/2) times the potential energy calculated using the image charge.

So, using the earlier approach, the potential energy would be (1/2) * k q q' / r.

Which is (1/2) * k (q) (- q R/d) / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ]

Simplify:

(1/2) * k (- q² R/d) * d / (d^2 - R^2 )

The d's cancel, leading to (1/2) * (-k q² R) / (d² - R^2 )

So U = - (k q² R ) / [ 2 (d² - R^2 ) ]

Which is option D.

So the correct answer is D.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider a charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( d \) from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is grounded, meaning its surface potential is zero. The induced charges on the sphere can be modeled using the method of images, where the induced charges are represented by an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Image Charge Calculation**:  
   The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( r = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is given by:
   \[
   q' = -\frac{q R}{d}.
   \]
   The negative sign indicates that the image charge has the opposite sign of \( q \).

2. **Potential Energy Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done in assembling the charge \( q \) and its image charge \( q' \). The distance between \( q \) and \( q' \) is:
   \[
   \text{Separation} = d - r = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}.
   \]
   The potential energy is given by:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{k q q'}{\text{Separation}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{q R}{d} \) and the separation, we get:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{k q \left(-\frac{q R}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
   \]

3. **Simplification**:  
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \frac{-k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]
   Thus, the potential energy of the system is:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The derived expression matches **Option D**, which is:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The net potential energy of the system is given by **Option D**.
