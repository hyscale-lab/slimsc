Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics because the effects of relativity become significant. So I should probably use Einstein's theory of relativity here.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Let me start with the relative speed. I recall that relative velocity in special relativity isn't just the difference as in classical mechanics. The formula for relative velocity u' between two objects moving at u and v relative to a stationary observer is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, wait, the formula is actually (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) when one is moving at u and the other at v relative to the same frame. But I'm not sure which way the velocities are—like, is one moving faster than the other?

Wait, in this case, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from astronaut 2's frame, what's the speed of astronaut 1? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the question says "relative speed and the total energy of the system." Oh wait, relative speed between them. So I think the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

So let's pick astronaut 2's frame. Then astronaut 1's speed would be calculated using the velocity addition formula. So u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. So u' = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = 0.1c/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c, so either of those could be possible.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes relative speed is considered as the magnitude, so whether it's (u - v) or (v - u) in the numerator, but since both are in the same direction, the relative speed is just the difference. So our calculation should be correct.

Next, the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. The formula for total energy of each astronaut is gamma * m c². So the total energy E_total is (gamma1 * 2m c²) + (gamma2 * 3m c²).

Wait, let's see. Each astronaut's energy is gamma times their rest mass energy. So for the first astronaut, gamma1 is 1/sqrt(1 - (v1²/c²)), and v1 is 0.6c. For v1, v1²/c² is 0.36, so 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. Square root is 0.8, so gamma1 is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Similarly for the second astronaut, v2 is 0.5c. v2²/c² is 0.25, so 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root is sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660, so gamma2 is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So calculating each energy:

E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² = 3.4641 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B is 4.96, which doesn't match. Option D is 5 mc², which is less than our calculated value.

So the total energy is about 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c. That points to option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation. The formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

So (0.6c -0.5c) = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = 1/7 c, which is approximately 0.142857c, which rounds to 0.14c. So that part is correct.

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.6c\) and \(v = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m c^2) = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**.
