Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the distance they travel before decaying is related to their lifetime and speed. Oh right, the mean decay length is the product of the particle's lifetime and its velocity, and then multiplied by the speed of light if necessary.

Wait, so the formula I think is something like L = gamma * v * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime. But I might be mixing up some terms here.

First, I need to find the proper lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV. I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a particle, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so Γ ≈ ħ / tau. Therefore, tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I think the exact formula is tau = ħ / Γ. Because the natural linewidth is Γ = ħ / tau. So yeah, tau = ħ / Γ.

But wait, the units here are important. Gamma is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something. Let me think about the constants. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so when using GeV, the unit conversion is important.

So, let's calculate tau. First, Γ is 320 MeV. Oh wait, we need to convert that to GeV. 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV). Let's compute that.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let's calculate 6.582 / 0.32 first. 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems really small, but lifetimes of particles are indeed tiny, so that's okay.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass m_X = 1.2 GeV. So we can calculate the velocity using the relativistic energy equations.

The total energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, solving for p, the momentum, we get p = sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c. Wait, maybe I should think in natural units where c=1, but let me double-check.

Wait, in natural units (where c=1), the equation simplifies to E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²). So for E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV, p = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, but wait, in natural units, p is in GeV/c. So p ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Now, the velocity beta (β) is given by β = p c / E. Wait, because in terms of units, p is in GeV/c, so p c is GeV. So β = (p c) / E. But since E is in GeV, and p c is GeV, the division gives a unitless value.

Wait, let me think again:

In natural units (c=1, ℏ=1), β = p / E.

So here, p is 7.91 GeV/c, E is 8 GeV. Wait, but when c=1, p is in GeV, because GeV/c * c = GeV. So p=7.91 GeV is in units where c=1.

So β = p / E = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. So beta is approximately 0.98875.

So the velocity v is β c. So v ≈ 0.98875 * c, which is about 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s.

But maybe I don't need to calculate the actual velocity in m/s right away. Let me see. Alternatively, since we're going to calculate gamma, maybe it's better to compute gamma first.

Gamma (γ) is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = E / (m c²). But since we're using units where c=1, it's just E / m. So for E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Wait, but wait, in natural units, c=1, so E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², but when you have E = gamma m c², then gamma = E/(m c²). But if we're working in natural units where c=1, E = gamma m. So yes, gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Now, the mean lifetime tau is the proper lifetime, but the particle is moving, so the observed lifetime is gamma times tau. So the lifetime we use in the decay length calculation is gamma * tau.

Wait no, the decay length L is given by L = gamma * v * tau * c. Wait, wait. Let me get this right.

The mean decay length L is the product of the particle's velocity, the lifetime (as observed in the lab frame), and the speed of light? Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of velocity multiplied by the lifetime. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, but v is a fraction of c, so maybe it's better to write v = beta c.

So L = beta c * gamma tau.

Because tau is the proper lifetime, the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So the distance is velocity (beta c) multiplied by the dilated lifetime (gamma tau).

So putting it all together, L = beta c gamma tau.

So let's compute each part.

First, beta is 0.98875.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = (0.98875) * (3e8 m/s) * (6.6667) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Wait, let me calculate this step by step.

Compute each part:

beta c = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

gamma tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.37125e-23 s.

Multiply these two together: 2.96625e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Let me compute that: 2.96625e8 * 1.37125e-23 = ?

Let me multiply the coefficients: 2.96625 * 1.37125 ≈ approximately 4.065.

Then exponents: 1e8 * 1e-23 = 1e-15.

So 4.065 × 1e-15 meters.

Wait, but I should check the exact calculation.

Wait, 2.96625e8 * 1.37125e-23:

2.96625 * 1.37125 = Let me calculate that.

Well, 3 * 1.37125 is 4.11375. So 2.96625 is a bit less than 3, so 4.11375 minus (0.03375 * 1.37125).

Wait, 0.03375 * 1.37125 ≈ 0.0463.

So 4.11375 - 0.0463 ≈ 4.06745.

So about 4.06745e-15 meters. So approximately 4.067e-15 meters.

Wait, looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

So my calculation gives about 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but let me make sure my calculations are precise enough.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the tau more accurately.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... so 6.6666666667.

Beta is 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

Wait, p is sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c.

So beta = p c / E = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) = 0.98875.

So beta = 0.98875.

So now, L = beta * c * gamma * tau.

Let me compute each part again.

Compute beta * c: 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s = 2.96625e8 m/s.

gamma * tau = 6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 6.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24:

6.6666666667 = 20/3.

20/3 * 2.056875 = (20 * 2.056875) /3.

20 * 2.056875 = 41.1375.

41.1375 /3 = 13.7125.

So gamma tau = 13.7125e-24 s? Wait, wait no, 2.056875e-24 s multiplied by 6.6666666667.

Wait, 2.056875e-24 * 6.6666666667 = approx 13.7125e-24 s? Wait, 2e-24 *6.666 is about 13.333e-24, but let me compute precisely.

2.056875e-24 * (20/3) = ?

Compute 20/3 = 6.6666666667.

2.056875 * 20 = 41.1375.

41.1375 / 3 = 13.7125.

So 13.7125e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s.

Wait, no, 13.7125e-24 is 1.37125e-23 s. Because 1e-24 *13.7125=1.37125e-23.

So now, L = beta c * gamma tau = (2.96625e8 m/s) * (1.37125e-23 s).

Multiply these two:

2.96625e8 * 1.37125e-23 = ?

Compute 2.96625 * 1.37125 = I'll do it more accurately.

Let me compute 2.96625 * 1.37125.

First, 2.96625 * 1 = 2.96625.

2.96625 * 0.3 = 0.889875.

2.96625 * 0.07 = 0.2076375.

2.96625 * 0.001 = 0.00296625.

Wait, adding them all together:

But wait, 1.37125 is 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.001 + 0.00025?

Wait, 1.37125 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.001 + 0.00025?

Wait, 0.3 + 0.07 is 0.37, plus 0.001 is 0.371, plus 0.00025 is 0.37125. So yes.

So 2.96625 * 1.37125 = 2.96625*(1) + 2.96625*(0.3) + 2.96625*(0.07) + 2.96625*(0.001) + 2.96625*(0.00025).

Calculate each term:

- 2.96625 * 1 = 2.96625
- 2.96625 * 0.3 = 0.889875
- 2.96625 * 0.07 = 0.2076375
- 2.96625 * 0.001 = 0.00296625
- 2.96625 * 0.00025 = 0.0007415625

Add them all up:

2.96625 + 0.889875 = 3.856125

3.856125 + 0.2076375 = 4.0637625

4.0637625 + 0.00296625 = 4.06672875

4.06672875 + 0.0007415625 = 4.0674703125

So the product is approximately 4.0674703125.

Then, the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-23 = 1e-15.

So L = 4.06747e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, why is there a slight discrepancy? Maybe I made a miscalculation in more precise steps.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise in the calculation of beta.

Wait, I approximated p as 7.91 GeV/c, but let me compute it more accurately. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so p = sqrt(E² - m²) in GeV/c.

E squared is 64 GeV², m squared is 1.44 GeV², so E² - m² is 62.56 GeV². The square root of 62.56 is approximately 7.91 GeV/c. But let's compute it more accurately.

What's the square root of 62.56?

Well, 7.91^2 is 62.5681 because 7.9^2 is 62.41, and 7.91^2 is 62.5681.

So p = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c, exactly 7.91 GeV/c.

So beta is 7.91 / 8 = 0.98875.

I think the calculation is correct. So the mean decay length is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So I think the correct answer is option B.

To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta c \gamma \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \frac{p}{E} \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate the proper lifetime \( \tau \)
The width \( \Gamma \) is given as \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the relation \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \), where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Using \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The momentum \( p \) is given by \( p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2} \). Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
p = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}/c.
\]

The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is then:

\[
\beta = \frac{p}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta c \gamma \tau.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta c = 0.98875 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.96625 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \gamma \tau = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \),

we calculate:

\[
L = (2.96625 \times 10^8) \times (1.37125 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to the calculated value \( 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
