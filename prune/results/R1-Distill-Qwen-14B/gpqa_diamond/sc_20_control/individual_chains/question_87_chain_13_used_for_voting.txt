Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an organic chemistry problem. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

First, let me break down the information. The compound is a 6-membered aromatic ring, so it's probably a benzene derivative. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents must account for 2 more carbons. But wait, maybe one substituent is a group with more than one carbon. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add up to 2 carbons. So, each substituent could be a single carbon, like -X or -OH, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a group with a carbonyl (C=O) and another substituent is a halogen. Because the IR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Wait, the IR has a carbonyl group (so maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester), and an aromatic-halogen, like a bromine or chlorine attached to the ring.

So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

So, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl, Br), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. So each substituent could be one carbon. For example, one substituent is -Cl (no carbons), but that's only one substituent. Wait, no, wait. Wait, that can't be right because 6 + 0 (for Cl) + 0 (for another substituent like NO2) would be 6, but the question says 8 carbons. So the substituents must add 2 carbons in total.

Ah, so each substituent may have one carbon each, but some substituents have more. Wait, let's think about possible substituents.

If one substituent is a carbonyl, like an acetyl group (-COCH3), that's two carbons (the CO and the CH3). But wait, that would make the substituent have two carbons. Adding that to another substituent, which maybe is a halogen (like Cl) which is one substituent, but that would give substituents with 2 (from COCH3) plus 1 (from Cl) but wait, benzene has 6, so 6 + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8? No, wait, no. Wait, the substituents are attached to the benzene, so the COCH3 adds two carbons (the C and the CH3?), but Cl is just an atom, no carbons. So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) = 8. Wait, that adds up. So the substituents are COCH3 and Cl.

Wait, but that would make the benzene di-substituted. So structure would be benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached.

Wait, but COCH3 is an acetyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone group, like a benzophenone derivative, but that's perhaps more carbons. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen, but both are single-carbon substituents. Wait, but a carbonyl group as a substituent would be something like -CO-, but that's not on the ring. Wait, maybe it's a ketone attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a halogen? No, because benzaldehyde is -CHO, which is a substituent of one carbon. Then another substituent would have to be something else, like maybe -Cl. But that would give 6 + 1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) = 7 carbons, which is less than 8. So that's not right.

Wait, maybe the substituent isn't just a single carbon. Let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons in total, with a benzene ring (6 carbons), and two substituents that add up to 2 carbons. So each substituent could be one carbon each, and perhaps one has two. Alternatively, one substituent is two carbons, and the other is none? No, because the substituents are two.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a ketone group, like O=C-R, but if R is a methyl group, that's two carbons (the O=C and CH3). So substituent would be COCH3.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Benzene ring with two substituents: one is Cl (or Br), and the other is COCH3. So the substituents are COCH3 and Cl.

But wait, that would make the molecule have 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) + 1 (Cl) = 9 carbons? No, wait. No, the Cl is just a substituent, it's not a carbon. So, the COCH3 contributes two carbons (the C from CO and the CH3). So total is 6 + 2 = 8 carbons. Oh, right. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

So the structure is a di-substituted benzene, with substituents Cl and COCH3.

Wait, but what about the positions? Di-substituted can be para, meta, or ortho.

But in any case, the NMR should show peaks corresponding to the aromatic protons, the protons from the COCH3 group, and perhaps any others.

Now, the IR shows a carbonyl (so a C=O stretch around 1700 cm^-1 or so) and an aromatic-halogen bond. The presence of Cl or Br near the aromatic ring which would show up in IR as a C-X stretch. But more importantly, the presence of these groups means that the compound has both.

Now, looking at the options, each NMR has different peaks. Let's go through each option.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So this has a singlet at 9.9, which could be an aldehyde proton (though aldehyde is usually around 9-10, singlet). But in our case, if the substituent is COCH3, wait, that's a ketone, so no aldehyde. So this might not fit. Alternatively, if the substituent is a nitro group or something else.

But wait, the carbonyl is present, so maybe the 9.9 ppm is a carbonyl group, but wait, no, carbonyls are usually C=O, but the protons in the molecule are in the NMR. So 9.9 is a proton, perhaps an aldehyde. But if the substituent is COCH3, then the carbonyl is a ketone, so no aldehyde. So this option might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl with an adjacent CH group, but I'm not sure. But let's keep thinking.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These look like two doublets around 4-5 ppm, perhaps from a group like a CH2 next to an oxygen. Maybe an ester or ether group. The 1.3 s is a singlet for a CH3, perhaps attached to oxygen. So this could be an acetal or something similar. But how does this fit into the aromatic ring with Cl and COCH3?

Alternatively, maybe these are from a substituent like -OCH2CH2O- (but that doesn't fit with COCH3 and Cl). Not sure. This option doesn't show any aromatic protons, which is a problem because the compound is aromatic. So perhaps this is not the right option.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic peaks are at 7.8 and 7.6, each as doublets. That suggests perhaps a para-substituted ring with two substituents. The 2.3 ppm singlet is a methyl group. So, the substituents could be a carbonyl (like COCH3) and another group, perhaps a Cl or Br. Wait, if the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets each integrating for two protons. That makes sense. So the COCH3 is attached, and the other substituent is Cl. Then, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets, each with two H. The 2.3 ppm is the methyl from COCH3. So this option seems to fit: aromatic ring with Cl and COCH3 in para positions. So that would give the NMR as in option C.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 s could be an aromatic proton, but if it's a di-substituted benzene, perhaps in the meta position, maybe. The 4.8 and 4.6 doublets suggest perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. The 1.3 singlet could be a methyl group. Wait, but how does this fit with the substituents?

Wait, but the compound must have a carbonyl group. So, if there's an ester group, for example, which has a carbonyl. Alternatively, a ketone. Let me think: perhaps the substituent is OCH2CH2OAc (but that's getting complicated). Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acetal group. Hmm, not sure. But the presence of a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which is lower than the aromatic region in option C, but benzene protons are usually higher (like 7 ppm unless there's strong deshielding). Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent that deshields the aromatic protons less, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures again. The molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents: a carbonyl group (like COCH3) and a halogen (Cl or Br). So the ring has substituents Cl and COCH3.

If the substituents are in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be as two doublets, each integrating for two protons. The COCH3 would give a singlet at around δ2.3 (as in option C), which is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.

So the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, each for two H. So that fits option C: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). And the 2.3 (3H, s) is the methyl group.

So why are the aromatic protons split into two doublets? Because if the substituents are para, then the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Each substituent is opposite each other, so the protons on the ring would be in two equivalent pairs.

For instance, let's imagine the structure where Cl is in position 1 and COCH3 is in position 3 (but wait, that's meta, not para). Wait, para would be positions 1 and 4. So if substituents are at 1 and 4, then the ring has protons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. But in such a case, positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So each pair would be a doublet due to coupling with their adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.

So option C seems to fit this scenario.

What about other options? Let me check option A again. The 9.9 ppm singlet could be an aldehyde proton. But in that case, the substituent would be CHO, which is a carbonyl group (so that fits the IR). The other substituent would have to be a halogen. So the structure would be benzaldehyde with a halogen substituent, which would make the total carbons 6 + 1 (CHO) + 0 (halogen) = 7 carbons. But the question says 8. So that can't be. So option A's structure would have 7 carbons, which doesn't fit. Hence, option A is incorrect.

Option B doesn't show any aromatic protons, which can't be right because the compound is an aromatic ring. So B is out.

Option D has a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which is a bit lower than typical aromatic protons. But then there are other peaks that seem like they could be from an acetal or some oxygen-containing group. But the carbonyl would come from a substituent like COCH3, as in option C.

So, putting it all together, the correct NMR is in option C: two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group, such as a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). The total carbon count aligns with this structure: 6 carbons from the benzene ring, 2 carbons from the -COCH₃ group, and no additional carbons from the halogen.

The NMR data must reflect this structure. The aromatic protons will appear as two doublets due to the para-substitution pattern, where the protons on the ring are split into two equivalent pairs. The methyl group attached to the carbonyl will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which could correspond to an aldehyde proton. However, the structure does not include an aldehyde, and the total carbon count would not match (7 carbons instead of 8). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lacks aromatic protons, which is inconsistent with the compound being an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Shows two doublets for aromatic protons (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for the methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent. This matches the expected structure with para-substitution of a halogen and a carbonyl group. This option is correct.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which is inconsistent with the expected aromatic proton pattern. Additionally, the other peaks suggest the presence of an oxygen-containing group, which is not indicated in the problem. This option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, which matches the structure of a para-substituted benzene with a halogen and a -COCH₃ group.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an organic chemistry problem. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

First, let me break down the information. The compound is a 6-membered aromatic ring, so it's probably a benzene derivative. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents must account for 2 more carbons. But wait, maybe one substituent is a group with more than one carbon. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add up to 2 carbons. So, each substituent could be a single carbon, like -X or -OH, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a group with a carbonyl (C=O) and another substituent is a halogen. Because the IR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Wait, the IR has a carbonyl group (so maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester), and an aromatic-halogen, like a bromine or chlorine attached to the ring.

So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

So, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl, Br), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. So each substituent could be one carbon. For example, one substituent is -Cl (no carbons), but that's only one substituent. Wait, no, wait. Wait, that can't be right because 6 + 0 (for Cl) + 0 (for another substituent like NO2) would be 6, but the question says 8 carbons. So the substituents must add 2 carbons in total.

Ah, so each substituent may have one carbon each, but some substituents have more. Wait, let's think about possible substituents.

If one substituent is a carbonyl, like an acetyl group (-COCH3), that's two carbons (the CO and the CH3). But wait, that would make the substituent have two carbons. Adding that to another substituent, which maybe is a halogen (like Cl) which is one substituent, but that would give substituents with 2 (from COCH3) plus 1 (from Cl) but wait, benzene has 6, so 6 + 2 (COCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8? No, wait, no. Wait, the substituents are attached to the benzene, so the COCH3 adds two carbons (the C and the CH3?), but Cl is just an atom, no carbons. So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) = 8. Wait, that adds up. So the substituents are COCH3 and Cl.

Wait, but that would make the benzene di-substituted. So structure would be benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached.

Wait, but COCH3 is an acetyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone group, like a benzophenone derivative, but that's perhaps more carbons. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen, but both are single-carbon substituents. Wait, but a carbonyl group as a substituent would be something like -CO-, but that's not on the ring. Wait, maybe it's a ketone attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a halogen? No, because benzaldehyde is -CHO, which is a substituent of one carbon. Then another substituent would have to be something else, like maybe -Cl. But that would give 6 + 1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) = 7 carbons, which is less than 8. So that's not right.

Wait, maybe the substituent isn't just a single carbon. Let me think again. The molecule has 8 carbons in total, with a benzene ring (6 carbons), and two substituents that add up to 2 carbons. So each substituent could be one carbon each, and perhaps one has two. Alternatively, one substituent is two carbons, and the other is none? No, because the substituents are two.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a ketone group, like O=C-R, but if R is a methyl group, that's two carbons (the O=C and CH3). So substituent would be COCH3.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Benzene ring with two substituents: one is Cl (or Br), and the other is COCH3. So the substituents are COCH3 and Cl.

But wait, that would make the molecule have 6 (benzene) + 2 (COCH3) + 1 (Cl) = 9 carbons? No, wait. No, the Cl is just a substituent, it's not a carbon. So, the COCH3 contributes two carbons (the C from CO and the CH3). So total is 6 + 2 = 8 carbons. Oh, right. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

So the structure is a di-substituted benzene, with substituents Cl and COCH3.

Wait, but what about the positions? Di-substituted can be para, meta, or ortho.

But in any case, the NMR should show peaks corresponding to the aromatic protons, the protons from the COCH3 group, and perhaps any others.

Now, the IR shows a carbonyl (so a C=O stretch around 1700 cm^-1 or so) and an aromatic-halogen bond. The presence of Cl or Br near the aromatic ring which would show up in IR as a C-X stretch. But more importantly, the presence of these groups means that the compound has both.

Now, looking at the options, each NMR has different peaks. Let's go through each option.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So this has a singlet at 9.9, which could be an aldehyde proton (though aldehyde is usually around 9-10, singlet). But in our case, if the substituent is COCH3, wait, that's a ketone, so no aldehyde. So this might not fit. Alternatively, if the substituent is a nitro group or something else.

But wait, the carbonyl is present, so maybe the 9.9 ppm is a carbonyl group, but wait, no, carbonyls are usually C=O, but the protons in the molecule are in the NMR. So 9.9 is a proton, perhaps an aldehyde. But if the substituent is COCH3, then the carbonyl is a ketone, so no aldehyde. So this option might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl with an adjacent CH group, but I'm not sure. But let's keep thinking.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These look like two doublets around 4-5 ppm, perhaps from a group like a CH2 next to an oxygen. Maybe an ester or ether group. The 1.3 s is a singlet for a CH3, perhaps attached to oxygen. So this could be an acetal or something similar. But how does this fit into the aromatic ring with Cl and COCH3?

Alternatively, maybe these are from a substituent like -OCH2CH2O- (but that doesn't fit with COCH3 and Cl). Not sure. This option doesn't show any aromatic protons, which is a problem because the compound is aromatic. So perhaps this is not the right option.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic peaks are at 7.8 and 7.6, each as doublets. That suggests perhaps a para-substituted ring with two substituents. The 2.3 ppm singlet is a methyl group. So, the substituents could be a carbonyl (like COCH3) and another group, perhaps a Cl or Br. Wait, if the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets each integrating for two protons. That makes sense. So the COCH3 is attached, and the other substituent is Cl. Then, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets, each with two H. The 2.3 ppm is the methyl from COCH3. So this option seems to fit: aromatic ring with Cl and COCH3 in para positions. So that would give the NMR as in option C.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 s could be an aromatic proton, but if it's a di-substituted benzene, perhaps in the meta position, maybe. The 4.8 and 4.6 doublets suggest perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. The 1.3 singlet could be a methyl group. Wait, but how does this fit with the substituents?

Wait, but the compound must have a carbonyl group. So, if there's an ester group, for example, which has a carbonyl. Alternatively, a ketone. Let me think: perhaps the substituent is OCH2CH2OAc (but that's getting complicated). Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acetal group. Hmm, not sure. But the presence of a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which is lower than the aromatic region in option C, but benzene protons are usually higher (like 7 ppm unless there's strong deshielding). Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent that deshields the aromatic protons less, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures again. The molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents: a carbonyl group (like COCH3) and a halogen (Cl or Br). So the ring has substituents Cl and COCH3.

If the substituents are in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be as two doublets, each integrating for two protons. The COCH3 would give a singlet at around δ2.3 (as in option C), which is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.

So the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, each for two H. So that fits option C: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). And the 2.3 (3H, s) is the methyl group.

So why are the aromatic protons split into two doublets? Because if the substituents are para, then the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Each substituent is opposite each other, so the protons on the ring would be in two equivalent pairs.

For instance, let's imagine the structure where Cl is in position 1 and COCH3 is in position 3 (but wait, that's meta, not para). Wait, para would be positions 1 and 4. So if substituents are at 1 and 4, then the ring has protons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6. But in such a case, positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So each pair would be a doublet due to coupling with their adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons.

So option C seems to fit this scenario.

What about other options? Let me check option A again. The 9.9 ppm singlet could be an aldehyde proton. But in that case, the substituent would be CHO, which is a carbonyl group (so that fits the IR). The other substituent would have to be a halogen. So the structure would be benzaldehyde with a halogen substituent, which would make the total carbons 6 + 1 (CHO) + 0 (halogen) = 7 carbons. But the question says 8. So that can't be. So option A's structure would have 7 carbons, which doesn't fit. Hence, option A is incorrect.

Option B doesn't show any aromatic protons, which can't be right because the compound is an aromatic ring. So B is out.

Option D has a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which is a bit lower than typical aromatic protons. But then there are other peaks that seem like they could be from an acetal or some oxygen-containing group. But the carbonyl would come from a substituent like COCH3, as in option C.

So, putting it all together, the correct NMR is in option C: two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br), and the other is a carbonyl-containing group, such as a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). The total carbon count aligns with this structure: 6 carbons from the benzene ring, 2 carbons from the -COCH₃ group, and no additional carbons from the halogen.

The NMR data must reflect this structure. The aromatic protons will appear as two doublets due to the para-substitution pattern, where the protons on the ring are split into two equivalent pairs. The methyl group attached to the carbonyl will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which could correspond to an aldehyde proton. However, the structure does not include an aldehyde, and the total carbon count would not match (7 carbons instead of 8). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lacks aromatic protons, which is inconsistent with the compound being an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Shows two doublets for aromatic protons (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for the methyl group of the -COCH₃ substituent. This matches the expected structure with para-substitution of a halogen and a carbonyl group. This option is correct.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which is inconsistent with the expected aromatic proton pattern. Additionally, the other peaks suggest the presence of an oxygen-containing group, which is not indicated in the problem. This option is incorrect.

The correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, which matches the structure of a para-substituted benzene with a halogen and a -COCH₃ group.

Answer: C
