Okay, so I have this physics problem here. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. 

Wait, wait, neutrinos are tricky because they're neutral and have very little mass. I think in these kinds of problems, we often assume the neutrino's rest mass is negligible compared to the others. So for calculations, maybe I can treat it as massless. Or maybe the problem expects me to use zero for its rest mass. I should keep that in mind.

The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So both the mu(+) and the neutrino would have some kinetic energy. But wait, the pion is at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. 

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's total energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy will be just its kinetic energy, since its rest mass is negligible.

So, the energy equation would be: 
m_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + KE_mu) + KE_nu

But momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, then the neutrino's momentum is -p. The magnitude is the same, so the magnitudes are equal. 

I remember that for a particle, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. For the muon, its total energy is sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is just pc, since its mass is negligible.

So, setting up the equations:

Equation 1: m_pi c² = [sqrt( p² c^4 + (m_mu c²)^2 )] + (p c)
Equation 2: (muon's momentum) = p, (neutrino's momentum) = p' = -p (so magnitudes are equal)

Wait, but how do I solve for p? Maybe I can square both sides of the energy equation to eliminate the square root. Let me try that.

Let me denote E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) = m_mu c^2 * sqrt(1 + (p² c²)/(m_mu² c^4)) ) = m_mu c^2 * sqrt(1 + (p/(m_mu c))² )

So the energy equation is:
m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu
= m_mu c² * sqrt(1 + (p/(m_mu c))² ) + p c

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can make an approximation. Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, perhaps its energy is much smaller compared to the muon's rest energy? Wait, but wait. Let me calculate the possible KE of muon and neutrino.

Wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, muon is 105.7 MeV. So the mass of the pion is just a bit larger than the muon. When the pion decays, it's likely that the muon will have some kinetic energy, and the neutrino will carry away the rest. But I'm not sure about the exact values.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The total energy after decay is the sum of the muon's rest energy plus its kinetic energy, plus the neutrino's kinetic energy. The pion's energy is just its rest energy.

So, considering that, the energy conservation equation is:

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + KE_mu) + KE_nu

But I also have to consider momentum conservation. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but opposite in direction.

Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but direction is opposite.

Wait, but the neutrino's momentum is p, but since it's direction is opposite, but magnitude is same. So for the momentum vectors, they cancel each other. 

So, the muon's energy is sqrt( p² c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is sqrt( p² c^4 + (m_nu c^2)^2 ). But since m_nu is negligible, the neutrino's energy is approximately p c. 

So, substituting that into the energy equation:

m_pi c² = [sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 )] + p c.

Hmm, this equation only has one variable, p. So I can try to solve for p.

Let me let x = p c. Then the equation becomes:

m_pi c² = sqrt( x^2 + m_mu² c^4 ) + x

Let me subtract x from both sides:

m_pi c² - x = sqrt( x² + m_mu² c^4 )

Now, square both sides:

( m_pi c² - x )^2 = x^2 + m_mu^2 c^4

Expanding the left side:

m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x + x² = x^2 + m_mu² c^4

Simplify by subtracting x^2 from both sides:

m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x = m_mu² c^4

Rearrange:

m_pi^2 c^4 - m_mu^2 c^4 = 2 m_pi c^2 x

Factor left side:

( m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c^4 = 2 m_pi c^2 x

Divide both sides by 2 m_pi c^2:

x = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c^4 ] / ( 2 m_pi c^2 )

Simplify:

x = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c^2 ] / ( 2 m_pi )

But x is p c, so p c = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c^2 ] / ( 2 m_pi )

Divide both sides by c:

p = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c ] / ( 2 m_pi )

Hmm, but I need to compute this. Let me plug in the numbers.

m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c², m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c².

So m_pi^2 = (139.6)^2 ≈ 19,488.16 (MeV/c²)^2

m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2 ≈ 11,172.49 (MeV/c²)^2

So m_pi² - m_mu² = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49 ≈ 8,315.67 (MeV/c²)^2

Multiply by c^2: 8,315.67 (MeV/c²)^2 * c^2 = 8,315.67 MeV²

Divide by (2 m_pi): 2 * 139.6 MeV/c² = 279.2 MeV/c².

So x = [8,315.67 MeV² ] / [279.2 MeV/c² ] 

Wait, wait, let me double-check the units. 

Wait, let me think about the units more carefully. Because x was defined as p c, which has units of MeV/c * c = MeV. So x is in MeV.

Wait, when we computed x earlier:

x = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c^2 ] / ( 2 m_pi )

Wait, m_pi is in MeV/c², so (m_pi^2) is (MeV²/c^4). Multiply by c^2 gives MeV²/c^2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recompute the units.

Wait, the equation for x is:

x = [ (m_pi^2 c^4 - m_mu^2 c^4 ) ] / (2 m_pi c^2 )

Wait, no, the numerator in x is (m_pi² - m_mu²) c^4, and denominator is 2 m_pi c^2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me go back to the equation when I solved for x.

Wait, after rearranging:

( m_pi² c^4 - m_mu² c^4 ) = 2 m_pi c² x 

So, x = [ ( m_pi² c^4 - m_mu² c^4 ) ] / ( 2 m_pi c² )

Factor c^4 in numerator:

x = ( c^4 ( m_pi² - m_mu² ) ) / ( 2 m_pi c² )

Simplify c^4 / c^2 = c². So:

x = ( c² ( m_pi² - m_mu² ) ) / ( 2 m_pi )

Wait, but m_pi is in MeV/c². So:

m_pi² is (MeV^2/c^4 )

Multiply by c²: (MeV^2/c^4 ) * c^2 = MeV²/c².

Wait, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe it's easier to compute numerically with the given masses.

Let me compute m_pi^2 - m_mu^2:

139.6^2 = 139.6 *139.6.

Let me compute that:

139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16

Similarly, 105.7^2 = 105.7 *105.7. Let me compute that.

105^2 = 11025. 0.7^2=0.49. 2 * 105 * 0.7 = 147.

So (105 +0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2 = 11025 +147 +0.49 = 11172.49.

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2.

So x = (8315.67) (MeV/c²)^2 * c^4 / (2 * 139.6 MeV/c² * c^2 )

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting the units right. Let me make sure.

Wait, x is in units of energy (MeV), as it's p c (momentum times c).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the numerical value. Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) = 8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2.

Multiply by c^4: 8315.67 * c^4 (MeV²/c^4) )? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should treat all the terms as MeV for simplicity, since c is set to 1 in these units. Wait, in particle physics, when we talk about mass in MeV/c², and energies in MeV, momentum p is in MeV/c. So when we have p c, it's (MeV/c) * c = MeV. So x has units of MeV.

So m_pi is 139.6 MeV/c², m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c².

So m_pi^2 is (139.6)^2 = about 19488.16 (MeV/c²)^2.

Similarly, m_mu^2 is 11172.49 (MeV/c²)^2.

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 is 8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2.

Thus, x = (8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2) * (c^4) ) / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV/c² * c^2 )

Wait, but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out c².

Wait, perhaps I should use natural units where c=1, so m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. Then x = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi )

So x = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)

Compute that:

(19488.16 - 11172.49) = 8315.67

Divide by (2 * 139.6) = 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me estimate.

279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 30 would be a bit higher than 8315.67.

So 279.2 * 29.8 ≈ 279.2 * 30 = 8376 minus 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84.

8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16. Close to 8315.67.

So 29.8 would give 8320.16, which is a bit more than 8315.67. Let me find a better approximation.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2 * (30 -0.2) = 8376 - (279.2 *0.2) = 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

The target is 8315.67, which is 8320.16 - 4.49. So each 0.1 decrease in 29.8 gives 279.2 *0.1=27.92.

So 29.8 - (4.49/27.92) ≈ 29.8 - 0.1607 ≈ 29.639.

So x ≈ 29.64 MeV. Wait, does this make sense?

Wait, but this x is p c. So p = x / c, but in natural units, p c is in MeV, so p would be x (MeV/c).

But let me think about the energy. The neutrino's energy is p c, which is x, so 29.64 MeV.

The muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 )

x is 29.64, so x^2 is about 878.6. Adding 105.7^2 = 11172.49 gives 11172.49 + 878.6 ≈ 12051.09.

sqrt(12051.09) ≈ 109.78 MeV.

So the muon's energy is about 109.78 MeV, which includes its rest mass (105.7 MeV) and KE of about 4.08 MeV.

Wait, because 109.78 - 105.7 = 4.08 MeV.

But the neutrino's energy is 29.64 MeV, so its KE is 29.64 MeV.

But wait, the problem asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So the muon's KE is about 4.08 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.64 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. Hmm, that's close to our estimate.

But wait, our calculation gave 4.08 for muon, 29.64 for neutrino. So option D is 4.12 and 29.8. Very close.

But wait, perhaps I should do a more precise calculation. Let me recalculate x.

x = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2)/(2*139.6)

Compute numerator: 139.6^2 = 139.6*139.6.

Let me compute 139.6 * 139.6:

139.6 * 100 = 13960

139.6 * 30 = 4188.

139.6 * 9 = 1256.4

139.6 * 0.6 = 83.76

Wait, wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 139.6 *139.6:

= (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 =19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: let's compute 105 *105 =11025.

105 *0.7 =73.5, 0.7*105 =73.5, 0.7*0.7=0.49.

So 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 =105^2 + 2*(105)(0.7) +0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 +0.49 =11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49 =8315.67.

Denominator is 2*139.6=279.2.

So x =8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 =8376-279.2=8096.8? Wait, no, 279.2 *29=?

Wait, 279.2 * 20=5584, 279.2*9=2512.8. So total 5584 + 2512.8=8096.8.

But 279.2 *29.6 =279.2*(29 +0.6)=8096.8 + (279.2 *0.6)= 8096.8 +167.52=8264.32.

8264.32 is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67-8264.32=51.35.

So how much more than 29.6? Let's compute 51.35 /279.2 ≈0.184.

So x≈29.6 +0.184=29.784. So x≈29.78 MeV.

So neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV.

Then, the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + 105.7^2 )

Compute (29.78)^2 = approx 886.8.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

Sum is 886.8 +11172.49=12059.29.

sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So muon's KE is 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

So KE for muon is approximately 4.11 MeV, neutrino 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's very close. So the correct answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \text{ (at rest)} \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

### Energy Conservation
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]

The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 c^4 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4},
\]
where \( p \) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. The neutrino's energy is approximately equal to its momentum times \( c \), \( E_{\nu} = p c \).

### Momentum Conservation
Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay must be zero. Thus, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu} = p.
\]

### Solving for Momentum \( p \)
From energy conservation:
\[
m_{\pi^+} c^2 = \sqrt{p^2 c^4 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4} + p c.
\]

Let \( x = p c \). Substituting:
\[
m_{\pi^+} c^2 = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4} + x.
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
(m_{\pi^+} c^2 - x)^2 = x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 c^4 - 2 m_{\pi^+} c^2 x = m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4.
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 c^4 - m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4}{2 m_{\pi^+} c^2}.
\]

### Numerical Calculation
Substitute \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4.
\]

\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4.
\]

\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the neutrino's kinetic energy is \( E_{\nu} = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Muon's Kinetic Energy
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this physics problem here. It's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think. The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV.

The question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So both the mu(+) and the neutrino would have some kinetic energy. But wait, the pion is at rest, so the total momentum before decay is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. 

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's total energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy will be just its kinetic energy, since its rest mass is negligible.

So, the energy equation would be: 
m_pi c^2 = (m_mu c^2 + KE_mu) + KE_nu

But momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, then the neutrino's momentum is -p. The magnitude is the same, so the magnitudes are equal. 

I remember that for a particle, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. For the muon, its total energy is sqrt( p^2 c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is just pc, since its mass is negligible.

So, setting up the equations:

Equation 1: m_pi c² = [sqrt( p² c^4 + (m_mu c²)^2 )] + (p c)
Equation 2: (muon's momentum) = p, (neutrino's momentum) = p' = -p (so magnitudes are equal)

Wait, but how do I solve for p? Maybe I can square both sides of the energy equation to eliminate the square root. Let me try that.

Let me denote E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) = m_mu c^2 * sqrt(1 + (p² c²)/(m_mu² c^4)) ) = m_mu c^2 * sqrt(1 + (p/(m_mu c))² )

So the energy equation is:
m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu
= m_mu c² * sqrt(1 + (p/(m_mu c))² ) + p c

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can make an approximation. Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, perhaps its energy is much smaller compared to the muon's rest energy? Wait, but wait. Let me calculate the possible KE of muon and neutrino.

Wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, muon is 105.7 MeV. So the mass of the pion is just a bit larger than the muon. When the pion decays, it's likely that the muon will have some kinetic energy, and the neutrino will carry away the rest. But I'm not sure about the exact values.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The total energy after decay is the sum of the muon's rest energy plus its kinetic energy, plus the neutrino's kinetic energy. The pion's energy is just its rest energy.

So, considering that, the energy conservation equation is:

m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + KE_mu) + KE_nu

But I also have to consider momentum conservation. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So their magnitudes of momentum are the same, but opposite in direction.

Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but direction is opposite.

Wait, but the neutrino's momentum is p, but since it's direction is opposite, but magnitude is same. So for the momentum vectors, they cancel each other. 

So, the muon's energy is sqrt( p² c^4 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is sqrt( p² c^4 + (m_nu c^2)^2 ). But since m_nu is negligible, the neutrino's energy is approximately p c. 

So, substituting that into the energy equation:

m_pi c² = [sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 )] + p c.

Hmm, this equation only has one variable, p. So I can try to solve for p.

Let me let x = p c. Then the equation becomes:

m_pi c² = sqrt( x^2 + m_mu² c^4 ) + x

Let me subtract x from both sides:

m_pi c² - x = sqrt( x² + m_mu² c^4 )

Now, square both sides:

( m_pi c² - x )^2 = x^2 + m_mu^2 c^4

Expanding the left side:

m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x + x² = x^2 + m_mu² c^4

Simplify by subtracting x^2 from both sides:

m_pi² c^4 - 2 m_pi c² x = m_mu² c^4

Rearrange:

m_pi^2 c^4 - m_mu^2 c^4 = 2 m_pi c^2 x

Factor left side:

( m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c^4 = 2 m_pi c^2 x

Divide both sides by 2 m_pi c^2:

x = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c^4 ] / ( 2 m_pi c^2 )

Simplify:

x = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c^2 ] / ( 2 m_pi )

But x is p c, so p c = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c^2 ] / ( 2 m_pi )

Divide both sides by c:

p = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c ] / ( 2 m_pi )

Hmm, but I need to compute this. Let me plug in the numbers.

m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c², m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c².

So m_pi^2 = (139.6)^2 ≈ 19,488.16 (MeV/c²)^2

m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2 ≈ 11,172.49 (MeV/c²)^2

So m_pi² - m_mu² = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49 ≈ 8,315.67 (MeV/c²)^2

Multiply by c^2: 8,315.67 (MeV/c²)^2 * c^2 = 8,315.67 MeV²

Divide by (2 m_pi): 2 * 139.6 MeV/c² = 279.2 MeV/c².

So x = [8,315.67 MeV² ] / [279.2 MeV/c² ] 

Wait, wait, let me double-check the units. 

Wait, let me think about the units more carefully. Because x was defined as p c, which has units of MeV/c * c = MeV. So x is in MeV.

Wait, when we computed x earlier:

x = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 ) c^2 ] / ( 2 m_pi )

Wait, m_pi is in MeV/c², so (m_pi^2) is (MeV²/c^4). Multiply by c^2 gives MeV²/c^2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me recompute the units.

Wait, the equation for x is:

x = [ (m_pi^2 c^4 - m_mu^2 c^4 ) ] / (2 m_pi c^2 )

Wait, no, the numerator in x is (m_pi² - m_mu²) c^4, and denominator is 2 m_pi c^2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me go back to the equation when I solved for x.

Wait, after rearranging:

( m_pi² c^4 - m_mu² c^4 ) = 2 m_pi c² x 

So, x = [ ( m_pi² c^4 - m_mu² c^4 ) ] / ( 2 m_pi c² )

Factor c^4 in numerator:

x = ( c^4 ( m_pi² - m_mu² ) ) / ( 2 m_pi c² )

Simplify c^4 / c^2 = c². So:

x = ( c² ( m_pi² - m_mu² ) ) / ( 2 m_pi )

Wait, but m_pi is in MeV/c². So:

m_pi² is (MeV^2/c^4 )

Multiply by c²: (MeV^2/c^4 ) * c^2 = MeV²/c².

Wait, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe it's easier to compute numerically with the given masses.

Let me compute m_pi^2 - m_mu^2:

139.6^2 = 139.6 *139.6.

Let me compute that:

139.6 * 139.6 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16

Similarly, 105.7^2 = 105.7 *105.7. Let me compute that.

105^2 = 11025. 0.7^2=0.49. 2 * 105 * 0.7 = 147.

So (105 +0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 +0.7^2 = 11025 +147 +0.49 = 11172.49.

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 is 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2.

So x = (8315.67) (MeV/c²)^2 * c^4 / (2 * 139.6 MeV/c² * c^2 )

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting the units right. Let me make sure.

Wait, x is in units of energy (MeV), as it's p c (momentum times c).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the numerical value. Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) = 8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2.

Multiply by c^4: 8315.67 * c^4 (MeV²/c^4) )? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should treat all the terms as MeV for simplicity, since c is set to 1 in these units. Wait, in particle physics, when we talk about mass in MeV/c², and energies in MeV, momentum p is in MeV/c. So when we have p c, it's (MeV/c) * c = MeV. So x has units of MeV.

So m_pi is 139.6 MeV/c², m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c².

So m_pi^2 is (139.6)^2 = about 19488.16 (MeV/c²)^2.

Similarly, m_mu^2 is 11172.49 (MeV/c²)^2.

So m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 is 8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2.

Thus, x = (8315.67 (MeV/c²)^2) * (c^4) ) / ( 2 * 139.6 MeV/c² * c^2 )

Wait, but that's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out c².

Wait, perhaps I should use natural units where c=1, so m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV. Then x = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi )

So x = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2) / (2 * 139.6)

Compute that:

(19488.16 - 11172.49) = 8315.67

Divide by (2 * 139.6) = 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me estimate.

279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 30 would be a bit higher than 8315.67.

So 279.2 * 29.8 ≈ 279.2 * 30 = 8376 minus 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84.

8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16. Close to 8315.67.

So 29.8 would give 8320.16, which is a bit more than 8315.67. Let me find a better approximation.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2 * (30 -0.2) = 8376 - (279.2 *0.2) = 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

The target is 8315.67, which is 8320.16 - 4.49. So each 0.1 decrease in 29.8 gives 279.2 *0.1=27.92.

So 29.8 - (4.49/27.92) ≈ 29.8 - 0.1607 ≈ 29.639.

So x ≈ 29.64 MeV. Wait, does this make sense?

Wait, but this x is p c. So p = x / c, but in natural units, p c is in MeV, so p would be x (MeV/c).

But let me think about the energy. The neutrino's energy is p c, which is x, so 29.64 MeV.

The muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) = sqrt( x^2 + (105.7)^2 )

x is 29.64, so x^2 is about 878.6. Adding 105.7^2 = 11172.49 gives 11172.49 + 878.6 ≈ 12051.09.

sqrt(12051.09) ≈ 109.78 MeV.

So the muon's energy is about 109.78 MeV, which includes its rest mass (105.7 MeV) and KE of about 4.08 MeV.

Wait, because 109.78 - 105.7 = 4.08 MeV.

But the neutrino's energy is 29.64 MeV, so its KE is 29.64 MeV.

But wait, the problem asks for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So the muon's KE is about 4.08 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.64 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. Hmm, that's close to our estimate.

But wait, our calculation gave 4.08 for muon, 29.64 for neutrino. So option D is 4.12 and 29.8. Very close.

But wait, perhaps I should do a more precise calculation. Let me recalculate x.

x = (139.6^2 - 105.7^2)/(2*139.6)

Compute numerator: 139.6^2 = 139.6*139.6.

Let me compute 139.6 * 139.6:

139.6 * 100 = 13960

139.6 * 30 = 4188.

139.6 * 9 = 1256.4

139.6 * 0.6 = 83.76

Wait, wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 139.6 *139.6:

= (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 =19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: let's compute 105 *105 =11025.

105 *0.7 =73.5, 0.7*105 =73.5, 0.7*0.7=0.49.

So 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 =105^2 + 2*(105)(0.7) +0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 +0.49 =11172.49.

So numerator is 19488.16 -11172.49 =8315.67.

Denominator is 2*139.6=279.2.

So x =8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 =8376-279.2=8096.8? Wait, no, 279.2 *29=?

Wait, 279.2 * 20=5584, 279.2*9=2512.8. So total 5584 + 2512.8=8096.8.

But 279.2 *29.6 =279.2*(29 +0.6)=8096.8 + (279.2 *0.6)= 8096.8 +167.52=8264.32.

8264.32 is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67-8264.32=51.35.

So how much more than 29.6? Let's compute 51.35 /279.2 ≈0.184.

So x≈29.6 +0.184=29.784. So x≈29.78 MeV.

So neutrino's KE is approximately 29.78 MeV.

Then, the muon's energy is sqrt( (29.78)^2 + 105.7^2 )

Compute (29.78)^2 = approx 886.8.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

Sum is 886.8 +11172.49=12059.29.

sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So muon's KE is 109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

So KE for muon is approximately 4.11 MeV, neutrino 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

That's very close. So the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \text{ (at rest)} \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use energy and momentum conservation principles. The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). The neutrino's rest mass is negligible.

### Energy Conservation
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's kinetic energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]

The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 c^4 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4},
\]
where \( p \) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. The neutrino's energy is approximately equal to its momentum times \( c \), \( E_{\nu} = p c \).

### Momentum Conservation
Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum after the decay must be zero. Thus, the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu} = p.
\]

### Solving for Momentum \( p \)
From energy conservation:
\[
m_{\pi^+} c^2 = \sqrt{p^2 c^4 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4} + p c.
\]

Let \( x = p c \). Substituting:
\[
m_{\pi^+} c^2 = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4} + x.
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
(m_{\pi^+} c^2 - x)^2 = x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 c^4 - 2 m_{\pi^+} c^2 x = m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4.
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 c^4 - m_{\mu^+}^2 c^4}{2 m_{\pi^+} c^2}.
\]

### Numerical Calculation
Substitute \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):
\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4, \quad m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4.
\]

\[
m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2/c^4.
\]

\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the neutrino's kinetic energy is \( E_{\nu} = x = 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Muon's Kinetic Energy
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**
