Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about wave functions and particles in a tube. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. Alright, let's break this down.

So the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, I remember that the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. Like, the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. That's the normalization condition, right? So the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But wait, the problem says that when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that means the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Oh, but in the given wave function, it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that would imply that the wave function is the same everywhere, but according to the measurement, it's non-zero only between 1 and 3. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function given is only valid in the region where the particle exists. So in the region x=1 to x=3, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And outside, it's zero? But then the wave function as given doesn't include that. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as the wave function is only non-zero between 1 and 3. So the integral should be from 1 to 3.

Wait, but the wave function is a complex number here. So the probability density is the square of the absolute value. The absolute value squared of (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ], right? Because the square of a complex number a+bi is (a^2 + b^2), but wait, no, that's the magnitude squared. So the probability density is |ψ|^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think again. The wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. So the absolute value squared is [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because the terms are real and imaginary. So |ψ|^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, when you square a complex number, you have to do (a + bi)(a - bi), which is a² + b². So, in this case, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ|² = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Now, the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ|² dx = 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute that. So the integral can be split into two parts:

Integral of (a²/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral is a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 is about 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7213). Let's calculate that. sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485. Hmm, so approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which would make sense.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. So:

Integral (a²/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 is a²*(ln(4) - ln(2)) = a²*(ln2) because ln(4)=2 ln2, so 2 ln2 - ln2 = ln2. So that part is correct.

Then the 0.25 over 2 units (from 1 to 3) gives 0.5. So total integral is a² * ln2 + 0.5 =1.

So a² = (0.5)/(ln2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721. a is sqrt(0.721)=approx 0.849, so 0.85 is the correct option, which is option B.

To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle is 1. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The particle is confined between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), so the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Now, the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ|² dx = 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute that. So the integral can be split into two parts:

Integral of (a²/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral is a² times the integral of 1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's the value of ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.693 is about 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213, so a ≈ sqrt(0.7213). Let's calculate that. sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485. Hmm, so approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which would make sense.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. So:

Integral (a²/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 is a²*(ln(4) - ln(2)) = a²*(ln2) because ln(4)=2 ln2, so 2 ln2 - ln2 = ln2. So that part is correct.

Then the 0.25 over 2 units (from 1 to 3) gives 0.5. So total integral is a² * ln2 + 0.5 =1.

So a² = (0.5)/(ln2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721. a is sqrt(0.721)=approx 0.849, so 0.85 is the correct option, which is option B.
