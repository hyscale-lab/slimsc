--- Reasoning Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀ through δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13°, respectively. They also mention that the electrons have 50 MeV of energy and to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. The general formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2iδ_l * (something with spherical harmonics?), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, right, the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts. Oh yes, it's f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ) ), where the sum is over all angular momentum states l, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials.

But wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which would be θ=0°, right? Because the incident beam is along the initial direction, so the scattering angle θ is zero.

At θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So the formula simplifies when θ=0.

So at θ=0°, f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * 1.

But wait, the sum is from l=0 to l= some maximum. In this problem, the given phase shifts are up to δ₄, so l goes up to 4. So the sum is from l=0 to l=4.

Each term is (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) for l=0 to 4.

Hmm, let me compute each term for l=0 to 4.

First, for l=0: δ₀=90°, which is π/2 radians. So 2δ₀= π radians. e^{iπ} is -1. So e^{2iδ₀} = e^{iπ} = -1. Then (e^{2iδ₀} -1) = (-1 -1) = -2.

l=1: δ₁=67°. 2δ₁=134°. Let me convert that to radians if needed, but perhaps it's easier to compute the sine and cosine in terms of degrees. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term's imaginary part.

Wait, but the problem wants the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So perhaps I can compute the imaginary part of each term, sum them, and then multiply by [1/(2ik)].

Wait, another approach: The amplitude f is a complex quantity. The imaginary part of f(0) is what we're after.

Alternatively, the expression for f(θ) can be written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ).

Since at θ=0°, P_l(1)=1 for all l, the expression becomes (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1).

So let's compute each term (e^{2iδ_l} -1) for l=0 to 4.

Let me make a table:

l | δ_l (degrees) | 2δ_l | e^{i 2δ_l} | e^{i2δ_l} -1

0 | 90 | 180 | e^{iπ} = -1 | (-1) -1 = -2
1 | 67 | 134 | e^{i 134°} | complex number
2 |55 |110 | e^{i 110°} | complex
3 |30 |60 | e^{i60} | complex
4 |13 |26 | e^{i26} | complex

Each of these terms is a complex number. We'll need their imaginary parts to sum up.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the imaginary part of each (e^{i x} -1), which is Im[e^{i x}] - Im[1] = sin x - 0 = sin x.

Wait, wait. Because e^{i x} = cos x + i sin x. So e^{i x} -1 = (cos x -1) + i sin x.

So the imaginary part of (e^{i x} -1) is sin x.

Ah! So for each l, the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ_l} -1) is sin(2δ_l).

So the total imaginary part of the sum is the sum of sin(2δ_l) for l=0 to 4.

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is [1/(2k)] times that sum, because (1/(2ik)) times the sum of (e^{2iδ_l} -1) gives (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (cos 2δ_l -1) + i sin 2δ_l ].

The imaginary part of f(0) would be [1/(2k)] * sum [ sin 2δ_l ].

Because when you distribute the (1/(2ik)), the i in the denominator will multiply the imaginary part, but let's think carefully.

Wait, let me compute Im[f(0)].

f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * sum_{l=0}^4 (e^{2iδ_l} -1)

Each term (e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l).

So sum over l:

Sum_r = sum [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) ] 

Sum_i = sum [ sin(2δ_l) ]

So f(0) = [1/(2ik)] ( Sum_r + i Sum_i )

To find the imaginary part of f(0):

Im[f(0)] = [1/(2k)] * Sum_i 

Because (1/(2ik)) * i Sum_i = (1/(2k)) Sum_i.

So yes, Im[f(0)] = (Sum_i) / (2k)

So now, I need to compute Sum_i, which is sum of sin(2δ_l) for l=0 to 4.

Let's compute each term:

l=0: δ₀=90°, 2δ=180°, sin(180°)=0

l=1: δ₁=67°, 2δ=134°, sin(134°)= sin(180-46)= sin46≈0.7193

l=2: δ₂=55°, 2δ=110°, sin(110)= sin(70)= approx 0.9397

Wait wait, sin(110) is sin(180-70)= sin70≈0.9397.

l=3: δ3=30°, 2δ=60°, sin60=√3/2≈0.8660

l=4: δ4=13°, 2δ=26°, sin26≈0.4384

So adding each:

l=0: 0

l=1: ≈0.7193

l=2: ≈0.9397

l=3: ≈0.8660

l=4: ≈0.4384

Sum_i = 0 + 0.7193 + 0.9397 + 0.8660 + 0.4384

Let me add them step by step:

0.7193 + 0.9397 = 1.659

1.659 + 0.8660 = 2.525

2.525 + 0.4384 ≈ 2.9634

So Sum_i ≈ 2.9634

Now, what is k? The wave number k is related to the electron's wavelength.

The electrons have energy E=50 MeV. But wait, the electrons are non-relativistic? Or relativistic?

Wait, 50 MeV is a significant amount of energy for electrons. The rest mass of the electron is about 0.511 MeV/c², so 50 MeV is much higher. So it's relativistic.

The momentum p can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²

So, E = 50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

So, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739 (MeV)^2.

So, pc = sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.99739 MeV.

So p≈ (49.99739 MeV) / c.

But we need to find k, which is (p)/ħ.

Wait, but I think in particle physics, the wave number k is often expressed in terms of inverse femtometers (fm⁻¹), since the typical nuclear scales are on the order of femtometers.

Given that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1 / 197.33 MeV fm⁻¹.

Wait, let me calculate k.

k = p/(ħ c) * (ħ c) ?

Wait, no, k is typically p/(ħ). But since p is in units of MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV s, so let me get the units right.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1, ħ=1.

But in any case, the formula for k in terms of momentum p is k = p/(ħ). So in natural units, p would be in MeV, and ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV s (but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of MeV s? No, maybe another approach.)

Alternatively, since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm).

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the units here. Let's think in terms of k in inverse femtometers.

Given p = (E² - (m c²)^2 )^(1/2) / c

Wait, in natural units (c=1), E = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 ) / c^2 ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute p in units of MeV/c.

E = 50 MeV.

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So, p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.2611) ≈ sqrt(2499.7389) ≈ 49.99739 MeV.

So p = (49.99739 MeV) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But ħ in units of MeV s is 6.582×10^-25 MeV s.

Wait, but I need to get k in units of fm⁻¹ because the options are in fm.

Hmm, let me compute ħ c in units of MeV fm.

ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, p = (49.99739 MeV)/c.

But since k = p/ħ, and p is in MeV/c, let me write in terms of ħ c.

Wait, perhaps I can express k as (p c) / (ħ c^2) ) * c.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express k in terms of p.

k = p / ħ.

But p is (49.99739 MeV)/c.

So, p = (49.99739 MeV) / c.

ħ is in units of J s. Let me convert everything into consistent units.

Alternatively, using the relation that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) ≈ 5.057e-3 fm⁻¹ (MeV)^{-1}.

Wait, but p is (49.99739 MeV)/c. Let me compute k.

k = p/(ħ) = [ (49.99739 MeV/c) ] / (ħ )

But to get this into fm⁻¹, I can express ħ as (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

Wait, because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So plugging into k:

k = [ (49.99739 MeV/c) ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) ]

The c cancels out, and MeV cancels.

So k = (49.99739 ) / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Wait, let me compute that numerically:

49.99739 / 197.33 ≈ (50 / 197.33) ≈ 0.2534.

So k ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise. Let me compute 49.99739 divided by 197.33.

49.99739 / 197.33 = approximately 0.25338.

So k ≈ 0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So now, the imaginary part of f(0) is (Sum_i) / (2k)

Sum_i is approximately 2.9634.

So Im(f(0)) = 2.9634 / (2 * 0.25338 fm⁻¹) )

Wait, wait. Let me think about the units.

Wait, wait, the units for f(0) are in terms of length (fm, because the options are in fm). So let me compute this properly.

Im(f(0)) = Sum_i / (2k) = (2.9634) / (2 * 0.25338) [units? Because k is in fm⁻¹, so 1/k is fm.]

So 2k is 2 * 0.25338 fm⁻¹ → 0.50676 fm⁻¹.

So 2.9634 divided by 0.50676 gives ?

Let me compute 2.9634 / 0.50676.

Hmm, 2.9634 / 0.50676 ≈ 5.841.

Wait, but wait: 0.5 * 5.841 = 2.9205, which is close to 2.9634, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 0.50676 * 5.84 = 0.50676 *5 = 2.5338, 0.50676 *0.84= approx 0.50676 *0.8=0.4054, 0.50676 *0.04=0.02027, so total 0.4054+0.02027=0.42567. So 2.5338+0.42567=2.95947, which is close to 2.9634. So 5.84 gives ~2.95947; the difference is 2.9634 -2.95947=0.00393. So maybe 5.84 + (0.00393/ (0.50676 * (1/100) )) ) → 5.84 + (0.00393 *100)/0.50676 → 5.84 + 0.775 ≈ 6.615? Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Perhaps I should just compute 2.9634 / 0.50676 → 2.9634 ÷ 0.50676.

Let me compute:

Calculate 2.9634 / 0.50676.

Let me approximate this using division.

0.50676 × 5 = 2.5338

Subtract that from 2.9634: 2.9634 - 2.5338 = 0.4296.

So 5 plus (0.4296 / 0.50676).

0.4296 / 0.50676 ≈ 0.847.

So total is approximately 5.847.

So Im(f(0)) ≈ 5.847 fm.

Wait, but the options are in the hundreds. Wait, the options are around 177, 251, etc. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me re-calculate k.

Earlier, I wrote:

p c = 49.99739 MeV.

So p = (49.99739 MeV)/c.

We have ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = p / ħ = (49.99739 MeV / c) / ( ħ )

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So, substituting:

k = (49.99739 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) )

The c cancels, MeV cancels.

So k = 49.99739 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So that's correct.

Wait, but the imaginary part is Sum_i/(2k) → (2.9634) / (2 * 0.25338) fm.

Wait, 2 * 0.25338 = 0.50676 fm⁻¹.

So 2.9634 / 0.50676 = approximately 5.847 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds, like 251.271 fm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Ah! Wait a second. Perhaps I forgot that the sum is for l=0 to 4, but I included l=0. However, for l=0, the phase shift is delta_0=90 degrees, and e^{2i delta_0}=e^{i pi}= -1.

So (e^{2i delta_0} -1) = (-1-1)= -2. The imaginary part of this is zero, as sin(180)=0. So including l=0 was correct, but perhaps the formula counts l=0, and that's fine.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in Sum_i. Let me recompute Sum_i.

Wait, l=0: 2 delta=180°, sin(180)=0.

l=1: 134°, sin(134)= sin(46)≈0.7193

l=2: 110°, sin(110)= sin(70)= approx 0.9397

l=3:60°, sin(60)=0.8660

l=4:26°, sin(26)=approx 0.4384

Sum is 0.7193 + 0.9397 = 1.659; +0.8660=2.525; +0.4384=2.9634.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise with the sine values.

Let me compute each sin accurately.

l=0: sin(180)=0.

l=1: 2*67=134°. sin(134) = sin(180-46)= sin46. Let me look up sin46°.

Sin45 is about 0.7071, sin46 is about 0.7193 as I had before.

l=2: 110°, which is 180-70, so sin110=sin70. Sin70 is approximately 0.9397.

l=3:60°, sin60=√3/2≈0.8660254.

l=4:26°, sin26≈0.43837115.

So summing:0.7193 +0.9397=1.659; +0.8660254=2.5250254; +0.43837115=2.96339655.

So Sum_i≈2.9634.

But that's correct.

Wait, but why is the result Im(f(0)) about 5.85 fm? The options are way higher, like 251 fm, 355, etc.

Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the formula for Im(f(0))?

Wait, let me go back to the formula.

Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * Sum_i.

Wait, but I have Sum_i=2.9634, and k≈0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k)=1/(2 * 0.25338) fm.

1/(0.50676) ≈ 1.973 fm.

So 2.9634 * 1.973 fm ≈ ?

Wait, 2.9634 * 1.973 ≈ let me compute.

Approximating:

3 * 2 = 6.

But 2.9634 is a bit less than 3, and 1.973 is a bit less than 2.

Wait, exact calculation: 2.9634 * 1.973.

Let me compute 2.9634 *2 = 5.9268, minus 2.9634*0.027:

2.9634 * 0.027 = approx 0.0800118.

So 5.9268 - 0.0800118 ≈5.8468.

So Im(f(0)) ≈5.8468 fm.

But the options are B) 355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, etc. So I'm getting an answer that's way too small.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider something else, like the Born approximation or something else?

Wait, another thought: The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ). But wait, some sources write it as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ). No, wait, no, I think that's not correct. Wait, in some treatments, the relation is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (something with (2l+1) P_l).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the amplitude formula. I should double-check.

Ah, yes! I think I might have missed a factor. I remember that the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) (2l + 1) P_l(cosθ)

Wait, if that's the case, then the formula includes (2l+1) factor for each term.

Oh no! Did I forget that?

Wait, looking it up in my notes: The scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (e^{2i\delta_l} - 1) (2l + 1) P_l(\cos\theta)

So yes, each term has a (2l+1) factor. I completely forgot that!

So that changes everything. So the correct expression is:

Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * sum_{l=0}^4 [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * (2l +1) ]_Im

Wait, but the imaginary part of each term (e^{2iδ_l} -1) is sin(2δ_l), as before. So for each l, the contribution is (2l +1)* sin(2δ_l).

So Sum_i = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l )

So let's compute this.

Compute each term:

l | (2l+1) | sin(2delta_l) | product
0 | 1 | 0 | 0
1 | 3 | sin(134°) ≈0.7193 → 3*0.7193=2.1579
2 |5 | sin(110°)= sin70 ≈0.9397 →5*0.9397=4.6985
3 |7 | sin(60)=0.8660 →7*0.8660=6.062
4 |9 | sin(26)=0.4384 →9*0.4384≈3.9456

Now sum all the products.

0 + 2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = ?

2.1579 +4.6985 = 6.8564

6.8564 +6.062=12.9184

12.9184 +3.9456=16.864

So Sum_i=16.864.

Now, Im(f(0))= Sum_i/(2k) → 16.864 / (2 * 0.25338) fm.

Compute denominator: 2 * 0.25338=0.50676 fm⁻¹.

So 16.864 / 0.50676 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

0.50676 *33 = 16.723, because 0.50676 *30=15.2028, 0.50676 *3=1.52028 → total 16.723.

So 33 would be 16.723, but we have 16.864.

The difference is 16.864 -16.723=0.141.

So 0.141 /0.50676 ≈0.278.

So total is approximately 33.278.

Wait, but 33.278 fm is still not matching the options. Wait, what's the options?

Options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Hmm, 33 fm is still way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees? No, the question states degrees, as δ0=90°, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

E=50 MeV.

m c²=0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2 )= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2)= sqrt(2500 -0.261)=sqrt(2499.739)=≈49.99739 MeV.

So p c=49.99739 MeV.

So p=49.99739 MeV / c.

Now, k= p/ħ.

But ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So, p c=49.99739 MeV → p=49.99739 MeV / c.

So, k= p/ħ = (49.99739 MeV / c ) / (ħ).

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ= (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

So,

k= (49.99739 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c )

= (49.99739 / 197.33 ) fm⁻¹

≈0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So that's correct.

Wait, but if I compute Im(f(0)) = 16.864 / (2 * 0.25338) →16.864 / 0.50676 ≈33.278 fm.

Hmm. But the options are much larger.

Wait, another possibility: I've been using the formula for the scattering amplitude, but perhaps the imaginary part is actually the total cross section or something else.

Wait, wait, I think I might have mixed the formula.

Wait, the optical theorem tells us that the total cross section σ_total is 4π |f|^2 integrated over all solid angles. But at θ=0, perhaps that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the imaginary part of f multiplied by k times something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} − 1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

So, in the direction θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} −1) (2l+1).

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is Im[f(0)] = [1/(2k)] * Σ (2l+1) * Im[ e^{2iδ_l} −1 ].

Which as before is [1/(2k)] * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) .

But we did that and got Im(f(0))=33.278 fm.

But none of the options are near that.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f is f = (1/k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) ... no, earlier I thought it was (1/(2ik)), but perhaps it's (1/k) times ... ?

Wait, let me check again.

The standard formula is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ) ]

So yes, correct.

But perhaps I should consider that the cross-section is given by |f|², but that's not the question here.

Wait, but the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction, which is Im(f(0)).

Wait, could the question be asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude multiplied by something else?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me think about the units of Im(f).

The scattering amplitude f has units of length (fm). Because when you compute the differential cross-section, it's |f|² multiplied by something, and the cross-section has units of area (fm²).

So, if f is in fm, then Im(f) is in fm. So the calculation I did gives Im(f(0))≈33.278 fm. But the options are way higher.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians instead of degrees? Let me check.

Wait, the question says the phase shifts are given in degrees, as it's written 90°, 67°, etc.

So that's not the issue.

Hmm, what else could I have missed?

Wait, perhaps the formula f(θ) includes an additional factor of (1/k) in front.

Wait, let me go back to the theory.

The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} −1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ)

So, the formula is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, despite the notation? Let me compute the sum again with radians.

No, the question explicitly states the phase shifts are in degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted degrees to radians before computing the sine.

Wait, no, because the sin(2δ_l) where δ is in degrees requires that I convert 2δ from degrees to radians before taking the sine.

Wait! Oh! That's probably the mistake.

In my earlier calculation, I computed sin(134°) as sin(46°)≈0.7193, but wait, in reality, when I compute 2δ in degrees, I have to use that angle in the sine function, but in radians.

Wait, no. The sin function in the calculation must be in radians. So I should have converted each 2δ_l from degrees to radians before computing sin.

Ah! That's the mistake.

So, let me recompute Sum_i correctly, using radians.

So for each l:

l=0: 2δ=180° →  π radians → sin(π)=0.

l=1: 2δ=134° → 134° * (π/180) ≈2.340 radians. sin(2.340)=approx 0.7193.

l=2: 2δ=110° → 110 * π/180 ≈1.91986 radians. sin(1.91986)=approx 0.9397.

l=3: 60° → π/3 ≈1.0472 rad. sin(1.0472)=√3/2≈0.8660.

l=4: 26° → 26 * π/180 ≈0.4537 rad. sin(0.4537)=approx 0.4384.

Wait, so the same values as before? Because the sine function's argument is in radians, but the values I used were correct because the sine of 134 degrees is the same as the sine of 2.34 radians. So my previous calculation of the sum as 2.9634 is correct.

Wait, but no, because the (2l+1) factor is the same. So the sum_i would be the same as before, leading to Im(f(0))≈33.278 fm.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: The sum is from l=0 to l=4, but perhaps the maximum l is given by l_max = (k a_0), where a_0 is the scattering length? No, that might not be relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of (1/k) instead of (1/(2k)).

Wait, what's the correct expression for Im(f(0))?

The correct formula is Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So that's correct.

Hmm. Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by k. Because sometimes in scattering theory, the quantity k Im(f) comes up.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps if I multiply Im(f) by k, I get a number in fm², but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, but I don't think so. The question states, "Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction."

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are in a different unit. Perhaps the question is using a different convention for k.

Wait, another way to compute k: perhaps I made a mistake in converting p to k.

Wait, p c=49.99739 MeV.

So p=49.99739 MeV / c.

k = p / ħ.

But ħ in MeV s is 6.5823×10^-25 MeV s.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute k in units of inverse meters, then convert to inverse femtometers.

Alternatively, let's compute k correctly.

p = E/(c^2) * v, but that's non-relativistic approach. Alternatively, for relativistic,

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So, pc = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) MeV ≈49.99739 MeV.

So, p = 49.99739 MeV / c.

Now, ħ = 6.5823e-25 GeV s = 6.5823e-25 * 1e9 eV s = 6.5823e-16 eV s.

But in terms of MeV, 1 MeV = 1e6 eV. So ħ = 6.5823e-16 eV s = 6.5823e-25 MeV s.

So, 1/(ħ) = 1/(6.5823e-25 MeV s) ) ≈1.517e24 s/(MeV).

But how does this help? Well, k = p / ħ = (49.99739 MeV / c) / (6.5823e-25 MeV s )

So, units: MeV/(MeV s) ) → 1/s.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should express k in terms of inverse femtometers.

We know that ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So, k = p / ħ = (p c ) / ( ħ c )

Because p = (p c ) / c.

So, k = (p c) / ( ħ c )

Since p c =49.99739 MeV, and ħ c=197.33 MeV fm,

k = 49.99739 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but maybe the formula for Im(f) is (sum) * (k) ?

Wait, no, because the formula is Im(f) = [1/(2k)] * sum.

Another thought: perhaps the question is using a different definition, such as f multiplied by 2ik.

Wait, if I compute f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum, so Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * sum Im[ ... ].

But perhaps the question is asking for (2ik) f(0), which would be sum.

Wait, but that would be sum (e^{2iδ} -1), but that's a complex number, and the question is about the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of (2ik f(0)).

Wait, 2ik f(0) = sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(1).

So, 2ik f(0) = sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1).

Then, the imaginary part of this would be sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) → Sum_i=16.864.

So, Im(2ik f(0)) = Sum_i=16.864.

But the question is asking for Im(f(0)).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of k f(0), which would be [k Im(f(0)) ].

Wait, but Im(f(0))=33.278 fm. So k Im(f(0)) would be 0.25338 fm⁻¹ * 33.278 fm = 8.438.

Not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mistaken, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me think again.

The correct formula for f(θ) is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} −1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0°, P_l(1)=1.

So, f(0)= (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} −1) (2l+1).

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is [1/(2k)] * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Which gives Im(f(0)) ≈33.278 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians. Let me try that.

Wait, delta_0=90 degrees is pi/2 radians.

If I compute 2 delta_l in radians:

l=0: 2*90=180°=pi radians. sin(pi)=0.

l=1: 2*67=134°=2.340 radians. sin(2.340)=approx 0.7193.

l=2: 2*55=110°=1.91986 radians. sin(1.91986)=approx 0.9397.

l=3: 2*30=60°=1.0472 radians. sin(1.0472)=approx 0.8660.

l=4:2*13=26°=0.4537 radians. sin(0.4537)=approx 0.4384.

So same values as before. So no change.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the scattering amplitude is in the differential cross-section formula, but the question is about the amplitude itself.

Wait, another possibility: The question is using the unit of k in 1/(fm), but perhaps the formula for f has a factor of k in the denominator, so when you compute Im(f), it's in (fm), but perhaps the actual value is the sum multiplied by (1/(2k)).

Wait, but that's what I did.

Wait, let's compute the numerical value again.

Sum_i =16.864.

k=0.25338 fm⁻¹.

Im(f(0))=16.864 / (2 *0.25338) =16.864 / 0.50676 ≈33.278 fm.

But options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are for higher l values beyond l=4, but the question says to ignore the rest beyond δ4.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (k), not divided by 2k.

Wait, then Im(f(0))=16.864/(0.25338) ≈66.556 fm. Still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are on the order of 177 fm, which is about 5 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me recheck the formula.

The correct formula is Im(f) = [1/(2k)] * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I've been treating them as degrees.

Wait, if I compute each 2δ_l in radians, then compute sin(2δ_l):

Wait, for each l:

l=0: 2delta=180 degrees → pi radians → sin(pi)=0.

l=1:2delta=134 degrees → 2.340 radians→ sin≈0.7193.

l=2:2delta=110→1.91986 rad→sin≈0.9397.

l=3:60→1.047 rad→ sin≈0.8660.

l=4:26→0.4537 rad→ sin≈0.4384.

Same as before.

Wait, but perhaps the question is using a different definition, such as f multiplied by 2k.

Wait, f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ}-1)(2l+1).

So, 2ik f(0)= sum (e^{2iδ}-1)(2l+1).

The imaginary part of 2ik f(0) is sum (2l+1) sin(2delta).

Which is 16.864.

So, Im(2ik f(0))=16.864.

If the question had asked for Im(2ik f(0)), the answer would be 16.864.

But again, the options are much larger.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total cross-section.

The total cross-section sigma is given by sigma_total = 4π |f(0)|^2 (something), but no, the optical theorem says sigma_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0)).

Because the optical theorem states that sigma_total = 4π ∫ |f(θ)|² dΩ = (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

Wait, the exact formula is sigma_total = (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

So if Im(f(0))=33.278 fm,

sigma_total= (4π /k ) * Im(f(0)).

But k=0.25338 fm⁻¹,

so 4π/k =4pi /0.25338 fm⁻¹ → (approx 12.566 /0.25338 ) fm⁻¹ → approx 49.58 fm.

So sigma_total= 49.58 fm * Im(f(0)) = 49.58 * 33.278 ≈1651 fm².

But the options are in the hundreds of fm, not the thousands.

Wait, but the question is not about the cross-section. So perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Another approach: Let's compute the scattering amplitude for the given phase shifts.

Wait, another way to compute the imaginary part of f(0) is using partial waves.

Each partial wave contributes to the amplitude. The contribution from each l is (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1)/(2ik) .

The imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin(2delta_l)/(2k).

Summing over l gives Im(f(0)).

Which is what I did.

Hmm. So I think I'm confident in my calculation, but the answer doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are for the real part, not the imaginary part? No, the phase shifts are given, and from them, we compute the amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the question actually wants the real part, but it says imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given as real parts, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are for the real part, and the imaginary part is zero. But that's not the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are in units where k=1. But that would make the units inconsistent.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

That would change the calculation.

If the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ),

then Im(f(0)) = [1/k] sum (2l+1) sin(2delta_l).

Which would be 16.864 / 0.25338 → approx 66.556 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but option D is 251.271 fm. 66.556 is roughly a quarter of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me compute k again.

p c=49.99739 MeV.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (49.99739 MeV/c) / ( ħ )

But ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c → thus,

k = (49.99739 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) = (49.99739 / 197.33 ) fm⁻¹ → 0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question uses a different value for ħ c, like 197.33 MeV-fm instead of MeV fm.

No, same thing.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin(2delta_l)/(k) → which would be 16.864 /0.25338 ≈66.556 fm. But that's still not matching.

Wait, but option C is 177.675 fm, which is approximately twice that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have included all the phase shifts beyond l=4, but the question says to ignore them.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) ] P_l(cosθ).

But perhaps the sum is for all l, but the question says to include up to l=4.

Wait, but that's what I did.

Hmm. I'm not sure where the mistake is, but perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the value of the imaginary part multiplied by k, which would be (sum (2l+1) sin(2delta_l)) →16.864.

But looking at the options, 16.864 is not present. Option C is 177.675 fm.

Wait, 177.675 is approximately 16.864 * 10.53. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the sum without the (2l+1) factor.

In that case, Sum_i=2.9634, Im(f)=2.9634/(2k)=2.9634/(0.50676)≈5.847 fm.

Which is close to option C's 177.675 divided by 30.36, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a non-relativistic approach for k?

In non-relativistic, k = p/(ħ).

But for non-relativistic, E≈pc²/(2m).

Wait, but E=50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass, so non-relativistic doesn't apply.

Wait, perhaps using non-relativistic formulas would give a different k.

But let's try.

In non-relativistic, p ≈ sqrt(2mE).

m is electron mass, 0.511 MeV/c².

So p= sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² *50 MeV ) / c.

Compute inside sqrt: 2 *0.511 *50 =51.1 MeV²/c².

So p= sqrt(51.1) MeV/c = 7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k=p/ħ =7.15 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm) → 7.15 /197.33 ≈0.0362 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f)= sum_i/(2k) → sum_i=16.864, 2k=0.0724.

16.864/0.0724≈232.9 fm.

Hmm, close to option D, 251.271. But not exactly.

Wait, perhaps using non-relativistic approach, Im(f)=232.9 fm.

But why would the question use non-relativistic when E=50 MeV is relativistic.

Hmm. But the option D is 251.271, which is close to 233.

But why would I get 233 with non-relativistic and 33 with relativistic.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is relativistic, but I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, another idea: The question asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which would be θ=0°, but perhaps the correct formula is f(π), since the beam is along the initial direction, but the scattering angle is measured from the target.

Wait, no, in scattering, θ=0 is the direction of the incident beam.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f(π) is used instead, as in the backward scattering.

Wait, but the question says along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0, not θ=π.

So, I think I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be around 33.28 fm, but none of the options match. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different definition of the scattering amplitude, such as f multiplied by k.

If Im(f(0))=33.28 fm,

then k Im(f(0))=0.25338 fm⁻¹ *33.28 fm =8.435.

Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the value of (2l+1) * Im(f(0)) summed over l, which would be sum_i=16.864, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

In that case, Im(f(0))= [1/k ] sum_i=16.864 / 0.25338 ≈66.556 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The closest is option C, 177.675, which is about 2.67 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing each (2l+1) * sin(2delta_l) term.

Let me recompute the sum.

l=0:0 → 0

l=1:3 * sin(134) →3 *0.7193=2.1579

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456

Sum: 2.1579+4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the question has a typo, or I misunderstood the question.

But given the options, the only possible way I can get one of them is if I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps k is computed as k = E / ħ c, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, E=50 MeV.

k=E/ħ c → 50 /197.33 →≈0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different, and I should include a factor of 2pi somewhere.

But I can't think of where.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin(2delta_l)/(k) →16.864 /0.25338≈66.556.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for ħ c, such as 197.33 MeV fm⁻¹.

No, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I'm treating them in degrees, leading to incorrect sin values.

Wait, let me compute the sum_i again, assuming delta_l are in radians.

Wait, if delta_0=90 degrees, that's pi/2 radians.

Then, 2delta_0=pi radians. So sin(pi)=0.

But wait, if all phase shifts are in radians, then:

delta_0=pi/2, 2delta=pi → sin(pi)=0.

delta_1=67 radians? That can't be right. 67 radians is about 3836 degrees, which is impossible as a phase shift.

So that's not possible.

Thus, I think my initial approach is correct, but I can't reconcile the answer with the options.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option D) 251.271 fm, which is approximately 2pi times the sum_i/(2k).

Wait, 16.864 * 2π ≈105.8, but 105.8/0.50676 ≈208.8 fm, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply the sum_i by 2pi.

But that doesn't seem right.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the calculation leads to 16.864/(2k)=33.28 fm, but none of the options match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

But given the options, and considering that when I used the non-relativistic approach I got approximately 233 fm, which is close to option D (251.271), perhaps the intended answer is D.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, the closest is C) 177.675.

But I'm not sure. Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is using the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by (2l+1) and then multiplied by (1/k).

So, sum (2l+1) delta_l (in radians), then multiply by 1/k.

Wait, let's try that.

Compute sum (2l+1) * delta_l (in radians).

l=0: (1) * (pi/2)=1.5708

l=1:3 * (67*pi/180)=3*(1.16937)=3.5081

l=2:5*(55*pi/180)=5*(0.95993)=4.7997

l=3:7*(30*pi/180)=7*(0.523599)=3.6652

l=4:9*(13*pi/180)=9*(0.22689)=2.0420

Sum=1.5708+3.5081=5.0789; +4.7997=9.8786; +3.6652=13.5438; +2.0420=15.5858.

So sum=15.5858 radians.

Then, Im(f)= sum_delta * (1/k) →15.5858 /0.25338≈61.47 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but 61.47 is not an option either.

Hmm. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option C)177.675 fm.

But I'm really not sure. Based on the detailed calculation, the correct Im(f(0)) should be around 33.28 fm, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately twice the value I calculated. But I don't see where a factor of 2 would come from.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts are given as \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and higher \( l \)-values are ignored. The scattering amplitude is expressed as:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (e^{2i\delta_l} - 1)(2l+1)P_l(1),
\]

where \( P_l(1) = 1 \) for all \( l \). The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shift Contributions**: For each \( l \), the term \( \sin(2\delta_l) \) is calculated. The results are:
   - \( l=0 \): \( \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \).

2. **Weighted Sum**: Each \( \sin(2\delta_l) \) is multiplied by \( (2l+1) \), and the results are summed:
   - \( l=0 \): \( 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( 3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

   Total sum: \( 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.864 \).

3. **Wave Number \( k \)**: Using \( k = \frac{p}{\hbar} \), where \( p = \frac{pc}{\hbar c} \) and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm} \), the momentum \( pc \) is calculated as \( \sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2} \approx 49.99739 \, \text{MeV} \). Thus:
   \[
   k = \frac{49.99739}{197.33} \approx 0.25338 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

4. **Imaginary Part**: Substituting into \( \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{\text{sum}}{2k} \):
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 0.25338} \approx \frac{16.864}{0.50676} \approx 33.28 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀ through δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13°, respectively. They also mention that the electrons have 50 MeV of energy and to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. The general formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2iδ_l * (something with spherical harmonics?), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, right, the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts. Oh yes, it's f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ) ), where the sum is over all angular momentum states l, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials.

But wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which would be θ=0°, right? Because the incident beam is along the initial direction, so the scattering angle θ is zero.

At θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So the formula simplifies when θ=0.

So at θ=0°, f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * 1.

But wait, the sum is from l=0 to l= some maximum. In this problem, the given phase shifts are up to δ₄, so l goes up to 4. So the sum is from l=0 to l=4.

Each term is (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) for l=0 to 4.

Hmm, let me compute each term for l=0 to 4.

First, for l=0: δ₀=90°, which is π/2 radians. So 2δ₀= π radians. e^{iπ} is -1. So e^{2iδ₀} = e^{iπ} = -1. Then (e^{2iδ₀} -1) = (-1 -1) = -2.

l=1: δ₁=67°. 2δ₁=134°. Let me convert that to radians if needed, but perhaps it's easier to compute the sine and cosine in terms of degrees. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each term's imaginary part.

Wait, but the problem wants the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So perhaps I can compute the imaginary part of each term, sum them, and then multiply by [1/(2ik)].

Wait, another approach: The amplitude f is a complex quantity. The imaginary part of f(0) is what we're after.

Alternatively, the expression for f(θ) can be written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ).

Since at θ=0°, P_l(1)=1 for all l, the expression becomes (1/(2ik)) * Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1).

So let's compute each term (e^{2iδ_l} -1) for l=0 to 4.

Let me make a table:

l | δ_l (degrees) | 2δ_l | e^{i 2δ_l} | e^{i2δ_l} -1

0 | 90 | 180 | e^{iπ} = -1 | (-1) -1 = -2
1 | 67 | 134 | e^{i 134°} | complex number
2 |55 |110 | e^{i 110°} | complex
3 |30 |60 | e^{i60} | complex
4 |13 |26 | e^{i26} | complex

Each of these terms is a complex number. We'll need their imaginary parts to sum up.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the imaginary part of each (e^{i x} -1), which is Im[e^{i x}] - Im[1] = sin x - 0 = sin x.

Wait, wait. Because e^{i x} = cos x + i sin x. So e^{i x} -1 = (cos x -1) + i sin x.

So the imaginary part of (e^{i x} -1) is sin x.

Ah! So for each l, the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ_l} -1) is sin(2δ_l).

So the total imaginary part of the sum is the sum of sin(2δ_l) for l=0 to 4.

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is [1/(2k)] times that sum, because (1/(2ik)) times the sum of (e^{2iδ_l} -1) gives (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (cos 2δ_l -1) + i sin 2δ_l ].

The imaginary part of f(0) would be [1/(2k)] * sum [ sin 2δ_l ].

Because when you distribute the (1/(2ik)), the i in the denominator will multiply the imaginary part, but let's think carefully.

Wait, let me compute Im[f(0)].

f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * sum_{l=0}^4 (e^{2iδ_l} -1)

Each term (e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l).

So sum over l:

Sum_r = sum [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) ] 

Sum_i = sum [ sin(2δ_l) ]

So f(0) = [1/(2ik)] ( Sum_r + i Sum_i )

To find the imaginary part of f(0):

Im[f(0)] = [1/(2k)] * Sum_i 

Because (1/(2ik)) * i Sum_i = (1/(2k)) Sum_i.

So yes, Im[f(0)] = (Sum_i) / (2k)

So now, I need to compute Sum_i, which is sum of sin(2δ_l) for l=0 to 4.

Let's compute each term:

l=0: δ₀=90°, 2δ=180°, sin(180°)=0

l=1: δ₁=67°, 2δ=134°, sin(134°)= sin(180-46)= sin46≈0.7193

l=2: δ₂=55°, 2δ=110°, sin(110)= sin(70)= approx 0.9397

Wait wait, sin(110) is sin(180-70)= sin70≈0.9397.

l=3: δ3=30°, 2δ=60°, sin60=√3/2≈0.8660

l=4: δ4=13°, 2δ=26°, sin26≈0.4384

So adding each:

l=0: 0

l=1: ≈0.7193

l=2: ≈0.9397

l=3: ≈0.8660

l=4: ≈0.4384

Sum_i = 0 + 0.7193 + 0.9397 + 0.8660 + 0.4384

Let me add them step by step:

0.7193 + 0.9397 = 1.659

1.659 + 0.8660 = 2.525

2.525 + 0.4384 ≈ 2.9634

So Sum_i ≈ 2.9634

Now, what is k? The wave number k is related to the electron's wavelength.

The electrons have energy E=50 MeV. But wait, the electrons are non-relativistic? Or relativistic?

Wait, 50 MeV is a significant amount of energy for electrons. The rest mass of the electron is about 0.511 MeV/c², so 50 MeV is much higher. So it's relativistic.

The momentum p can be found using the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²

So, E = 50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

So, (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2500 - 0.261 ≈ 2499.739 (MeV)^2.

So, pc = sqrt(2499.739) ≈ 49.99739 MeV.

So p≈ (49.99739 MeV) / c.

But we need to find k, which is (p)/ħ.

Wait, but I think in particle physics, the wave number k is often expressed in terms of inverse femtometers (fm⁻¹), since the typical nuclear scales are on the order of femtometers.

Given that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1 / 197.33 MeV fm⁻¹.

Wait, let me calculate k.

k = p/(ħ c) * (ħ c) ?

Wait, no, k is typically p/(ħ). But since p is in units of MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV s, so let me get the units right.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1, ħ=1.

But in any case, the formula for k in terms of momentum p is k = p/(ħ). So in natural units, p would be in MeV, and ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV s (but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of MeV s? No, maybe another approach.)

Alternatively, since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm).

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the units here. Let's think in terms of k in inverse femtometers.

Given p = (E² - (m c²)^2 )^(1/2) / c

Wait, in natural units (c=1), E = sqrt( p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4 ) / c^2 ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute p in units of MeV/c.

E = 50 MeV.

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So, p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV ≈ sqrt(2500 - 0.2611) ≈ sqrt(2499.7389) ≈ 49.99739 MeV.

So p = (49.99739 MeV) / c.

Then, k = p / ħ.

But ħ in units of MeV s is 6.582×10^-25 MeV s.

Wait, but I need to get k in units of fm⁻¹ because the options are in fm.

Hmm, let me compute ħ c in units of MeV fm.

ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, p = (49.99739 MeV)/c.

But since k = p/ħ, and p is in MeV/c, let me write in terms of ħ c.

Wait, perhaps I can express k as (p c) / (ħ c^2) ) * c.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express k in terms of p.

k = p / ħ.

But p is (49.99739 MeV)/c.

So, p = (49.99739 MeV) / c.

ħ is in units of J s. Let me convert everything into consistent units.

Alternatively, using the relation that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) ≈ 5.057e-3 fm⁻¹ (MeV)^{-1}.

Wait, but p is (49.99739 MeV)/c. Let me compute k.

k = p/(ħ) = [ (49.99739 MeV/c) ] / (ħ )

But to get this into fm⁻¹, I can express ħ as (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

Wait, because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

So plugging into k:

k = [ (49.99739 MeV/c) ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm) / c ) ]

The c cancels out, and MeV cancels.

So k = (49.99739 ) / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Wait, let me compute that numerically:

49.99739 / 197.33 ≈ (50 / 197.33) ≈ 0.2534.

So k ≈ 0.2534 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise. Let me compute 49.99739 divided by 197.33.

49.99739 / 197.33 = approximately 0.25338.

So k ≈ 0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So now, the imaginary part of f(0) is (Sum_i) / (2k)

Sum_i is approximately 2.9634.

So Im(f(0)) = 2.9634 / (2 * 0.25338 fm⁻¹) )

Wait, wait. Let me think about the units.

Wait, wait, the units for f(0) are in terms of length (fm, because the options are in fm). So let me compute this properly.

Im(f(0)) = Sum_i / (2k) = (2.9634) / (2 * 0.25338) [units? Because k is in fm⁻¹, so 1/k is fm.]

So 2k is 2 * 0.25338 fm⁻¹ → 0.50676 fm⁻¹.

So 2.9634 divided by 0.50676 gives ?

Let me compute 2.9634 / 0.50676.

Hmm, 2.9634 / 0.50676 ≈ 5.841.

Wait, but wait: 0.5 * 5.841 = 2.9205, which is close to 2.9634, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me compute 0.50676 * 5.84 = 0.50676 *5 = 2.5338, 0.50676 *0.84= approx 0.50676 *0.8=0.4054, 0.50676 *0.04=0.02027, so total 0.4054+0.02027=0.42567. So 2.5338+0.42567=2.95947, which is close to 2.9634. So 5.84 gives ~2.95947; the difference is 2.9634 -2.95947=0.00393. So maybe 5.84 + (0.00393/ (0.50676 * (1/100) )) ) → 5.84 + (0.00393 *100)/0.50676 → 5.84 + 0.775 ≈ 6.615? Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Perhaps I should just compute 2.9634 / 0.50676 → 2.9634 ÷ 0.50676.

Let me compute:

Calculate 2.9634 / 0.50676.

Let me approximate this using division.

0.50676 × 5 = 2.5338

Subtract that from 2.9634: 2.9634 - 2.5338 = 0.4296.

So 5 plus (0.4296 / 0.50676).

0.4296 / 0.50676 ≈ 0.847.

So total is approximately 5.847.

So Im(f(0)) ≈ 5.847 fm.

Wait, but the options are in the hundreds. Wait, the options are around 177, 251, etc. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me re-calculate k.

Earlier, I wrote:

p c = 49.99739 MeV.

So p = (49.99739 MeV)/c.

We have ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = p / ħ = (49.99739 MeV / c) / ( ħ )

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So, substituting:

k = (49.99739 MeV / c ) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) )

The c cancels, MeV cancels.

So k = 49.99739 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈ 0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So that's correct.

Wait, but the imaginary part is Sum_i/(2k) → (2.9634) / (2 * 0.25338) fm.

Wait, 2 * 0.25338 = 0.50676 fm⁻¹.

So 2.9634 / 0.50676 = approximately 5.847 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds, like 251.271 fm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Ah! Wait a second. Perhaps I forgot that the sum is for l=0 to 4, but I included l=0. However, for l=0, the phase shift is delta_0=90 degrees, and e^{2i delta_0}=e^{i pi}= -1.

So (e^{2i delta_0} -1) = (-1-1)= -2. The imaginary part of this is zero, as sin(180)=0. So including l=0 was correct, but perhaps the formula counts l=0, and that's fine.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in Sum_i. Let me recompute Sum_i.

Wait, l=0: 2 delta=180°, sin(180)=0.

l=1: 134°, sin(134)= sin(46)≈0.7193

l=2: 110°, sin(110)= sin(70)= approx 0.9397

l=3:60°, sin(60)=0.8660

l=4:26°, sin(26)=approx 0.4384

Sum is 0.7193 + 0.9397 = 1.659; +0.8660=2.525; +0.4384=2.9634.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise with the sine values.

Let me compute each sin accurately.

l=0: sin(180)=0.

l=1: 2*67=134°. sin(134) = sin(180-46)= sin46. Let me look up sin46°.

Sin45 is about 0.7071, sin46 is about 0.7193 as I had before.

l=2: 110°, which is 180-70, so sin110=sin70. Sin70 is approximately 0.9397.

l=3:60°, sin60=√3/2≈0.8660254.

l=4:26°, sin26≈0.43837115.

So summing:0.7193 +0.9397=1.659; +0.8660254=2.5250254; +0.43837115=2.96339655.

So Sum_i≈2.9634.

But that's correct.

Wait, but why is the result Im(f(0)) about 5.85 fm? The options are way higher, like 251 fm, 355, etc.

Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the formula for Im(f(0))?

Wait, let me go back to the formula.

Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * Sum_i.

Wait, but I have Sum_i=2.9634, and k≈0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So 1/(2k)=1/(2 * 0.25338) fm.

1/(0.50676) ≈ 1.973 fm.

So 2.9634 * 1.973 fm ≈ ?

Wait, 2.9634 * 1.973 ≈ let me compute.

Approximating:

3 * 2 = 6.

But 2.9634 is a bit less than 3, and 1.973 is a bit less than 2.

Wait, exact calculation: 2.9634 * 1.973.

Let me compute 2.9634 *2 = 5.9268, minus 2.9634*0.027:

2.9634 * 0.027 = approx 0.0800118.

So 5.9268 - 0.0800118 ≈5.8468.

So Im(f(0)) ≈5.8468 fm.

But the options are B) 355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, etc. So I'm getting an answer that's way too small.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider something else, like the Born approximation or something else?

Wait, another thought: The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ). But wait, some sources write it as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ). No, wait, no, I think that's not correct. Wait, in some treatments, the relation is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (something with (2l+1) P_l).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the amplitude formula. I should double-check.

Ah, yes! I think I might have missed a factor. I remember that the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) (2l + 1) P_l(cosθ)

Wait, if that's the case, then the formula includes (2l+1) factor for each term.

Oh no! Did I forget that?

Wait, looking it up in my notes: The scattering amplitude can be written as:

f(θ) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (e^{2i\delta_l} - 1) (2l + 1) P_l(\cos\theta)

So yes, each term has a (2l+1) factor. I completely forgot that!

So that changes everything. So the correct expression is:

Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * sum_{l=0}^4 [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) * (2l +1) ]_Im

Wait, but the imaginary part of each term (e^{2iδ_l} -1) is sin(2δ_l), as before. So for each l, the contribution is (2l +1)* sin(2δ_l).

So Sum_i = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l )

So let's compute this.

Compute each term:

l | (2l+1) | sin(2delta_l) | product
0 | 1 | 0 | 0
1 | 3 | sin(134°) ≈0.7193 → 3*0.7193=2.1579
2 |5 | sin(110°)= sin70 ≈0.9397 →5*0.9397=4.6985
3 |7 | sin(60)=0.8660 →7*0.8660=6.062
4 |9 | sin(26)=0.4384 →9*0.4384≈3.9456

Now sum all the products.

0 + 2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = ?

2.1579 +4.6985 = 6.8564

6.8564 +6.062=12.9184

12.9184 +3.9456=16.864

So Sum_i=16.864.

Now, Im(f(0))= Sum_i/(2k) → 16.864 / (2 * 0.25338) fm.

Compute denominator: 2 * 0.25338=0.50676 fm⁻¹.

So 16.864 / 0.50676 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

0.50676 *33 = 16.723, because 0.50676 *30=15.2028, 0.50676 *3=1.52028 → total 16.723.

So 33 would be 16.723, but we have 16.864.

The difference is 16.864 -16.723=0.141.

So 0.141 /0.50676 ≈0.278.

So total is approximately 33.278.

Wait, but 33.278 fm is still not matching the options. Wait, what's the options?

Options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Hmm, 33 fm is still way off. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees? No, the question states degrees, as δ0=90°, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

E=50 MeV.

m c²=0.511 MeV.

p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2 )= sqrt(50^2 -0.511^2)= sqrt(2500 -0.261)=sqrt(2499.739)=≈49.99739 MeV.

So p c=49.99739 MeV.

So p=49.99739 MeV / c.

Now, k= p/ħ.

But ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So, p c=49.99739 MeV → p=49.99739 MeV / c.

So, k= p/ħ = (49.99739 MeV / c ) / (ħ).

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → ħ= (197.33 MeV fm)/c.

So,

k= (49.99739 MeV / c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c )

= (49.99739 / 197.33 ) fm⁻¹

≈0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So that's correct.

Wait, but if I compute Im(f(0)) = 16.864 / (2 * 0.25338) →16.864 / 0.50676 ≈33.278 fm.

Hmm. But the options are much larger.

Wait, another possibility: I've been using the formula for the scattering amplitude, but perhaps the imaginary part is actually the total cross section or something else.

Wait, wait, I think I might have mixed the formula.

Wait, the optical theorem tells us that the total cross section σ_total is 4π |f|^2 integrated over all solid angles. But at θ=0, perhaps that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the imaginary part of f multiplied by k times something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} − 1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

So, in the direction θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} −1) (2l+1).

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is Im[f(0)] = [1/(2k)] * Σ (2l+1) * Im[ e^{2iδ_l} −1 ].

Which as before is [1/(2k)] * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) .

But we did that and got Im(f(0))=33.278 fm.

But none of the options are near that.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f is f = (1/k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) ... no, earlier I thought it was (1/(2ik)), but perhaps it's (1/k) times ... ?

Wait, let me check again.

The standard formula is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ) ]

So yes, correct.

But perhaps I should consider that the cross-section is given by |f|², but that's not the question here.

Wait, but the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction, which is Im(f(0)).

Wait, could the question be asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude multiplied by something else?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me think about the units of Im(f).

The scattering amplitude f has units of length (fm). Because when you compute the differential cross-section, it's |f|² multiplied by something, and the cross-section has units of area (fm²).

So, if f is in fm, then Im(f) is in fm. So the calculation I did gives Im(f(0))≈33.278 fm. But the options are way higher.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians instead of degrees? Let me check.

Wait, the question says the phase shifts are given in degrees, as it's written 90°, 67°, etc.

So that's not the issue.

Hmm, what else could I have missed?

Wait, perhaps the formula f(θ) includes an additional factor of (1/k) in front.

Wait, let me go back to the theory.

The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} −1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ)

So, the formula is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, despite the notation? Let me compute the sum again with radians.

No, the question explicitly states the phase shifts are in degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted degrees to radians before computing the sine.

Wait, no, because the sin(2δ_l) where δ is in degrees requires that I convert 2δ from degrees to radians before taking the sine.

Wait! Oh! That's probably the mistake.

In my earlier calculation, I computed sin(134°) as sin(46°)≈0.7193, but wait, in reality, when I compute 2δ in degrees, I have to use that angle in the sine function, but in radians.

Wait, no. The sin function in the calculation must be in radians. So I should have converted each 2δ_l from degrees to radians before computing sin.

Ah! That's the mistake.

So, let me recompute Sum_i correctly, using radians.

So for each l:

l=0: 2δ=180° →  π radians → sin(π)=0.

l=1: 2δ=134° → 134° * (π/180) ≈2.340 radians. sin(2.340)=approx 0.7193.

l=2: 2δ=110° → 110 * π/180 ≈1.91986 radians. sin(1.91986)=approx 0.9397.

l=3: 60° → π/3 ≈1.0472 rad. sin(1.0472)=√3/2≈0.8660.

l=4: 26° → 26 * π/180 ≈0.4537 rad. sin(0.4537)=approx 0.4384.

Wait, so the same values as before? Because the sine function's argument is in radians, but the values I used were correct because the sine of 134 degrees is the same as the sine of 2.34 radians. So my previous calculation of the sum as 2.9634 is correct.

Wait, but no, because the (2l+1) factor is the same. So the sum_i would be the same as before, leading to Im(f(0))≈33.278 fm.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: The sum is from l=0 to l=4, but perhaps the maximum l is given by l_max = (k a_0), where a_0 is the scattering length? No, that might not be relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the formula includes a factor of (1/k) instead of (1/(2k)).

Wait, what's the correct expression for Im(f(0))?

The correct formula is Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So that's correct.

Hmm. Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude multiplied by k. Because sometimes in scattering theory, the quantity k Im(f) comes up.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps if I multiply Im(f) by k, I get a number in fm², but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, but I don't think so. The question states, "Calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction."

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options are in a different unit. Perhaps the question is using a different convention for k.

Wait, another way to compute k: perhaps I made a mistake in converting p to k.

Wait, p c=49.99739 MeV.

So p=49.99739 MeV / c.

k = p / ħ.

But ħ in MeV s is 6.5823×10^-25 MeV s.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute k in units of inverse meters, then convert to inverse femtometers.

Alternatively, let's compute k correctly.

p = E/(c^2) * v, but that's non-relativistic approach. Alternatively, for relativistic,

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So, pc = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) MeV ≈49.99739 MeV.

So, p = 49.99739 MeV / c.

Now, ħ = 6.5823e-25 GeV s = 6.5823e-25 * 1e9 eV s = 6.5823e-16 eV s.

But in terms of MeV, 1 MeV = 1e6 eV. So ħ = 6.5823e-16 eV s = 6.5823e-25 MeV s.

So, 1/(ħ) = 1/(6.5823e-25 MeV s) ) ≈1.517e24 s/(MeV).

But how does this help? Well, k = p / ħ = (49.99739 MeV / c) / (6.5823e-25 MeV s )

So, units: MeV/(MeV s) ) → 1/s.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should express k in terms of inverse femtometers.

We know that ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

So, k = p / ħ = (p c ) / ( ħ c )

Because p = (p c ) / c.

So, k = (p c) / ( ħ c )

Since p c =49.99739 MeV, and ħ c=197.33 MeV fm,

k = 49.99739 / 197.33 fm⁻¹ ≈0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but maybe the formula for Im(f) is (sum) * (k) ?

Wait, no, because the formula is Im(f) = [1/(2k)] * sum.

Another thought: perhaps the question is using a different definition, such as f multiplied by 2ik.

Wait, if I compute f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum, so Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * sum Im[ ... ].

But perhaps the question is asking for (2ik) f(0), which would be sum.

Wait, but that would be sum (e^{2iδ} -1), but that's a complex number, and the question is about the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of (2ik f(0)).

Wait, 2ik f(0) = sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(1).

So, 2ik f(0) = sum (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1).

Then, the imaginary part of this would be sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) → Sum_i=16.864.

So, Im(2ik f(0)) = Sum_i=16.864.

But the question is asking for Im(f(0)).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part of k f(0), which would be [k Im(f(0)) ].

Wait, but Im(f(0))=33.278 fm. So k Im(f(0)) would be 0.25338 fm⁻¹ * 33.278 fm = 8.438.

Not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mistaken, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me think again.

The correct formula for f(θ) is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} −1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0°, P_l(1)=1.

So, f(0)= (1/(2ik)) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} −1) (2l+1).

So, the imaginary part of f(0) is [1/(2k)] * Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Which gives Im(f(0)) ≈33.278 fm.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians. Let me try that.

Wait, delta_0=90 degrees is pi/2 radians.

If I compute 2 delta_l in radians:

l=0: 2*90=180°=pi radians. sin(pi)=0.

l=1: 2*67=134°=2.340 radians. sin(2.340)=approx 0.7193.

l=2: 2*55=110°=1.91986 radians. sin(1.91986)=approx 0.9397.

l=3: 2*30=60°=1.0472 radians. sin(1.0472)=approx 0.8660.

l=4:2*13=26°=0.4537 radians. sin(0.4537)=approx 0.4384.

So same values as before. So no change.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the scattering amplitude is in the differential cross-section formula, but the question is about the amplitude itself.

Wait, another possibility: The question is using the unit of k in 1/(fm), but perhaps the formula for f has a factor of k in the denominator, so when you compute Im(f), it's in (fm), but perhaps the actual value is the sum multiplied by (1/(2k)).

Wait, but that's what I did.

Wait, let's compute the numerical value again.

Sum_i =16.864.

k=0.25338 fm⁻¹.

Im(f(0))=16.864 / (2 *0.25338) =16.864 / 0.50676 ≈33.278 fm.

But options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are for higher l values beyond l=4, but the question says to ignore the rest beyond δ4.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (k), not divided by 2k.

Wait, then Im(f(0))=16.864/(0.25338) ≈66.556 fm. Still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are on the order of 177 fm, which is about 5 times larger.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me recheck the formula.

The correct formula is Im(f) = [1/(2k)] * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I've been treating them as degrees.

Wait, if I compute each 2δ_l in radians, then compute sin(2δ_l):

Wait, for each l:

l=0: 2delta=180 degrees → pi radians → sin(pi)=0.

l=1:2delta=134 degrees → 2.340 radians→ sin≈0.7193.

l=2:2delta=110→1.91986 rad→sin≈0.9397.

l=3:60→1.047 rad→ sin≈0.8660.

l=4:26→0.4537 rad→ sin≈0.4384.

Same as before.

Wait, but perhaps the question is using a different definition, such as f multiplied by 2k.

Wait, f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (e^{2iδ}-1)(2l+1).

So, 2ik f(0)= sum (e^{2iδ}-1)(2l+1).

The imaginary part of 2ik f(0) is sum (2l+1) sin(2delta).

Which is 16.864.

So, Im(2ik f(0))=16.864.

If the question had asked for Im(2ik f(0)), the answer would be 16.864.

But again, the options are much larger.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the total cross-section.

The total cross-section sigma is given by sigma_total = 4π |f(0)|^2 (something), but no, the optical theorem says sigma_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0)).

Because the optical theorem states that sigma_total = 4π ∫ |f(θ)|² dΩ = (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

Wait, the exact formula is sigma_total = (4π/k) Im(f(0)).

So if Im(f(0))=33.278 fm,

sigma_total= (4π /k ) * Im(f(0)).

But k=0.25338 fm⁻¹,

so 4π/k =4pi /0.25338 fm⁻¹ → (approx 12.566 /0.25338 ) fm⁻¹ → approx 49.58 fm.

So sigma_total= 49.58 fm * Im(f(0)) = 49.58 * 33.278 ≈1651 fm².

But the options are in the hundreds of fm, not the thousands.

Wait, but the question is not about the cross-section. So perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Another approach: Let's compute the scattering amplitude for the given phase shifts.

Wait, another way to compute the imaginary part of f(0) is using partial waves.

Each partial wave contributes to the amplitude. The contribution from each l is (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1)/(2ik) .

The imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin(2delta_l)/(2k).

Summing over l gives Im(f(0)).

Which is what I did.

Hmm. So I think I'm confident in my calculation, but the answer doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are for the real part, not the imaginary part? No, the phase shifts are given, and from them, we compute the amplitude.

Wait, perhaps the question actually wants the real part, but it says imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given as real parts, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are for the real part, and the imaginary part is zero. But that's not the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are in units where k=1. But that would make the units inconsistent.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

That would change the calculation.

If the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ),

then Im(f(0)) = [1/k] sum (2l+1) sin(2delta_l).

Which would be 16.864 / 0.25338 → approx 66.556 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but option D is 251.271 fm. 66.556 is roughly a quarter of that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me compute k again.

p c=49.99739 MeV.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = p/(ħ) = (49.99739 MeV/c) / ( ħ )

But ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c → thus,

k = (49.99739 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV fm / c ) ) = (49.99739 / 197.33 ) fm⁻¹ → 0.25338 fm⁻¹.

So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question uses a different value for ħ c, like 197.33 MeV-fm instead of MeV fm.

No, same thing.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A)87163.4 fm

B)355.351 fm

C)177.675 fm

D)251.271 fm

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin(2delta_l)/(k) → which would be 16.864 /0.25338 ≈66.556 fm. But that's still not matching.

Wait, but option C is 177.675 fm, which is approximately twice that.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should have included all the phase shifts beyond l=4, but the question says to ignore them.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) ] P_l(cosθ).

But perhaps the sum is for all l, but the question says to include up to l=4.

Wait, but that's what I did.

Hmm. I'm not sure where the mistake is, but perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the value of the imaginary part multiplied by k, which would be (sum (2l+1) sin(2delta_l)) →16.864.

But looking at the options, 16.864 is not present. Option C is 177.675 fm.

Wait, 177.675 is approximately 16.864 * 10.53. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the sum without the (2l+1) factor.

In that case, Sum_i=2.9634, Im(f)=2.9634/(2k)=2.9634/(0.50676)≈5.847 fm.

Which is close to option C's 177.675 divided by 30.36, but that doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a non-relativistic approach for k?

In non-relativistic, k = p/(ħ).

But for non-relativistic, E≈pc²/(2m).

Wait, but E=50 MeV is much larger than the rest mass, so non-relativistic doesn't apply.

Wait, perhaps using non-relativistic formulas would give a different k.

But let's try.

In non-relativistic, p ≈ sqrt(2mE).

m is electron mass, 0.511 MeV/c².

So p= sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV/c² *50 MeV ) / c.

Compute inside sqrt: 2 *0.511 *50 =51.1 MeV²/c².

So p= sqrt(51.1) MeV/c = 7.15 MeV/c.

Then, k=p/ħ =7.15 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm) → 7.15 /197.33 ≈0.0362 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f)= sum_i/(2k) → sum_i=16.864, 2k=0.0724.

16.864/0.0724≈232.9 fm.

Hmm, close to option D, 251.271. But not exactly.

Wait, perhaps using non-relativistic approach, Im(f)=232.9 fm.

But why would the question use non-relativistic when E=50 MeV is relativistic.

Hmm. But the option D is 251.271, which is close to 233.

But why would I get 233 with non-relativistic and 33 with relativistic.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is relativistic, but I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, another idea: The question asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which would be θ=0°, but perhaps the correct formula is f(π), since the beam is along the initial direction, but the scattering angle is measured from the target.

Wait, no, in scattering, θ=0 is the direction of the incident beam.

Wait, perhaps the formula for f(π) is used instead, as in the backward scattering.

Wait, but the question says along the incident beam direction, which is θ=0, not θ=π.

So, I think I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the correct answer should be around 33.28 fm, but none of the options match. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different definition of the scattering amplitude, such as f multiplied by k.

If Im(f(0))=33.28 fm,

then k Im(f(0))=0.25338 fm⁻¹ *33.28 fm =8.435.

Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the value of (2l+1) * Im(f(0)) summed over l, which would be sum_i=16.864, but that's not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) (2l+1) P_l(cosθ).

In that case, Im(f(0))= [1/k ] sum_i=16.864 / 0.25338 ≈66.556 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, but none of the options match this. The closest is option C, 177.675, which is about 2.67 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing each (2l+1) * sin(2delta_l) term.

Let me recompute the sum.

l=0:0 → 0

l=1:3 * sin(134) →3 *0.7193=2.1579

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456

Sum: 2.1579+4.6985=6.8564; +6.062=12.9184; +3.9456=16.864.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the question has a typo, or I misunderstood the question.

But given the options, the only possible way I can get one of them is if I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps k is computed as k = E / ħ c, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, E=50 MeV.

k=E/ħ c → 50 /197.33 →≈0.2533 fm⁻¹.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different, and I should include a factor of 2pi somewhere.

But I can't think of where.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin(2delta_l)/(k) →16.864 /0.25338≈66.556.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for ħ c, such as 197.33 MeV fm⁻¹.

No, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I'm treating them in degrees, leading to incorrect sin values.

Wait, let me compute the sum_i again, assuming delta_l are in radians.

Wait, if delta_0=90 degrees, that's pi/2 radians.

Then, 2delta_0=pi radians. So sin(pi)=0.

But wait, if all phase shifts are in radians, then:

delta_0=pi/2, 2delta=pi → sin(pi)=0.

delta_1=67 radians? That can't be right. 67 radians is about 3836 degrees, which is impossible as a phase shift.

So that's not possible.

Thus, I think my initial approach is correct, but I can't reconcile the answer with the options.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option D) 251.271 fm, which is approximately 2pi times the sum_i/(2k).

Wait, 16.864 * 2π ≈105.8, but 105.8/0.50676 ≈208.8 fm, which is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply the sum_i by 2pi.

But that doesn't seem right.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the calculation leads to 16.864/(2k)=33.28 fm, but none of the options match, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

But given the options, and considering that when I used the non-relativistic approach I got approximately 233 fm, which is close to option D (251.271), perhaps the intended answer is D.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, the closest is C) 177.675.

But I'm not sure. Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is using the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by (2l+1) and then multiplied by (1/k).

So, sum (2l+1) delta_l (in radians), then multiply by 1/k.

Wait, let's try that.

Compute sum (2l+1) * delta_l (in radians).

l=0: (1) * (pi/2)=1.5708

l=1:3 * (67*pi/180)=3*(1.16937)=3.5081

l=2:5*(55*pi/180)=5*(0.95993)=4.7997

l=3:7*(30*pi/180)=7*(0.523599)=3.6652

l=4:9*(13*pi/180)=9*(0.22689)=2.0420

Sum=1.5708+3.5081=5.0789; +4.7997=9.8786; +3.6652=13.5438; +2.0420=15.5858.

So sum=15.5858 radians.

Then, Im(f)= sum_delta * (1/k) →15.5858 /0.25338≈61.47 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but 61.47 is not an option either.

Hmm. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D) 251.271 fm, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option C)177.675 fm.

But I'm really not sure. Based on the detailed calculation, the correct Im(f(0)) should be around 33.28 fm, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately twice the value I calculated. But I don't see where a factor of 2 would come from.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts are given as \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and higher \( l \)-values are ignored. The scattering amplitude is expressed as:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (e^{2i\delta_l} - 1)(2l+1)P_l(1),
\]

where \( P_l(1) = 1 \) for all \( l \). The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shift Contributions**: For each \( l \), the term \( \sin(2\delta_l) \) is calculated. The results are:
   - \( l=0 \): \( \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \).

2. **Weighted Sum**: Each \( \sin(2\delta_l) \) is multiplied by \( (2l+1) \), and the results are summed:
   - \( l=0 \): \( 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \),
   - \( l=1 \): \( 3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579 \),
   - \( l=2 \): \( 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \),
   - \( l=3 \): \( 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \),
   - \( l=4 \): \( 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

   Total sum: \( 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.864 \).

3. **Wave Number \( k \)**: Using \( k = \frac{p}{\hbar} \), where \( p = \frac{pc}{\hbar c} \) and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV fm} \), the momentum \( pc \) is calculated as \( \sqrt{E^2 - (mc^2)^2} \approx 49.99739 \, \text{MeV} \). Thus:
   \[
   k = \frac{49.99739}{197.33} \approx 0.25338 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
   \]

4. **Imaginary Part**: Substituting into \( \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{\text{sum}}{2k} \):
   \[
   \text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 0.25338} \approx \frac{16.864}{0.50676} \approx 33.28 \, \text{fm}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
The calculated value of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 33.28 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest match to the reasoning and calculations is **Option C: 177.675 fm**, which is approximately 5.33 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy may arise from a misinterpretation of the problem or an error in the provided options.
