Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. And we're told that the photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. That probably means we can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Oh right, where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference between the two levels is given as ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. The question states that in star_1, the excitation is twice as high, so I think that means the ratio of the excited state to the lower state (n_i/n_j) is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Wait no, actually star_1's level is twice as excited. So maybe n1_i/n1_j = 2 and n2_i/n2_j = 1, or perhaps it's the other way? Hmm. Let me read the question again.

Oh yeah, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So for the same energy levels, the population in the excited state (n_i) is higher in star_1. So n1_i/n1_j = 2, and n2_i/n2_j = 1, perhaps? Or maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Wait, no, the problem says they're in LTE, so each star's photosphere satisfies LTE independently.

So the ratio of the populations for each star is determined by their own temperatures.

So for each star, n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

But wait, the problem says "twice as excited", so perhaps the ratio is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Or does it mean that star_1's ratio is twice star_2's? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level as compared to star_2. So, for the same energy level, the number in that level is twice as much? Or perhaps the excitation is in a higher level.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to model it as the ratio of the excitation (i.e., the number in the excited state compared to the ground state) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1: n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j).

But wait, maybe not. Let me think again. When they say the excitation is twice as high, perhaps it means that the population in the excited state is twice as much. So for star_1, n1_i = 2 * n2_i. Or maybe the ratio between the excited and lower states is twice. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. That is, (n1_i/n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j). Or maybe it's that the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1. So star_1's excitation is higher, so more atoms are in the higher state.

Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the specific level's population is twice as high in star_1. So for the same transition, the number in the higher level is higher. So n1_i = 2 * n2_i? Or maybe the ratio is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio (n_i/n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1_i/n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j). I think that's more likely, because the excitation is relative to each other.

Wait, but the problem says "twice as excited", which might mean that in star_1, the fraction in the excited state relative to the lower state is higher. So for star_1, n_i/n_j is higher than for star_2 by a factor of 2. So for example, if star_2 has a ratio of 1 (equal populations), then star_1 would have a ratio of 2.

But wait, maybe each star's ratio is determined by their own temperature. So for star_1, (n1_i/n1_j) = 2, and for star_2, (n2_i/n2_j) = 1? No, because if so, that would imply star_1 is hotter than star_2. But let's see.

Wait, no, perhaps the question is that in star_1, the excitation (the ratio) is twice as much as in star_2. So if star_2's ratio is R, then star_1's is 2R.

So let's set this up. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2.

According to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2.

And each ratio is given by R = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars, because it's the same transition in the same element (iron).

So R1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Since R1 = 2 R2, substituting:

(g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The (g_i/g_j) terms cancel out, so:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ):

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Which can be rewritten as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, let's write that equation.

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2)

But wait, 1/T2 -1/T1 = -(1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So:

ΔE/(k) [ -(1/T1 - 1/T2) ] = ln(2)

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) = - ln(2)

Wait, but wait a second, perhaps it's better to rearrange the equation as follows.

Starting from:

exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take ln of both sides:

(ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Let me factor the equation:

(ΔE/k) [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] = ln(2)

But let's write 1/T2 -1/T1 as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So substituting:

ΔE/k * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, or is it 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me compute:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, because when you find a common denominator T1 T2, it's T1 - T2 over T1 T2.

So putting that into the equation:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the question asks for the equation that relates T1 and T2.

So from the above, rearranged:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But looking at the options, none of them directly have ΔE or k. So perhaps I need to express ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, but wait. The given options don't include ΔE, which is 1.38e-23 J. So this suggests that we can eliminate ΔE from the equation, perhaps by considering the ratio of the equations.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to look for an equation that matches the structure of the one we have.

Wait, let me express the equation again.

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But perhaps we can rearrange it to make it in terms of ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly have this structure. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me double-check.

We have R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1))

R2 = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

So R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Set R1/R2 = 2.

So:

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

ΔE/(k) * [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So that becomes:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, the options don't include any terms with ΔE or k, so perhaps I need to look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the ratio of the Boltzmann factors.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the ratio (T1/T2) somehow.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's denote x = T1 and y = T2.

The equation we have is:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/y - 1/x) ) = (ΔE/(k)) (x - y)/(x y )

But I don't see this form in the options given. Hmm.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which would be ln(2) = (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

But according to our equation, ln(2) equals (ΔE/(k)) times that quantity.

So unless ΔE/(k) is 1, this wouldn't hold.

Wait, what's the value of ΔE/(k)?

ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K ) ) = 1 K.

Ah! So in that case, the equation becomes ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, that's option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct equation is option D.

The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and lower energy states, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their statistical weights, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions into this ratio:

\[
\frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Canceling \(\frac{g_i}{g_j}\) from both sides:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \(\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)\):

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Substituting \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we find:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D: 

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
