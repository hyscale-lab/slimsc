Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the kinetic energy of particles after a pion decays. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that a pion Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a muon mu(+) and a neutrino nu. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D, each with two numbers, presumably the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have almost zero mass, right? Or do they? Oh wait, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are considered to have nearly zero mass, but in reality, they do have some mass. But for this problem, I think I can treat the neutrino as massless because the problem doesn't give its mass. So, assuming the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, which is a common approximation in these kinds of problems.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the total momentum must still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c². Since the pion is stationary, its kinetic energy is zero, so its total energy is just 139.6 MeV.

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just its momentum times c (E = pc for neutrino). The muon has rest mass, so its energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ).

So, let me set up the equations. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, so the neutrino's momentum is -p (since they're oppositely directed). So their magnitudes are the same.

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu. E_mu is sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? Wait, no, E is in units of MeV, so perhaps I'm mixing units. Wait, let me think again. The energy is in MeV, and masses are given in MeV/c². So E = gamma m c², and for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). But since m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV, and p is in MeV/c units, perhaps I can work in units where c=1 for simplicity. So, let's set c=1 to make the equations simpler. So then, m_mu is 105.7 MeV, m_pi is 139.6 MeV.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p. Because for the neutrino, E_nu = p (since m_nu is 0). And the total energy must equal the pion's rest energy: m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So, the equation is sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, I need to solve for p. Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p².

So, p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 p.

Let me compute the squares. Let me calculate 105.7 squared: approximately, 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross term is 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49. Similarly, 139.6^2: Let me compute that. 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So plugging in:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * p.

Rearranging:

2 * 139.6 * p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
= 8315.67.

So,

2 *139.6 * p = 8315.67.

Compute 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So, p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me calculate that. 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 279.2 * 29.75 = ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do this division:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

Hmm, 279.2 *30=8376. So 8315.67 is 8376 - 60.33. So 29. So 279.2 *29 = 279.2*(30-1) =8376 -279.2 =8096.8.

But 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

So, 218.87 divided by 279.2 is approximately 0.783. So p is approximately 29.783.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

279.2 × 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So p ≈ 29.782.

So p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, that seems high, but okay.

Now, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p =29.78 MeV. Since it's a neutrino, its kinetic energy is the same as its energy because its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu = 29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(886.7 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.19) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and 109.81 + 29.78 ≈ 139.59, which is about 139.6, so that checks out.

So the muon's total energy is 109.81 MeV. Its rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.11 MeV (muon) and 29.78 MeV (neutrino).

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I calculated.

Option B's KE values are 7.2 and 32.8, which are quite a bit higher, so probably not. Option C is 3.52 and 20.8, which are lower. Option A is 2.84 and 26.8, which don't match.

So the correct answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino after the decay of a stationary pion (\(\pi^+\)), we use the principles of energy and momentum conservation. The pion's rest mass is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\), and the muon's rest mass is \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino is treated as massless.

### Key Equations and Setup:
1. **Total Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy (\(E_\mu\)) and the neutrino's energy (\(E_\nu\)):  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_\mu + E_\nu.
   \]

2. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   The muon's energy is given by:  
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2},
   \]  
   where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and \(m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).

3. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p.
   \]

4. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The pion is stationary, so the total momentum after decay is zero. This means the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_\mu = p_\nu = p.
   \]

### Solving for Momentum (\(p\)):
Substituting into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} + p = 139.6.
\]  
Let \(m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]  
Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 11172.49} = 139.6 - p,
\]  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = (139.6 - p)^2 = 19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2.
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 \cdot p.
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
279.2 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]  
Solve for \(p\):  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   The neutrino's energy is:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  

2. **Muon Energy**:  
   The muon's energy is:  
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx \sqrt{886.7 + 11172.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  

3. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_\mu = E_\mu - m_\mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the kinetic energy of particles after a pion decays. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that a pion Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a muon mu(+) and a neutrino nu. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D, each with two numbers, presumably the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have almost zero mass, right? Or do they? Oh wait, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are considered to have nearly zero mass, but in reality, they do have some mass. But for this problem, I think I can treat the neutrino as massless because the problem doesn't give its mass. So, assuming the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, which is a common approximation in these kinds of problems.

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the total momentum must still be zero because momentum is conserved. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That makes sense.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi c². Since the pion is stationary, its kinetic energy is zero, so its total energy is just 139.6 MeV.

After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just its momentum times c (E = pc for neutrino). The muon has rest mass, so its energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ).

So, let me set up the equations. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, so the neutrino's momentum is -p (since they're oppositely directed). So their magnitudes are the same.

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu. E_mu is sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? Wait, no, E is in units of MeV, so perhaps I'm mixing units. Wait, let me think again. The energy is in MeV, and masses are given in MeV/c². So E = gamma m c², and for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). But since m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV, and p is in MeV/c units, perhaps I can work in units where c=1 for simplicity. So, let's set c=1 to make the equations simpler. So then, m_mu is 105.7 MeV, m_pi is 139.6 MeV.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p. Because for the neutrino, E_nu = p (since m_nu is 0). And the total energy must equal the pion's rest energy: m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

So, the equation is sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, I need to solve for p. Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p².

So, p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 p.

Let me compute the squares. Let me calculate 105.7 squared: approximately, 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross term is 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49. Similarly, 139.6^2: Let me compute that. 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So plugging in:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * p.

Rearranging:

2 * 139.6 * p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's subtract:

19488.16
-11172.49
= 8315.67.

So,

2 *139.6 * p = 8315.67.

Compute 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So, p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me calculate that. 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 279.2 * 29.75 = ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do this division:

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

Hmm, 279.2 *30=8376. So 8315.67 is 8376 - 60.33. So 29. So 279.2 *29 = 279.2*(30-1) =8376 -279.2 =8096.8.

But 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

So, 218.87 divided by 279.2 is approximately 0.783. So p is approximately 29.783.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

279.2 × 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So p ≈ 29.782.

So p is approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, that seems high, but okay.

Now, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p =29.78 MeV. Since it's a neutrino, its kinetic energy is the same as its energy because its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu = 29.78 MeV.

The muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(886.7 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.19) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and 109.81 + 29.78 ≈ 139.59, which is about 139.6, so that checks out.

So the muon's total energy is 109.81 MeV. Its rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.11 MeV (muon) and 29.78 MeV (neutrino).

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I calculated.

Option B's KE values are 7.2 and 32.8, which are quite a bit higher, so probably not. Option C is 3.52 and 20.8, which are lower. Option A is 2.84 and 26.8, which don't match.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino after the decay of a stationary pion (\(\pi^+\)), we use the principles of energy and momentum conservation. The pion's rest mass is \(139.6 \, \text{MeV}\), and the muon's rest mass is \(105.7 \, \text{MeV}\). The neutrino is treated as massless.

### Key Equations and Setup:
1. **Total Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the muon's energy (\(E_\mu\)) and the neutrino's energy (\(E_\nu\)):  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_\mu + E_\nu.
   \]

2. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   The muon's energy is given by:  
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2},
   \]  
   where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum, and \(m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\).

3. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p.
   \]

4. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The pion is stationary, so the total momentum after decay is zero. This means the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_\mu = p_\nu = p.
   \]

### Solving for Momentum (\(p\)):
Substituting into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} + p = 139.6.
\]  
Let \(m_\mu = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\):  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]  
Rearranging and squaring both sides:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 11172.49} = 139.6 - p,
\]  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = (139.6 - p)^2 = 19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2.
\]  
Simplify:  
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 \cdot p.
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
279.2 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]  
Solve for \(p\):  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   The neutrino's energy is:  
   \[
   E_\nu = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  

2. **Muon Energy**:  
   The muon's energy is:  
   \[
   E_\mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_\mu^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} \approx \sqrt{886.7 + 11172.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  

3. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   KE_\mu = E_\mu - m_\mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**

Answer: D
