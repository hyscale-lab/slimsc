Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let me read the question again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving in the positive x-direction at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So the first part is about relative velocity, right? Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, I can't use the classical velocity addition formula. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition comes into play here. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is a bit tricky. I remember that the relative velocity between two objects moving at u and v is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, which direction are they moving in? Both are moving in the positive x-direction, so u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. So u is the velocity of the first astronaut as seen from the second's frame, or vice versa? Wait, no. Let me get that right.

Wait, the relative velocity formula depends on which frame you're calculating from. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, the relative speed of A as seen by B would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute that.

So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. So looking at the options, that would be either option C or D.

Wait, but I should be precise. Let me compute 0.1 / 0.7 exactly. 0.1 / 0.7 is 1/7 ≈ 0.142857 c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

Now for the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Let's compute gamma for each.

Gamma for astronaut 1: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the energy is gamma * mass * c squared. So E1 = gamma * m_i c². So for astronaut 1, mass 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c²?

Wait, wait, no. Let me check: the formula is E = gamma * m c². So if the mass is 2m, it's E = gamma * (2m) c². So yeah, 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2, mass 3m, moving at 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) → 1/sqrt(0.75) → approximately 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 m c². So the total energy would be about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D says E=5 mc², which is lower. So option C matches.

Wait, but wait—another thing. I'm assuming that the total energy is the sum of their individual energies. Is that correct? Because in relativity, the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame would be different, but the problem doesn't specify a particular frame. Oh, wait, the question says "the total energy of the system." In the lab frame, each astronaut is moving, so their energies are as calculated. So the total energy is indeed E1 + E2.

So putting it together: relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option should be C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut:
- Mass = \( 2m \)
- Speed = \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy: \( E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2 \)

#### Energy of the second astronaut:
- Mass = \( 3m \)
- Speed = \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy: \( E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

Thus, the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \).

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( 0.14c \).
- The total energy of the system is \( 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
