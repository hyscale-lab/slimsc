Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change, right?

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ reacting with OH- to form water. Oh right, and for strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy change is around -57 kJ/mol, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid but since it's diprotic, I need to consider both H+ ions.

First, I think I should figure out how many moles of H+ and OH- are present from each solution.

Let's start with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. So moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So HCl gives 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4. It's a strong acid and it's diprotic, so each mole releases 2 H+. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each contributes 2 H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2. This is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each contributes 2 OH-, so that's 0.2 moles of OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ reacts with OH-. So the limiting reagent here is the OH- because 0.2 < 0.28. So all the OH- will react, and some H+ will be left over.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases about -57 kJ (or sometimes it's given as -57.3 kJ, but I'll stick with -57 for now).

So the total moles of H+ reacting with OH- are 0.2 moles. So the enthalpy change should be 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Oh, I know that 1 cal is about 4.184 J, so 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. Wait, let me think: 1 calorie is 4.184 joules, so 1 kcal is 4184 J, which is 4.184 kJ. So to convert kJ to kcal, I divide by 4.184.

So -11.4 kJ is how much in kcal? Let me calculate: 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.726. So about -2.726 kcal. Wait, but wait! Oh no, wait. I think I might have gotten the conversion wrong. Because 1 kJ is 1000 J, and 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal (since 1/4.184 ≈ 0.239). So to convert kJ to kcal, multiply by 0.239.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If I have X kJ, how much is that in kcal? Since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, then 1 kJ is 1/4.184 kcal. So, X kJ = X / 4.184 kcal.

So -11.4 kJ is -11.4 /4.184 ≈ -2.72 kcal. Oh, that's about option A. But wait, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh wait, no, option B is -11.42 kJ? No, looking back, option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmm.

Wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization. But wait, wait. The neutralization reaction's enthalpy is given per mole of H+ reacting. So in this case, we have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. So the total enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. So in kcal, that's -11.4 /4.184 ≈ -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A. But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as -11.4 kJ in kcal. Hmm, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the concentrations and the total volume, but no, the question is about the enthalpy change. Wait, perhaps the question is expecting the answer in kJ but one of the options is in kJ. Wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me recheck.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. H+ from HCl is 0.1.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, that's 0.18.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So limiting is OH-.

So 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with OH-.

So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when it's a strong acid, both H+ ions are released. So that's correct.

But wait, wait. H2SO4 in dilute solution behaves as a diprotic acid. So yes, 2 H+ per molecule.

So the calculation seems correct.

But now, looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. That's close to -11.4 kJ because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. Oh wait, no. Wait, wait:

Wait, 1 kJ is 1000 J. 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 1 kJ ≈ 0.239 kcal.

So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.71 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So that would be option A.

But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole is given as -57.3 kcal/mol. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, I think I might have confused units. Let me think again. Wait, I know that the enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But sometimes it's given in kcal. So 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal: 57,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.62 kcal. So 57 kJ is about 13.62 kcal. So the neutralization enthalpy is -13.62 kcal per mole.

Wait, wait, but no. I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ/mol (or sometimes approximated as -57 kJ/mol). So if you have 1 mole of H+ reacting with 1 mole of OH- to form 1 mole of H2O, the enthalpy change is -57.3 kJ (exothermic).

So in this problem, we have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. So total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Converting that to kcal: -11.46 kJ * (1 kcal /4.184 kJ) ≈ -2.736 kcal, which is approximately -2.74 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close. So that's probably the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but option B is in kcal. Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So if I computed -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal, that's approximately option A.

But let me think again. Did I calculate the moles correctly?

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the H+ used is 0.2 mol, leaving 0.08 mol H+.

So the neutralization is 0.2 mol. So enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. So that's about -11.5 kJ, which in kcal is about -2.74 kcal.

Looking back, the options are A) -2.72 kcal and B) -11.42 kcal. Wait, so if I compute -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. Oh wait, option B is -11.42 kcal. But 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kJ. Let me check the options again. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than our calculation. So no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me re-calculate.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol.

So yes, 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent, so 0.2 mol of H+ reacts.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So that's approximately 11.46 kJ, which is about 2.73 kcal (since 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.73).

So the correct answer is approximately -2.73 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So that's the answer.

Wait, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? Maybe because someone might have thought to multiply 0.28 moles by 57 kcal/mol. Wait, 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. So 0.28 * 13.6 kcal ≈ 3.808 kcal. But that's not the case here because only 0.2 moles react.

Alternatively, perhaps someone forgot to convert kJ to kcal, so they thought the answer is -11.42 kJ, but option B is in kcal. Hmm, but that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact value. Let's compute 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46. So 11.46 kJ. To convert to kcal: 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal. The option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So option A is the correct answer.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing the given solutions, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions contributed by each solution:

1. **HCl (500 mL, 0.2 M):**  
   HCl is a strong acid, so each mole contributes 1 H⁺ ion.  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **H₂SO₄ (300 mL, 0.3 M):**  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic strong acid, so each mole contributes 2 H⁺ ions.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (200 mL, 0.5 M):**  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so each mole contributes 2 OH⁻ ions.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

Next, we identify the limiting reagent. The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \), so 1 mole of H⁺ reacts with 1 mole of OH⁻.  
- Total H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
- Total OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  

Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacts. The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). Thus, the total enthalpy change is:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

To convert this to kcal, we use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \):  
\[
\Delta H = -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 = -2.736 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Among the options provided, the closest value is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

**Critical Analysis of Options:**  
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value of \( -2.736 \, \text{kcal} \).  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as this would imply the answer is in kJ without proper conversion.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, likely derived from an error in calculating moles or the enthalpy constant.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.
