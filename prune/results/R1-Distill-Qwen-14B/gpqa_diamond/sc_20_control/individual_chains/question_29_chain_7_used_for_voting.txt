Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The compound is bad for food use, so they want to get rid of it. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, and looked at the target gene in mutants. The changes are in the first exon area.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound. So, probably, they want a mutation that disrupts the gene function, making the protein not work, or not produce the compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. I need to look at the sequences.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

So comparing, the intact and mutant 1. Let me see where the changes are.

Intact: The first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...
Mutant 1: ATG T T C T ACG C TGGTACT...

Wait, maybe I should write each line and compare.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the beginning:

Intact: ATG T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G... 

Mutant 1: ATG T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G...

Wait, so the first part: the third T and fourth C in the intact are replaced. Let me count the letters:

Intact: positions 4-8: TTTCT
Mutant 1: positions 4-8: TTCTA?

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for where the sequences differ.

Looking at the start:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TT CT ACG C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, the third codon in the intact is TTT (which is Phe), and in mutant 1, it's TTC (which is also Phe). Wait, no, let me count the letters.

Wait, the full sequences:

Intact: ATG (start), then TTT (positions 4-6), then CTC (7-9), GCT (10-12), GGT (13-15), ACT (16-18), TCT (19-21), GTG (22-24), GAT (25-27), GAA (28-30), etc.

Mutant 1: ATG, then T T C (positions 4-6?), wait, the initial part is ATGTTCTACGCT...

Wait, let me write each line.

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So the first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, the first three nucleotides after ATG are TTT in intact, TTC in mutant 1. So that's a change from TTT to TTC. TTT is phenylalanine, TTC is also phenylalanine. So that's a silent mutation; the amino acid doesn't change.

Then, next codon in intact is CTC (which is leucine), and in mutant 1 it's TAC. TAC is tyrosine. So that's a change from Leu to Tyr. That's a missense mutation. But that's in the middle of the exon, so it's in the coding region.

Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So the start is ATG TTC TA A... Wait, let me see:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant 2: ...TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCT...

So after the initial ATG, the next part:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 2: TTC TA A GCT GGT ACT...

So in the first codon, TTT becomes TTC (same amino acid, Phe). Then CTC becomes TAA. CTC is Leu, TAA is stop. Oh, that's a big change. So after the initial ATG, the next codons in mutant 2 are TTC (Phe), then TAA (stop). So the reading frame would stop early, leading to a truncated protein. But is that in the middle of an exon? Well, exons are the coding regions, so a stop codon in the exon would lead to a nonfunctional protein if it's in the middle.

Wait, but the first exon is the beginning. So a stop codon in the first exon would cause the protein to be much shorter. But would that eliminate the anti-nutritional compound? Well, if the compound is synthesized by the protein, then a nonfunctional or shorter protein might not produce it. So this could be a candidate.

Mutant 3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So comparing:

Intact: ...ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 3: ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA... Hmm, looking at the beginning:

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Wait, let me see:

The initial part of mutant 3 is ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT...

Wait, intact is TTT CTC GCT GGT...

Mutant 3 is TTT TAC GCT GGT...

Wait, the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), and in mutant 3 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's another missense mutation. Then the next codon in intact is GCT G (Leu), but in mutant 3 it's GCT G (same?), no wait:

Wait, in intact, after CTC (Leu) is GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly). In mutant 3, after TAC (Tyr) is GCT (Ala), same as before? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write the beginning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

So the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), mutant 3 is TAC (Tyr). So after that, intact is GCT (Ala), mutant 3 is GCT (Ala) as well. Then in intact, it's GGT (Gly), and in mutant 3, it's GTC (Val). So two changes here: Leu to Tyr, and Gly to Val. So that's two missense mutations.

Does that affect the function? Maybe, but not necessarily a complete loss.

Mutant 4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the beginning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So after the initial ATG and TTT, intact has CTC (Leu), mutant4 has TAC (Tyr). Then intact has GCT GGT (Ala Gly), mutant4 has GCT ACT (Ala Thr). So in the third codon, CTC changes to TAC (Leu to Tyr), and then GGT changes to ACT (Gly to Thr). So again, two missense mutations.

Wait, but looking at what's important: the effect on the gene product. The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, for that, the protein's function must be disrupted.

Looking at the options:

Mutant 1: change in two codons, Leu to Tyr and maybe another. But both are missense; the protein is still made but possibly with altered function. Maybe not enough to eliminate the compound.

Mutant 2: has a stop codon early on. That would truncate the protein after two amino acids. So the protein would be nonfunctional. So the gene product wouldn't be made, so the anti-nutritional compound wouldn't be synthesized.

Mutant3: two missense changes—so the protein is altered but may still function. If the function is disrupted, then good, but it depends on where the changes are.

Mutant4: two missense changes as well.

So which one is more likely to eliminate the compound? The one where the protein is not made at all, or is severely truncated, so the compound isn't produced.

So Mutant2 has a stop codon after the second codon (TTC is Phe, then TAA is stop). So the protein would be Phe followed by nothing else—extremely truncated.

But wait, the gene structure is five exons and four introns. So the first exon is the beginning. The stop codon in the middle of the exon would cause the mRNA to be subject to nonsense-mediated decay, perhaps, or produce a nonfunctional protein.

But EMS mutagenesis can cause various mutations, including point mutations leading to stop codons or changes.

So which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound? Probably the one causing a premature stop codon (like Mutant2). Because if the gene isn't expressed properly, the compound isn't made.

Wait, but looking at the sequences again. In Mutant2, the second codon after ATG is TTC (Phe), then the next codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the mRNA would be translated into Phe and then stop. The protein would be very short, so the gene's function is abolished. So the anti-nutritional compound wouldn't be made.

But wait, the question says "eliminate," which suggests that the gene's product is not made. So in that case, Mutant2 would be the best option.

Looking at the options:

Option A is Mutant2.

So the correct answer is A) Mutant2.

Wait, but let me think again. The anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene product. So if the gene is nonfunctional, the compound isn't made.

Yes, so Mutant2 would be the best choice.

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene responsible for synthesizing the compound. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, preventing the production of the anti-nutritional compound.

### Intact Gene Sequence:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

### Mutant Analysis:
1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - TTT → TTC (Phe to Phe, silent mutation).
     - CTC → TAC (Leu to Tyr, missense mutation).
   - Effect: The protein is altered, but the gene likely remains functional. This mutation is unlikely to completely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - TTT → TTC (Phe to Phe, silent mutation).
     - CTC → TAA (Leu to stop codon, premature termination).
   - Effect: The introduction of a stop codon (TAA) after the second codon results in a severely truncated protein. This likely renders the gene nonfunctional, preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - CTC → TAC (Leu to Tyr, missense mutation).
     - GGT → GTC (Gly to Val, missense mutation).
   - Effect: Two missense mutations occur, altering the protein structure. However, the gene likely remains functional, and the anti-nutritional compound may still be produced.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - CTC → TAC (Leu to Tyr, missense mutation).
     - GGT → ACT (Gly to Thr, missense mutation).
   - Effect: Similar to Mutant 3, two missense mutations occur. The gene likely remains functional, and the anti-nutritional compound may still be produced.

### Conclusion:
The most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon (TAA), resulting in a nonfunctional protein. This ensures that the anti-nutritional compound is not synthesized.

**Answer: A**
