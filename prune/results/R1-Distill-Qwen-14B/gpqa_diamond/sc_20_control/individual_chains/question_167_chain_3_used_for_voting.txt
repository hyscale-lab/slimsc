Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. Oh right, alpha is the amplitude, phi the phase, and N should make sure the state is normalized, so N squared is the sum of the squares of the coefficients. Wait, the formula for N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)). That makes sense because when you expand |psi> squared, you get terms cos^2, sin^2, and a cross term which involves cos(phi)sin(phi) * something. The cross term is the interference part, I think.

The problem asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. The options are A to D, with D being zero. Wait, why would it be zero? Well, Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. A Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian. But wait, under what conditions would the non-Gaussianity be zero? That would mean it's a Gaussian state. So maybe if the state can be expressed as a Gaussian state, then nG would be zero.

Wait, let's plug in phi = -pi/4. Let's compute sin(2phi) because that's part of N. 2phi would be -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1. Then, exp(-2 alpha^2) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.25))= exp(-0.5)≈0.6065. So sin(2phi)*exp(-2 alpha^2) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + (-0.6065). So 1 -0.6065 is 0.3935. Thus, N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. So the normalized state is [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

Wait, phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4) which is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071. Similarly, sin(phi) is sin(-pi/4) which is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.7071.

So putting it all together, |psi> is approximately [0.7071 |0.5> -0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, but wait, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. When you take their superpositions, and if the coefficients are real, like here (since cos and sin are real for phi = -pi/4), then the state may be equivalent to a squeezed state. Because the superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases is a squeezed state, which is a Gaussian state. Oh! So if the state is a squeezed state, then its non-Gaussianity would be zero because Gaussian states have zero non-Gaussianity.

Wait, but wait, the relative entropy is between the state's density matrix and a reference Gaussian state. If the state itself is Gaussian, then their relative entropy would be zero, meaning non-Gaussianity is zero. So if the given state is a Gaussian state, the nG would be zero. So let me think about whether this state is Gaussian.

Schrödinger cat states are typically non-Gaussian, but wait, maybe under certain conditions. For a superposition of two coherent states, if the coefficients are real and symmetric, it's a squeezed state. Because a squeezed state can be written as (|alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha>)/sqrt(2}, but perhaps when the phase is such that the coefficients are real, like here with phi = -pi/4, which makes cos(phi) and sin(phi) real and opposite in sign. So in that case, the state becomes (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/sqrt(2), but normalized.

Wait, but the normalization factor N isn't exactly sqrt(2) because when we calculate N^2, we have 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha^2). Let's compute that with phi=-pi/4.

As before, sin(2phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N^2 = 1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5). Approximately, 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935, so N ≈0.6275.

So the state is (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) / 0.6275. Now, wait, is this a Gaussian state? Because a squeezed state is a Gaussian state. So perhaps when the state becomes a squeezed state, then the non-Gaussianity is zero.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the structure. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian. A superposition of two coherent states can be non-Gaussian, but under certain conditions, like when the coefficients form a real symmetric superposition, it becomes a squeezed state, which is Gaussian.

Wait, another approach: A squeezed state can be written as alpha = r e^{i theta}, and the squeezing parameter is usually applied in such a way that the state is a combination of |alpha> and |beta>, where beta is -Re(alpha) if it's a single-mode squeezed state. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Alternatively, I remember that a two-mode squeezed state is different, but a single-mode squeezed state can be written as a superposition of coherent states with a specific phase relationship.

Wait, considering that the state is |psi> = (e^{i theta} |alpha> + e^{-i theta} |-alpha> ) / N, perhaps it's a squeezed state. Wait, when phi is such that the coefficients have a certain phase relationship. In our case, phi is -pi/4. So, the coefficients are cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi)= -sqrt(2)/2. So the state is (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha> ) / N.

Wait, but for a squeezed state, the superposition is |alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha>, with theta such that the interference terms create a squeezed state. Alternatively, maybe it's a coherent displacement of a squeezed vacuum.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is not a squeezed state when the parameter N isn't 1/sqrt(2), which would be the case for a simple superposition of two equal amplitudes. But in our case, N is approximately 0.6275, which is less than 1/sqrt(2)≈0.707. So perhaps it's not a squeezed state, implying the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity would not be zero.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should compute the Wigner function or the density matrix and see if it's Gaussian. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to see if the state is Gaussian by looking at its moments.

But wait, another approach: the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (nG) is given by del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is a reference Gaussian state. For Gaussian states, the relative entropy would be zero because rho and tau would be the same, so their entropy differences would vanish. But for non-Gaussian states, this difference would be positive.

Wait, but in our case, if the state |psi> is Gaussian, then nG would be zero, which is option D. So if the state is Gaussian when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, then the answer is D.

But under what conditions is the state Gaussian? Because generally, a Schrödinger cat state is non-Gaussian. Unless, as I thought before, it's a case where the state reduces to a squeezed state.

Wait, let me think again. The state |alpha> is a coherent state, which is Gaussian. Taking a superposition of two coherent states, |alpha> and |-alpha>, with real coefficients, could result in a Gaussian state, like a squeezed state. So if the state is a squeezed state, then it’s Gaussian and nG is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps when phi is such that the cross term in N makes the state a squeezed state. Wait, let's think about when the state becomes a squeezed state. The squeezing parameter r can be found such that the state is (e^{i theta} |alpha> + e^{-i theta} |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2), which is a squeezed vacuum state when alpha is zero. But in our case, alpha is 0.5, so it's a coherent state superposition.

Wait, maybe when the state is written as (|alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha> ), and the coefficients are real, perhaps it's a squeezed state. Alternatively, perhaps when phi is chosen such that the superposition results in a squeezed state, the state is Gaussian.

But I'm a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the density matrix and see if it's Gaussian.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. For a squeezed state, the density matrix is Gaussian, so if the given state is a squeezed state, rho would be Gaussian, so tau would be rho, and del_b would be zero.

Wait, but under what conditions would |psi> be a squeezed state? Let me think about the form of a squeezed state. A squeezed state can be written as S(z) |0>, where S is the squeezing operator and z is the squeezing parameter. Alternatively, in a different parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a superposition of |alpha> and | - alpha> with equal coefficients, it's a squeezed state. So if phi is such that the coefficients are real and equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, then |psi> is a squeezed state.

Wait, let's compute the coefficients. For phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071, and sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.7071. So the coefficients are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So the state is (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071|-0.5> ) / N.

Hmm, that looks similar to a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. Now, if a state is a squeezed state, would it be written in such a way? Let me think about when alpha is zero. Then |psi> would be (cos(phi)|0> + sin(phi)|0> )/N, which would just be |0>, but that's a coherent state with alpha=0. Wait, no, if alpha=0, then |alpha> is |0>, so the state becomes (cos(phi)|0> + sin(phi)|0> )/N, which makes N = sqrt( cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) )=1. So the state is |0>, which is a coherent state, hence Gaussian. So when alpha is zero, the state is Gaussian. But when alpha is non-zero, perhaps it's not.

Wait, but in our problem, alpha is 0.5, which is non-zero. So I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the density matrix.

The state |psi> is ( |alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2 * 0.3935) ) because N is 0.6275, so 1/N is approximately 1.59.

Wait, so |psi> is (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) * 1.59. So let's compute the density matrix rho = |psi><psi|.

The density matrix of a coherent state |alpha> is Gaussian, but when you take a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix becomes non-Gaussian unless the superposition leads to a Gaussian state. So in this case, does the state become Gaussian?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Wigner function of this state. For a Gaussian state, the Wigner function is Gaussian. For a non-Gaussian state, it has higher-order correlations.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I can think about the second moments. For a Gaussian state, all higher-order moments can be expressed in terms of second moments. So if the state is Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

Alternatively, maybe for the given parameters, the state becomes a coherent state. But that would require phi=0 or phi=pi/2, I think.

Wait, another approach: the non-Gaussianity using relative entropy compares the state to a reference Gaussian state. If the given state is itself Gaussian, then the relative entropy would be zero, so nG=0.

So the question is, is the given state Gaussian when phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5?

If yes, then answer is D) 0.

If not, then nG is greater than zero.

So, is the state a Gaussian state?

Wait, I think that when the superposition is symmetric and with real coefficients, the state may be a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. Let me think again. A squeezed state can be written as a superposition of coherent states with opposite phases. For example, the squeezed vacuum state can be written as (|alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2). But in our case, the coefficients are real and negative, so e^{i theta} could be -1, making theta = pi.

So, perhaps our state is a squeezed vacuum state. Because the coefficients are real and symmetric, leading to a squeezed state.

Wait, but the squeezing parameter r would relate to the amplitude alpha. Alternatively, perhaps when the state is written as (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2), it's a squeezed state.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a squeezed coherent state. Because |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states displaced in phase space.

Wait, another way to think: a squeezed state in position space would be a Gaussian but displaced in such a way that the variance in one quadrature is squeezed.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should recall how a squeezed state is formed. The squeezing operator S(z) acts on the vacuum to produce a squeezed vacuum state. The general form is S(z) |0> = |z>, where z is a complex parameter. Alternatively, in terms of a and a†, z = r e^{i theta}, and the squeezing operator is exp( (e^{i theta} a^2 - e^{-i theta} (a†)^2 ) / 2 tanh r ), for r being the squeezing parameter.

But perhaps the state |psi> we're given isn't a squeezed state. Because the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), which for phi=-pi/4 are sqrt(2)/2 and -sqrt(2)/2, respectively. So the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with equal magnitude but opposite sign coefficients.

Wait, another thought: the state (|alpha> ± |-alpha> ) is a two-mode squeezed state? No, because it's a single-mode state.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cat state. Cat states are superpositions of coherent states and are non-Gaussian. But wait, I thought that certain cat states can be written as squeezed states, but maybe that's only under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps when the state is a coherent state itself, which would happen if the superposition leads to a displacement in phase space. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps if the cross term in N is zero, then the state would be a statistical mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>, each with probability 1/2. But in that case, the state is a classical mixture, which would be Gaussian because each component is Gaussian. But in our case, the cross term is not zero, because N is less than 1, so the state is a pure state, not a mixture.

Wait, let's compute N squared again. N^2 is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2). With phi=-pi/4, sin(2phi) is -1, and alpha=0.5. So exp(-2*(0.5)^2)=exp(-0.5)=0.6065. So N^2=1-0.6065=0.3935. So N is about 0.6275.

So the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, but a coherent state |alpha> can be written as e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum (alpha^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>. Similarly, |-alpha> is e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum ( (-alpha)^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>.

So the state |psi> becomes [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / N.

If I expand that, the state would be (e^{-|alpha|^2/2} [ sum (alpha^n |n> ) - sum ( (-alpha)^n |n> ) ] ) / N.

So for each n, the coefficient is e^{-|alpha|^2/2} (alpha^n - (-alpha)^n ) / N.

Which simplifies to e^{-|alpha|^2/2} [ 1 for n odd, 0 for n even ] * (alpha^n) / N.

So |psi> is a sum over odd n of ( e^{-|alpha|^2/2} alpha^n ) / N |n>.

This is a Fock state superposition, which is a highly non-Gaussian state because Fock states are orthogonal and their superpositions generally have non-Gaussian Wigner functions.

Wait, so if |psi> is a superposition of Fock states with only odd n, then it's a non-Gaussian state, right? Because coherent states are superpositions of all n, but here it's only the odd n's. So the state would be non-Gaussian, making the non-Gaussianity (nG) greater than zero.

But wait, when alpha is 0.5, which is small, perhaps the state can be approximated as a squeezed state. Because when alpha is small, the even and odd terms may not be as pronounced. Or perhaps not. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the density matrix. If the state is a superposition of two coherent states, then the density matrix would have terms that are diagonal (from |alpha><alpha| and |-alpha> < -alpha| ) and cross terms involving |alpha><-alpha| and vice versa. These cross terms would involve terms like |alpha><-alpha|, which have a Gaussian form but maybe lead to a Gaussian overall state? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state's density matrix has a certain structure that makes it Gaussian. For instance, the Wigner function of a Gaussian state is Gaussian in phase space, but for a non-Gaussian state, it's not.

Another approach: in the given state |psi>, with phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, N is about 0.6275. The state is (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) / 0.6275. Let me compute the expectation value of the number operator n. For a coherent state |alpha>, <n> is |alpha|^2. So for |0.5>, <n> is 0.25.

The state |psi> is a superposition, so <n> would be ( |0.5|^2 + |-0.5|^2 ) / N^2. Oh, wait, because the cross terms would involve expectation values like <alpha| -alpha> which is zero, because the coherent states are orthogonal except when alpha=beta.

Wait, wait, no. The inner product <alpha| -alpha> is e^{-|alpha|^2/2} e^{ - |alpha|^2 /2 } sum [ ( (-1)^n alpha^n )^* ( alpha^n ) ] / sqrt(n! )^2 ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute N. N^2 is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) = 1 + (-1) exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.3935. So N ≈0.6275.

The state |psi> is (|0.5> - |-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The density matrix of a Gaussian state is determined by its first and second moments. If the state is Gaussian, then all higher moments are determined by the first two. So perhaps I can check if the state's moments match those of a Gaussian state.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about whether the state is a squeezed state. Because a squeezed state is Gaussian. So perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state is a squeezed state, making it Gaussian, so nG is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is not a squeezed state when alpha is not zero. Wait, maybe when alpha is non-zero, the state is a displaced squeezed state, which is still Gaussian.

Wait, a displaced squeezed state is a Gaussian state. So if the state |psi> is a displaced squeezed state, then it's Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

But wait, is |psi> a displaced squeezed state? Let's think. A displaced squeezed state can be written as D(alpha) S(r) |0>, where D is the displacement operator and S is the squeezing operator. The resulting state is Gaussian.

In our case, |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so perhaps it's a different kind of state. Alternatively, perhaps for certain parameters, it becomes a displaced squeezed state.

Wait, let me think about when alpha is zero. Then, the state would be (cos(phi)|0> + sin(phi)|0> ) / N, which is just |0> if N is 1, which it would be because sin(0) is zero. So in that case, it's a coherent state, which is Gaussian. So when alpha is zero, the state is Gaussian, nG is zero.

But when alpha is 0.5, as in this problem, is the state Gaussian?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the given options. If the answer is D) 0, that would mean the state is Gaussian. But I thought that a cat state is non-Gaussian. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a squeezed state, hence Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity is zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (nG) is given by the del_b formula. If the state is Gaussian, then rho equals tau, so the entropy terms would cancel, and nG would be zero.

So perhaps when the state is Gaussian, the nG is zero. So if the parameters lead the state to be Gaussian, the answer is zero.

So, given phi =-pi/4, alpha=0.5, is the state Gaussian?

Hmm. I think the confusion arises because when phi is -pi/4, the state becomes a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with equal real coefficients. This kind of superposition can be a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again. A squeezed state is a Gaussian state, so if |psi> is a squeezed state, then nG=0.

So when does a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> become a squeezed state? Perhaps when the coefficients are real and symmetric, which they are here. So I think that in this case, the state is a squeezed state, hence Gaussian, so nG is zero. So the correct answer would be D) 0.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\). The relative entropy measure for nG is given by:

\[
\text{nG} = \text{del}_b = \text{trace}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{trace}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Normalization**:  
   The normalization constant \(N\) is computed as:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}.
   \]
   For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), we find:
   \[
   \sin(2\phi) = \sin(-\pi/2) = -1, \quad e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-2(0.5)^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   N^2 = 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935, \quad N \approx 0.6275.
   \]

2. **Structure of the State**:  
   Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(-\pi/4)|0.5\rangle + \sin(-\pi/4)|-0.5\rangle}{N}.
   \]
   Using \(\cos(-\pi/4) = \sin(-\pi/4) = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), the state simplifies to:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}|0.5\rangle - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}|-0.5\rangle}{0.6275}.
   \]

3. **Gaussianity of the State**:  
   A Gaussian state includes coherent states, squeezed states, and displaced squeezed states. A squeezed state can be written as a superposition of coherent states with opposite phases, such as:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{|\alpha\rangle - |- \alpha\rangle}{N}.
   \]
   For \(\phi = -\pi/4\), the coefficients of \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|- \alpha\rangle\) are real and symmetric, suggesting that the state is a squeezed state. Squeezed states are Gaussian, meaning their non-Gaussianity is zero.

4. **Non-Gaussianity (nG)**:  
   The relative entropy measure \(\text{nG}\) compares the given state \(\rho\) to a reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). If the state \(\rho\) is Gaussian, \(\text{nG} = 0\). Since the given state is a squeezed state (a Gaussian state), the non-Gaussianity is zero.

### Conclusion:
The state is Gaussian for \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), so the non-Gaussianity is zero.

**Answer: D**
