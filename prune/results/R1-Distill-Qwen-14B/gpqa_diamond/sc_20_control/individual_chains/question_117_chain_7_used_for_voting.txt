Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... that's when compounds have different configurations that make them non-superimposable mirror images, right? So they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. Got it.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each a combination of some of the four compounds.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl structures can have different isomers because the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond, allowing rotation. But wait, if the substituents are in certain positions, they can cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. Let me think. In this case, the substituents are on positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Wait, for biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that are symmetric, like para positions, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. Wait, but in this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Oh wait, each benzene ring is substituted at 2 and 6, but the biphenyl is 1,1', so the two rings are connected at position 1 and 1'. So what's the structure? The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, so for each benzene, that's 1,2,6 substitution. Hmm, maybe that creates a situation where the molecule can have stereoisomerism. Wait, does this compound have a chiral center? Or maybe it's a case of meso compounds. Alternatively, maybe it's about the possibility of having enantiomers.

Wait, considering that the two rings are connected, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it could have enantiomers. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent them from being mirror images.

But wait, since each ring has two substituents (at 2 and 6), and the other substituents are attached to the central bond, maybe the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the molecule can't have a plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism.

I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe this compound has two ester groups (from the carboxylate) and two nitro groups. The arrangement could lead to a situation where the molecule is chiral. Wait, nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, but whether they cause chirality depends on the structure.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to look for the presence of a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't have optical isomerism. For example, in the case of 1,2-dinitro-1,2-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester on a biphenyl, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral. Or perhaps not. Hmm, not too sure about this one. I'll come back to it later.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So that's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is also known as glycolic acid. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid has the structure CH2(COOH)OH. When esterified, the formula becomes CH2(COOMe)OMe, I think. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it's methyl ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Oh wait, let me structure it: the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3COHCOOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 as the ester.

Wait, so the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So, looking for chiral centers. The central carbon, the CH2, is connected to OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. The structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So, the central CH2 is connected to OH, another CH2, and the COOCH3. Wait, no, the structure is more accurately: the chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH2 in the middle. Wait, each CH2 is CH2. Let me write it as: O

The structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, that's a straight chain. So the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Each CH2 has two Hs, so the central carbon (the second CH2) is connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3 group. Wait, wait, no. No, it's actually:

The structure is H O

|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no. The first carbon (from left) is CH2OH, the second is CH2, which is connected to the third carbon, which is COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon is the one with the OH group. So, is there a chiral center? Let's see: for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

The second carbon has: OH, CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, and another CH2 group? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester. So, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon.

So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2(OH), wait no, no, the middle carbon is connected to:

Wait, perhaps I should number the carbons. Carbon 1: CH3 group? No, wait, for propanoate, it's three carbons. Carbon 1: COOCH3, carbon 2: OH, carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Let me think. Propanoic acid has three carbons: COOH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- OH group,

- two CH2 groups (the first and third carbons),

- and the COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH),

Carbon 2: CH2,

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, the propanoate part is COOCH3 attached to the third carbon? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle CH2 has two CH2 groups attached. So, the middle carbon is connected to:

- OH,

- CH2(OH) (no, wait, that's the same carbon), no, wait, the middle carbon is the second carbon, connected to:

- the first carbon (CH2(OH)),

- the third carbon (COOCH3),

- two hydrogen atoms.

Wait, no, no. Let's think about the actual structure. The molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH2 in the middle. So the central carbon is connected to:

- one CH2OH group,

- one CH2COOCH3 group,

- two H atoms.

Wait, so the central carbon is CH2. So, it's CH2-OH on the left, and CH2-COOCH3 on the right. So the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O
|
CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. The actual structure is:

The ester is formed by the acid and an alcohol. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it reacts with methanol, the -OH of the acid becomes an ester: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking at the central carbon (the CH2 in the middle): it's connected to:

- a CH2(OH) group,

- a CH2COOCH3 group,

- and two hydrogens.

Wait, but each CH2 is a carbon with two hydrogens. So, the central carbon (the second one) is connected to:

- the CH2(OH) group (carbon 1),

- the CH2COOCH3 group (carbon 3),

- two H's.

So, substituents are: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So two H's. So, four substituents are not all different. Wait, no, because two are H's. So, no, that carbon isn't a chiral center. But wait, maybe another carbon is.

Looking at the CH2COOCH3 group, the third carbon. The COOCH3 is attached to the third carbon. So, the third carbon is connected to:

- the CH2 from the second carbon,

- the COOCH3 group,

- and two H's.

So substituents: CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. Again, two H's, so not a chiral center.

What about the first carbon, the CH2OH? It's connected to:

- OH,

- two H's,

- and the second carbon (CH2).

So substituents: OH, H, H, and CH2. So again, not a chiral center.

Wait, so does this compound have any chiral centers? Because if all carbons either have two H's or other substituents, maybe not. Hmm, but wait, wait. Maybe the structure is different. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that's more like 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, but wait, no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH.  Hydroxy on the second carbon would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, when esterified, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, looking at the structure, it's a three-carbon chain:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, perhaps the central carbon (carbon 2) is CH2, which is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH2(OH)),

- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),

- and two H's.

So, substituents are: CH2OH, COOCH3, H, H. So, again, two H's, so that's not a chiral center.

So, does this molecule have any chiral centers? It doesn't seem like it. Wait, then why is the question considering it as an option? Because if it's not chiral, it won't have optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the molecule does have a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe 2-hydroxypropanoate is not a straight chain. Oh wait, wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is also known as (2R) or (2S) something? No, wait, no. Wait, maybe the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So, the central carbon is CH with OH, CH3, COOH, and another CH group?

Wait, perhaps I confused the structure. Let's think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the middle carbon. So, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the middle CH2 has two H's, so no chiral centers. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which also lacks a chiral center.

Wait, but then why is this compound in the options? Because if it doesn't have any chiral centers, it can't show optical isomerism. So, perhaps I'm wrong here.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the structure is different. Like, if the hydroxy group is on a carbon adjacent to the ester group, making the carbon a chiral center. Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

The ester is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that would make the central carbon (the one with the hydroxy) connected to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another CH2 group or something else. Wait, maybe that's the case.

Wait, let me clarify. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, that's actually 2-hydroxypropanoic acid? No, wait, that would be more like 2-hydroxypropanoic acid if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Because then the middle carbon (CH) has the OH, a CH3, a COOH, and another H. So, in that case, the middle carbon is a chiral center. Because four different substituents: COOH, CH3, OH, and H.

Wait, I think I got it wrong earlier. Because propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So if it's 2-hydroxy, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the middle carbon is CH2. So, no chiral center because it has two H's.

But wait, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH, which is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, then the middle carbon would be a chiral center, because connected to four different groups: CH3, COOH, OH, and H. So that would be chiral.

Wait, so which is correct? I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the numbering. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The carboxylic acid is on carbon 1. So, 2-hydroxy would be on carbon 2. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the middle carbon is CH2, which has two H's, so no chiral center.

Wait, but then how can 2-hydroxypropanoic acid have a chiral center? Maybe it's not possible. Because if the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, the middle carbon is CH2, which can't be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think about it differently. Let's imagine a three-carbon chain: carboxylic acid group on the first carbon, then the second carbon has the hydroxyl, and the third has a methyl group.

Wait, no, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoic acid. Because the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, and the hydroxyl on carbon 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, perhaps the correct structure for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(COOH)CH2OH. So, the COOH is on carbon 1, the OH on carbon 2. So, the structure is CH2(COOH)-CH2-OH. But then, the middle carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- two CH2 groups,

- OH,

- and two H's.

So again, no chiral center.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about the ester in question. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So if the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, again, no chiral center.

So, if that's the case, then this compound (2) doesn't have any chiral centers and hence can't show optical isomerism. But wait, the options include option A, which includes 2. So, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group. For example, if it's an alpha-hydroxy ester, like CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3. No, that's not the case. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the propanoate has a hydroxyl on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry. If there's a plane of symmetry, the molecule is achiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is chiral despite the substituents, but that's unlikely without four different groups on a carbon.

Wait, moving on to the next compound for now.

Compound 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO, i.e., two benzene rings connected to a ketone group. Its structure is Ph-CO-Ph. Let's think about its structure. The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the ketone). So, the central carbon is C=O. Wait, no, in benzophenone, the ketone is C=O, and the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups. So the structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So, the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. Since the central carbon is double-bonded, it can't rotate, but does that create a chiral center? No, because chiral centers must be tetrahedral. So, the central carbon here is trigonal (double-bonded), so it's not a chiral center.

Moreover, the molecule is symmetrical. The two phenyl groups are identical, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central carbon. So, no optical isomerism. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid, which has the structure:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   || 
   C-OCH3

But wait, fumaric acid is the trans- isomer, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Let me think. The structure would be:

CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. So, the structure is:

Phthalic anhydride? No, phthalic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride, but fumarate is the diethyl or dimethyl ester of fumaric acid.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, and the dimethyl ester would be (CH3O2C)CH=CH(CO2Me), but in the trans configuration. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

That would mean that the molecule has a double bond, with the substituents (ester groups) on opposite sides. So, this would lead to the possibility of cis and trans isomerism. However, optical isomerism is about chirality, not geometric isomerism.

Wait, so does dimethyl fumarate have a chiral center? Let me look at the structure. The molecule has a central double bond (CH=CH), with each CH connected to an ester group (COOCH3). So, each CH is connected to:

- the double bond,

- two COOCH3 groups,

- and two H's.

Wait, no, in the fumarate structure, each CH is connected to:

- the other CH (double bond),

- two ester groups (COOCH3),

- and so on? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H. No, no, wait, no. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid, which is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So, the structure is with a double bond between the two CH groups.

So, the dimethyl ester would be (COOCH3)2C-CH=CH-C(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the structure is:

Each of the two CH groups in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So, each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's? No, no, let me think correctly.

Actually, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
|| 
O

No, that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure is that each carbon in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

So, each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group. So, each carbon has two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and two H's? No, that's not possible because each carbon in a double bond can only have three substituents.

Wait, maybe each carbon in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 group, and each of those carbons is also connected to another substituent. Wait, no, in fumarate, each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) is attached to one COOCH3 group and one H. So, the structure is:

CH(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

But in the trans configuration. So, each CH is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- one H,

- and the double bond to the other CH.

So, each of these CH groups has:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and two double bonds (but double bonds don't count as substituents for chirality). Wait, but in that case, each carbon is connected to four groups: COOCH3, H, and two from the double bond. So, the double bond is between the two carbons. So, each CH is connected to COOCH3, H, and two other CHs (but as double bonds, they're part of the structure).

Wait, but in this case, each carbon in the double bond has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the two adjacent carbons (but as part of the double bond, they are sp2 hybridized). Therefore, each carbon is trigonal, not tetrahedral. So, they can't be chiral centers.

However, the molecule as a whole can have geometric isomerism (cis and trans), but that's not optical isomerism. Optical isomerism requires a chiral center or a molecule without a plane of symmetry that's not superimposable on its mirror image.

Wait, but wait. Could the molecule have a plane of symmetry? In the trans form, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the molecule would be symmetrical along the plane that bisects the double bond. Because each side mirrors the other. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) doesn't show optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm confusing geometric isomerism with optical isomerism. Because the molecule is trans, it would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another thought: if the substituents are on the same side, it's the cis isomer, which would have a different configuration. But if the substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the possibility of the molecule being chiral. If the two substituents on either side of the double bond are not identical, then maybe the molecule could have chirality. But in this case, each substituent (the COOCH3 groups) is the same. Wait, but in the case of fumarate, both substituents are the same. So, perhaps the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but wait, if the molecule has identical groups on either side of the double bond, it might be achiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, each substituent is COOCH3, so the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism. So, compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, that's conflicting with my initial thought. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule has a center of symmetry. If it does, then it's not chiral.

Wait, but now I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If the substituents on either end of the double bond are the same, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, now, going back to the four compounds.

Let me list each compound and whether I think they show optical isomerism.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Wait, I need to think about this. The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond). The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester group (COOCH3) at 2. Let me try to imagine the structure.

So, each benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro group at the 6 position and a COOCH3 at the 2 position. The biphenyl is connected at the 1 and 1' positions.

Wait, so each ring has nitro at 6 and COOCH3 at 2. So, the substituents are on adjacent positions. Now, let's see if the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If the two rings are arranged such that the substituents are symmetrical, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to the molecule being chiral.

Wait, considering the biphenyl structure, the single bond between the two rings allows rotation, which can lead to different isomeric forms. However, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that they are mirror images, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral.

But in this case, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group, but their positions are on adjacent carbons. So, perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the molecule: each ring has a nitro at 6 and COOCH3 at 2. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1'.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is such that the substituents are in positions that create a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the two nitro groups and two COOCH3 groups are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral.

Wait, without a clear picture, it's a bit hard, but perhaps this compound does not show optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. So, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the plane passing through the central bond, then it's not chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 at 6 and 2 respectively. So, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that there's a plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that no such plane exists, making the molecule chiral.

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps in this case, the molecule is not chiral, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and has no internal planes of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I think the key here is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If each substituent on the two rings are mirror images, then the molecule is symmetrical.

But in this case, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group. If the positions are such that the arrangement on each ring is the same, then the entire molecule is symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are arranged in a way that they are not symmetrical, making the molecule chiral.

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are opposite each other (like para-substituted), then it's symmetrical. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent? Or maybe 2 and 6 are opposite on a benzene ring. Wait, in a benzene ring, position 1 is connected to 2 and 6. So, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to each other. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, each position has two adjacent positions. So, position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. So, substituents at 2 and 6 would be across the ring from each other, perhaps.

Wait, no, let me think: in a benzene ring, the numbering goes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in a circle. So, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. So, substituents at 2 and 6 are across the ring from each other, not adjacent.

So, in this compound, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a COOCH3 at position 2. So, the substituents on each ring are opposite each other, at positions 2 and 6.

Now, the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1' of each ring. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other. Now, whether the overall molecule has a plane of symmetry depends on the arrangement.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions are mirrored across the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no such symmetry, the molecule would be chiral.

But I'm not certain. Maybe this compound (1) doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it would have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps substituents are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral.

I'm a bit stuck on this. So, perhaps I should move on and see what the options say.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, from the earlier analysis:

Compound 1: unsure.

Compound 2: possibly no optical isomerism.

Compound 3: no.

Compound 4: no.

So, the only possible compounds that might show optical isomerism are 1 and 2. But wait, earlier analysis suggested that compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 2. Let me think again.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the CH) would have four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So, that would make it a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, that would mean that compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought the structure was CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Ah, wait, perhaps 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which has a chiral center. So, the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, which would have a chiral center at the second carbon.

So, in that case, compound 2 would have a chiral center and show optical isomerism.

Wait, that makes sense. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier about the structure. So, compound 2 does show optical isomerism.

In that case, let's re-evaluate the four compounds.

Compound 1: we're unsure. Let's think again. The substituents on each benzene ring are at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other. So, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group across from each other. Now, the two rings are connected by a single bond. So, perhaps the arrangement allows for a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. But if the substituents on each ring are in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the two substituents on each ring are such that their positions don't allow for a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

Wait, but if each substituent is opposite on each ring, perhaps the arrangement is symmetrical, making the molecule achiral.

Wait, for example, if the nitro group on the first ring is at position 6 and the COOCH3 at position 2, and the second ring has the same arrangement, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement of substituents on each ring is such that their positions are mirrored, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Hmm, but I'm not certain. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and COOCH3 at 2. The two rings are connected at 1 and 1'. So, looking at the molecule, each substituent is on opposite sides of the ring, making the overall structure symmetric.

In that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, now, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is compound 2.

Looking at the options, which option includes only compound 2?

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4. Includes 2.

B)3,4. Doesn't include 2.

C)2 and3. Includes 2, but 3 doesn't have isomerism.

D)1 and2. Includes 2, but 1 doesn't.

So, the correct answer would be option A, which includes 2 and possibly others. Wait, but what about option A includes 1, 2, and4. But we thought 1 and 4 don't show isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4.

Let me go back to compound4: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the trans isomer. So, dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. This would give the molecule a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, if compound 4 doesn't show isomerism, then option A (which includes 4) would be incorrect.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2.

Looking at the options, only option A includes 2, but it also includes 1 and4, which we think don't show isomerism. So, none of the options match.

Hmm, this suggests I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I've missed something in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 does show optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate has a structure where the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are the same (COOCH3 groups). So, whether the molecule is chiral depends on whether there's a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical, so no chirality.

Wait, but in that case, the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

So, that brings us back to only compound 2 showing optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of the options include only compound2. The options are A, B, C, D, each a combination.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1.

Let me think again about compound1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. The two rings are connected at 1 and 1'.

So, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other.

Thus, each ring has two substituents opposite each other.

Now, whether the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

But if the substituents are arranged in a way that's not symmetric, the molecule would be chiral.

Hmm, perhaps the arrangement of substituents on each ring is such that the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in a way that they are mirror images across the central bond, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged in the same way, then the molecule is symmetrical.

So, in that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, no optical isomerism for compound1.

Thus, only compound2 shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps compound4 does show optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the substituents in compound4 are identical.

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each substituent on the double bond is a COOCH3 group. So, the substituents are identical. Therefore, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Thus, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2.

Looking back at the options, none of the options have only 2. So, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound2.

If compound2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3, then the center carbon is a chiral center, so it exists as two enantiomers, leading to optical isomerism.

So, compound2 does show optical isomerism.

So, the answer would include compound2. Looking at the options, option A includes 1, 2,4. But if 1 and4 don't show isomerism, then the correct answer must be a different option.

Wait, maybe I'm missing another compound that shows optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate compound4.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer. Hmm, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Yes, because the substituents on each side are the same (both COOCH3), so the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, only compound2 shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, option A includes compound2, but also 1 and4, which I think don't show isomerism. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A? But that would mean compounds1 and4 show isomerism, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps compound1 does show isomerism.

Wait, perhaps in compound1, the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

So, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't mirror each other, the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but in the structure, each ring has substituents at 2 and6, which are opposite each other. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule is not symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement of substituents on each ring is such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality.

But without a clear picture, it's hard to say. But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that all four compounds are being considered for optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, let me think: compound4, dimethyl fumarate, is a di-ester of fumaric acid (trans). Fumaric acid itself has two carboxylic acid groups on opposite sides of a double bond. The dimethyl ester would have two ester groups on opposite sides. But that would make the molecule symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only compound2 shows optical isomerism. But none of the options include only 2.

Wait, looking back, option A includes 1,2,4. So, if only 2 shows isomerism, but option A includes it, then perhaps the correct answer is option A? No, because the others wouldn't.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question asks which of the four compounds show optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes compounds 1,2,4.

But earlier analysis suggests that 1 and4 don't show isomerism, but 2 does.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound1.

Let me think again about compound1.

If the substituents on each ring are in positions that don't allow a plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral. For example, if the substituents are on adjacent positions, or arranged asymmetrically.

Wait, in compound1, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2, which are opposite each other. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound2 shows isomerism.

But the options don't have an option that includes only 2.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4. But that would mean all three show isomerism, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound4.

Wait, another possibility: if the substituents are on the same side, it's the cis isomer, and the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, which is symmetrical. The cis isomer would be different.

Wait, no, the cis isomer of fumarate would have the two COOCH3 groups on the same side of the double bond, making the molecule have a plane of symmetry as well. So, both cis and trans would be achiral.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the substituents are on the same side, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, but wait, if the substituents are on the same side, the molecule is symmetrical. So, no, both cis and trans would be achiral, which is impossible because fumarate is known to have geometric isomerism, but not optical.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between optical and geometric isomerism.

In any case, going back to the options.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

From the analysis, only compound2 shows optical isomerism. But none of the options fit. Hence, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound4 has a chiral center. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH group, but wait, no, in fumarate, each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each carbon is CH=C, but each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's.

Wait, that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, each carbon is CH, connected to one COOCH3, one H, and two double bonds (but double bonds count as one bond).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

So, each carbon is CH, connected to:

- COOCH3,

- H,

- and double bonded to the other CH.

In that case, each carbon is a CH group, with substituents COOCH3 and H. So, each carbon is connected to COOCH3, H, and two adjacent carbons (as part of the double bond).

Wait, but in this case, each carbon is a CH group, so they're sp² hybridized and have three substituents (COOCH3, H, and the double bond). So, in this case, each carbon is not a chiral center because it's trigonal, not tetrahedral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Thus, compound4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Hmm, so perhaps the only correct answer is compound2.

But the options don't include an option with only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound1. Let me think again.

Compound1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and6, which are opposite each other.

So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond. Hence, it's achiral.

Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that shows isomerism is 2. But the options don't have an option with only 2.

Wait, perhaps I should check the other compounds again.

Compound3 is benzophenone, which is (Ph)₂CO. As discussed, it's not chiral.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options, none of them include only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound4.

Wait, could compound4 have a chiral center?

Wait, perhaps not. Because each substituent is the same on both ends. So, no chiral center.

Hmm. So, the only correct answer is compound2. But since the options don't have an option with only 2, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, maybe another approach: which of these compounds have chiral centers?

Compound2: yes, as discussed.

Compound1: no.

Compound3: no.

Compound4: no.

Thus, only compound2 shows optical isomerism.

Looking back at the options, option A includes 1,2,4. Option D includes 1 and 2.

So, since only 2 is correct, but no option includes only 2, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option A is the correct one because I was wrong about compound1 and4.

Alternatively, perhaps compound4 does have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate can have cis and trans isomers, but not optical isomerism. Because cis and trans are geometric isomers, not optical.

So, no, that's not relevant.

Thus, the correct answer must be only compound2.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about compound1.

Wait, perhaps compound1 has a chiral center.

Wait, the structure is a biphenyl with substituents at positions 2 and6 on each ring.

If the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But in this case, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group opposite each other. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the conclusion that only compound2 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options fit, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1, 2, and4. So, the correct answer is A.

But I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which requires a tetrahedral carbon with four different substituents or a lack of a plane of symmetry.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with nitro groups at positions 6 and carboxylate ester groups at positions 2 on each ring. The substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond. Therefore, it is **achiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-C(OH)H-COOCH₃. The central carbon (second carbon) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group (CH₃), a hydroxyl group (OH), a carboxylate ester group (COOCH₃), and a hydrogen atom (H). This makes the compound **chiral**, and it exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. Since the central carbon is trigonal (not tetrahedral), it cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is **achiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer of the di-ester of fumaric acid. Its structure is CH(COOCH₃)=CH(COOCH₃), with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule is symmetrical due to identical substituents on both carbons of the double bond, and it has a plane of symmetry. Thus, it is **achiral** and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds (1, 3, or 4) are chiral. However, the options provided do not include an option that lists only compound 2. Based on the analysis, **option A (1, 2, and 4)** is the closest match, even though compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.
