Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe in the formation of alkenes, but wait, another thought: when alkenes are treated with HI, it's usually an addition reaction. Oh wait, wait. Red phosphorus is often used in the dehydrohalogenation or maybe in the formation of alkenes from dihalides. Or wait, maybe it's related to the Wittig reaction? No, the Wittig uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Oh right! I think when you have a compound with a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, and you treat it with something like HI and red phosphorus, it's called the von Braun degradation. Or wait, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction. No, wait. Oh, I think that formyl groups (like in an aldehyde) can undergo elimination when treated with HI and red phosphorus. Oh wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus is used with HI for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but that doesn't seem to fit here.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, it's a cyclohexene ring (since it's cyclohex-3-ene), and on the ring there's a formyl group at position 2 and a vinyl group at position 5. Also, a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh wait, I think this is a case of the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's for ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation or elimination.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what HI does in such reactions. HI is a strong acid, and when it reacts with alkenes, it can add across the double bond (like in an addition reaction). But red phosphorus is sometimes used as a reducing agent. Oh! Wait, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction. No, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and reduces ketones to alkanes. But that's not the same as the reagents here.

Wait, another thought: the compound has a formyl group (CHO). Formyl groups can be converted into CH2OH groups when treated with certain reagents. Wait, I remember that treatment of a formyl group with HI and red phosphorus can lead to a reduction. Oh! Yes, the formyl group (RCHO) when treated with HI and red P is converted into a diol. Or wait, no—maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, formyl groups can be reduced to CH2OH. But wait, another possibility is that the double bonds in the molecule might be undergoing some reaction. The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so a double bond) and a vinyl group as well. So two double bonds in the molecule: the cyclohexene and the vinyl (CH2=CH-).

But the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Oh! I think this is a case of the hydroboration reaction, but that typically uses other reagents like BH3. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydrohalogenation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation. Or wait, perhaps it's a halohydrin formation. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the possibility that the reaction is adding HI across the double bonds. The starting material has two double bonds: the cyclohexene (cyclohex-3-ene) and the vinyl group (CH2=CH-). So each double bond could react with HI.

Wait, but wait, the cyclohexene is a ring double bond, and the vinyl is a substituent on the ring. So when HI is added in excess, each double bond could undergo an addition reaction. But red phosphorus is usually a Lewis acid catalyst, perhaps for such additions.

So, for each double bond, adding HI would lead to dihalides. But wait, the reaction could be more specific. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a peroxide effect, but that's more for alkenes adding HX in a different way.

Wait, but the product is formed when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Another thought: perhaps the formyl group is being converted. Wait, formyl groups can be reduced to CH2OH by other methods, but with HI and red phosphorus, maybe it's a different process.

Wait, another angle: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the number of rings plus double bonds plus triple bonds, etc. Each of those contributes one to the index. So, for the product, I need to find out how many of these are present.

The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond), a vinyl group (another double bond), and the formyl group (a carbonyl, which is a double bond). So the starting material has three double bonds: cyclohexene (1), vinyl (2), and formyl (3). So the index is 3. But wait, the reaction may change that.

Wait, but how does the reaction proceed? Let me think about each part.

The starting molecule has:

- A cyclohexene ring (double bond at position 3).
- At position 2, a formyl group (CHO).
- At position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So structure is:

Cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl (CHO), position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2-CH2? Wait, no, I think it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So the molecule has a ring with two substituents and three double bonds: ring (1), vinyl (2), formyl (3).

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm.

Wait, I think I remember that when a carbonyl group (like formyl) is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a reduction. Formyl (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH. So the CHO group becomes CH2OH. So that's one change.

As for the double bonds in the ring and the vinyl group, maybe they are hydrogenated. Wait, but red phosphorus with HI is more of a catalyst for addition reactions. Alternatively, maybe they are being halogenated.

Wait, but wait. If the reaction is adding HI across the double bonds, each double bond would add two H and two I, leading to vicinal dihalides. So for each double bond, two H and two I atoms are added, converting each double bond into a single bond with two adjacent iodine atoms.

Wait, but the reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but that's more for oxidizing conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogenation.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the reagents. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to form amines, but that's not the case here. Another possibility: the reaction of carbonyl groups with HI. Formyl groups can react with HI in a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products.

The starting molecule has a formyl group, a vinyl group, and a cyclohexene ring. The reaction with HI and red phosphorus could:

1. Reduce the formyl group to CH2OH.
2. Add HI across the cyclohexene double bond, converting it to a diiodide.
3. Add HI across the vinyl double bond, converting it to a diiodide.

But wait, if both double bonds undergo addition, each would add two I atoms and two H, converting each double bond into a single bond with adjacent I's.

So let's model this:

Starting molecule:

- The ring has a double bond (1).
- The vinyl group has another double bond (2).
- The formyl group has a double bond (3).

After reaction:

- Formyl becomes CH2OH (no double bond there).
- The cyclohexene double bond becomes a single bond with two I's adjacent (so no double bond here).
- The vinyl double bond becomes a single bond with two I's adjacent.

So the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond).
- The vinyl group becomes CH2I-CH2I? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the vinyl group is CH2-CH2 when the double bond is added? No, adding HI across a double bond replaces the double bond with two single bonds and two I atoms on adjacent carbons.

So for the vinyl group: CH2=CH- attached to the ring. After adding HI, it would become CH2-I-CH2-I attached to the ring? No, wait, wait. When you add HI to a double bond, each end adds an H and an I. So for a CH2=CH- group, adding HI would form CH2I-CH2I? No, wait, no, that's not correct. Each H adds to one end, and each I to the other. So the structure becomes CH2-I-CH2-I? No, wait, that would be if both H and I add to the same end. But in reality, each H adds to one carbon and I to the same. So for CH2=CH2, adding HI would give CH2I-CH2I. No, that's not right. Wait, the correct addition is that each H adds to one end and I to the other. So CH2=CH- becomes CH2I-CH2I? No, no, I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. For a double bond like CH2=CH-, adding HI would become CH2I-CH2I? No, that's not right. The correct structure after addition would be CH2I-CH2I? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think about the mechanism. The HI adds across the double bond in an anti addition. So each H and I add to opposite ends.

So for a double bond like CH2=CH-:

The left CH2 would get an H, and the right CH would get an I. So the structure becomes CH2(I)-CH2(H)?

Wait, no. Wait, each H and I would add across the double bond. So for CH2=CH-, adding HI would give CH2-I-CH2-H, but that can't be right because the structure would be CH2I-CH2I? No, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think about ethene. Ethene (CH2=CH2) reacts with HI to form 1,2-dihydroxyethyl iodide? No, wait, no, the product is 1-iodoethane. Wait, no, I think when ethene reacts with HI, it adds across the double bond, giving CH2I-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, ethene plus HI (excess) would add two H and two I, giving CH2I-CH2I, but that's not possible. Oh wait, no, I think the correct product is CH2I-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the addition. Let me think: the reaction of ethene with HI in a gas phase can lead to substitution (like forming ethyl iodide), but in solution, it typically adds across the double bond. So ethene + HI → CH2I-CH2I? No, that's not right. Wait, each molecule of HI adds once, so each end gets an H and I. So ethene (CH2=CH2) + HI → CH2I-CH2I? No, that would require two moles of HI, but the reaction is probably 1:1. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps only one addition happens.

Wait, perhaps in the presence of red phosphorus, the reaction is more about elimination rather than addition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps red phosphorus and HI are used for the dehydrohalogenation or other elimination reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydride reduction.

Wait, maybe I should think about each functional group:

1. The formyl group (CHO) → treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's reduced. So CHO → CH2OH.

2. The cyclohexene ring (C=C) → perhaps it's hydrogenated. But wait, red phosphorus and HI might not be a hydrogenation catalyst. Alternatively, it could add HI across the double bond, making a diiodide.

3. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → same as the cyclohexene, perhaps adds HI, making a diiodide.

So, if all the double bonds are converted to single bonds with I addition, then the product would have:

- CH2OH group where the formyl was.
- The ring becomes a cyclohexane (no double bond) with two I atoms added where the ring's double bond was.
- The vinyl group becomes a CH2-I-CH2-I group attached to the ring? Or wait, perhaps each double bond adds one I.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Each double bond would react with HI. For each double bond, one mole of HI adds, adding H and I across the double bond. So each double bond becomes a single bond with adjacent I and H.

Wait, but in the presence of excess HI, maybe both double bonds (the ring and the vinyl) would each add two HI molecules, leading to diiodides.

But perhaps the reaction is different. Let me think: when an alkene reacts with HI, it typically adds across the double bond. So each double bond (ring and vinyl) would do so. So the ring's double bond would become a single bond with two iodines and two hydrogens added (each carbon gets one H and one I). Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond would become a single bond with two I and two H.

Wait, but in the ring, when the double bond is opened, the ring might become a cyclohexane with two adjacent I atoms. Similarly, the vinyl group would become CH2-I-CH2-I, but that's not possible because the vinyl is attached to the ring. So the structure might become a longer chain with I's.

Wait, perhaps each double bond adds one HI per molecule. So the ring's double bond becomes a single bond with one I and H on each adjacent carbon, and the vinyl's double bond similarly.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not addition but elimination. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is being converted into a CH2OH group, and the other double bonds are being hydrogenated.

Wait, but how would the double bonds be hydrogenated? Red phosphorus is not a catalyst for hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps they're not reacting, and only the formyl group reacts.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is only affecting the formyl group. So the formyl (CHO) becomes CH2OH, and the rest remains the same. So the cyclohexene and vinyl groups would still have their double bonds. But why would only the formyl group react?

Alternatively, maybe HI is more reactive towards the more substituted double bonds. The cyclohexene is part of a ring, maybe more reactive, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration reaction, but that's under acidic conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not affecting the double bonds but only the formyl group. Let's think: if the formyl group is converted to CH2OH, then the product would have:

- A cyclohexene ring (still has a double bond)
- A CH2OH group at position 2
- A vinyl group at position 5 (still has a double bond)
So the product would have two double bonds (the ring and the vinyl). The formyl group is gone, replaced by CH2OH, which doesn't have a double bond.

So the index of hydrogen deficiency would be 2 (from the two double bonds in the product).

Wait, but the options given are 0,1,3,5. Hmm, 2 isn't an option. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the reaction also affects the other double bonds. Maybe the cyclohexene and vinyl groups are also hydrogenated. Let me think: if all double bonds are hydrogenated, then the product would have no double bonds, so index of hydrogen deficiency would be 0. But would that be the case under these reaction conditions?

Wait, another thought: the starting material has a cyclohexene ring, which is a conjugated diene? No, it's a single double bond.

Wait, maybe the reaction adds HI across the double bonds, converting them into single bonds. So the cyclohexene becomes a cyclohexane with two adjacent I atoms, and the vinyl group becomes a CH2-I-CH2 group attached to the ring. So then, the product would have no double bonds left.

But wait, the formyl group is converted to CH2OH, so no more double bonds there either.

So the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond)
- CH2OH at position 2
- CH2I-CH2- group at position 5 (but wait, the vinyl was CH2=CH-, adding HI would make CH2I-CH2I, but attached where? Maybe it's more like CH2I-CH2- attached to the ring, but that would require two I's.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group's double bond is also attacked by HI, adding across it. So the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2I-CH2I. So the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond)
- CH2OH at position 2
- CH2I-CH2I at position 5.

In this case, the molecule would have no double bonds (all are single bonds), so the index of hydrogen deficiency would be 0.

Wait, but wait. Let me count the rings. The starting material was a cyclohexene ring, which in the product becomes a cyclohexane ring. So that's a ring (one contribution), but in the starting material, the cyclohexene had a double bond, which was part of the ring. So after hydrogenation, the ring remains but without the double bond. So the ring is a single ring, contributing 1 to the index.

Wait, but the index is calculated as the number of rings plus the number of double bonds plus the number of triple bonds, etc. So if the product has a ring (so 1), and all double bonds are gone, then the index is 1.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The starting material has:

- 1 ring (cyclohexene)
- 2 double bonds (cyclohexene and vinyl)
- 1 double bond (formyl group)

Wait, no. The formyl group is a carbonyl (C=O), which is a double bond. So the starting material has three double bonds: cyclohexene (1), vinyl (2), and formyl (3). Plus, the ring itself is a single ring.

So the index of hydrogen deficiency is (number of rings) + (number of double bonds) = 1 + 3 = 4? Wait, no. Wait, the index is calculated as the sum of (rings + double bonds + triple bonds + ...). Each ring or pi bond contributes 1.

But wait, the correct formula for index of hydrogen deficiency (DoH) is DoH = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2. But perhaps it's easier to count rings and double bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the DoH for the product. Let's think about the product structure.

After reaction, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (so 1 ring)
- The formyl group converted to CH2OH (no double bond)
- The cyclohexene double bond converted to single (so no double bond)
- The vinyl group's double bond converted to single (so no double bond)

So in the product:

- 1 ring
- 0 double bonds
- 0 triple bonds
So the DoH is 1.

But looking at the options, option D is 0, option A is 1. So the answer would be A) 1.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction doesn't hydrogenate all the double bonds. Maybe only the formyl group is reduced, and the other double bonds remain. But that would give DoH as 3, but that's not an option except B.

Wait, no, the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recount the starting material's DoH.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- The cyclohexene ring (1 ring) contributes 1.
- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) contributes another double bond, so +1.
- The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl, another double bond, +1.
- The carboxylic acid (COOH) is also a carbonyl, but since it's a carboxylic acid, it has a double bond (C=O), so +1.

Wait, wait, wait! Oh no, I didn't consider that the starting material has a carboxylic acid group, which has a double bond. So the starting material has four double bonds: the ring (1), vinyl (2), formyl (3), and carboxylic acid (4). Plus, the ring contributes 1. So DoH is 1 (ring) +4 (double bonds) =5.

But when the reaction occurs, what changes?

The formyl (CHO) group converts to CH2OH. So that's one less double bond.

The ring's double bond (cyclohexene) converts to single, so that's another minus one.

The vinyl group's double bond converts to single, another minus one.

The carboxylic acid group remains as COOH, which still has a double bond.

So the product would have:

- 1 ring (so 1)
- 1 double bond from the carboxylic acid.

So DoH = 1 +1=2.

But that's not an option. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the carboxylic acid group. So the product would have:

- 1 ring (from cyclohexane)
- The carboxylic acid (COOH) still has a double bond.
- The formyl group is converted to CH2OH (no double bond)
- The vinyl group's double bond is opened (so no double bond)
- The cyclohexene double bond is opened.

So DoH would be 1 (ring) +1 (carboxylic acid) =2.

But the options don't include 2. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction doesn't add to all double bonds. Maybe only the formyl group reacts.

So:

- Formyl becomes CH2OH (so 1 less double bond)
- The other double bonds remain.

So the product would have:

- 1 ring (cyclohexene → cyclohexane? No, if the double bond is added to, then the ring would become a cyclohexane without the double bond. So the ring count remains 1.

Wait, no, the ring would still be a ring but without the double bond. So the ring count remains 1, but the DoH would decrease by the number of double bonds converted.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the DoH using the formula.

The formula for DoH is:

DoH = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

Where C is the number of carbon atoms, H is hydrogens, X halogens, N nitrogens.

But I don't have the molecular formula here, so maybe it's easier to count rings and double bonds.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction leads to the product having no rings and no double bonds.

Wait, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring (1 ring), and three double bonds (ring, vinyl, formyl, and carboxylic acid). Wait, carboxylic acid is a double bond too. So four double bonds.

If the reaction converts all double bonds except the carboxylic acid, then DoH would be 1 (ring) +1 (carboxylic acid) =2.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the product having no double bonds. So DoH would be 1 (ring) only. So DoH=1.

Looking at the options, option A is 1. So perhaps that's the answer.

But earlier I thought the product would have 1 ring and 0 double bonds, leading to DoH=1.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction doesn't hydrogenate the cyclohexene ring but only the formyl group. So the ring's double bond remains, and the vinyl group's double bond remains as well.

So the product would have:

- 1 ring (with double bond)
- 1 formyl converted to CH2OH (so no double bond)
- 1 vinyl group with double bond.

Plus, the carboxylic acid group (double bond).

So DoH would be 1 (ring) + 1 (vinyl) +1 (carboxylic acid) =3. Which is option B.

But I'm getting conflicting possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only affects the formyl group, leaving the other double bonds intact. So:

- Formyl converted to CH2OH (so 1 less double bond)
- Cyclohexene still has a double bond → 1
- Vinyl still has a double bond →1
- Carboxylic acid →1.

So total DoH would be 1 (ring) +1 (cyclohexene) +1 (vinyl) +1 (carboxylic acid) =4.

But that's not an option either.

I'm a bit stuck here, but perhaps I should think about the reaction again.

Wait, another approach: the starting material, when treated with red phosphorus and HI, undergoes the Baeyer-Villiger reaction? No, that's for ketones.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation of the double bonds. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of the double bonds, adding HI across each.

If each double bond adds HI, then each double bond is converted into a single bond with two adjacent H and I atoms.

So for the cyclohexene ring, adding HI would give a diiodide, and same for the vinyl group.

So the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond) with two I atoms.
- A vinyl group converted to a CH2I-CH2I group attached to the ring.
- The formyl group converted to CH2OH.
- The carboxylic acid group remains.

So the product would have:

- 1 ring (cyclohexane → no double bond, but it's a ring)
- No other double bonds.

So DoH is 1 (from the ring).

Thus, the answer would be A)1.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the carboxylic acid group, so it still has a double bond. Then DoH would be 1 (ring) +1 (carboxylic acid) =2, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the reaction does affect the carboxylic acid group. Does HI and red phosphorus react with carboxylic acids?

Hmm, I'm not sure. Carboxylic acids are generally resistant to such reactions. They might be hydrolyzed under strong acidic conditions, but with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps not.

So, perhaps the carboxylic acid group remains as is, contributing a double bond. So DoH would be 1 (ring) +1 (carboxylic acid) =2, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't add to all double bonds. Maybe only the formyl group and the cyclohexene react, leaving the vinyl group's double bond and the carboxylic acid.

So DoH would be 1 (ring converted to cyclohexane) plus 1 (vinyl) plus 1 (carboxylic acid) → 3.

Which is option B.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: perhaps the reaction leads to the complete hydrogenation of all double bonds except the carboxylic acid. So DoH would be 1 (ring) +1 (carboxylic acid) =2. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the product structure.

The product after reaction is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid treated with HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, another thought: the formyl group is reduced to CH2OH. The other double bonds (cyclohexene and vinyl) may undergo addition of HI, converting them into single bonds. Thus, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond)
- CH2OH at position 2
- A CH2I-CH2I group at position 5 (from the vinyl)
- A COOH group (which has a double bond).

Wait, but that would leave the COOH group's double bond, so DoH would be 1 (ring) +1 (COOH) =2. But again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't add to the vinyl group. So DoH would be 1 (ring) +1 (vinyl) +1 (COOH) =3, which is option B.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product and its structure again.

The starting material has:

- 1 ring (cyclohexene: 1 ring, 1 double bond)
- 1 formyl group (CHO: 1 double bond)
- 1 vinyl group (CH2=CH-: another double bond)
- 1 carboxylic acid group (COOH: another double bond)

DoH = 1 (ring) + 3 (double bonds) + 1 (COOH double bond) → wait, no. Wait, each group contributes one double bond. So ring (1), formyl (1), vinyl (1), COOH (1) → total DoH =4.

After reaction:

- Formyl becomes CH2OH: -1 DoH.
- Ring's double bond is opened: -1 DoH.
- Vinyl's double bond is opened: -1 DoH.

COOH remains: +1 DoH.

So total DoH =4-3+1=2, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the vinyl group. So only formyl and ring double bonds are opened.

DoH after reaction: 4 -2=2 → but again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps only the formyl group is converted, and the others remain.

DoH after reaction:4-1=3 → which is option B.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product has zero double bonds and no rings. But that can't be because the ring would remain as a cyclohexane, contributing 1.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the ring opening, but that's unlikely. Red phosphorus and HI usually don't cause ring opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only reduces the formyl group, and the other double bonds remain. So DoH remains 4-1=3.

So the answer would be B)3.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction completely saturates all double bonds except the carboxylic acid, leading to DoH=1+1=2, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is A)1.

Hmm, I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoH) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The DoH is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and double bonds (including those in functional groups like carbonyls) in the molecule.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:
   - The molecule contains:
     - A cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond).
     - A formyl group (CHO, 1 double bond).
     - A vinyl group (CH₂=CH-, 1 double bond).
     - A carboxylic acid group (COOH, 1 double bond).
   - Total DoH of the starting material = 1 (ring) + 3 (double bonds) + 1 (carboxylic acid double bond) = **4**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**:
   - **Formyl Group (CHO)**: Reacts with HI and red phosphorus to form CH₂OH, eliminating the double bond in the formyl group.
   - **Cyclohexene Ring**: Likely undergoes addition of HI, converting the double bond into a single bond and forming a cyclohexane ring.
   - **Vinyl Group (CH₂=CH-)**: Reacts with HI, converting the double bond into a single bond.
   - **Carboxylic Acid Group (COOH)**: Likely remains unaffected under these reaction conditions, retaining its double bond.

3. **Structure of the Product**:
   - The product contains:
     - A cyclohexane ring (1 ring, no double bond).
     - A CH₂OH group (no double bond).
     - A saturated vinyl group (no double bond).
     - A carboxylic acid group (COOH, 1 double bond).
   - Total DoH of the product = 1 (ring) + 1 (carboxylic acid double bond) = **2**.

4. **Reevaluation of Options**:
   - The calculated DoH of the product is **2**, but this value is not among the provided options (A: 1, B: 3, C: 5, D: 0). This discrepancy suggests that the reaction might not affect the carboxylic acid group, leaving it with a double bond, or that the cyclohexane ring is not counted as a ring in the product. If the ring is not counted, the DoH would be **1**.

5. **Final Conclusion**:
   - Based on the reaction conditions and the options provided, the most plausible answer is **A: 1**, assuming the cyclohexane ring is not counted as a ring in the product.
