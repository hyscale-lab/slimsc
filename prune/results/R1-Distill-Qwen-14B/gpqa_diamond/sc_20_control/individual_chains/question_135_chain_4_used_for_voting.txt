Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian term for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. The term is λf ψ_f bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I think that's a Yukawa interaction term, right? Yukawa couplings are common in particle physics, like how the Higgs field interacts with fermions.

So the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed for X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D with various fermion pairs.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products' rest masses must be less than the mass of X. So for each possible fermion pair, like b b-bar, I have to check if 2*m(fermion) < m_X.

Let me list the masses of the fermions I know. The fermions in the Standard Model are quarks and leptons. The up and down quarks are the lightest; their masses are around a few MeV. The strange quark is heavier, maybe ~100 MeV. The charm quark is around 1.5 GeV, bottom quark about 4.5 GeV, top is way heavier, around 173 GeV. For leptons, the electron and muon are about 0.1 and 0.1 GeV (but wait, actually, 0.000511 GeV for electron and ~0.1057 GeV for muon). The tau is around 1.78 GeV. 

So X is 6 GeV. Let's go through each possible decay channel.

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Check each pair:

b quark: mass ~4.5 GeV. So 2*m = ~9 GeV. But X is 6 GeV. 9 >6, so that's not allowed. Wait, that can't be. So if X is 6 GeV, can it decay into two b quarks? Because 2*m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So decay into b quarks is not possible. So option A includes b decay, which is not allowed kinematically. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

c quark mass ~1.5 GeV. 2*1.5=3 <6. So possible. s quark is ~100 MeV, 2*0.1=0.2, so fine. u and d are even lighter, so definitely allowed. Tau is about 1.78 GeV. 2*1.78 =3.56 <6. So tau pair is allowed. Mu and e are even lighter. So all these decay options in B are allowed.

Wait, but what about the top quark? Oh, but top is too heavy. 2*m_t is 346 GeV, which is way beyond X's 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks.

Option C: Includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e.

Wait, t quark is 173 GeV. 2*m_t is 346 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So that decay is impossible. So option C includes t quark decay, which is not allowed. So C can't be correct.

Option D: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, the b quark pair's mass is 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So decay into b quarks isn't allowed. So D is also incorrect.

So the correct option should be B because all the pairs listed have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Let me check each: c is 3 GeV, s is 0.2, u and d even less. Tau is 3.56 GeV, mu is 0.21 GeV, e is 0.1 GeV. All under 6.

Wait, but what about the W and Z bosons? Oh, no, because the Lagrangian term is for fermions, so X can only decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. So W and Z are bosons, not relevant here.

So the correct answer is option B. So looking at the options, that's choice B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given Lagrangian interaction term. The interaction is of Yukawa type, allowing \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. To determine the allowed decays, the combined rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m(f) < m_X \).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b\bar{b} \), where the bottom quark mass is approximately \( 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \). The combined mass is \( 2m(b) = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), which exceeds \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, this decay is not allowed. **Option A is incorrect.**

2. **Option B**: Includes \( X \to c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^{+}\tau^{-} \), \( \mu^{+}\mu^{-} \), and \( e^{+}e^{-} \). The masses of the fermions are:
   - \( c \): \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m(c) = 3 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( s \): \( 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m(s) = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( u, d \): even lighter, so \( 2m(u/d) \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( \tau \): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m(\tau) = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( \mu \): \( 0.1057 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m(\mu) \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \),
   - \( e \): \( 0.000511 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m(e) \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
   All these decays are kinematically allowed. **Option B is correct.**

3. **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t\bar{t} \), where the top quark mass is approximately \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \). The combined mass is \( 2m(t) = 346 \, \text{GeV} \), which far exceeds \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, this decay is not allowed. **Option C is incorrect.**

4. **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b\bar{b} \), similar to Option A, where \( 2m(b) = 9 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus, this decay is not allowed. **Option D is incorrect.**

### Conclusion:
The only option where all listed decays are kinematically allowed is **Option B**.
