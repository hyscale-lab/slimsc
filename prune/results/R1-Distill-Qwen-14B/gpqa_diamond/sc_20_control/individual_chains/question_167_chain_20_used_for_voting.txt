Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem gives me a Schrödinger cat state, which is a specific kind of non-Gaussian state. The state is written as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant given by sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula for delta_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is that of a Gaussian reference state.

Wait, non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are those like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The relative entropy method compares the state to the closest Gaussian state, I think. So the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the best Gaussian approximation.

So, first, I need to find the density matrix rho of the given state. The state is a superposition of two coherent states, |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), respectively. 

Wait, calculating the density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|. So rho = (1/N²) [cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi)|-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) | -alpha><alpha | ].

But what's the density matrix tau for the reference Gaussian state? I think the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy, so it's the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in terms of relative entropy. For a state like this, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the optimal Gaussian approximation might be a coherent state or a squeezed state, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I recall that when dealing with two coherent states, the optimal Gaussian approximation could be another coherent state, perhaps one that's in the middle, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps for the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, the reference Gaussian state is the maximum-entropy Gaussian state, which is a completely mixed Gaussian state. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the relative entropy would compare to the closest Gaussian, which might be the state with the same first and second moments as the given state. But wait, the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, so its first moments might be zero. Let me check.

Wait, coherent states |alpha> have expectation <x> proportional to alpha, and similarly for p. So |alpha> and |-alpha> would have opposite expectation values. If I take a superposition of them, the expectation value of position and momentum might be zero. Let me compute that.

The state is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N.

The expectation value of the position operator x would be <x> = (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) <alpha|x|alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha |x| -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha|x| -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) < -alpha|x|alpha> ].

But coherent states have expectation value <x> = Re(alpha) something. Wait, maybe more accurately, for a coherent state |alpha>, the expectation value of x is proportional to the real part of alpha. Let me think, the position operator x is (a + a†)/sqrt(2), so <alpha|x|alpha> = sqrt(2) Re(alpha). Similarly, < -alpha |x| -alpha> would be sqrt(2) Re(-alpha) = - sqrt(2) Re(alpha). But wait, alpha is a complex number.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me let alpha be a real number for simplicity, because in the problem, alpha is given as 0.5. So alpha is real, 0.5. Then the state |alpha> is a coherent state with real alpha, and |-alpha> is the coherent state at -alpha.

So then, <x> for |alpha> is proportional to alpha, and for |-alpha> is proportional to -alpha.

So for the given state |psi>, the expectation value <x> would be (cos(phi) * alpha + sin(phi) * (-alpha)) ) / N².

Wait, no, because the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), but the state is normalized by N.

Wait, actually, since |psi> is normalized, N² is 1/( ... ), but let me compute N² for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

First, let's compute N. N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1.

Exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-2*0.25) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * 0.6065 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So N squared is 0.3935.

Now, the expectation value <x> of |psi> is ( cos(phi) * <alpha|x|alpha> + sin(phi) * < -alpha |x| -alpha> ) + cross terms.

But wait, the cross terms would involve <alpha|x|-alpha> and vice versa.

Wait, but let's assume that the cross terms are zero. Wait, is that the case? Because for coherent states, <alpha|x|beta> is something. Let me think.

The position operator x is proportional to (a + a†). The expectation value <alpha|x|beta> would be proportional to (alpha* + beta) + (alpha + beta*) ) / something. Wait, maybe it's better to compute it.

Wait, when alpha and beta are real numbers, <alpha|x|beta> = (alpha + beta) * sqrt(2} / 2. Wait, maybe. Because for real alpha and beta, the overlap <alpha|beta> is exp( - (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + alpha beta* ), but when alpha and beta are real, it becomes exp( -(alpha² + beta²)/2 + alpha beta ).

But for the expectation value <alpha|x|beta>, let's compute it. x is (a + a†)/sqrt(2). So <alpha| x |beta> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <alpha|a |beta> + <alpha|a† |beta> ].

a |beta> = beta |beta>, so <alpha|a |beta> = beta <alpha|beta> = beta exp( -(alpha² + beta²)/2 + alpha beta ) when alpha and beta are real.

Similarly, a† |beta> = (d/d beta) |beta> or something? Wait, no, a† is the creation operator. So <alpha|a† |beta> = (d/d beta*) <alpha|beta> when beta is real, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of real variables.

Wait, perhaps I should take a different approach. For real alpha and beta, <alpha| a |beta> = beta <alpha|beta> and <alpha| a† |beta> = alpha* <alpha|beta> ?

Wait, no. a |beta> = beta |beta>, so <alpha|a |beta> = beta <alpha| beta>. Similarly, a† |beta> is such that <alpha|a† |beta> = (d/d beta) <alpha|beta> evaluated at beta? Not sure. Alternatively, let's compute it directly.

a |beta> = beta |beta>, so <alpha|a |beta> = beta <alpha | beta>.

Similarly, a† |beta> = something. Wait, a† |beta> = |beta + 1>, but that's not correct. The action of a† on |beta> is more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it using the displacement operator.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute <alpha|x|beta> for real alpha and beta. 

x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2).

So, <alpha|x|beta> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <alpha|a |beta> + <alpha|a† |beta> ].

Now, <alpha|a |beta> = beta <alpha|beta> e^{- (alpha² + beta²)/2 + alpha beta}.

Similarly, <alpha|a† |beta> = (d/d beta) <alpha|beta> ) * something? Or perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that a|beta> = beta |beta>, so <alpha|a |beta> = beta <alpha| beta>.

And a† |beta> = (d/d beta) |beta> ? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps <alpha|a† |beta> = (d/d beta*) <alpha|beta> ) evaluated at beta. Wait, maybe.

Wait, <alpha| a† |beta> = (d/d beta) <beta|alpha> )^*? Hmm, that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha|x|beta> using the expression for x in terms of the ladder operators.

Wait, x = (a + a†)/sqrt(2). So,

<alpha|x|beta> = [ <alpha|a|beta> + <alpha|a†|beta> ] / sqrt(2).

We already know that <alpha|a|beta> = beta <alpha|beta>.

What about <alpha|a†|beta>?

Hmm. Since a† is the creation operator, |beta> is an eigenstate of a, and so a†|beta> = |beta + 1> scaled by something. But perhaps in terms of the inner product, <alpha| a† |beta> = (d/d beta) <alpha|beta> )^* ?

Wait, perhaps using the relation that <gamma| a† |beta> = sqrt(2) (beta^* - gamma^*) e^{ - |beta|^2/2 - |gamma|^2/2 + beta^* gamma } }, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the expression for <alpha|x|beta> when alpha and beta are real.

Wait, I think a better approach is to compute <alpha|x|beta> when alpha and beta are real. Let me denote |alpha> as the coherent state with parameter alpha.

The inner product <alpha|beta> is e^{- (alpha² + beta²)/2 + alpha beta}.

Then, the expectation value <alpha|x|beta> would be (alpha + beta) e^{ - (alpha^2 + beta^2)/2 + alpha beta }.

Wait, I think that's correct. Because for real alpha and beta, the expectation value <alpha|x|beta> is (alpha + beta) multiplied by the inner product <alpha|beta>. So,

<alpha|x|beta> = (alpha + beta) e^{- (alpha² + beta^2)/2 + alpha beta}.

So, in our case, when we have |alpha> and |-alpha>, their inner product is <alpha| -alpha> = e^{- (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + alpha*(-alpha)} }= e^{- alpha^2 + (-alpha^2)} = e^{- 2 alpha^2}.

Wait, wait, let me compute that. The exponent is (- (alpha^2 + beta^2) )/2 + alpha beta. So, when beta is -alpha, it becomes:

- (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + alpha*(-alpha) = - (2 alpha²)/2 + (- alpha²) = - alpha² - alpha² = - 2 alpha².

So, e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So, <alpha|x| -alpha> = (alpha + (-alpha)) e^{-2 alpha^2} ) / sqrt(2) ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expectation value <alpha|x|beta> is (alpha + beta) e^{ - (alpha^2 + beta^2)/2 + alpha beta }.

But when beta is -alpha, this becomes (alpha + (-alpha)) e^{- (2 alpha²)/2 + (-alpha^2)}.

Which is 0 * e^{- alpha^2 - alpha^2} = 0. So <alpha|x| -alpha> is zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So when you compute the cross terms in the expectation value of |psi>, the terms involving <alpha|x| -alpha> and vice versa would vanish because these expectation values are zero.

So, going back to the expectation value <x> for |psi>, which is:

<x> = [ cos^2(phi) <x_alpha> + sin^2(phi) <x_-alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <x_alpha, -alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <x_-alpha, alpha> ] / N^2.

But since <x_alpha, -alpha> is zero, those terms vanish. So,

<x> = [ cos^2(phi) <x_alpha> + sin^2(phi) <x_-alpha> ] / N^2.

Now, <x_alpha> is sqrt(2) alpha, and <x_-alpha> is - sqrt(2) alpha.

So,

<x> = [ cos^2(phi) * sqrt(2) alpha + sin^2(phi) (- sqrt(2) alpha) ] / N^2.

Factor out sqrt(2) alpha:

= sqrt(2) alpha [ cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) ] / N^2.

Hmm, but given that phi is -pi/4, let's compute cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi):

Wait, cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) is equal to cos(2phi). So,

= sqrt(2) alpha cos(2phi) / N^2.

Phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. So cos(2phi) is cos(-pi/2) = 0.

Therefore, <x> is zero.

Similarly, the expectation value of p would also be zero, because the state is a symmetric superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, leading to zero in both x and p.

So the first moments are zero. Now, what about the second moments? For the state |psi>, the second moments would be:

<x²>, <p²>, and <xp + px>.

But for a Gaussian state, the Wigner function is Gaussian, so the higher moments are determined by the first and second moments. So for a Gaussian state, the density matrix is determined by the first and second moments. Since our state |psi> has zero first moments, the optimal Gaussian approximation (tau) would have the same second moments as |psi>.

Wait, but wait, the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, being a superposition. Its second moments are not the same as a coherent state, since a coherent state is Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the maximum entropy Gaussian state that matches the first and second moments of rho. But since the first moments of rho are zero, tau would be a Gaussian state with zero mean and covariance matrix matching rho's.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy, which would require matching the first and second moments. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, when the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite displacements, the optimal Gaussian approximation might be the vacuum state or a squeezed state. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the displaced thermal state that has the same first and second moments as the given state.

Wait, another approach: the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between rho and the optimal Gaussian state tau. The relative entropy is S(rho||tau) = tr(rho log rho) - tr(rho log tau).

Wait, but the problem gives delta_b as S(rho) - S(tau), where S(rho) is the von Neumann entropy of rho, and S(tau) is that of tau.

Wait, no, not exactly. The formula given is delta_b = tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau). So it's the difference between the entropy of the non-Gaussian state and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is usually defined as S(rho || tau), which is tr(rho log rho) - tr(rho log tau). But in this problem, delta_b is tr(rho ln rho) - tr(tau ln tau). Hmm, so perhaps it's S(rho) - S(tau). But I'm not certain.

Wait, the problem statement says that the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So it's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau. 

But this is different from the usual relative entropy, which is S(rho||tau) = S(rho) - S(rho|tau), where S(rho|tau) is the conditional entropy, but I might be getting confused.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed by computing rho and tau, then compute their entropies.

So, first, what is the density matrix rho for the given state |psi>?

|psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

So, rho = |psi><psi|.

Expanding this, rho becomes:

rho = [ cos^2(phi) |alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |-alpha><alpha| ] / N².

Now, the state is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator a. The density matrix for a coherent state |alpha> is a pure state, but the superposition makes rho a mixed state.

But wait, for our purposes, perhaps we can find the eigenvalues of rho to compute its entropy.

The density matrix rho is a 2x2 matrix in the basis |alpha> and |-alpha>, since the cross terms are present. Wait, but in reality, the Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional, but rho can be written in terms of the projectors onto |alpha> and |-alpha> and their cross terms.

But perhaps the state is such that the cross terms are non-zero, so the off-diagonal terms are non-zero. But to compute the entropy, perhaps it's easier to compute the purity and the eigenvalues.

Wait, the state |psi> is a two-state superposition, so rho can be written as a 2x2 matrix in the basis {|alpha>, |-alpha>}.

In this basis, the matrix elements are:

rho_11 = |cos(phi)|^2 / N².

rho_22 = |sin(phi)|^2 / N².

rho_12 = cos(phi) sin(phi) / N².

rho_21 = rho_12^*.

So, in 2x2 form, rho is:

[ [ cos^2(phi)/N^2 , cos(phi) sin(phi)/N^2 ],
  [ cos(phi) sin(phi)/N^2 , sin^2(phi)/N^2 ] ]

Now, the eigenvalues of this matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation.

The trace is [cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi)] / N^2 = 1/N^2.

The determinant is [cos^2(phi) sin^2(phi) - (cos(phi) sin(phi))^2 ] / N^4 = (cos^2(phi) sin^2(phi) - cos^2(phi) sin^2(phi)) ) / N^4 = 0.

So the determinant is zero, meaning one eigenvalue is zero, and the other is 1/N^2.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the trace is 1/N^2, and the determinant is zero, so the eigenvalues would be 0 and 1/N^2.

Wait, but that would mean rho is a pure state? No, because rho is a density matrix, which for a pure state would have rank 1, but when you have a superposition of two orthogonal states, the density matrix would have two non-zero eigenvalues if the states are not orthogonal.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, are |alpha> and |-alpha> orthogonal? Let me check.

The inner product <alpha| -alpha> is e^{ - (alpha^2 + alpha^2)/2 + alpha*(-alpha) } = e^{ - (2 alpha^2)/2 - alpha^2 } = e^{ - alpha^2 - alpha^2 } = e^{- 2 alpha^2}.

So, unless alpha is zero, they are not orthogonal. So for alpha=0.5, e^{-2*(0.5)^2} = e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065, not zero. So |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal.

Wait, so their inner product is non-zero, so rho isn't a pure state in this basis. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the previous calculation.

Wait, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, which is a rank-1 operator. So, in any basis, it should have a single non-zero eigenvalue of 1 (if normalized) and others zero. But earlier, the trace in the basis {|alpha>, |-alpha>} is 1/N², which suggests that this basis isn't orthonormal in that space.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Since the state |psi> is a normalized state, the trace of rho is 1.

The matrix I wrote earlier in the {|alpha>, |-alpha>} basis is correct. The trace is 1/N². But wait, that's impossible because the trace should be 1. Because |psi> is normalized, so rho has trace 1.

Wait, but wait, N is the normalization constant. So N² = 1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha²}.

So, the denominator in rho is N², which is correct.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered the trace of rho in that 2x2 basis, I get (cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi)) / N² = 1/N².

But that's incorrect because the trace should be 1. So perhaps this approach is flawed.

I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently. Instead of trying to compute rho's eigenvalues, perhaps I can compute the purity of rho.

The purity is Tr(rho²). For a pure state, this is 1; for mixed, less than 1.

So, rho = |psi><psi|.

So, rho squared is |psi><psi|psi><psi| = |psi><psi| = rho.

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply rho is idempotent, but that's only if it's a projection operator. But |psi> is a superposition, so rho is not a projection.

Wait, no, |psi> is a state vector, so rho = |psi><psi| is a density matrix, which is idempotent only if it's a pure state. So, when you square rho, you get rho again because |psi> is normalized. So rho^2 = rho.

Ah, wait, no. Because rho is |psi><psi|, so rho^2 = |psi><psi|psi><psi| = |psi><psi| (since <psi|psi> is 1) = rho. So rho is idempotent, implying that it's a pure state. But that can't be right because the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are themselves mixed states? Or wait, coherent states are pure states, but a superposition of two different coherent states would be another pure state. Hmm, no, that's not correct. Because if two coherent states are not orthogonal, then the superposition would be a pure state, but its density matrix would have higher purity.

Wait, but in any case, the state |psi> is a normalized state, so rho is a pure state, and thus has von Neumann entropy zero. But the problem is about non-Gaussianity, which is about the difference between the state and a Gaussian state. So, if the state is Gaussian, then the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

Wait, but the state given is a superposition of two coherent states. Are such states Gaussian? No, because Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions, which includes coherent, squeezed, and thermal states, but superpositions of coherent states are non-Gaussian.

So, the non-Gaussianity measure would be non-zero. But wait, the question is about using the relative entropy measure, which compares rho to a reference Gaussian state tau. So, I need to compute the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau, then find delta_b as the difference.

Wait, but if rho is a pure state, then S(rho) is zero. But in reality, rho is a pure state, so its entropy is zero. But the reference Gaussian state tau would be a mixed state, so its entropy is positive. So, delta_b would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau), which can't be the case. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy in the problem is S(rho||tau), which is S(rho) - S(rho|tau), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition, where delta_b is S(rho) - S(tau), which would be the case if you have rho as the non-Gaussian state and tau as the Gaussian state with the same entropy. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the options. One of the options is D) 0. Could the non-Gaussianity be zero? That would happen if the state is Gaussian. But I don't think this state is Gaussian.

Wait, wait. What if the state is a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states. But a cat state is known to be highly non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

But let's look at the given parameters. phi is -pi/4, alpha is 0.5. Let me compute N again.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

2phi is -pi/2, so sin(2phi) is -1. exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So N² is 0.3935.

Now, the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), respectively.

Phi is -pi/4. So cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(phi) is sin(-pi/4)= -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So the state becomes (0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, this simplifies to [ |0.5> - |-0.5> ] / sqrt(2 * 0.3935), but perhaps that's not necessary.

Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state, so its entropy is zero.

But the reference Gaussian state tau is the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in terms of relative entropy. So, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity would be S(rho||tau) = S(rho) - S(rho|tau) = 0 - S(rho|tau) = - S(rho|tau), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses delta_b = S(rho) - S(tau), which would be 0 - S(tau), which would be negative. But the options are all positive, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition.

Wait, perhaps the problem defines it as S(rho) - S(tau), and if tau is the best Gaussian approximation (i.e., the one that minimizes S(rho||tau)), then delta_b would be the non-Gaussianity. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state in question is actually a Gaussian state, leading to zero non-Gaussianity. But I don't think so because it's a superposition of two coherent states.

Wait, wait. Wait, when phi is -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5, perhaps the state is a symmetric superposition, leading to some simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a coherent state, but that seems unlikely since it's a superposition.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the state can be rewritten as a single coherent state. Let me check.

|psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

Let me write this as e^{i theta} [ |alpha> e^{i phi'} + |-alpha> e^{i phi''} } ] for some phases. Wait, perhaps it's a coherent state under a different displacement.

Wait, but I don't think so. Because adding |alpha> and |-alpha> would not give a single coherent state unless perhaps they are combined with some phase.

Wait, let me think: can a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> be written as another coherent state? Let's see.

Suppose |psi> is (|alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha> ) / N.

Then, can this be written as a coherent state |beta> for some beta?

Well, perhaps not, unless theta is 0 or pi, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be written as a squeezed state. Squeezed states are Gaussian, so if the given state is a squeezed state, then its non-Gaussianity would be zero. But I'm not sure if this particular superposition is a squeezed state.

Wait, perhaps when phi is 0, the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, when phi is pi/2, the state would be |-alpha>, which is also Gaussian. So for other values of phi, the state is a superposition, thus non-Gaussian.

So, in our case, phi is -pi/4, which is not 0 or pi/2, so the state is a non-Gaussian state, hence the non-Gaussianity (nG) should be positive.

But looking at the options, one of them is D) 0. So perhaps under certain conditions, the non-Gaussianity is zero.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the state is a mixed state that is Gaussian. For example, if the state is a completely mixed state, it would be Gaussian, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent state after all. Let me check if it can be written as a single coherent state.

The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N.

Let me factor this as e^{i theta} [ e^{i phi'} |alpha> + e^{i phi''} |-alpha> ] / N.

But I'm not sure if that would give a coherent state. Alternatively, perhaps using displacement operators, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a cat state, which is known to be non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so option D (0) is unlikely.

Wait, but perhaps the state is a coherent state, leading to zero non-Gaussianity. Let me reconsider.

Wait, when phi is such that the state is a single coherent state. Let's see: 

If phi is 0, then the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, phi=pi/2 would give |-alpha>, also Gaussian. So for those values, the non-Gaussianity would be zero. But for other values of phi, it's a non-Gaussian state.

In our problem, phi is -pi/4, which is neither 0 nor pi/2. So the state is a non-Gaussian state, so non-Gaussianity should be positive. So options A, C, or B.

But wait, perhaps the state is actually a Gaussian state for any phi. How?

Wait, perhaps when the state is written as |beta> where beta is a complex number. Let me see.

Suppose beta = gamma e^{i theta}, and we can write |beta> as a displaced vacuum.

But in our case, the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, with real coefficients. So perhaps it can be rewritten as a single coherent state with some beta.

Wait, let's try.

Suppose |psi> = (c |alpha> + d |-alpha> ) / N.

Can this be written as |beta> where beta is some complex number?

I think no, because a coherent state is a single eigenstate of a, and a superposition of two different coherent states generally is not a coherent state unless under certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps if c and d are complex numbers with specific phases, then the state could be a single coherent state. For example, if d = e^{i theta} c, then perhaps the state can be written as a single coherent state.

Wait, let's try that. Let me suppose that d = e^{i theta} c, so the state becomes [ c |alpha> + e^{i theta} c |-alpha> ] / N.

= c [ |alpha> + e^{i theta} |-alpha> ] / N.

But for this to be a coherent state |beta>, we need:

 |beta> = e^{ -beta^2/2 } sum_{n} (beta^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>,

and the state |psi> would have to match this form. I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be rewritten as a displaced thermal state or another Gaussian state. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the problem again. The question gives a formula for delta_b, which is the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau, the Gaussian reference state.

If the state |psi> is a pure state, then the entropy S(rho) is zero. The reference Gaussian state tau would have some entropy S(tau). So delta_b would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau), which is negative, but the options are all positive, so perhaps this is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive, but that would imply that the entropy of the Gaussian state is greater than that of the non-Gaussian state, which could be the case.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the approach. Let's think differently. Maybe for a two-mode state, the non-Gaussianity can be calculated using some formula, but I'm not familiar with it.

Alternatively, perhaps the given state is a pure state, so S(rho) is zero, and the reference Gaussian state tau would have a certain entropy. So delta_b would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau), but since the options are positive, perhaps the problem defines delta_b as S(tau) - S(rho), leading to S(tau) being the entropy of the Gaussian state.

But I'm not sure. Without a clear formula to compute the entropy of a general non-Gaussian state and its reference Gaussian state, perhaps the only way is to consider when the state is Gaussian. For example, for phi=0 or phi=pi/2, the state is Gaussian, leading to nG=0. But for other values, it's non-Gaussian.

Wait, but in our case, phi is -pi/4, so the state is non-Gaussian, so nG is non-zero. So option D (0) is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the state is actually a Gaussian state for any phi. How?

Another thought: perhaps the given state is a squeezed vacuum state. Squeezed states are Gaussian. But the given state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which doesn't look like a squeezed state.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is written in position or momentum space, it's a Gaussian, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent state when alpha is zero. But alpha is 0.5 in this problem.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the given state is actually a thermal state, which is Gaussian. But the density matrix of a thermal state is diagonal in the number basis, which isn't the case here.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the options.

The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

If the state is a pure state, the entropy is zero. The reference Gaussian state's entropy would depend on its properties. But without knowing more, perhaps in certain cases, the non-Gaussianity is zero. For example, when the state is Gaussian, which would be the case when the state is a coherent state, as in phi=0 or phi=pi/2.

But in our case, phi=-pi/4, so the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So options A, B, C are possible.

But perhaps for some parameters, the state is a coherent state. Let me check.

Wait, given that the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, perhaps only when phi is 0 or pi/2 does it reduce to a single coherent state. For other phi, it's a non-Gaussian state.

So for phi=-pi/4, nG is non-zero. So the correct answer is not D.

But without knowing the exact formula to compute the non-Gaussianity, perhaps I can think of when the non-Gaussianity is zero. It would be zero only when the state is Gaussian, which would happen for phi=0 or phi=pi/2. But in our case, phi is -pi/4, so the non-Gaussianity is non-zero.

Thus, the correct answer is either A, B, or C.

But perhaps I'm missing something. Another possibility: perhaps the given state is a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, and the non-Gaussianity can be computed using the relative entropy formula.

But without knowing the specific calculation steps, perhaps I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a coherent state, making the non-Gaussianity zero. Or perhaps the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the Wigner function of the state and see if it's Gaussian.

The Wigner function for a coherent state |alpha> is a Gaussian centered at (alpha_x, alpha_p). The Wigner function for a superposition would have interference terms, making it non-Gaussian.

So, for our state being a superposition, the Wigner function would be non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity would be positive, making D) incorrect.

Since I can't compute the exact value, perhaps the answer is one of the other options. But without further insight, I can't choose between A, B, and C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the state |psi> is actually a Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity is zero. How?

Wait, perhaps for specific phi and alpha, the state |psi> can be rewritten as a single coherent state.

Let me see. Let's write |psi> as ( cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ) / N.

If we factor out something, perhaps it becomes a single coherent state plus another phase.

Wait, perhaps when phi is such that cos(phi) = sin(phi), which is at phi=pi/4, but in our case phi is -pi/4. Let me see.

Wait, cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So, the state becomes [ sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5> ] / N.

= [ |0.5> - |-0.5> ] / (N * sqrt(2)).

Hmm, perhaps this can be written as a different coherent state.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a superposition leading to a zero mean, but Gaussian in some other way.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a squeezed vacuum state. Squeezed states are Gaussian, but I don't think this is the case.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I need to proceed with the assumption that the non-Gaussianity is zero, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> is a coherent state. Let me compute the expectation values.

Earlier, we saw that <x> is zero, and similarly <p> would be zero.

The second moments would involve <x²>, <p²>, and <xp + px>.

For a coherent state, the second moments are related to the variance, which is the same for x and p. But for our state, perhaps the variances are the same as a coherent state, making it Gaussian.

Wait, but no. Because rho is a pure state, while a coherent state is also a pure state. But the state |psi> is a superposition of two different coherent states, so it's a different state.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. But I don't see how the given state would be a squeezed state.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Perhaps the answer is D) 0 because the state is Gaussian, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the state becomes a coherent state when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. 

Wait, let me think about the expectation values again.

The state |psi> has <x> = 0 and <p> = 0. The second moments would be the same as a coherent state centered at zero, which is the vacuum state. But a coherent state |0> is the vacuum, but our state is a superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5>, so it's not the vacuum state.

Wait, perhaps the state is a vacuum state. No, because |psi> is a combination of |alpha> and |-alpha> with alpha=0.5, which are not the vacuum.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. The non-Gaussianity is zero only if the state is Gaussian. Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, it's non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity is non-zero. Thus, the correct answer is not D.

But without knowing the exact calculation, I can't be sure. Another approach: perhaps the state is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian, leading to a non-zero nG. Then, the correct answer is either A, B, or C.

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C) 1.38. Alternatively, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state is such that the relative entropy becomes 1.38.

But I'm not certain. Another thought: perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero when the state is Gaussian, which would be the case if it's a coherent state. But for phi=-pi/4, it's not a coherent state, so nG is non-zero.

In the absence of further insight, I'll have to pick an answer. I'll go with option C) 1.38.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\), \(\alpha = 0.5\), and \(\phi = -\pi/4\). The relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Properties**:
   - The state is a superposition of two coherent states, \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\), with coefficients \(\cos(\phi)\) and \(\sin(\phi)\), respectively.
   - Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are generally non-Gaussian unless specific conditions are met (e.g., \(\phi = 0\) or \(\phi = \pi/2\), which reduce the state to a single coherent state).

2. **Non-Gaussianity**:
   - The given state is a Schrödinger cat state, which is known to be non-Gaussian due to its superposition structure. This implies that the non-Gaussianity (nG) should be positive for \(\phi = -\pi/4\), as the state cannot be expressed as a single Gaussian state.

3. **Density Matrix and Entropy**:
   - The density matrix \(\rho\) of the state is constructed as \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\). Since the state is a pure superposition, \(\rho\) is a pure state with von Neumann entropy \(S(\rho) = 0\).
   - The reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) would have a positive entropy \(S(\tau)\), and the non-Gaussianity is defined as the difference \(\Delta_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau)\). Since \(S(\rho) = 0\), \(\Delta_b = -S(\tau)\), which is negative. However, the problem likely defines non-Gaussianity as the absolute value of this difference, making it positive.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option D (\(nG = 0\))**: This would imply the state is Gaussian, which is incorrect for \(\phi = -\pi/4\), as the state is a non-Gaussian superposition.
   - **Options A (\(nG = 2.48\)), B (\(nG = 0.25\)), and C (\(nG = 1.38\))**: These correspond to positive non-Gaussianity values, consistent with the state being non-Gaussian. Without explicit computation, the exact value cannot be determined, but based on the structure of the problem, \(nG = 1.38\) is a plausible answer.

### Conclusion:
The state is non-Gaussian for \(\phi = -\pi/4\), and the non-Gaussianity is positive. Among the given options, the most reasonable choice is \(nG = 1.38\).
