Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, the question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and another compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find the right reagent A and catalyst B from the options.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I think this has to do with some kind of alkylation or maybe a ring expansion or contraction. Let's think about the structure of the starting material and the product.

3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring, right? Pyrrolidine is a secondary amine with a five-membered ring, so numbering the positions, the substituent is on carbon 3. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the cyclohexylidenemethyl group is attached to the pyrrolidine ring at position 1.

Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl... Oh, that's a group where a cyclohexane ring is connected via a double bond. So maybe it's like a vinyl group attached to cyclohexane. Like, perhaps it's cyclohexylidene meaning a substituted cyclohexene? Or maybe it's a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group attached via a double bond.

Wait, the product structure: 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. So that substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexene ring. Because cyclohexylidene would be a substituent with a double bond to the cyclohexane. So maybe it's a vinylic group.

So perhaps the reaction is forming a new ring or adding a substituent. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product has this cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached at position 1.

I remember that acid catalyzed reactions in amines can involve things like alkylation, maybe through an iminium ion formation. Wait, the problem says acid-catalyzed, so the catalyst is probably an acid, like TsOH or acetic acid.

So, the reaction is between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A, using catalyst B, heat, and solvent. The product is that substituted pyrrolidine.

Hmm, what reactions can form a new ring or add a substituent like that? Maybe it's a Friedländer pyrrolidine synthesis? Or perhaps a ring-opening followed by a ring-closing.

Wait, another thought: if 3-methylpyrrolidine is reacting with an aldehyde, maybe it's a case of a Mannich reaction? Or maybe it's an example of a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think about the product again. The substituent on the pyrrolidine is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. So maybe the reaction is an alkylation where a cyclohexene group is being attached.

Wait, another approach: the product has a cyclohexene ring (since cyclohexylidene implies a double bond). So perhaps the reaction is involving a ring-forming process where a cyclohexene is generated.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring expansion. Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring. If it undergoes some kind of ring expansion, perhaps via a conjugate addition, to form a six-membered ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about the options given. The options for A are either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. The catalyst options are TsOH or acetic acid.

So option A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is an aldehyde. Option C is vinylcyclohexane, which is an alkene.

In an acid-catalyzed reaction, if compound A is an aldehyde, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of addition. Alternatively, if it's a vinyl compound, perhaps it's a Michael addition or some conjugate addition.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexene ring attached. So maybe the reaction is forming a new ring by adding a double bond.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a reaction similar to the formation of a substituted pyrrolidine via a conjugate addition. Or perhaps it's a case of a vinylation.

Wait, I remember that in the presence of acid, amines can form iminium ions, which act as electrophiles. So perhaps compound A is an aldehyde, and the reaction is a kind of alkylation where the aldehyde is acting as an electrophile.

Wait, in the presence of an acid, an aldehyde could form an iminium intermediate with the amine. Then maybe another molecule attacks. Wait, but how would that form the product with the cyclohexene ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is involved in a cyclization. Wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde with a cyclohexane ring attached. So if the pyrrolidine reacts with the aldehyde, maybe it's forming a new ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of an Aldol-like reaction, but with a cyclic amine. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the aldehyde is undergoing a condensation reaction. Let me think about the product: the substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group, which is a CH2 attached to a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, if the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO attached to cyclohexane), then under acid conditions, the aldehyde might react with the amine to form an imine. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the cyclohexene part.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cyclization where the aldehyde group is used to form a new ring. Let me imagine: 3-methylpyrrolidine has a CH2 group at position 1. If that CH2 reacts with an aldehyde, perhaps it forms a ring.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a larger molecule that, upon reaction, forms a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, another approach: What's the structure of the product? The substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. So that's a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexene (which is a six-membered ring with a double bond). So, the structure is CH2-Cyclohexene.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition of the amine to an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde, which would lead to a ring formation. Wait, that rings a bell.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexene ring attached to the pyrrolidine. So perhaps the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system. For example, cyclohexenecarbaldehyde has a double bond adjacent to the aldehyde group. But the options don't have that. Option A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is just an aldehyde attached to cyclohexane, no double bond.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is an example of a vinylogous reaction. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is reacting to form a new ring via a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, maybe the compound A is a ketone, but no, the options are aldehyde and vinylcyclohexane.

Wait, let's think about the other option, where A is vinylcyclohexane. So vinylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with a vinyl group attached. So, it's like CH2=CH-cyclohexane, but perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene.

So, if compound A is vinylcyclohexane, and the reaction is acid-catalyzed, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? But 3-methylpyrrolidine is a diene? Wait, pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with one nitrogen. I don't think it's a diene, as the ring is saturated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of alkylation via a vinyl group. The acid might protonate the amine, making it a better electrophile, and then the vinylcyclohexane would add on.

Wait, but vinylcyclohexane has a double bond. In an acid-catalyzed reaction, perhaps it's undergoing an addition of the amine to the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a case of ring-opening of an epoxide, but I don't see how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, where the amine attacks a beta position of a carbonyl.

Wait, if A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO attached to cyclohexane), then under acidic conditions, the aldehyde would form an iminium ion with the amine. Then perhaps another molecule of aldehyde would add, but I'm not sure how that would form the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Stork enamine reaction. Enamine chemistry involves the formation of a new ring when an enamine reacts with a carbonyl compound. So, let me think: the 3-methylpyrrolidine would react with a carbonyl (like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) under acid catalysis to form an enamine, which can then undergo various cyclizations.

But wait, the product in this case is a substituted pyrrolidine, not a ring expansion. Hmm.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group.

If the reaction is forming this substituent, perhaps the aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) is being used to add a cyclohexyl group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a larger ring formation. Wait, maybe the aldehyde reacts with the amine to form a ring. Let me think: the amine has a CH2 group that could attack the aldehyde, forming a new ring.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has a five-membered ring. If the CH2 at position 1 attacks an aldehyde, it would form a six-membered ring? Let me sketch it out mentally.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So position 1 is adjacent to the nitrogen. If the amine at position 1 attacks an aldehyde (like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde), that would form a new ring.

So, the aldehyde is O=CH-cyclohexane. The 3-methylpyrrolidine's CH2 at position 1 would attack the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon, forming an imine. But wait, if it's under acidic conditions, it would form an iminium ion.

Wait, but the product has a cyclohexene ring attached as a substituent. So, perhaps the aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) is being converted into a cyclohexene ring through some elimination.

Wait, here's a thought: the aldehyde can undergo an acid-catalyzed dehydration to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. But cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is not conjugated, so perhaps it's not that.

Alternatively, perhaps under acidic conditions, the aldehyde is being converted into an enol or enolate, which then reacts.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Options for A are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane.

If the reaction is acid-catalyzed and involves an aldehyde, perhaps it's a case of a conjugate addition. Wait, but without conjugation, maybe not.

Alternatively, if A is vinylcyclohexane, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition of the amine to the double bond. But that would form a secondary amine with the cyclohexane ring. But the product is a pyrrolidine with a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the vinylcyclohexane is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. But I'm not sure if the amine would act as a dienophile or a diene. Wait, pyrrolidine is a saturated ring, so maybe not a diene.

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group is forming a new ring when it reacts with the amine.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the possible catalysts. The options are TsOH or acetic acid. Both are acidic catalysts, but TsOH is a strong acid (para-toluenesulfonic acid), while acetic acid is a weaker acid.

In acid-catalyzed reactions, the strength of the acid might matter depending on the reaction. For example, for certain eliminations, a strong acid might be needed.

Wait, considering the product, the substituent is a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group. That structure suggests that the substituent contains a double bond, which might have formed via an elimination reaction.

So, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a double bond, which would require an elimination step.

Hmm. So maybe the starting material reacts with compound A in a way that forms a new double bond.

If compound A is an aldehyde, perhaps it's involved in a condensation reaction that forms a ring with a double bond.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which is the base-catalyzed condensation of an aromatic aldehyde with a ketone to form a chalcone. But this is acid-catalyzed, so that might not apply.

Wait, but the presence of an acid might lead to a different mechanism. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed aldol reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. So that's a CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring. That structure suggests that the substituent is a cyclohexene which is connected via a methylene bridge.

So another possibility is that the cyclohexene is formed via a ring-opening or ring-forming reaction. Maybe the starting material adds to a cycloalkane via ring-opening, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion. Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring. If it undergoes a ring expansion to a six-membered ring, perhaps incorporating the cyclohexane part.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe through a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, like Cope or Claisen. But I'm not sure if that would produce the product in question.

Wait, another angle: The product's substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. So perhaps that group is formed via a ring-forming reaction where a six-membered ring is created, involving the amine.

Wait, think about the possible reaction when a secondary amine reacts with a carbonyl. That could form an imine, but under acidic conditions, perhaps with some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the formation of an enamine, which involves the reaction of an amine with a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, enamine formation typically involves two steps: first, the amine attacking a carbonyl to form an iminium ion, which then loses water to form the enamine. Enamines are useful in various reactions, including conjugate additions.

But in this case, the product is a substituted pyrrolidine, so maybe the enamine is involved in a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, here's a thought: The 3-methylpyrrolidine could react with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form an enamine, which then undergoes a cyclization to form a new ring, incorporating the cyclohexane part.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is acting as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is an acid-catalyzed alkylation, where the amine's lone pair attacks an electrophilic carbon.

If compound A is an aldehyde, then under acidic conditions, the aldehyde could be protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. The amine could then attack, forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Wait, but in that case, the product would have an aldehyde-derived substituent. So, 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a substituent from the aldehyde. So the substituent would be a CH2-cyclohexane group? Because cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is O=CH-C6H11.

So attacking that would give a CH2-cyclohexane group attached to the amine.

Wait, but the product's substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group, which is CH2-Cyclohexene. So that implies that the substituent has a double bond.

So, perhaps after the initial formation of the aldehyde-derived substituent, an elimination occurs to form the double bond.

Wait, but in the reaction conditions, we have heat. So perhaps after the initial addition, elimination occurs under heat to form the double bond.

So, let's imagine the sequence:

1. 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (A) under acid (B).

2. The amine attacks the aldehyde, forming a new C-N bond. That would add a cyclohexylmethyl group (CH2-C6H11) to the pyrrolidine.

3. Then, under heat, an elimination occurs, removing a water molecule and forming a double bond. So the substituent becomes CH2-Cyclohexene.

That would explain the product: 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine.

So, the reaction would involve nucleophilic attack by the amine on the aldehyde, followed by elimination to form the double bond.

But wait, to form the cyclohexene, perhaps the cyclohexane ring undergoes some ring-opening and re-closing. Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the aldehyde is not the right choice. Let me think about the other option, which is vinylcyclohexane.

If A is vinylcyclohexane, then under acidic conditions, perhaps the amine reacts with the double bond.

In an acid-catalyzed addition to a double bond, the mechanism could involve the amine acting as a nucleophile, attacking the protonated double bond.

So, vinylcyclohexane has a structure like CH2=CH-C6H11. Under acid, the double bond becomes protonated, making it more electrophilic.

The amine (3-methylpyrrolidine) could attack the protonated double bond, leading to a new C-N bond.

But how would that lead to the product with the cyclohexene substituent?

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in vinylcyclohexane is part of a conjugated system. I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The product has a cyclohexene ring as a substituent. So perhaps the vinyl group is being incorporated into the substituent.

If the amine attacks the vinyl group, perhaps forming a new ring. For example, the nitrogen could attack one end of the double bond, and another part of the molecule could form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cycloaddition. But under acidic conditions, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the amine is adding across the double bond, and then eliminating to form a ring.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it. Let me think about the possible products with each option.

Option A: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is TsOH.

Reaction: 3-methylpyrrolidine + cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, acid catalyst.

Possibly forms an imine, then elimination to form a double bond in the substituent.

So that would give the cyclohexylidenemethyl group.

Option B: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is acetic acid.

Same as above, but using a different acid.

Option C: A is vinylcyclohexane, B is acetic acid.

So the amine reacts with vinylcyclohexane under acid.

Option D: A is vinylcyclohexane, B is TsOH.

So for the reaction to produce the cyclohexene substituent, options A and B involve an aldehyde, whereas options C and D involve a vinyl compound.

In the scenario where A is an aldehyde, the product would have a substituent formed from the aldehyde, possibly with elimination to form a double bond.

In the scenario where A is a vinyl compound, the product might incorporate the vinyl group into the substituent.

So, going back, if the product substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl, which is CH2-C6H10 (since cyclohexene is C6H10?), then perhaps the reaction with the aldehyde would form that.

Wait, another thought: When an aldehyde reacts with an amine in acidic conditions, it forms an imine. But imines typically require heat and sometimes a reducing agent to form the more stable form.

Wait, but if it's an acid-catalyzed reaction without a reducing agent, perhaps it's not an imine but an iminium ion, which is a resonance-stabilized structure.

In any case, the substituent would come from the aldehyde. So if the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then the substituent would be a cyclohexylmethyl group. But the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group, which is a double bond.

So, perhaps after forming the imine (or iminium), there's an elimination step that forms the double bond.

So, the reaction would proceed as:

3-methylpyrrolidine + cyclohexanecarbaldehyde → imine formation → elimination → cyclohexylidenemethyl group.

That would fit the product structure.

So, the reagent A would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and catalyst B would be an acid, either TsOH or acetic acid.

So looking at the options:

Option A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.

Option B: A = same, B = acetic acid.

So which acid is more suitable as a catalyst for this reaction?

Typically, imine formation can be acid-catalyzed, but sometimes a mild acid is sufficient. TsOH is a strong acid, and acetic acid is a weaker acid.

In the presence of heat, perhaps a strong acid is needed. Alternatively, the reaction might require a strong acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen and make the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by the amine.

But I'm not entirely sure which acid is more appropriate here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Mannich reaction, which involves an aldehyde, an amine, and a ketone or another aldehyde. But in this case, the product seems to involve a ring expansion or substitution.

Wait, another thought: If the reaction is forming an enamine, the usual process is to first form the imine, then eliminate water to form the enamine. Enamine formation typically uses a ketone or aldehyde and an amine, with acid catalysis.

In this case, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the other reagent is an aldehyde. So, perhaps the reaction forms an enamine, which would have a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen.

But the product isn't an enamine; it's a substituted pyrrolidine with a cyclohexene substituent.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure of the product again. The substituent is CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring.

If the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, the position 1 is adjacent to the nitrogen. So, if a substituent is added there, it's via the nitrogen.

Wait, but the substituent is attached via a methylene group, so perhaps the reaction is forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is undergoing a conjugate addition to an enamine. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a ring-opening reaction.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

If the product is formed from 3-methylpyrrolidine and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then the substituent would be a cyclohexylmethyl group with an elimination to form the double bond.

So, the reaction would be:

3-methylpyrrolidine + cyclohexanecarbaldehyde → [imine] → [elimination] → 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine.

So, the key steps are imine formation and elimination. Which conditions facilitate this?

Imine formation typically requires an acid catalyst, like HCl or TsOH. But in some cases, acetic acid can also be used.

In the presence of heat, the imine might undergo elimination. So, the reaction would require an acid catalyst and heat.

Looking at the options, for A being cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, the catalyst could be TsOH (option A) or acetic acid (option B).

I think TsOH might be a stronger acid, which could help in the imine formation and subsequent elimination.

Alternatively, both catalysts might work, but perhaps TsOH is more effective in this case.

So, the correct option would be A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.

Wait, but why not acetic acid? Because TsOH is a stronger acid and provides better protonation for the reaction to proceed.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another angle: the formation of the enamine (if that's what's happening) would typically use a ketone, but here it's an aldehyde. So maybe the reaction is straightforward imine formation followed by elimination.

In any case, I think the correct answer is option A: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with TsOH as the catalyst.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with compound A under acid-catalyzed conditions to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group, which is a CH₂ group attached to a cyclohexene ring. This suggests that the reaction involves the formation of a new substituent on the pyrrolidine ring, likely through nucleophilic attack on an electrophilic carbon followed by elimination to form the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A (A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH):**  
   Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde with a cyclohexane ring. Under acidic conditions, the aldehyde can form an iminium ion with the amine in 3-methylpyrrolidine. This intermediate can then undergo elimination to form the cyclohexylidenemethyl group. TsOH, being a strong acid, is suitable for facilitating both the imine formation and the elimination step.

2. **Option B (A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = acetic acid):**  
   Similar to Option A, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde can react with 3-methylpyrrolidine to form the product. However, acetic acid is a weaker acid compared to TsOH. While it can catalyze the reaction, TsOH is more effective in facilitating the imine formation and elimination, especially under heat.

3. **Option C (A = vinylcyclohexane, B = acetic acid):**  
   Vinylcyclohexane contains a double bond and a cyclohexane ring. However, the reaction mechanism for forming the cyclohexylidenemethyl group from vinylcyclohexane is unclear. This option does not align well with the product structure.

4. **Option D (A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH):**  
   Similar to Option C, the use of vinylcyclohexane does not clearly explain the formation of the cyclohexylidenemethyl group. The reaction mechanism remains ambiguous, making this option less plausible.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible pathway involves the reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde under strong acid catalysis (TsOH). This facilitates imine formation and subsequent elimination to yield the cyclohexylidenemethyl group. While acetic acid could also work, TsOH is more effective for this reaction.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, the question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and another compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find the right reagent A and catalyst B from the options.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I think this has to do with some kind of alkylation or maybe a ring expansion or contraction. Let's think about the structure of the starting material and the product.

3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring, right? Pyrrolidine is a secondary amine with a five-membered ring, so numbering the positions, the substituent is on carbon 3. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the cyclohexylidenemethyl group is attached to the pyrrolidine ring at position 1.

Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl... Oh, that's a group where a cyclohexane ring is connected via a double bond. So maybe it's like a vinyl group attached to cyclohexane. Like, perhaps it's cyclohexylidene meaning a substituted cyclohexene? Or maybe it's a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group attached via a double bond.

Wait, the product structure: 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. So that substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexene ring. Because cyclohexylidene would be a substituent with a double bond to the cyclohexane. So maybe it's a vinylic group.

So perhaps the reaction is forming a new ring or adding a substituent. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the product has this cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached at position 1.

I remember that acid catalyzed reactions in amines can involve things like alkylation, maybe through an iminium ion formation. Wait, the problem says acid-catalyzed, so the catalyst is probably an acid, like TsOH or acetic acid.

So, the reaction is between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A, using catalyst B, heat, and solvent. The product is that substituted pyrrolidine.

Wait, another approach: the product has a cyclohexene ring (since cyclohexylidene implies a double bond). So perhaps the reaction is involving a ring-forming process where a cyclohexene is generated.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ring expansion. Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring. If it undergoes some kind of ring expansion, perhaps via a conjugate addition, to form a six-membered ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about the options given. The options for A are either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. The catalyst options are TsOH or acetic acid.

So option A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is an aldehyde. Option C is vinylcyclohexane, which is an alkene.

Wait, in the presence of an acid, an aldehyde could form an iminium intermediate with the amine. Then maybe another molecule attacks. Wait, but how would that form the product with the cyclohexene ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is involved in a cyclization. Wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde with a cyclohexane ring attached. So if the pyrrolidine reacts with the aldehyde, maybe it's forming a new ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of an Aldol-like reaction, but with a cyclic amine. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the aldehyde is undergoing a condensation reaction. Let me think about the product: the substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group, which is a CH2 attached to a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, if the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO attached to cyclohexane), then under acid conditions, the aldehyde might react with the amine to form an imine. But I'm not sure how that would lead to the cyclohexene part.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cyclization where the aldehyde group is used to form a new ring. Let me imagine: 3-methylpyrrolidine has a CH2 group at position 1. If that CH2 reacts with an aldehyde, perhaps it forms a ring.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a larger molecule that, upon reaction, forms a cyclohexene ring.

So, if compound A is vinylcyclohexane, and the reaction is acid-catalyzed, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? But 3-methylpyrrolidine is a diene? Wait, pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with one nitrogen. I don't think it's a diene, as the ring is saturated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of alkylation via a vinyl group. The acid might protonate the amine, making it a better electrophile, and then the vinylcyclohexane would add on.

Wait, but vinylcyclohexane has a double bond. In an acid-catalyzed reaction, perhaps it's undergoing an addition of the amine to the double bond. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a case of ring-opening of an epoxide, but I don't see how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, where the amine attacks a beta position of a carbonyl.

Wait, if A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (CHO attached to cyclohexane), then under acidic conditions, the aldehyde would form an iminium ion with the amine. Then perhaps another molecule of aldehyde would add, but I'm not sure how that would form the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Stork enamine reaction. Enamine chemistry involves the formation of a new ring when an enamine reacts with a carbonyl compound. So, let me think: the 3-methylpyrrolidine would react with a carbonyl (like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) under acid catalysis to form an enamine, which can then undergo various cyclizations.

But wait, the product in this case is a substituted pyrrolidine, not a ring expansion. Hmm.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the substituent is a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group.

If the reaction is forming this substituent, perhaps the aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) is being used to add a cyclohexyl group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a larger ring formation. Wait, maybe the aldehyde reacts with the amine to form a ring. Let me think: the amine has a CH2 group that could attack the aldehyde, forming a new ring.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine has a five-membered ring. If the CH2 at position 1 attacks an aldehyde, it would form a six-membered ring? Let me sketch it out mentally.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So position 1 is adjacent to the nitrogen. If the amine at position 1 attacks an aldehyde (like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde), that would form a new ring.

So, the aldehyde is O=CH-cyclohexane. The 3-methylpyrrolidine's CH2 at position 1 would attack the aldehyde's carbonyl carbon, forming an imine. But wait, if it's under acidic conditions, it would form an iminium ion.

Wait, but the product has a cyclohexene ring attached as a substituent. So, perhaps the aldehyde (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde) is being converted into a cyclohexene ring through some elimination.

Wait, here's a thought: the aldehyde can undergo an acid-catalyzed dehydration to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. But cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is not conjugated, so perhaps it's not that.

Alternatively, perhaps under acidic conditions, the aldehyde is being converted into an enol or enolate, which then reacts.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Options for A are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane.

If the reaction is acid-catalyzed and involves an aldehyde, perhaps it's a case of a conjugate addition. Wait, but without conjugation, maybe not.

Alternatively, if A is vinylcyclohexane, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition of the amine to the double bond. But that would form a secondary amine with the cyclohexane ring. But the product is a pyrrolidine with a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the vinylcyclohexane is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. But I'm not sure if the amine would act as a dienophile or a diene. Wait, pyrrolidine is a saturated ring, so maybe not a diene.

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group is forming a new ring when it reacts with the amine.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the possible catalysts. The options are TsOH or acetic acid. Both are acidic catalysts, but TsOH is a strong acid (para-toluenesulfonic acid), while acetic acid is a weaker acid.

In acid-catalyzed reactions, the strength of the acid might matter depending on the reaction. For example, for certain eliminations, a strong acid might be needed.

Wait, considering the product, the substituent is a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group. That structure suggests that the substituent contains a double bond, which might have formed via an elimination reaction.

So, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a double bond, which would require an elimination step.

Hmm. So maybe the starting material reacts with compound A in a way that forms a new double bond.

If compound A is an aldehyde, perhaps it's involved in a condensation reaction that forms a ring with a double bond.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps the reaction is a Claisen-Schmidt condensation, which is the base-catalyzed condensation of an aromatic aldehyde with a ketone to form a chalcone. But this is acid-catalyzed, so that might not apply.

Wait, but the presence of an acid might lead to a different mechanism. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed aldol reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. So that's a CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring. That structure suggests that the substituent is a cyclohexene which is connected via a methylene bridge.

So another possibility is that the cyclohexene is formed via a ring-opening or ring-forming reaction. Maybe the starting material adds to a cycloalkane via ring-opening, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion. Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring. If it undergoes a ring expansion to a six-membered ring, perhaps incorporating the cyclohexane part.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe through a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, like Cope or Claisen. But I'm not sure if that would produce the product in question.

Wait, another angle: The product's substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. So perhaps that group is formed via a ring-forming reaction where a six-membered ring is created, involving the amine.

Wait, think about the possible reaction when a secondary amine reacts with a carbonyl. That could form an imine, but under acidic conditions, perhaps with some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the formation of an enamine, which involves the reaction of an amine with a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, enamine formation typically involves two steps: first, the amine attacking a carbonyl to form an iminium ion, which then loses water to form the enamine. Enamines are useful in various reactions, including conjugate additions.

But in this case, the product is a substituted pyrrolidine, so maybe the enamine is involved in a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, here's a thought: The 3-methylpyrrolidine could react with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde to form an enamine, which then undergoes a cyclization to form a new ring, incorporating the cyclohexane part.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is acting as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is an acid-catalyzed alkylation, where the amine's lone pair attacks an electrophilic carbon.

If compound A is an aldehyde, then under acidic conditions, the aldehyde could be protonated, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. The amine could then attack, forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond.

Wait, but in that case, the product would have an aldehyde-derived substituent. So, 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a substituent from the aldehyde. So the substituent would be a CH2-cyclohexane group? Because cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is O=CH-C6H11.

So attacking that would give a CH2-cyclohexane group attached to the amine.

Wait, but the product's substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group, which is CH2-Cyclohexene. So that implies that the substituent has a double bond.

So, perhaps after the initial formation of the aldehyde-derived substituent, an elimination occurs to form the double bond.

Wait, but in the reaction conditions, we have heat. So perhaps after the initial addition, elimination occurs under heat to form the double bond.

So, let's imagine the sequence:

1. 3-methylpyrrolidine reacts with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (A) under acid (B).

2. The amine attacks the aldehyde, forming a new C-N bond. That would add a cyclohexylmethyl group (CH2-C6H11) to the pyrrolidine.

3. Then, under heat, an elimination occurs, removing a water molecule and forming a double bond. So the substituent becomes CH2-Cyclohexene.

That would explain the product: 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine.

So, the reaction would involve nucleophilic attack by the amine on the aldehyde, followed by elimination to form the double bond.

But wait, to form the cyclohexene, perhaps the cyclohexane ring undergoes some ring-opening and re-closing. Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the aldehyde is not the right choice. Let me think about the other option, which is vinylcyclohexane.

If A is vinylcyclohexane, then under acidic conditions, perhaps the amine reacts with the double bond.

In an acid-catalyzed addition to a double bond, the mechanism could involve the amine acting as a nucleophile, attacking the protonated double bond.

So, vinylcyclohexane has a structure like CH2=CH-C6H11. Under acid, the double bond becomes protonated, making it more electrophilic.

The amine (3-methylpyrrolidine) could attack the protonated double bond, leading to a new C-N bond.

But how would that lead to the product with the cyclohexene substituent?

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in vinylcyclohexane is part of a conjugated system. I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The product has a cyclohexene ring as a substituent. So perhaps the vinyl group is being incorporated into the substituent.

If the amine attacks the vinyl group, perhaps forming a new ring. For example, the nitrogen could attack one end of the double bond, and another part of the molecule could form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cycloaddition. But under acidic conditions, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the amine is adding across the double bond, and then eliminating to form a ring.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it. Let me think about the possible products with each option.

Option A: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is TsOH.

Reaction: 3-methylpyrrolidine + cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, acid catalyst.

Possibly forms an imine, then elimination to form a double bond in the substituent.

So that would give the cyclohexylidenemethyl group.

Option B: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B is acetic acid.

Same as above, but using a different acid.

Option C: A is vinylcyclohexane, B is acetic acid.

So the amine reacts with vinylcyclohexane under acid.

Option D: A is vinylcyclohexane, B is TsOH.

So for the reaction to produce the cyclohexene substituent, options A and B involve an aldehyde, whereas options C and D involve a vinyl compound.

In the scenario where A is an aldehyde, the product would have a substituent formed from the aldehyde, possibly with elimination to form a double bond.

In the scenario where A is a vinyl compound, the product might incorporate the vinyl group into the substituent.

So, going back, if the product substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl, which is CH2-C6H10 (since cyclohexene is C6H10?), then perhaps the reaction with the aldehyde would form that.

Wait, another thought: When an aldehyde reacts with an amine in acidic conditions, it forms an imine. But imines typically require heat and sometimes a reducing agent to form the more stable form.

Wait, but if it's an acid-catalyzed reaction without a reducing agent, perhaps it's not an imine but an iminium ion, which is a resonance-stabilized structure.

In any case, the substituent would come from the aldehyde. So if the aldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then the substituent would be a cyclohexylmethyl group. But the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group, which is a double bond.

So, perhaps after forming the imine (or iminium), there's an elimination step that forms the double bond.

So, the reaction would proceed as:

3-methylpyrrolidine + cyclohexanecarbaldehyde → imine formation → elimination → cyclohexylidenemethyl group.

That would fit the product structure.

So, the reagent A would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and catalyst B would be an acid, either TsOH or acetic acid.

So looking at the options:

Option A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.

Option B: A = same, B = acetic acid.

So which acid is more suitable as a catalyst for this reaction?

Typically, imine formation can be acid-catalyzed, but sometimes a mild acid is sufficient. TsOH is a strong acid, and acetic acid is a weaker acid.

In the presence of heat, perhaps a strong acid is needed. Alternatively, the reaction might require a strong acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen and make the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by the amine.

But I'm not entirely sure which acid is more appropriate here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Mannich reaction, which involves an aldehyde, an amine, and a ketone or another aldehyde. But in this case, the product seems to involve a ring expansion or substitution.

Wait, another thought: If the reaction is forming an enamine, the usual process is to first form the imine, then eliminate water to form the enamine. Enamine formation typically uses a ketone or aldehyde and an amine, with acid catalysis.

In this case, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, and the other reagent is an aldehyde. So, perhaps the reaction forms an enamine, which would have a double bond adjacent to the nitrogen.

But the product isn't an enamine; it's a substituted pyrrolidine with a cyclohexene substituent.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure of the product again. The substituent is CH2 connected to a cyclohexene ring.

If the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, the position 1 is adjacent to the nitrogen. So, if a substituent is added there, it's via the nitrogen.

Wait, but the substituent is attached via a methylene group, so perhaps the reaction is forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is undergoing a conjugate addition to an enamine. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a ring-opening reaction.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

If the product is formed from 3-methylpyrrolidine and cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, then the substituent would be a cyclohexylmethyl group with an elimination to form the double bond.

So, the reaction would be:

3-methylpyrrolidine + cyclohexanecarbaldehyde → [imine] → [elimination] → 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine.

So, the key steps are imine formation and elimination. Which conditions facilitate this?

Imine formation typically requires an acid catalyst, like HCl or TsOH. But in some cases, acetic acid can also be used.

In the presence of heat, the imine might undergo elimination. So, the reaction would require an acid catalyst and heat.

Looking at the options, for A being cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, the catalyst could be TsOH (option A) or acetic acid (option B).

I think TsOH might be a stronger acid, which could help in the imine formation and subsequent elimination.

Alternatively, both catalysts might work, but perhaps TsOH is more effective in this case.

So, the correct option would be A: A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH.

Wait, but why not acetic acid? Because TsOH is a stronger acid and provides better protonation for the reaction to proceed.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another angle: the formation of the enamine (if that's what's happening) would typically use a ketone, but here it's an aldehyde. So maybe the reaction is straightforward imine formation followed by elimination.

In any case, I think the correct answer is option A: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with TsOH as the catalyst.


The reaction involves 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with compound A under acid-catalyzed conditions to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group, which is a CH₂ group attached to a cyclohexene ring. This suggests that the reaction involves the formation of a new substituent on the pyrrolidine ring, likely through nucleophilic attack on an electrophilic carbon followed by elimination to form the double bond in the cyclohexene ring.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A (A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = TsOH):**  
   Cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde with a cyclohexane ring. Under acidic conditions, the aldehyde can form an iminium ion with the amine in 3-methylpyrrolidine. This intermediate can then undergo elimination to form the cyclohexylidenemethyl group. TsOH, being a strong acid, is suitable for facilitating both the imine formation and the elimination step.

2. **Option B (A = cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, B = acetic acid):**  
   Similar to Option A, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde can react with 3-methylpyrrolidine to form the product. However, acetic acid is a weaker acid compared to TsOH. While it can catalyze the reaction, TsOH is more effective in facilitating the imine formation and elimination, especially under heat.

3. **Option C (A = vinylcyclohexane, B = acetic acid):**  
   Vinylcyclohexane contains a double bond and a cyclohexane ring. However, the reaction mechanism for forming the cyclohexylidenemethyl group from vinylcyclohexane is unclear. This option does not align well with the product structure.

4. **Option D (A = vinylcyclohexane, B = TsOH):**  
   Similar to Option C, the use of vinylcyclohexane does not clearly explain the formation of the cyclohexylidenemethyl group. The reaction mechanism remains ambiguous, making this option less plausible.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible pathway involves the reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with cyclohexanecarbaldehyde under strong acid catalysis (TsOH). This facilitates imine formation and subsequent elimination to yield the cyclohexylidenemethyl group. While acetic acid could also work, TsOH is more effective for this reaction.
