Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion (Pi+) at rest decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). 

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, energy and momentum have to be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero, so the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. That probably means the muon and neutrino move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have such a tiny mass, almost considered massless. Oh wait, in this problem, maybe I should treat the neutrino as massless since the problem doesn't specify its mass. So the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV/c², and the pion is 139.6 MeV/c².

The decay equation is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. So the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the muon and neutrino should cancel each other out, meaning their magnitudes are equal and opposite. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy would be equal to its momentum times c. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Let me think about conservation of energy first. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy can be written in terms of its rest mass and kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + KE_mu. Similarly, the neutrino's energy is just E_nu = p_nu c, since its mass is negligible (assuming it's zero). 

But wait, because momentum is conserved, the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) and the neutrino's momentum (p_nu) must be equal. Because the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay is zero, so p_mu = -p_nu. So the magnitudes are the same.

So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me outline the knowns:

- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c² (rest mass)
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
- m_nu is negligible, so m_nu ≈ 0.

Conservation of energy: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

E_pi is the rest energy of the pion: E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon: sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

E_nu is the energy of the neutrino: since m_nu c² ≈ 0, E_nu = p_nu c.

But since the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, p_mu = -p_nu. So |p_mu|=|p_nu|=p.

So, E_nu = p c.

Also, because p_mu = p, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

Putting it all together, energy conservation:

139.6 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c

Hmm, that looks like an equation I can solve for p c. Let me denote x = p c for simplicity.

So: 139.6 = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 x + x²

So, subtract left side:

x² + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x + x²

Wait, let's calculate 105.7 squared. 105 *105 is 11025, 105.7^2 is roughly 105.7 *105.7. Let me compute it: 105^2 = 11025, (0.7)^2=0.49, and cross terms: 2*105*0.7=147. So 11025 + 147 + 0.49= 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6 squared: 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2=0.36, and 2*139*0.6 = 166.8. So (139.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 +166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16.

So back to the equation:

x² + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Now, bringing terms to one side:

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49: Let's subtract 11000 from 19488.16 gives 8488.16, then subtract 172.49, so 8488.16 - 172.49 = 8315.67.

So 279.2 x = 8315.67 → x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's calculate that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2:

Well, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 30 is a bit high. 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. The difference between 8315.67 and 8096.8 is 218.87.

218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So x ≈ 29.783. Approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, x is p c, so p = x/(c). But maybe I can just keep using x as the product of p and c for now.

So x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but let me double-check the division. 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is larger than 8315.67. So 30 is too much. So 29.78 is approximately 29.78, right?

So E_nu = x ≈29.78 MeV.

And E_mu = sqrt( x^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78 squared: approx 887. So 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.

sqrt(12059.49) is approximately 109.8 MeV.

Wait, 109.8? Let me see: 109^2=11881, 109.8^2= (109 +0.8)^2= 109² + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2= 11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 12056.04. Which is close to 12059.49. So E_mu ≈109.8 MeV.

But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c².

So KE_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV. Hmm, looking at the options, option D's muon KE is 4.12 MeV and neutrino's is 29.8 MeV. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but did I calculate x correctly? Let's go back to the equation:

279.2 x = 8315.67 → x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this accurately. Let's do 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. Because 279.2 * 30= 8376, which is larger than 8315.67.

The difference between 8315.67 and 8096.8 is 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 = approximately 0.783.

So x =29 + 0.783≈29.783 MeV.

So E_nu=29.783 MeV. That's about 29.8 MeV, which matches option D.

KE_mu is E_mu - m_mu c². E_mu is sqrt( x² + m_mu^2 ). So:

E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( 887.06 + 11172.49 ) = sqrt(12059.55) ≈109.83 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.83 - 105.7 =4.13 MeV. But the options have 4.12, which is close. Hmm, perhaps I should carry more decimal places.

Wait, maybe I made an approximation. Let me recalculate x more accurately.

The equation after expansion:

x² + 11172.49 = 19488.16 -279.2 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

11172.49 =19488.16 -279.2 x

Rearranged:

279.2 x = 19488.16 -11172.49

Compute 19488.16 -11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 -0.49)

19488-11172=8316, and 0.16-0.49= -0.33 → 8316 -0.33=8315.67.

So 279.2 x=8315.67 → x=8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this division precisely.

279.2 into 8315.67.

Calculate 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 *29=8096.8.

279.2 * 29.783 ≈8315.67? Let's see:

279.2 * 29 =8096.8.

Now, 0.783 *279.2 = ?

0.783 *200=156.6

0.783 *79.2= ?

79.2 * 0.7= 55.44, 79.2 *0.08=6.336, 79.2 *0.003=0.2376. Summing:55.44+6.336=61.776 +0.2376=62.0136.

So 0.783 *279.2 =156.6 +62.0136=218.6136.

So 29 +0.783 =29.783 → 29.783 *279.2 =8096.8 +218.6136= 8315.4136.

But 8315.4136 is very close to 8315.67. So x=29.783 MeV/c.

So E_nu=x=29.783 MeV, which is about 29.8 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.783^2: 29.783 *29.783.

Well, 30^2=900, so 29.783 is 30 -0.217.

(30 -0.217)^2= 900 - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2=900 -12.  0.217*60=13.02 → 900-13.02=886.98 + 0.047=887.027.

So 29.783²≈887.027.

Adding m_mu²: 105.7²=11172.49.

So 887.027 +11172.49=12059.517.

sqrt(12059.517)≈ let's calculate.

We know 109.8^2=12056.04 (Wait, earlier I thought 109.8 squared is around 12056, but let me recalculate:

109.8 *109.8 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 110² - 2*110*0.2 +0.2²= 12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.

But our total is 12059.517. So what's the square root?

Between 109.8 and 109.9.

Compute 109.8^2=12056.04.

109.8 + delta)^2 =12059.517.

So (109.8 + delta)^2 =12056.04 + 2*109.8*delta + delta^2 =12059.517.

Assuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible.

So 2*109.8 * delta ≈ 12059.517 -12056.04=3.477.

So 219.6 * delta ≈3.477 → delta≈3.477/219.6≈0.0158.

So sqrt ≈109.8 +0.0158=109.8158 MeV.

So E_mu≈109.8158 MeV.

So KE_mu=E_mu - m_mu c²= 109.8158 - 105.7=4.1158 MeV≈4.12 MeV.

So the muon has KE≈4.12 MeV, and the neutrino has E_nu≈29.78 MeV. So the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

Wait, but neutrinos have some mass, but in this problem, we can probably ignore it. So the neutrino's KE is equal to its energy, which is 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion (Pi⁺) into a muon (mu⁺) and a neutrino (nu). Conservation of energy and momentum must be applied.

### Key Information:
- Rest mass of Pi⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Rest mass of muon: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Neutrino mass is negligible (\( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \)).
- The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

### Conservation of Energy:
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4},
\]
and the neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c.
\]
Since momentum is conserved, \( |p_{\mu}| = |p_{\nu}| = p \). Thus, \( E_{\nu} = p c \), and substituting into the energy conservation equation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (105.7)^2} + p c.
\]

### Solving for \( p c \):
Let \( x = p c \). The equation becomes:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x.
\]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]
Square both sides:
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x + x^2.
\]
Cancel \( x^2 \) and rearrange:
\[
279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]
\[
279.2 x = 8315.67.
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Thus, \( E_{\nu} = p c = 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Muon's Energy and Kinetic Energy:
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.027 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.517} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The muon's kinetic energy is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the neutrino's energy is approximately \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion (Pi+) at rest decays into a muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). 

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, energy and momentum have to be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero, so the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. That probably means the muon and neutrino move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have such a tiny mass, almost considered massless. Oh wait, in this problem, maybe I should treat the neutrino as massless since the problem doesn't specify its mass. So the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV/c², and the pion is 139.6 MeV/c².

The decay equation is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. So the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the final momenta of the muon and neutrino should cancel each other out, meaning their magnitudes are equal and opposite. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy would be equal to its momentum times c. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Let me think about conservation of energy first. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's energy can be written in terms of its rest mass and kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + KE_mu. Similarly, the neutrino's energy is just E_nu = p_nu c, since its mass is negligible (assuming it's zero). 

But wait, because momentum is conserved, the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) and the neutrino's momentum (p_nu) must be equal. Because the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay is zero, so p_mu = -p_nu. So the magnitudes are the same.

So, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me outline the knowns:

- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c² (rest mass)
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
- m_nu is negligible, so m_nu ≈ 0.

Conservation of energy: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

E_pi is the rest energy of the pion: E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon: sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

E_nu is the energy of the neutrino: since m_nu c² ≈ 0, E_nu = p_nu c.

But since the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, p_mu = -p_nu. So |p_mu|=|p_nu|=p.

So, E_nu = p c.

Also, because p_mu = p, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

Putting it all together, energy conservation:

139.6 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c

Hmm, that looks like an equation I can solve for p c. Let me denote x = p c for simplicity.

So: 139.6 = sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 x + x²

So, subtract left side:

x² + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x + x²

Wait, let's calculate 105.7 squared. 105 *105 is 11025, 105.7^2 is roughly 105.7 *105.7. Let me compute it: 105^2 = 11025, (0.7)^2=0.49, and cross terms: 2*105*0.7=147. So 11025 + 147 + 0.49= 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6 squared: 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2=0.36, and 2*139*0.6 = 166.8. So (139.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 +166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16.

So back to the equation:

x² + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x

Now, bringing terms to one side:

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49: Let's subtract 11000 from 19488.16 gives 8488.16, then subtract 172.49, so 8488.16 - 172.49 = 8315.67.

So 279.2 x = 8315.67 → x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's calculate that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2:

Well, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 30 is a bit high. 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. The difference between 8315.67 and 8096.8 is 218.87.

218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So x ≈ 29.783. Approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, x is p c, so p = x/(c). But maybe I can just keep using x as the product of p and c for now.

So x ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but let me double-check the division. 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is larger than 8315.67. So 30 is too much. So 29.78 is approximately 29.78, right?

So E_nu = x ≈29.78 MeV.

And E_mu = sqrt( x^2 + m_mu^2 ) = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78 squared: approx 887. So 887 + 11172.49 = 12059.49.

sqrt(12059.49) is approximately 109.8 MeV.

Wait, 109.8? Let me see: 109^2=11881, 109.8^2= (109 +0.8)^2= 109² + 2*109*0.8 +0.8^2= 11881 + 174.4 +0.64= 12056.04. Which is close to 12059.49. So E_mu ≈109.8 MeV.

But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c².

So KE_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV. Hmm, looking at the options, option D's muon KE is 4.12 MeV and neutrino's is 29.8 MeV. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but did I calculate x correctly? Let's go back to the equation:

279.2 x = 8315.67 → x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this accurately. Let's do 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. Because 279.2 * 30= 8376, which is larger than 8315.67.

The difference between 8315.67 and 8096.8 is 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 = approximately 0.783.

So x =29 + 0.783≈29.783 MeV.

So E_nu=29.783 MeV. That's about 29.8 MeV, which matches option D.

KE_mu is E_mu - m_mu c². E_mu is sqrt( x² + m_mu^2 ). So:

E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt( 887.06 + 11172.49 ) = sqrt(12059.55) ≈109.83 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.83 - 105.7 =4.13 MeV. But the options have 4.12, which is close. Hmm, perhaps I should carry more decimal places.

Wait, maybe I made an approximation. Let me recalculate x more accurately.

The equation after expansion:

x² + 11172.49 = 19488.16 -279.2 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

11172.49 =19488.16 -279.2 x

Rearranged:

279.2 x = 19488.16 -11172.49

Compute 19488.16 -11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 -0.49)

19488-11172=8316, and 0.16-0.49= -0.33 → 8316 -0.33=8315.67.

So 279.2 x=8315.67 → x=8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this division precisely.

279.2 into 8315.67.

Calculate 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 *29=8096.8.

279.2 * 29.783 ≈8315.67? Let's see:

279.2 * 29 =8096.8.

Now, 0.783 *279.2 = ?

0.783 *200=156.6

0.783 *79.2= ?

79.2 * 0.7= 55.44, 79.2 *0.08=6.336, 79.2 *0.003=0.2376. Summing:55.44+6.336=61.776 +0.2376=62.0136.

So 0.783 *279.2 =156.6 +62.0136=218.6136.

So 29 +0.783 =29.783 → 29.783 *279.2 =8096.8 +218.6136= 8315.4136.

But 8315.4136 is very close to 8315.67. So x=29.783 MeV/c.

So E_nu=x=29.783 MeV, which is about 29.8 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (29.783)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.783^2: 29.783 *29.783.

Well, 30^2=900, so 29.783 is 30 -0.217.

(30 -0.217)^2= 900 - 2*30*0.217 + (0.217)^2=900 -12.  0.217*60=13.02 → 900-13.02=886.98 + 0.047=887.027.

So 29.783²≈887.027.

Adding m_mu²: 105.7²=11172.49.

So 887.027 +11172.49=12059.517.

sqrt(12059.517)≈ let's calculate.

We know 109.8^2=12056.04 (Wait, earlier I thought 109.8 squared is around 12056, but let me recalculate:

109.8 *109.8 = (110 -0.2)^2 = 110² - 2*110*0.2 +0.2²= 12100 -44 +0.04=12056.04.

But our total is 12059.517. So what's the square root?

Between 109.8 and 109.9.

Compute 109.8^2=12056.04.

109.8 + delta)^2 =12059.517.

So (109.8 + delta)^2 =12056.04 + 2*109.8*delta + delta^2 =12059.517.

Assuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible.

So 2*109.8 * delta ≈ 12059.517 -12056.04=3.477.

So 219.6 * delta ≈3.477 → delta≈3.477/219.6≈0.0158.

So sqrt ≈109.8 +0.0158=109.8158 MeV.

So E_mu≈109.8158 MeV.

So KE_mu=E_mu - m_mu c²= 109.8158 - 105.7=4.1158 MeV≈4.12 MeV.

So the muon has KE≈4.12 MeV, and the neutrino has E_nu≈29.78 MeV. So the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

Wait, but neutrinos have some mass, but in this problem, we can probably ignore it. So the neutrino's KE is equal to its energy, which is 29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's the correct choice.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion (Pi⁺) into a muon (mu⁺) and a neutrino (nu). Conservation of energy and momentum must be applied.

### Key Information:
- Rest mass of Pi⁺: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Rest mass of muon: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Neutrino mass is negligible (\( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \)).
- The pion is stationary, so its initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

### Conservation of Energy:
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
\]
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4},
\]
and the neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c.
\]
Since momentum is conserved, \( |p_{\mu}| = |p_{\nu}| = p \). Thus, \( E_{\nu} = p c \), and substituting into the energy conservation equation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + (105.7)^2} + p c.
\]

### Solving for \( p c \):
Let \( x = p c \). The equation becomes:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x.
\]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]
Square both sides:
\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x + x^2.
\]
Cancel \( x^2 \) and rearrange:
\[
279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.
\]
\[
279.2 x = 8315.67.
\]
\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Thus, \( E_{\nu} = p c = 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Muon's Energy and Kinetic Energy:
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]
\[
E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.027 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.517} \approx 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The muon's kinetic energy is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the neutrino's energy is approximately \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
