Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think that means they are the standard basis states for the spin-1/2 system, right? So, |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1) in the computational basis.

The first part of the question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so the matrix is 2x2 because the state is two-dimensional. So the matrix would look like:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0     ]

Wait, because for i≠j, the elements are hbar/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Wait, but that's an unusual matrix. What does this operator represent? Oh, wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and if you multiply that by hbar/2, you get exactly this matrix. So the operator in question is (hbar/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of this operator as well because it's a scalar multiple. So the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the spin-up and spin-down states along the x-axis.

So the problem reduces to finding the probability of measuring |alpha> in each of these eigenstates, which are |+x> and |-x>, and then finding the average value of the operator.

But first, I need to normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional. The given |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's compute its norm.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Calculating each term:

|1 + i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

|2 - i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.

So the total norm squared is 2 + 5 = 7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

The eigenstates of σ_x (or A = (hbar/2) σ_x) can be written as:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The eigenstates are:

|+x> = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down>)

|-x> = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> - |down>)

Wait, actually, no. Wait, when you have σ_x, which is the Pauli X matrix, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the states that are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of |up> and |down>.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1. The eigenvectors for σ_x |+x> = |+x> are (1,1) and for |−x> are (1,-1), both normalized by 1/sqrt(2).

So, the eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, that's not right because σ_x |up> = |down>, so when you act σ_x on |+x>, you should get |+x> multiplied by 1, right?

Wait, let me compute σ_x |+x>. Let me compute that:

σ_x |+x> = σ_x (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

σ_x |up> = |down>, σ_x |down> = |up>.

So σ_x |+x> = (|down> + |up>)/sqrt(2) = |+x>, so that works. So yes, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, let me clarify. The eigenstates for σ_x are:

|+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) in computational basis, but here |up> is like |0> and |down> is |1>.

Wait, no, actually, in my case, |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1). So σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, the eigenvectors are any vectors of the form (1,1) and (1,-1). So |+x> is (1,1)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (1,-1)/sqrt(2).

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

Similarly, |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, that's correct. Because if you write |+x> as (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is |up> + |down> all over sqrt(2), and similarly for |-x>.

So, our state |alpha> is:

(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> all over sqrt(7).

We can express this as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. So, let's find coefficients a and b such that:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>

But wait, let me write the expressions:

Expressing |alpha> as a combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, since |+x> and |-x> form an orthonormal basis, the coefficients a and b can be found by taking the inner product of |alpha> with each of these eigenstates.

So, a = < +x | alpha >, and b = < -x | alpha >.

Let me compute a first.

Compute a = < +x | alpha >.

< +x | is (1/sqrt(2)) (1, 1), because |+x> is (1,1)/sqrt(2), so the bra is the conjugate transpose.

Wait, actually, for |+x>, it's (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the bra is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

So, a = [ (1/sqrt(2)) (1, 1) ] · [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, more accurately, in components, a is:

a = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1)( (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + (1)( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

So,

a = (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ]

Simplify numerator:

(1 + i) + (2 - i) = (1+2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So, a= 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute b = < -x | alpha >.

< -x | is (1/sqrt(2)) (1, -1), because |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, b = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (-1) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

So,

b = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))

Compute numerator:

(1 + i) - (2 - i) = (1-2) + (i + i) = (-1) + (2i) = (-1 + 2i).

So,

b = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

Hmm, so the coefficients a and b are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), respectively.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that:

For a: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 as above.

For b: (1+i) - (2 -i) = [1-2] + [i + i] = -1 + 2i.

Yes.

So, the state |alpha> can be written as:

a |+x> + b |-x>,

with a = 3/sqrt(14), and b = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait a second, because |alpha> is a normalized state. Let's check the modulus squared of a and b.

Wait, the square of |a|^2 plus |b|^2 should equal 1, because |alpha> is normalized.

Compute |a|^2:

a = 3/sqrt(14), so |a|^2 = 9/14.

Compute |b|^2:

b = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)

The modulus squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14.

So, 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1. That checks out. Good.

So, the probabilities of measuring +x and -x are |a|^2 and |b|^2, respectively.

So, |a|^2 =9/14 ≈ 0.6429, and |b|^2 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Wait, but the options given are in fractions like 0.64, 0.36 etc.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.3571, which is about 0.36.

So looking at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, which matches the first part.

But let's check the other parts, because the question also asks for the average value (expectation value) of the operator A.

The operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x. So, its expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is a state, the expectation value <A> is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, <A> = (hbar/2) <sigma_x>.

Another approach: The expectation value of A is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in |alpha>.

Alternatively, we can compute <sigma_x> for |alpha>, which is <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>.

Sigma_x is the Pauli matrix:

[[0 1],
 [1 0]].

So, let's represent |alpha> as a column vector.

|alpha> is:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) in the first component,

(2 - i)/sqrt(7) in the second component.

So, as a vector in column form:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

[ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, sigma_x applied to this vector is:

[0 1; 1 0 ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

Which results in swapping the components:

[ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]

[ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, <sigma_x> is the inner product of |alpha> with this result.

So, compute:

<alpha| sigma_x |alpha> = ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T.

Wait, more accurately, this is the dot product:

= [ (1+i) (2 - i) + (2 -i)(1 + i) ] / (7)

Wait, no. Because when you compute <a| sigma_x |a>, it's the first component times the second component of |a> after sigma_x is applied, plus the second component times the first component.

Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Compute <alpha| sigma_x |alpha>:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ] * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ; (1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, each term is:

(1+i)(2 -i) /7 + (2 -i)(1 +i)/7.

So, compute each product:

First term: (1+i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + i*2 + i*(-i) = 2 -i + 2i -i².

Since i² = -1, this becomes 2 +i +1 (because -i² is +1). So 2+1 =3, 3 +i.

Second term: (2 -i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i -i*1 -i*i = 2 + 2i -i -i².

Again, i²=-1, so this becomes 2 +i +1 = 3 +i.

So, each term is 3 +i.

So, adding both terms:

(3 +i +3 +i)/7 = (6 + 2i)/7.

Wait, wait no. Because the first term is (1+i)(2-i) = 3 +i.

The second term is (2 -i)(1 +i) = 3 +i as well.

So total is (3 +i) + (3 +i) = 6 + 2i.

So, <sigma_x> = (6 + 2i)/(7) = [6/(7)] + i [2/(7)].

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the expectation value of an observable (which is Hermitian) should be real. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, sigma_x is Hermitian, so its expectation value must be real. Therefore, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the matrix multiplication.

Let me recompute <sigma_x>.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it another way. Since |alpha> can be written as a combination of |+x> and |-x>, the expectation value of sigma_x is ( |+x> coefficient * 1 + |-x> coefficient * (-1) ) multiplied by the probabilities.

Wait, because sigma_x |+x> = |+x> * 1, and sigma_x |-x> = |-x> * (-1).

So, <sigma_x> = |a|^2 * 1 + |b|^2 * (-1).

Because |a|^2 is the probability of being in |+x>, which gives eigenvalue 1, and |b|^2 is the probability of being in |-x>, which gives eigenvalue -1.

So,

<sigma_x> = (9/14)(1) + (5/14)(-1) = (9 -5)/14 = 4/14 = 2/7.

So, that's 2/7 as a real number.

So, then <A> is (hbar/2) * <sigma_x> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Wait, that makes sense. So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is hbar/7.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

So that's option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The average of A is hbar/2 times the average of sigma_x, which is 2/7. So, (hbar/2)*(2/7) = hbar/7. Correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 (0.64) and 0.3571 (0.36). So option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's correct.

But wait, let me check the other options to be sure.

Option D says 0.61, 0.29 and 2 hbar/sqrt(7). Hmm, 2/sqrt(7) is about 0.7559, which is larger than 1/7 (~0.1428).

Wait, but I think option A fits.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\uparrow}\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |{\downarrow}\rangle,
\]

where the normalization factor \(\sqrt{7}\) is determined from the norm of the unnormalized state \((1+i)|{\uparrow}\rangle + (2-i)|{\downarrow}\rangle\). The norm is calculated as:

\[
\| (1+i)|{\uparrow}\rangle + (2-i)|{\downarrow}\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

The operator \(A\) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]

which corresponds to \((\hbar/2)\sigma_x\), where \(\sigma_x\) is the Pauli \(x\)-matrix. The eigenstates of \(\sigma_x\) are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|{\uparrow}\rangle + |{\downarrow}\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|{\uparrow}\rangle - |{\downarrow}\rangle),
\]

with eigenvalues \(+1\) and \(-1\), respectively. Since \(A = (\hbar/2)\sigma_x\), the eigenvalues of \(A\) are \(\hbar/2\) and \(-\hbar/2\).

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\), we express \(|\alpha\rangle\) in terms of these eigenstates. The coefficients \(a\) and \(b\) are calculated as:

\[
a = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
b = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|a|^2 = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |b|^2 = \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring \(|+x\rangle\) and \(|-x\rangle\) are approximately \(0.64\) and \(0.36\), respectively.

Next, we calculate the expectation value of \(A\). Using the fact that \(A = (\hbar/2)\sigma_x\), the expectation value is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

The expectation value of \(\sigma_x\) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot (+1) + |b|^2 \cdot (-1) = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing the results with the options:

- Probabilities: \(0.64\) and \(0.36\),
- Expectation value: \(\hbar/7\).

This matches **Option A**.
