Okay, so I've got this question here about quantum states and their energies. Hmm, let me think through it. So the question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds, respectively. We need to figure out the energy difference so that they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2. Or maybe it's ħ? I think the exact form might be ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/(2π), but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, sometimes it's approximated as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ, but I'll have to check.

So, the lifetimes given are the times during which the states exist. If the lifetime is shorter, the energy uncertainty is larger because Δt is small. Or wait, no, the longer the lifetime (Δt), the more precisely the energy can be measured, so the smaller ΔE. Right, because a longer time means we can measure energy more accurately, so the uncertainty is smaller.

But wait, the problem is about the energy difference between the two states that can be clearly resolved. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the two states might appear as one, and we can't distinguish them.

So for each state, the energy uncertainty is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. Since ħ is about 6.582e-16 eV·s. Let's plug in the numbers.

For the first state with Δt = 1e-9 s:
ΔE1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-9 is 6.582e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, no wait, wait, actually, 1e-9 seconds is a nanosecond. So 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV. So approximately 7e-7 eV.

Similarly for the second state, Δt is 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV. So about 6.6e-8 eV.

So the energy differences need to be larger than the maximum of these two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than either, you can't resolve them. Wait, no: actually, for two states, the energy difference must be larger than the sum? Or wait, no. Let me think. The uncertainty in each state's energy is ΔE1 and ΔE2. So when you measure the energy of each state, the uncertainty is their respective ΔE. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. To clearly distinguish them, ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty in ΔE. The uncertainty in ΔE would be the sum of the uncertainties of each energy. Because the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2, and uncertainty in E1 is ΔE1, so the uncertainty in their difference is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 )? Or is it additive if they're independent? Hmm, I'm not sure. But perhaps for the sake of the problem, we can consider the larger uncertainty.

Wait, the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in each to be resolved. So for each state, the energy difference can't be smaller than the uncertainty in that state. So perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two ΔEs.

Wait, but the first state has a much larger ΔE. Because 1e-9 is smaller than 1e-8, so the uncertainty for the first state is larger. So the required ΔE between E2 and E1 should be larger than ΔE1, which is about 6.5e-7 eV. Because if the energy difference is smaller than this, the two energy levels might not be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 n eV? That's way smaller than 6e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → that's 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. Let's see: 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 6.5e-7 is 0.00000065 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 100 times bigger than 6.5e-7? Wait, 6.5e-7 is 0.00000065 eV, which is 6.5e-7 eV. 1e-4 eV is 1e-4=0.0001 eV, which is larger than 6.5e-7. So 1e-4 eV is larger than the uncertainty of the first state.

So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the uncertainty of both states, then the two energy levels can be clearly resolved. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but what about the second state? Its uncertainty is about 6.5e-8 eV, which is much smaller than 1e-4. So the energy difference is way larger than the uncertainty, so it's definitely resolvable.

So the correct answer should be option C. Let me look at the options.

Wait, the options are A: 1e-9, B: 1e-11, C: 1e-4, D:1e-8.

Hmm, 1e-4 is much larger than both 6.5e-7 and 6.5e-8. So yes, C is much larger. So C is the correct answer.

So the answer is option C.

To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\pi},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For a quantum state with a lifetime \( \Delta t \), the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For the first state with \( \Delta t = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state with \( \Delta t = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the uncertainties in energy for both states. Since the larger uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), the energy difference must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the two states.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it also cannot resolve the two states.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it can clearly resolve the two states.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the two states.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be larger than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), and the only option that satisfies this condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

Okay, so I've got this question here about quantum states and their energies. Hmm, let me think through it. So the question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds, respectively.

Right, because a longer time means we can measure energy more accurately, so the uncertainty is smaller.

For the first state with Δt = 1e-9 s:

Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-9 is 6.582e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, no wait, wait, actually, 1e-9 seconds is a nanosecond. So 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV. So approximately 7e-7 eV.

Similarly for the second state, Δt is 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV. So about 6.6e-8 eV.

So the energy differences need to be larger than the maximum of these two uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than either, you can't resolve them. Wait, no: actually, for two states, the energy difference must be larger than the sum? Or wait, no. Let me think. The uncertainty in each state's energy is ΔE1 and ΔE2.

But perhaps for the sake of the problem, we can consider the larger uncertainty.

Wait, the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in each to be resolved. So for each state, the energy difference can't be smaller than the uncertainty in that state. So perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two ΔEs.

Wait, but the first state has a much larger ΔE. Because 1e-9 is smaller than 1e-8, so the uncertainty for the first state is larger. So the required ΔE between E2 and E1 should be larger than ΔE1, which is about 6.5e-7 eV. Because if the energy difference is smaller than this, the two energy levels might not be distinguishable.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 n eV? That's way smaller than 6e-7.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → that's 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. Let's see: 1e-4 eV is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 6.5e-7 is 0.00000065 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 100 times bigger than 6.5e-7? Wait, 6.5e-7 is 0.00000065 eV, which is 6.5e-7 eV. 1e-4 eV is 1e-4=0.0001 eV, which is larger than 6.5e-7. So 1e-4 eV is larger than the uncertainty of the first state.

So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the uncertainty of both states, then the two energy levels can be clearly resolved. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but what about the second state? Its uncertainty is about 6.5e-8 eV, which is much smaller than 1e-4. So the energy difference is way larger than the uncertainty, so it's definitely resolvable.

So the correct answer should be option C. Let me look at the options.

Wait, the options are A: 1e-9, B: 1e-11, C: 1e-4, D:1e-8.

Hmm, 1e-4 is much larger than both 6.5e-7 and 6.5e-8. So yes, C is much larger. So C is the correct answer.

So the answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2\pi},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For a quantum state with a lifetime \( \Delta t \), the energy uncertainty is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For the first state with \( \Delta t = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state with \( \Delta t = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be larger than the uncertainties in energy for both states. Since the larger uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), the energy difference must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the two states.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it also cannot resolve the two states.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it can clearly resolve the two states.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it cannot resolve the two states.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be larger than \( 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), and the only option that satisfies this condition is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
