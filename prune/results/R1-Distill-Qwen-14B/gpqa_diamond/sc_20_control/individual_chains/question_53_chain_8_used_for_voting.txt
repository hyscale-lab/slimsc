Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, that means the compound has two substituents attached to a benzene ring, right? The ring is six-membered, so it's probably benzene-based.

Then, the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl group (C=O), and in IR, that usually appears around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So, that tells me the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons can have different environments. If it's para-substituted, the two sets of aromatic protons would be as two doublets. Wait, no, para substitution would have equivalent protons, so maybe two doublets if it's ortho? Or perhaps it's a different substitution pattern. Hmm, maybe the substituents are in the para positions, leading to two sets of aromatic protons. Or maybe one substituent is meta to the other, but that's less likely with two substituents. Wait, but for di-substitution, there are different possibilities like ortho, meta, or para. But if the two substituents are identical, the substitution pattern can affect the symmetry and hence the NMR signals.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are on a double bond. One is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. So that suggests perhaps a trans coupling or something. Vinyl groups might be part of an ester structure, maybe an acetyl group or something like that. Wait, esters can have R-O-C-O-R structures, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents include an ester group attached via a vinyl group. Hmm.

3. Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. So, two different methyl groups. Since there are two signals, they must be in different environments. If the substituents are different, each could have a methyl group. But wait, the IR shows an ester, so maybe one of the substituents is an ester group, which would have a carbonyl and an oxygen. For example, an ester like OAc (acetyloxy) group.

Wait, let me think. The compound is a di-substituted benzene, so two groups attached. And the ester group is present. So perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is another group. What could that be?

Looking at the NMR, the –CH3 groups: two signals, so maybe two different methyl groups. For an ester, the typical group is R-O-CO-O-R'? No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So for example, methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3. But in that case, the methyl groups attached to oxygen would be equivalent if it's an ester substituent on the benzene. Wait, but if the substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, but that's not right. Wait, no. The substituent would be like O-CO-R, right? So, if one substituent is an ester group, like OAc (O-CO-CH2CH3?), or maybe O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached to a vinyl group. Like maybe the substituent is an ester connected to another group, such as a propenyl (vinyl) ester.

Wait, the vinyl protons are two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let me think about possible structures. For example, if there's a vinyl group attached to an oxygen, like an allyl ester. Or maybe it's a substituted vinyl group, such as in an ortho substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group attached to another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group (like O-CO-CH2CH3) and the other is a vinyl group, which is attached to a methyl group. Or maybe each substituent has a vinyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this methodically.

FTIR shows ester group: so the structure must have an ester (RCOOR').

The NMR has six signals:

- Aromatic protons: two signals. So the two substituents might have some symmetry. If the substituents are para, then the benzene would have symmetry, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent might be in opposite positions, leading to two doublets for the aromatic Hs.

But wait, if the substituents are identical, like two ester groups in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be equivalent, leading to a single peak. But in this case, it's two signals, so the substituents are different, making the two H environments different.

So two substituents, each different, in positions that create two distinct sets of aromatic protons. That could happen if the substituents are in the para position but are different. For example, substituent A and substituent B in para positions. Then, each substituent affects the adjacent protons differently, leading to two distinct sets. Each set would have two protons, but perhaps split into multiplets.

Alternatively, substituents in the meta position? Wait, no, di-substituted. Let me think about that.

Wait, for a di-substituted benzene, the substitution patterns can be para, ortho, or meta. If the substituents are para, and they're different, the aromatic protons would have two distinct sets, each with two protons. So, two doublets in the NMR. That would match the description.

Then, the vinyl-H signals: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, and coupling with adjacent protons can lead to multiplets.

So, if there's a substituent with a vinyl group, perhaps as part of an ester substituent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one substituent is an ester (like OAc) and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CH-R. Or maybe the substituent is a propenyl group.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Let's think about a vinyl group adjacent to another group.

For example, imagine a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-... attached to the benzene. Wait, but then the vinyl protons would be CH2 and CH. The CH2 would couple with the CH, leading to a triplet for CH2 and a doublet for CH. But in this case, the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. Like, a substituent could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, such as O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For each option:

Option A: C11H14O2: C=11, H=14, O=2.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -14 -0 +0)/2 = (24 -14)/2=5.

Which would account for the benzene ring (3 degrees) plus an ester (1 double bond in the carbonyl, so another degree), and perhaps a double bond elsewhere, but wait, 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) =4, but we have 5. So perhaps another double bond or ring.

Option B: C12H14O2: (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26 -14)/2=6.

Benzene ring (3) + ester (1) =4. So another 2 degrees would be a double bond or another ring. Hmm.

Option C: C12H12O2: (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7 degrees.

Benzene (3) + ester (1) =4, so remaining 3 degrees: perhaps another ring and a double bond, or three double bonds. Unlikely.

Option D: C11H12O2: (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6.

Benzene (3) + ester (1) =4, so 2 more degrees which could be a double bond or a ring.

Hmm, so the structure must account for the degrees of unsaturation. Let's think about the substituents.

Assuming the aromatic ring is a benzene (3), the ester contributes a carbonyl (1). So that's four degrees. So for option A, which has 5, there's one more degree, which could be a double bond elsewhere.

Looking at the NMR, the vinyl protons suggest a double bond. So that's the fifth degree in option A. So option A would have 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5. That's correct.

Option B: 6 degrees. 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +2 more. So maybe two rings or two double bonds.

But the other substituent in the aromatic ring: perhaps another double bond in the substituent. For example, if one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group with another substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl signals. So perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group with more than one proton, such as a propenyl group.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the substituents.

The substituents on the benzene are two groups: let's say one is an ester group (like OAc), and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So the substituents may each have a methyl group. For example, substituent 1 is OAc (which has CH3) and substituent 2 is a vinyl group connected to a CH2CH3 or something else with a CH3.

Wait, but the NMR says two signals for CH3. So maybe each substituent has a CH3 that's in a different environment.

So substituent 1: maybe OAc (CH3COO-), substituent 2: perhaps a vinyl group attached to a methyl ester, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a propyl group or something else with a CH3.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, which suggests they're in different environments. So perhaps one substituent is an ester (OAc, with one CH3) and the other is an alkyl group with another CH3.

Wait, but where would the vinyl protons come in?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and an allyl group. For example, substituent 1 is OAc, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2-O-... No, not sure.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group elsewhere, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, maybe O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would give a methyl group in the ester, and perhaps a vinyl group somewhere else.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is OAc (CH3COO-) and substituent 2 is a methyl group attached via a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-... But I'm not making much progress.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like 4-(vinyl)phenyl acetate. So the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (OAc) and the other is a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), but that's unlikely because vinyl is CH2=CH-.

Wait, in that case, the vinyl group would have two protons, which would be split into a doublet. And perhaps another group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals:

- Aromatic protons: two signals. So two different sets, each with two protons. That suggests substituents in positions that break the symmetry, like para with two different groups.

- Vinyl-H: two signals. One is a doublet, meaning each proton is coupled with one other. The other is a doublet of quartets, which suggests coupling with two sets of protons (maybe two neighboring groups).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl (allyl) group. For example, one substituent is OAc, the other is CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CO-... No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. Wait, but then the vinyl group would have two protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester (like OCOCH2CH3) and another substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH2). But that would give two substituents: OCOCH2CH3 and CH2=CH2 attached to the ring.

But wait, that might not fit the NMR data. Let me think about the NMR signals:

The vinyl protons would be in CH2=CH2. But that's an isolated vinyl group. The protons on the CH2 would be equivalent, so perhaps a triplet. Hmm, but the question says one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So maybe the vinyl is part of a larger structure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an allyl group attached to the ester. Like, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-R attached to the benzene. So the allyl group would have three carbons, with the middle one attached to oxygen.

In that case, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH- part. The CH2=CH would have two protons: the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet for CH2 and a doublet for CH. But in the NMR, it's one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, that doesn't quite match.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's just a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. So, substituent 1: OAc (CH3COO-), substituent 2: CH2=CH-CH3.

Wait, but then the vinyl group would be CH2=CH-CH3. The protons on CH2 would be a triplet (if adjacent to CH), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a prop-1-enyl group (CH2=CH2) attached via an oxygen. Hmm, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula. The options are four, all with varying C, H, O.

The ester group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So each ester contributes O2. Since the compound is di-substituted, each substituent may contribute to the formula.

Assuming substituent 1 is an ester group, say, O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl acetate-like), which would contribute 4 carbons (the ester group has R-O-CO-R', where R is CH2CH3 and R' is part of the benzene). Wait, no, the benzene is the main ring, so substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (3 carbons: O, CO, CH2CH3). So substituent 1 has 3 carbons.

Substituent 2 could be a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CH-CH3. That would be 3 carbons as well. So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 3 (ester) + 3 (vinyl methyl) = 12 carbons. Wait, but that's the total, but some may be shared.

Wait, perhaps each substituent contributes to the formula. Let me think about the formula.

The benzene ring is C6H5. Each substituent would replace a hydrogen.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ester group), that's 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3), so the substituent adds 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since O-CO-CH2CH3: the structure is O-CO-CH2CH3, which is O from the ester, then CO, then CH2CH3. So, the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3, which is 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3: 3 carbons in the substituent). So substituent 1 contributes 3 C, and perhaps some H.

Substituent 2 is perhaps a vinyl group attached to a methyl. So, maybe -CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an alkyl chain. Wait, but the substituent would be something else.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl ester, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Hmm, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is an isopropyl group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached via a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl methyl group, like CH2=CH-CH3. So substituent 2 contributes 3 carbons (CH2=CH-CH3 has 3 carbons), and 5 hydrogens (since each CH2 group has 2 H, and CH3 has 3 H, but in the vinyl structure, the CH2=CH-CH3 would have 4 H: CH2 has 2, CH has 1, and CH3 has 3, but wait, in CH2=CH-CH3, the structure is CH2=CH-CH3, so the CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So total H from substituent 2 is 2 +1 +3 =6, but perhaps some are involved in coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2CH2 group, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ester group, 3 carbons), substituent 2 is a CH2=CH2 group (vinyl group, but that's just two carbons). So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) +3 (ester) +2 (vinyl) =11. So the formula would be C11H?O2.

But wait, the substituent 2 is CH2=CH2, which is just a vinyl group attached to the benzene. So substituent 2 is -CH2-CH2- but that's not possible because it's a double bond.

Wait, the substituent would be -CH2-CH2– but that's a single bond. No, substituent 2 would be -CH2-CH2– which isn't a vinyl group. Alternatively, substituent 2 is -CH2-CH2– but that's ethyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR again.

The NMR shows two signals for CH3 groups. So substituent 1 (ester) has a CH3 (like OAc), and substituent 2 has another CH3 group. So substituent 2 could be a methyl group attached to something else, perhaps a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-CH3.

So substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3. That would give a substituent with a vinyl group and a methyl group. So, substituent 2 has 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3: that's 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3) and 5 hydrogens (O-CO-O-CH2CH3 has CH2CH3: 5 H? No, the CH2CH3 group has 5 H? Let me count: CH3 has 3 H, CH2 has 2 H. So CH2CH3 has 5 H in total. So substituent 1 contributes 3 C and 5 H.

Substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3: 3 C and 5 H.

So the total substituents contribute 6 C and 10 H. The benzene is 6 C and 4 H (since two substituents). So total formula would be 6 (benzene) +6 (substituents) =12 C. For H: benzene has 4 (since each substituent replaces an H). Substituents contribute 10 H. So total H is 4 +10 =14. But wait, wait:

Wait, benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H. So for di-substituted, 2 H replaced, leaving 4 H on the benzene. So substituent 1 (ester) contributes its own H, substituent 2 contributes its own H.

Ester substituent O-CO-CH2CH3: the CH2CH3 group has 5 H. Substituent 2: CH2=CH-CH3 has 5 H (CH2= has 2 H, CH- has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H. So total 5 H in substituent 2).

So substituent 1 contributes 5 H, substituent 2 contributes 5 H. Benzene contributes 4 H. So total H would be 4 + (5 +5) =14. So the formula would be C12H14O2? Because the benzene is 6 C, substituent 1 is 3 C, substituent 2 is 3 C, total 12 C. O is 2 from the ester.

Wait, but the options include C12H14O2 as option B.

But let me check the degrees of unsaturation. For C12H14O2: (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6.

Which would mean 6 degrees. The benzene ring is 3. The ester contributes 1 (the carbonyl). The vinyl group in substituent 2 contributes 1 (the double bond). So that's 5 degrees. So we're missing one more degree. So perhaps another ring or another double bond.

Wait, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3. That's a single double bond. So that's one degree. So total so far: 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5. But the degrees of unsaturation are 6, so missing one.

Ah, perhaps substituent 1's structure includes another double bond. Wait, O-CO-CH2CH3 is an ester. The carbonyl is a double bond, but substituent 1 might have a ring or another double bond. No, O-CO-CH2CH3 is an ester, without any other rings or double bonds.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), which would add more carbons.

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester) would have 4 carbons (COOCH2CH2CH3). So substituent 1 contributes 4 C, substituent 2 contributes 3 C (CH2=CH-CH3).

Then total C is 6 (benzene) +4 +3=13 C. But the options don't have C13.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 isn't CH2=CH-CH3 but something else.

Wait, another possibility: substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. Like CH2=CH-CH3. But that's the same as before.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a CH3 group attached to a double bond. Like CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 (but that's a longer chain). Wait, but that would have four carbons in substituent 2.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group in a different way.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenyl group (CH2=CH-CH2-O-) attached to the ring, making the substituent a propenyl ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl ester. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, making it CH2=CH-CH3. That's 3 carbons, 5 H, and a double bond.

So, substituent 1 (ester) has 3 C, substituent 2 has 3 C. Benzene is 6 C. So total C is 12. So the formula would be C12H14O2, which is option B.

But earlier, when I calculated degrees of unsaturation, for C12H14O2, the degrees are 6. Benzene is 3, ester is 1, vinyl is 1, so that's 5. So where's the sixth?

Ah! Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ester). That's a single carbonyl group, so one double bond. So that's correct. Substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3 (vinyl), so that's another double bond. So that's two double bonds. Benzene is three. So 3+2=5. But degrees of unsaturation is 6. So there must be another double bond or ring.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which would be an ester with a propyl group. But that would give more C.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester). That would contribute 3 C (O-CO-O-CH3). Wait, no, O-CO-O would be a carbonate, but ester is O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl. So O-CO-O-R is an ester.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester). So substituent 1 is 4 C (O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3), which would make the total C as 6+4+3=13, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me think about the NMR signals.

Looking at the NMR, the two vinyl protons are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Let me think about possible structures.

Doublet of quartets suggests that each proton is coupling with two sets of neighboring protons. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-O-..., the CH2 next to the double bond would have two neighboring groups. Wait, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent. For example, substituent 1 might be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (hexyl ester), but that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (butyl ester), substituent 2 is a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester), and substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3.

Then, substituent 1 contributes 4 C, substituent 2 contributes 3 C. So total C is 6+4+3=13, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think of a different structure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of an ester group in the IR suggests an ester is present, so the formula must have the appropriate oxygen count. Each ester contributes two oxygen atoms. So the formula is C?H?O2.

Looking at the options, all have O2. So that's consistent.

Now, the molecular formula options are:

A) C11H14O2 → (2*11 +2 -14)=24 → 24/2=12 → 12-14= -2? Wait, no. Wait, degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For A: (22 +2 -14)/2= (24-14)/2=5.

B) C12H14O2 → (24+2-14)/2= (26-14)/2=6.

C) C12H12O2 → (24+2-12)/2= (26-12)/2=7.

D) C11H12O2 → (22+2-12)/2= (24-12)/2=6.

So, for option D: degrees of unsaturation 6.

Now, the structure must have a benzene ring (3), ester (1), and another 2 degrees. So, perhaps another double bond and a ring? But benzene is already a ring.

Alternatively, another double bond and a ring would contribute, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl signals. So maybe two double bonds elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent itself has a double bond. For example, substituent 1 is an ester with a double bond, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's just a single bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is an ester with a double bond, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (butyl ester), which doesn't add any double bonds.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, but no, that's more carbons.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (butyl ester, 4 C), substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C), benzene is 6 C. So total C is 6+4+3=13, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester, 3 C), substituent 2 is CH2=CH2 (2 C), benzene is 6 C. So total C is 6+3+2=11. So molecular formula would be C11H?O2.

But substituent 1 (O-CO-CH3) has 3 C, and substituent 2 (CH2=CH2) has 2 C. So substituent 1 contributes 3 C, substituent 2 contributes 2 C.

But substituent 2 being CH2=CH2 is just a vinyl group attached to the ring. Then, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3.

So the formula would be C6H5-(O-CO-CH3) and C6H5-(CH2=CH2). Wait, but that's two substituents; the benzene is C6, substituent 1 adds 3 C, substituent 2 adds 2 C, so total C: 6+3+2=11.

So the formula would be C11H?O2.

Now, how many H do we have?

Benzene has 4 H after substitution. Substituent 1 (O-CO-CH3) contributes 3 H (from CH3). Substituent 2 (CH2=CH2) contributes 2 H (from CH2=CH2).

Wait, CH2=CH2 would have two H in the CH2 and two H in the CH2, but no—wait, CH2=CH2 has two CH2 groups, each with two H. So substituent 2 contributes 4 H.

So total H: 4 (benzene) +3 (substituent 1) +4 (substituent 2) =11 H. But the options for C11 are A) C11H14O2 and D) C11H12O2.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Because substituent 2 (CH2=CH2) has two CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two H, but in a vinyl group, the structure is CH2=CH2. So each CH2 has two H, but in the vinyl group, the H are on adjacent carbons. So substituent 2 would contribute 2+2=4 H.

But then, substituent 1 (O-CO-CH3) has 3 H (from CH3). Benzene has 4 H. So total H would be 4 +3 +4=11. But the options for C11 are C11H14O2 and C11H12O2. 11 H isn't matching either.

Wait, this suggests that I'm miscalculating the H count. Let me think again.

Each substituent replaces a H on the benzene. So the benzene ring has 6 H normally, but with two substituents, it has 6-2=4 H left.

Substituent 1 (O-CO-CH3): the CH3 contributes 3 H.

Substituent 2 (CH2=CH2): the two CH2 groups each contribute 2 H, but in a vinyl group, the structure is CH2=CH2, so each CH2 has two H. So 2 CH2 groups × 2 H each =4 H.

So substituent 1: 3 H, substituent 2:4 H.

Total H: 4 (benzene) +3 +4=11.

But the options for C11 are:

A) C11H14O2 → 14 H.

D) C11H12O2 → 12 H.

Hmm, 11 H doesn't match either. So perhaps this structure isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenyl group, CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-R or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-CH3.

So substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3: 3 C, 5 H.

Substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3: 3 C, 3 H.

Benzene has 4 H.

Total H:4 +3 +5=12.

So formula would be C12H12O2. That's option C.

Wait, but substituent 2 is 3 C, substituent 1 is 3 C, benzene 6 C. Total 12 C.

So formula is C12H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=7.

Which would require 7 degrees. Benzene (3), ester (1), vinyl (1), and substituent 2's structure. Wait, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3, which is a double bond (1), so that's 4. So where are the other 3 degrees?

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 is connected in a way that forms a ring. Like, substituent 2 is a cyclopropane ring? No, that complicates it.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester, 3 C). Then substituent 2 is CH2=CH2 (2 C). So total C is 6 +3 +2=11. Then H would be 4 (benzene) +5 (ester's ethyl) +4 (vinyl) = 13. But that's not matching any option.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.

The NMR shows two vinyl protons as one doublet and one doublet of quartets. How can those arise?

Imagine a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-R attached to the benzene. Then, the vinyl group would be CH2=CH-O-CO-R. The CH2 would be next to the oxygen, and the CH would be attached to the oxygen.

In such a case, the CH2 would have two H, and the CH would have one H. The CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet for CH2 and a doublet for CH. But the NMR shows a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the vinyl protons are in a trans configuration, leading to specific splitting.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a carbonyl group, like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. But that would complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester, 4 C), substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C). Then, total C is 6 (benzene) +4 +3 =13, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → 11 C, 14 H.

B) C12H14O2 →12 C,14 H.

C) C12H12O2 →12 C,12 H.

D) C11H12O2 →11 C,12 H.

We have a di-substituted benzene, so 6 C from benzene.

Now, substituent 1 and substituent 2 contribute the remaining C.

Option A: 11 C. So 6 + substituent 1 (3 C) + substituent 2 (2 C) =11. So substituent 2 would be 2 C, which would be a vinyl group (CH2=CH2). So substituent 1: 3 C (ester group, like O-CO-CH3), substituent 2: 2 C (CH2=CH2).

So, substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), substituent 2: CH2=CH2 (vinyl group).

So benzene has 6 C, substituent 1 has 3 C, substituent 2 has 2 C. Total 11 C.

Hydrogen count: benzene has 4 H. Substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 has 3 H (CH3). Substituent 2: CH2=CH2 has 4 H (each CH2 has 2 H). So total H:4 +3 +4=11. But option A is C11H14O2, which has 14 H. So discrepancy here.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a longer chain. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH2CH3 (but that would be 4 C, making substituent 2 4 C. So substituent 1 would be 3 C, substituent 2 4 C. Total C:6+3+4=13, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-CH3, which is 3 C. So substituent 1 is 3 C, substituent 2 is 3 C. Total C:6+3+3=12. So formula would be C12H?O2.

Hydrogen count: benzene (4), substituent 1 (3 H from CH3), substituent 2 (CH2=CH-CH3 has 5 H: CH2 has 2, CH has 1, CH3 has 3. So total 2+1+3=6 H from substituent 2).

So total H:4 +3 +6=13. But the options for C12 are B (14 H) and C (12 H). 13 doesn't match.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the NMR signals again.

The vinyl group shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. The doublet would suggest coupling with one neighboring proton, perhaps a trans coupling. The doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two different sets of protons, maybe two neighboring groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the vinyl group is adjacent to another proton group. For example, if the vinyl group is part of a substituent like CH2=CH-O-CO-R.

In that case, the CH2 would be next to the oxygen, and the CH would be attached to oxygen. The CH2 would couple with the CH, leading to a triplet for CH2 and a doublet for CH. But the NMR shows a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is in a different configuration. For example, if the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CH-CH2-), the CH2 at the end would have two neighbors: the CH and the next CH2. Wait, but that might lead to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to another group, leading to quartet splitting.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So, each –CH3 is in a different environment. So, for example, one –CH3 is attached to an oxygen (like in an ester) and another –CH3 is attached to a vinyl group.

So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which has a –CH2CH3 group (two –CH2 and one –CH3). Wait, but that would give one –CH3 signal. Substituent 2 is something with another –CH3.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a CH2=CH-CH3 group. So, substituent 1 has a –CH2CH3 (ester), which contributes two –CH2 and one –CH3. Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 signals, so perhaps substituent 1 has a –CH3 and substituent 2 has another –CH3.

But substituent 1 being O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester) would have one –CH3. Substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3, which has another –CH3. So that would give two –CH3 signals, matching the NMR.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (3 C, 3 H), substituent 2: CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C, 5 H). Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12. Total H:4+3+5=12. So formula is C12H12O2, which is option C.

But wait, the degrees of unsaturation for C12H12O2 is (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=7.

Which would mean 7 degrees of unsaturation. Benzene:3, ester:1 (C=O), vinyl group:1 (CH2=CH). That's 5. So where are the other 2 degrees?

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 (CH2=CH-CH3) has a double bond (1) and a ring? But I don't see a ring there. Alternatively, maybe substituent 1's structure includes another double bond.

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3. That's a single carbonyl group. No other double bonds. So that can't be.

Hmm. This is confusing. Let me try to think of another way.

The NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So substituent 1 is an ester with a –CH3 (like OAc), and substituent 2 has another –CH3.

Substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a –CH3. So probably CH2=CH-CH3.

So substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (3 C, 3 H), substituent 2: CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C, 5 H).

Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12. H:4+3+5=12.

So formula is C12H12O2, option C.

But degrees of unsaturation is 7. So 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) +2 more.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 has another double bond, but CH2=CH-CH3 only has one double bond. So that's 3 +1 +1 =5. So where's the 7th?

Ah, I think I'm missing something. The substituent 2 could be part of a ring. Like, perhaps substituent 2 is a cyclopropane ring with a vinyl group. But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester, 4 C?), but that would add more carbons.

Wait, O-CO-CH2CH3 is 3 carbons: O-CO-O-CH2CH3. So substituent 1 is 3 C. So substituent 2 would be 3 C (CH2=CH-CH3). So total C is 6+3+3=12.

So formula is C12H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 7. So that requires one more degree. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 has a double bond and a ring, but I don't see it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aromatic ring itself, but that would complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group. No, that would require more carbons.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a cyclopropyl group attached to a vinyl group, but I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the molecular formulas and possible structures.

Option D is C11H12O2. That would mean 11 carbons.

Benzene:6 C.

So substituents must add 5 C. For example, substituent 1: ester (3 C), substituent 2: 2 C.

Substituent 2 would be a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), which is 2 C.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (3 C).

So total C:6+3+2=11.

Hydrogen count: benzene 4, substituent 1:3 H, substituent 2:4 H. Total H:11. But option D is C11H12O2, which has 12 H. So doesn't match.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C), substituent 1: O-CO-CH2 (but that might not make sense).

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-CH3 (but that's 4 C, making substituent 1 4 C, and substituent 2 2 C: CH2=CH2. Total C:6+4+2=12, which is option B. But then H would be:

Benzene:4 H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H (CH2CH2CH3: CH3 has 3, each CH2 has 2 ×2=4, total 7 H).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH2 has 4 H.

Total H:4+7+4=15. But option B is C12H14O2, which has 14 H. So discrepancy here.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester, 3 C, 5 H). Substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C, 5 H). Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12 → option B or C.

H:4 (benzene) +5 (ester) +5 (vinyl methyl) =14 H. So formula is C12H14O2, option B.

Degrees of unsaturation: (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. 

Breakdown: benzene (3), ester (1), vinyl (1), and substituent 2's structure.

Wait, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3, which has a double bond (1), so 3+1+1+1=6. So that works.

So formula is C12H14O2, option B.

But wait, earlier I thought substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3, which has 5 H. So substituent 1 (ester) has 5 H, substituent 2 has 5 H, benzene has 4 H. Total H:4+5+5=14, which matches option B.

So the structure would have:

Benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-CH2CH3), which contributes 5 H (from CH2CH3), and another substituent is CH2=CH-CH3, which contributes 5 H.

So the formula is C12H14O2, option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the IR spectrum. The NMR data provides six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups. The absence of signals for CH₂ groups suggests that all methyl groups are in distinct environments.

### Key Analysis:
1. **IR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group (C=O) is confirmed, contributing two oxygen atoms to the molecular formula.

2. **NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals indicate two distinct environments for the aromatic protons, consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring with different substituents.
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) suggest a vinyl group with specific coupling patterns.
   - **Methyl Groups**: Two signals indicate two distinct methyl groups in different environments.

3. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **Option A (C₁₁H₁₄O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 5. This would require one double bond or ring in addition to the benzene ring and ester group. However, the NMR data suggests more complexity.
   - **Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6. This accounts for the benzene ring (3), ester carbonyl (1), and a vinyl group (1), with one additional degree of unsaturation.
   - **Option C (C₁₂H₁₂O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 7. This would require an additional double bond or ring, which is not supported by the NMR data.
   - **Option D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6. However, the hydrogen count does not match the expected number of hydrogens based on the substituents.

4. **Structure Determination**:
   - The benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-CH₂CH₃), contributing 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens, and the other is a vinyl group (e.g., CH₂=CH-CH₃), contributing 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.
   - The total molecular formula becomes **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**, which matches **Option B**.

5. **Hydrogen Count**:
   - Benzene contributes 4 hydrogens.
   - Ester group (O-CO-CH₂CH₃) contributes 5 hydrogens.
   - Vinyl group (CH₂=CH-CH₃) contributes 5 hydrogens.
   - Total hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 5 = 14, consistent with **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**, corresponding to **Option B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, that means the compound has two substituents attached to a benzene ring, right? The ring is six-membered, so it's probably benzene-based.

Then, the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a characteristic carbonyl group (C=O), and in IR, that usually appears around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So, that tells me the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons can have different environments. If it's para-substituted, the two sets of aromatic protons would be as two doublets. Wait, no, para substitution would have equivalent protons, so maybe two doublets if it's ortho? Or perhaps it's a different substitution pattern. Hmm, maybe the substituents are in the para positions, leading to two sets of aromatic protons. Or maybe one substituent is meta to the other, but that's less likely with two substituents. Wait, but for di-substitution, there are different possibilities like ortho, meta, or para. But if the two substituents are identical, the substitution pattern can affect the symmetry and hence the NMR signals.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are on a double bond. One is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. So that suggests perhaps a trans coupling or something. Vinyl groups might be part of an ester structure, maybe an acetyl group or something like that. Wait, esters can have R-O-C-O-R structures, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents include an ester group attached via a vinyl group. Hmm.

3. Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. So, two different methyl groups. Since there are two signals, they must be in different environments. If the substituents are different, each could have a methyl group. But wait, the IR shows an ester, so maybe one of the substituents is an ester group, which would have a carbonyl and an oxygen. For example, an ester like OAc (acetyloxy) group.

Wait, let me think. The compound is a di-substituted benzene, so two groups attached. And the ester group is present. So perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is another group. What could that be?

Looking at the NMR, the –CH3 groups: two signals, so maybe two different methyl groups. For an ester, the typical group is R-O-CO-O-R'? No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So for example, methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3. But in that case, the methyl groups attached to oxygen would be equivalent if it's an ester substituent on the benzene. Wait, but if the substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, but that's not right. Wait, no. The substituent would be like O-CO-R, right? So, if one substituent is an ester group, like OAc (O-CO-CH2CH3?), or maybe O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached to a vinyl group. Like maybe the substituent is an ester connected to another group, such as a propenyl (vinyl) ester.

Wait, the vinyl protons are two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let me think about possible structures. For example, if there's a vinyl group attached to an oxygen, like an allyl ester. Or maybe it's a substituted vinyl group, such as in an ortho substitution.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group attached to another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group (like O-CO-CH2CH3) and the other is a vinyl group, which is attached to a methyl group. Or maybe each substituent has a vinyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this methodically.

FTIR shows ester group: so the structure must have an ester (RCOOR').

The NMR has six signals:

- Aromatic protons: two signals. So the two substituents might have some symmetry. If the substituents are para, then the benzene would have symmetry, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent might be in opposite positions, leading to two doublets for the aromatic Hs.

But wait, if the substituents are identical, like two ester groups in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be equivalent, leading to a single peak. But in this case, it's two signals, so the substituents are different, making the two H environments different.

So two substituents, each different, in positions that create two distinct sets of aromatic protons. That could happen if the substituents are in the para position but are different. For example, substituent A and substituent B in para positions. Then, each substituent affects the adjacent protons differently, leading to two distinct sets. Each set would have two protons, but perhaps split into multiplets.

Alternatively, substituents in the meta position? Wait, no, di-substituted. Let me think about that.

Wait, for a di-substituted benzene, the substitution patterns can be para, ortho, or meta. If the substituents are para, and they're different, the aromatic protons would have two distinct sets, each with two protons. So, two doublets in the NMR. That would match the description.

Then, the vinyl-H signals: two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, and coupling with adjacent protons can lead to multiplets.

So, if there's a substituent with a vinyl group, perhaps as part of an ester substituent.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one substituent is an ester (like OAc) and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, like CH2=CH-R. Or maybe the substituent is a propenyl group.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Let's think about a vinyl group adjacent to another group.

For example, imagine a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-... attached to the benzene. Wait, but then the vinyl protons would be CH2 and CH. The CH2 would couple with the CH, leading to a triplet for CH2 and a doublet for CH. But in this case, the NMR shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. Like, a substituent could be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester, such as O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula is either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2.

Degrees of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For each option:

Option A: C11H14O2: C=11, H=14, O=2.

Degrees of unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -14 -0 +0)/2 = (24 -14)/2=5.

Which would account for the benzene ring (3 degrees) plus an ester (1 double bond in the carbonyl, so another degree), and perhaps a double bond elsewhere, but wait, 3 (benzene) + 1 (ester) =4, but we have 5. So perhaps another double bond or ring.

Option B: C12H14O2: (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26 -14)/2=6.

Benzene ring (3) + ester (1) =4. So another 2 degrees would be a double bond or another ring. Hmm.

Option C: C12H12O2: (2*12 +2 -12)/2= (26-12)/2=7 degrees.

Benzene (3) + ester (1) =4, so remaining 3 degrees: perhaps another ring and a double bond, or three double bonds. Unlikely.

Option D: C11H12O2: (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6.

Benzene (3) + ester (1) =4, so 2 more degrees which could be a double bond or a ring.

Hmm, so the structure must account for the degrees of unsaturation. Let's think about the substituents.

Assuming the aromatic ring is a benzene (3), the ester contributes a carbonyl (1). So that's four degrees. So for option A, which has 5, there's one more degree, which could be a double bond elsewhere.

Looking at the NMR, the vinyl protons suggest a double bond. So that's the fifth degree in option A. So option A would have 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5. That's correct.

Option B: 6 degrees. 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +2 more. So maybe two rings or two double bonds.

But the other substituent in the aromatic ring: perhaps another double bond in the substituent. For example, if one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group with another substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl signals. So perhaps the substituent has a vinyl group with more than one proton, such as a propenyl group.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the substituents.

The substituents on the benzene are two groups: let's say one is an ester group (like OAc), and the other is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So the substituents may each have a methyl group. For example, substituent 1 is OAc (which has CH3) and substituent 2 is a vinyl group connected to a CH2CH3 or something else with a CH3.

Wait, but the NMR says two signals for CH3. So maybe each substituent has a CH3 that's in a different environment.

So substituent 1: maybe OAc (CH3COO-), substituent 2: perhaps a vinyl group attached to a methyl ester, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a propyl group or something else with a CH3.

Wait, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, which suggests they're in different environments. So perhaps one substituent is an ester (OAc, with one CH3) and the other is an alkyl group with another CH3.

Wait, but where would the vinyl protons come in?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester and an allyl group. For example, substituent 1 is OAc, substituent 2 is CH2=CHCH2-O-... No, not sure.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group elsewhere, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-... No, maybe O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. That would give a methyl group in the ester, and perhaps a vinyl group somewhere else.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is OAc (CH3COO-) and substituent 2 is a methyl group attached via a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-CH2-... But I'm not making much progress.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like 4-(vinyl)phenyl acetate. So the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (OAc) and the other is a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), but that's unlikely because vinyl is CH2=CH-.

Wait, in that case, the vinyl group would have two protons, which would be split into a doublet. And perhaps another group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals:

- Aromatic protons: two signals. So two different sets, each with two protons. That suggests substituents in positions that break the symmetry, like para with two different groups.

- Vinyl-H: two signals. One is a doublet, meaning each proton is coupled with one other. The other is a doublet of quartets, which suggests coupling with two sets of protons (maybe two neighboring groups).

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl (allyl) group. For example, one substituent is OAc, the other is CH2-CH2-CH2-O-CO-... No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. Wait, but then the vinyl group would have two protons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester (like OCOCH2CH3) and another substituent is a vinyl group (CH2=CH2). But that would give two substituents: OCOCH2CH3 and CH2=CH2 attached to the ring.

But wait, that might not fit the NMR data. Let me think about the NMR signals:

The vinyl protons would be in CH2=CH2. But that's an isolated vinyl group. The protons on the CH2 would be equivalent, so perhaps a triplet. Hmm, but the question says one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So maybe the vinyl is part of a larger structure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is an allyl group attached to the ester. Like, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-R attached to the benzene. So the allyl group would have three carbons, with the middle one attached to oxygen.

In that case, the vinyl protons would be on the CH2=CH- part. The CH2=CH would have two protons: the CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet for CH2 and a doublet for CH. But in the NMR, it's one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Hmm, that doesn't quite match.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. For example, substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's just a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. So, substituent 1: OAc (CH3COO-), substituent 2: CH2=CH-CH3.

Wait, but then the vinyl group would be CH2=CH-CH3. The protons on CH2 would be a triplet (if adjacent to CH), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a prop-1-enyl group (CH2=CH2) attached via an oxygen. Hmm, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula. The options are four, all with varying C, H, O.

The ester group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So each ester contributes O2. Since the compound is di-substituted, each substituent may contribute to the formula.

Assuming substituent 1 is an ester group, say, O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl acetate-like), which would contribute 4 carbons (the ester group has R-O-CO-R', where R is CH2CH3 and R' is part of the benzene). Wait, no, the benzene is the main ring, so substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (3 carbons: O, CO, CH2CH3). So substituent 1 has 3 carbons.

Substituent 2 could be a vinyl group attached to a methyl, like CH2=CH-CH3. That would be 3 carbons as well. So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 3 (ester) + 3 (vinyl methyl) = 12 carbons. Wait, but that's the total, but some may be shared.

Wait, perhaps each substituent contributes to the formula. Let me think about the formula.

The benzene ring is C6H5. Each substituent would replace a hydrogen.

If substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ester group), that's 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3), so the substituent adds 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since O-CO-CH2CH3: the structure is O-CO-CH2CH3, which is O from the ester, then CO, then CH2CH3. So, the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH3, which is 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3: 3 carbons in the substituent). So substituent 1 contributes 3 C, and perhaps some H.

Substituent 2 is perhaps a vinyl group attached to a methyl. So, maybe -CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's an alkyl chain. Wait, but the substituent would be something else.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl ester, like CH2=CH-O-CO-R. Hmm, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is an isopropyl group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached via a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl methyl group, like CH2=CH-CH3. So substituent 2 contributes 3 carbons (CH2=CH-CH3 has 3 carbons), and 5 hydrogens (since each CH2 group has 2 H, and CH3 has 3 H, but in the vinyl structure, the CH2=CH-CH3 would have 4 H: CH2 has 2, CH has 1, and CH3 has 3, but wait, in CH2=CH-CH3, the structure is CH2=CH-CH3, so the CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 1 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So total H from substituent 2 is 2 +1 +3 =6, but perhaps some are involved in coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a CH2CH2 group, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ester group, 3 carbons), substituent 2 is a CH2=CH2 group (vinyl group, but that's just two carbons). So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) +3 (ester) +2 (vinyl) =11. So the formula would be C11H?O2.

But wait, the substituent 2 is CH2=CH2, which is just a vinyl group attached to the benzene. So substituent 2 is -CH2-CH2- but that's not possible because it's a double bond.

Wait, the substituent would be -CH2-CH2– but that's a single bond. No, substituent 2 would be -CH2-CH2– which isn't a vinyl group. Alternatively, substituent 2 is -CH2-CH2– but that's ethyl group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR again.

The NMR shows two signals for CH3 groups. So substituent 1 (ester) has a CH3 (like OAc), and substituent 2 has another CH3 group. So substituent 2 could be a methyl group attached to something else, perhaps a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-CH3.

So substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3. That would give a substituent with a vinyl group and a methyl group. So, substituent 2 has 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3: that's 3 carbons (COOCH2CH3) and 5 hydrogens (O-CO-O-CH2CH3 has CH2CH3: 5 H? No, the CH2CH3 group has 5 H? Let me count: CH3 has 3 H, CH2 has 2 H. So CH2CH3 has 5 H in total. So substituent 1 contributes 3 C and 5 H.

Substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3: 3 C and 5 H.

So the total substituents contribute 6 C and 10 H. The benzene is 6 C and 4 H (since two substituents). So total formula would be 6 (benzene) +6 (substituents) =12 C. For H: benzene has 4 (since each substituent replaces an H). Substituents contribute 10 H. So total H is 4 +10 =14. But wait, wait:

Wait, benzene has 6 H. Each substituent replaces one H. So for di-substituted, 2 H replaced, leaving 4 H on the benzene. So substituent 1 (ester) contributes its own H, substituent 2 contributes its own H.

Ester substituent O-CO-CH2CH3: the CH2CH3 group has 5 H. Substituent 2: CH2=CH-CH3 has 5 H (CH2= has 2 H, CH- has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H. So total 5 H in substituent 2).

So substituent 1 contributes 5 H, substituent 2 contributes 5 H. Benzene contributes 4 H. So total H would be 4 + (5 +5) =14. So the formula would be C12H14O2? Because the benzene is 6 C, substituent 1 is 3 C, substituent 2 is 3 C, total 12 C. O is 2 from the ester.

Wait, but the options include C12H14O2 as option B.

But let me check the degrees of unsaturation. For C12H14O2: (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6.

Which would mean 6 degrees. The benzene ring is 3. The ester contributes 1 (the carbonyl). The vinyl group in substituent 2 contributes 1 (the double bond). So that's 5 degrees. So we're missing one more degree. So perhaps another ring or another double bond.

Wait, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3. That's a single double bond. So that's one degree. So total so far: 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) =5. But the degrees of unsaturation are 6, so missing one.

Ah, perhaps substituent 1's structure includes another double bond. Wait, O-CO-CH2CH3 is an ester. The carbonyl is a double bond, but substituent 1 might have a ring or another double bond. No, O-CO-CH2CH3 is an ester, without any other rings or double bonds.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester), which would add more carbons.

Wait, substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester) would have 4 carbons (COOCH2CH2CH3). So substituent 1 contributes 4 C, substituent 2 contributes 3 C (CH2=CH-CH3).

Then total C is 6 (benzene) +4 +3=13 C. But the options don't have C13.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 isn't CH2=CH-CH3 but something else.

Wait, another possibility: substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group. Like CH2=CH-CH3. But that's the same as before.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a CH3 group attached to a double bond. Like CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 (but that's a longer chain). Wait, but that would have four carbons in substituent 2.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group in a different way.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenyl group (CH2=CH-CH2-O-) attached to the ring, making the substituent a propenyl ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected to a methyl ester. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-O-CO-R, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group, making it CH2=CH-CH3. That's 3 carbons, 5 H, and a double bond.

So, substituent 1 (ester) has 3 C, substituent 2 has 3 C. Benzene is 6 C. So total C is 12. So the formula would be C12H14O2, which is option B.

But earlier, when I calculated degrees of unsaturation, for C12H14O2, the degrees are 6. Benzene is 3, ester is 1, vinyl is 1, so that's 5. So where's the sixth?

Ah! Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ester). That's a single carbonyl group, so one double bond. So that's correct. Substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3 (vinyl), so that's another double bond. So that's two double bonds. Benzene is three. So 3+2=5. But degrees of unsaturation is 6. So there must be another double bond or ring.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which would be an ester with a propyl group. But that would give more C.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester). That would contribute 3 C (O-CO-O-CH3). Wait, no, O-CO-O would be a carbonate, but ester is O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl. So O-CO-O-R is an ester.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (propyl ester). So substituent 1 is 4 C (O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3), which would make the total C as 6+4+3=13, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this the wrong way. Let me think about the NMR signals.

Looking at the NMR, the two vinyl protons are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Let me think about possible structures.

Doublet of quartets suggests that each proton is coupling with two sets of neighboring protons. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-CH2-O-..., the CH2 next to the double bond would have two neighboring groups. Wait, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent. For example, substituent 1 might be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (hexyl ester), but that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (butyl ester), substituent 2 is a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester), and substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3.

Then, substituent 1 contributes 4 C, substituent 2 contributes 3 C. So total C is 6+4+3=13, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think of a different structure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of an ester group in the IR suggests an ester is present, so the formula must have the appropriate oxygen count. Each ester contributes two oxygen atoms. So the formula is C?H?O2.

Looking at the options, all have O2. So that's consistent.

Now, the molecular formula options are:

A) C11H14O2 → (2*11 +2 -14)=24 → 24/2=12 → 12-14= -2? Wait, no. Wait, degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For A: (22 +2 -14)/2= (24-14)/2=5.

B) C12H14O2 → (24+2-14)/2= (26-14)/2=6.

C) C12H12O2 → (24+2-12)/2= (26-12)/2=7.

D) C11H12O2 → (22+2-12)/2= (24-12)/2=6.

So, for option D: degrees of unsaturation 6.

Now, the structure must have a benzene ring (3), ester (1), and another 2 degrees. So, perhaps another double bond and a ring? But benzene is already a ring.

Alternatively, another double bond and a ring would contribute, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl signals. So maybe two double bonds elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent itself has a double bond. For example, substituent 1 is an ester with a double bond, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that's just a single bond.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is an ester with a double bond, like O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. But that would complicate things.

Alternatively, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 (butyl ester), which doesn't add any double bonds.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, but no, that's more carbons.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (butyl ester, 4 C), substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C), benzene is 6 C. So total C is 6+4+3=13, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester, 3 C), substituent 2 is CH2=CH2 (2 C), benzene is 6 C. So total C is 6+3+2=11. So molecular formula would be C11H?O2.

But substituent 1 (O-CO-CH3) has 3 C, and substituent 2 (CH2=CH2) has 2 C. So substituent 1 contributes 3 C, substituent 2 contributes 2 C.

But substituent 2 being CH2=CH2 is just a vinyl group attached to the ring. Then, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3.

So the formula would be C6H5-(O-CO-CH3) and C6H5-(CH2=CH2). Wait, but that's two substituents; the benzene is C6, substituent 1 adds 3 C, substituent 2 adds 2 C, so total C: 6+3+2=11.

So the formula would be C11H?O2.

Now, how many H do we have?

Benzene has 4 H after substitution. Substituent 1 (O-CO-CH3) contributes 3 H (from CH3). Substituent 2 (CH2=CH2) contributes 2 H (from CH2=CH2).

Wait, CH2=CH2 would have two H in the CH2 and two H in the CH2, but no—wait, CH2=CH2 has two CH2 groups, each with two H. So substituent 2 contributes 4 H.

So total H: 4 (benzene) +3 (substituent 1) +4 (substituent 2) =11 H. But the options for C11 are A) C11H14O2 and D) C11H12O2.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Because substituent 2 (CH2=CH2) has two CH2 groups. Each CH2 has two H, but in a vinyl group, the structure is CH2=CH2. So each CH2 has two H, but in the vinyl group, the H are on adjacent carbons. So substituent 2 would contribute 2+2=4 H.

But then, substituent 1 (O-CO-CH3) has 3 H (from CH3). Benzene has 4 H. So total H would be 4 +3 +4=11. But the options for C11 are C11H14O2 and C11H12O2. 11 H isn't matching either.

Wait, this suggests that I'm miscalculating the H count. Let me think again.

Each substituent replaces a H on the benzene. So the benzene ring has 6 H normally, but with two substituents, it has 6-2=4 H left.

Substituent 1 (O-CO-CH3): the CH3 contributes 3 H.

Substituent 2 (CH2=CH2): the two CH2 groups each contribute 2 H, but in a vinyl group, the structure is CH2=CH2, so each CH2 has two H. So 2 CH2 groups × 2 H each =4 H.

So substituent 1: 3 H, substituent 2:4 H.

Total H: 4 (benzene) +3 +4=11.

But the options for C11 are:

A) C11H14O2 → 14 H.

D) C11H12O2 → 12 H.

Hmm, 11 H doesn't match either. So perhaps this structure isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propenyl group, CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-R or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-CH3.

So substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3: 3 C, 5 H.

Substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3: 3 C, 3 H.

Benzene has 4 H.

Total H:4 +3 +5=12.

So formula would be C12H12O2. That's option C.

Wait, but substituent 2 is 3 C, substituent 1 is 3 C, benzene 6 C. Total 12 C.

So formula is C12H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=7.

Which would require 7 degrees. Benzene (3), ester (1), vinyl (1), and substituent 2's structure. Wait, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3, which is a double bond (1), so that's 4. So where are the other 3 degrees?

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 is connected in a way that forms a ring. Like, substituent 2 is a cyclopropane ring? No, that complicates it.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester, 3 C). Then substituent 2 is CH2=CH2 (2 C). So total C is 6 +3 +2=11. Then H would be 4 (benzene) +5 (ester's ethyl) +4 (vinyl) = 13. But that's not matching any option.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.

The NMR shows two vinyl protons as one doublet and one doublet of quartets. How can those arise?

Imagine a structure like CH2=CH-O-CO-R attached to the benzene. Then, the vinyl group would be CH2=CH-O-CO-R. The CH2 would be next to the oxygen, and the CH would be attached to the oxygen.

In such a case, the CH2 would have two H, and the CH would have one H. The CH2 would couple with the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet for CH2 and a doublet for CH. But the NMR shows a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the vinyl protons are in a trans configuration, leading to specific splitting.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to a carbonyl group, like CH2=CH-CO-O-R. But that would complicate the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3 (propyl ester, 4 C), substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C). Then, total C is 6 (benzene) +4 +3 =13, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe I should look at the options again.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → 11 C, 14 H.

B) C12H14O2 →12 C,14 H.

C) C12H12O2 →12 C,12 H.

D) C11H12O2 →11 C,12 H.

We have a di-substituted benzene, so 6 C from benzene.

Now, substituent 1 and substituent 2 contribute the remaining C.

Option A: 11 C. So 6 + substituent 1 (3 C) + substituent 2 (2 C) =11. So substituent 2 would be 2 C, which would be a vinyl group (CH2=CH2). So substituent 1: 3 C (ester group, like O-CO-CH3), substituent 2: 2 C (CH2=CH2).

So, substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester), substituent 2: CH2=CH2 (vinyl group).

So benzene has 6 C, substituent 1 has 3 C, substituent 2 has 2 C. Total 11 C.

Hydrogen count: benzene has 4 H. Substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 has 3 H (CH3). Substituent 2: CH2=CH2 has 4 H (each CH2 has 2 H). So total H:4 +3 +4=11. But option A is C11H14O2, which has 14 H. So discrepancy here.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 2 is a longer chain. For example, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH2CH3 (but that would be 4 C, making substituent 2 4 C. So substituent 1 would be 3 C, substituent 2 4 C. Total C:6+3+4=13, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a methyl group attached to a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-CH3, which is 3 C. So substituent 1 is 3 C, substituent 2 is 3 C. Total C:6+3+3=12. So formula would be C12H?O2.

Hydrogen count: benzene (4), substituent 1 (3 H from CH3), substituent 2 (CH2=CH-CH3 has 5 H: CH2 has 2, CH has 1, CH3 has 3. So total 2+1+3=6 H from substituent 2).

So total H:4 +3 +6=13. But the options for C12 are B (14 H) and C (12 H). 13 doesn't match.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the NMR signals again.

The vinyl group shows one doublet and one doublet of quartets. The doublet would suggest coupling with one neighboring proton, perhaps a trans coupling. The doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two different sets of protons, maybe two neighboring groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the vinyl group is adjacent to another proton group. For example, if the vinyl group is part of a substituent like CH2=CH-O-CO-R.

In that case, the CH2 would be next to the oxygen, and the CH would be attached to oxygen. The CH2 would couple with the CH, leading to a triplet for CH2 and a doublet for CH. But the NMR shows a doublet and a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is in a different configuration. For example, if the substituent is a propenyl group (CH2=CH-CH2-), the CH2 at the end would have two neighbors: the CH and the next CH2. Wait, but that might lead to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to another group, leading to quartet splitting.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows two signals for –CH3 groups. So, each –CH3 is in a different environment. So, for example, one –CH3 is attached to an oxygen (like in an ester) and another –CH3 is attached to a vinyl group.

So substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester), which has a –CH2CH3 group (two –CH2 and one –CH3). Wait, but that would give one –CH3 signal. Substituent 2 is something with another –CH3.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a CH2=CH-CH3 group. So, substituent 1 has a –CH2CH3 (ester), which contributes two –CH2 and one –CH3. Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 signals, so perhaps substituent 1 has a –CH3 and substituent 2 has another –CH3.

But substituent 1 being O-CO-CH3 (methyl ester) would have one –CH3. Substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3, which has another –CH3. So that would give two –CH3 signals, matching the NMR.

So, substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (3 C, 3 H), substituent 2: CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C, 5 H). Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12. Total H:4+3+5=12. So formula is C12H12O2, which is option C.

But wait, the degrees of unsaturation for C12H12O2 is (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26-12)/2=7.

Which would mean 7 degrees of unsaturation. Benzene:3, ester:1 (C=O), vinyl group:1 (CH2=CH). That's 5. So where are the other 2 degrees?

Ah, perhaps substituent 2 (CH2=CH-CH3) has a double bond (1) and a ring? But I don't see a ring there. Alternatively, maybe substituent 1's structure includes another double bond.

Wait, substituent 1 is O-CO-CH3. That's a single carbonyl group. No other double bonds. So that can't be.

Hmm. This is confusing. Let me try to think of another way.

The NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So substituent 1 is an ester with a –CH3 (like OAc), and substituent 2 has another –CH3.

Substituent 2 is a vinyl group with a –CH3. So probably CH2=CH-CH3.

So substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (3 C, 3 H), substituent 2: CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C, 5 H).

Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12. H:4+3+5=12.

So formula is C12H12O2, option C.

But degrees of unsaturation is 7. So 3 (benzene) +1 (ester) +1 (vinyl) +2 more.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 has another double bond, but CH2=CH-CH3 only has one double bond. So that's 3 +1 +1 =5. So where's the 7th?

Ah, I think I'm missing something. The substituent 2 could be part of a ring. Like, perhaps substituent 2 is a cyclopropane ring with a vinyl group. But that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester, 4 C?), but that would add more carbons.

Wait, O-CO-CH2CH3 is 3 carbons: O-CO-O-CH2CH3. So substituent 1 is 3 C. So substituent 2 would be 3 C (CH2=CH-CH3). So total C is 6+3+3=12.

So formula is C12H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 7. So that requires one more degree. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 has a double bond and a ring, but I don't see it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aromatic ring itself, but that would complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group. No, that would require more carbons.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a cyclopropyl group attached to a vinyl group, but I'm not sure.

At this point, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the molecular formulas and possible structures.

Option D is C11H12O2. That would mean 11 carbons.

Benzene:6 C.

So substituents must add 5 C. For example, substituent 1: ester (3 C), substituent 2: 2 C.

Substituent 2 would be a vinyl group (CH2=CH2), which is 2 C.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH3 (3 C).

So total C:6+3+2=11.

Hydrogen count: benzene 4, substituent 1:3 H, substituent 2:4 H. Total H:11. But option D is C11H12O2, which has 12 H. So doesn't match.

Alternatively, substituent 2 could be a CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C), substituent 1: O-CO-CH2 (but that might not make sense).

Wait, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH2-CH3 (but that's 4 C, making substituent 1 4 C, and substituent 2 2 C: CH2=CH2. Total C:6+4+2=12, which is option B. But then H would be:

Benzene:4 H.

Substituent 1: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H (CH2CH2CH3: CH3 has 3, each CH2 has 2 ×2=4, total 7 H).

Substituent 2: CH2=CH2 has 4 H.

Total H:4+7+4=15. But option B is C12H14O2, which has 14 H. So discrepancy here.

Hmm, perhaps substituent 1 is O-CO-CH2CH3 (ethyl ester, 3 C, 5 H). Substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3 (3 C, 5 H). Benzene:6 C, 4 H.

Total C:6+3+3=12 → option B or C.

H:4 (benzene) +5 (ester) +5 (vinyl methyl) =14 H. So formula is C12H14O2, option B.

Degrees of unsaturation: (2*12 +2 -14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. 

Breakdown: benzene (3), ester (1), vinyl (1), and substituent 2's structure.

Wait, substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3, which has a double bond (1), so 3+1+1+1=6. So that works.

So formula is C12H14O2, option B.

But wait, earlier I thought substituent 2 is CH2=CH-CH3, which has 5 H. So substituent 1 (ester) has 5 H, substituent 2 has 5 H, benzene has 4 H. Total H:4+5+5=14, which matches option B.

So the structure would have:

Benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group (O-CO-CH2CH3), which contributes 5 H (from CH2CH3), and another substituent is CH2=CH-CH3, which contributes 5 H.

So the formula is C12H14O2, option B.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the IR spectrum. The NMR data provides six signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two methyl groups. The absence of signals for CH₂ groups suggests that all methyl groups are in distinct environments.

### Key Analysis:
1. **IR Spectrum**: The presence of an ester group (C=O) is confirmed, contributing two oxygen atoms to the molecular formula.

2. **NMR Spectrum**:
   - **Aromatic Protons**: Two signals indicate two distinct environments for the aromatic protons, consistent with a di-substituted benzene ring with different substituents.
   - **Vinyl Protons**: Two signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets) suggest a vinyl group with specific coupling patterns.
   - **Methyl Groups**: Two signals indicate two distinct methyl groups in different environments.

3. **Molecular Formula Options**:
   - **Option A (C₁₁H₁₄O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 5. This would require one double bond or ring in addition to the benzene ring and ester group. However, the NMR data suggests more complexity.
   - **Option B (C₁₂H₁₄O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6. This accounts for the benzene ring (3), ester carbonyl (1), and a vinyl group (1), with one additional degree of unsaturation.
   - **Option C (C₁₂H₁₂O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 7. This would require an additional double bond or ring, which is not supported by the NMR data.
   - **Option D (C₁₁H₁₂O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6. However, the hydrogen count does not match the expected number of hydrogens based on the substituents.

4. **Structure Determination**:
   - The benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-CH₂CH₃), contributing 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens, and the other is a vinyl group (e.g., CH₂=CH-CH₃), contributing 3 carbons and 5 hydrogens.
   - The total molecular formula becomes **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**, which matches **Option B**.

5. **Hydrogen Count**:
   - Benzene contributes 4 hydrogens.
   - Ester group (O-CO-CH₂CH₃) contributes 5 hydrogens.
   - Vinyl group (CH₂=CH-CH₃) contributes 5 hydrogens.
   - Total hydrogens = 4 + 5 + 5 = 14, consistent with **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₄O₂**, corresponding to **Option B**.
