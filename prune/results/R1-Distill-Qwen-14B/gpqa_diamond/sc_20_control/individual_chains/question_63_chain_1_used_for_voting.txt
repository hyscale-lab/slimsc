Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and some quantum stuff. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see if I can work through it.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that a molecule absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is in its fundamental state, so that's the ground state, right? And we're modeling it using the rotation-vibration model, which I think is a bit more advanced than the rigid rotor model because it allows for some stretching of the bond.

Wait, the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is the same as the rotation-vibration model. So it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy states.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe means the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). When it absorbs a photon, it will transition to the next possible state with the lowest energy. So what's the next state?

In the quantum mechanical model, energy levels for vibrations are quantized. The fundamental vibrational state is v=0. The first excited vibrational state is v=1. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states. But what's the next lowest energy? Because sometimes the next state might involve a change in rotation without vibration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." The next state would be the one that requires the least energy to reach. So maybe the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or increase its rotational state. Which of these requires less energy?

So I need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy?

I think the energy levels for rotation (J) are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, the energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

Wait, but the fundamental state (v=0) has E_vib = (1/2) h w. If the molecule moves to v=1, the energy increases by h w. Alternatively, moving from J=0 to J=1 in rotation: the rotational energy increases by B (1*(1+1)) - B(0*(0+1)) = 2B. So the energy difference for rotation is 2B.

So which is smaller: h w or 2B?

We can calculate both and compare.

Given that the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So the vibrational energy difference is h*w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

But wait, the first transition in vibration is from v=0 to v=1, which requires an energy of h*w. So that's the energy needed for that.

Now for the rotational part. The rotational constant B is given by (h/(8π² I)) * (1), where I is the moment of inertia. I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r². μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

So let's compute μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. One amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So:

Mx = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg
My = 2 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-27 kg

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27)

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (3.32e-26)*(3.32e-27) = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.0224e-53 = 1.10224e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 (1 + 0.1) )= 3.32e-26 * 1.1 = 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.10224e-52) / (3.652e-26) ) = approximately (1.10224 / 3.652) * 1e-52+26 = 0.3017 * 1e-26 = 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that again. 1.10224e-52 / 3.652e-26 = (1.10224 / 3.652) * 1e-52+26? Wait, no: when you divide exponents, subtract. So 1e-52 / 1e-26 is 1e-26. So 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.10224 / 3.652 is approximately 0.3017. So yeah, 3.017e-27 kg.

Now, the moment of inertia I is μ r². r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = (3.017e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Then, B = h/(8π² I). Let's compute that.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 )

Compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 95.3e-46 ≈ 9.53e-45.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 9.53e-45 ≈ approx 6.95e9 rad^-1.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

6.626e-34 divided by 9.53e-45 is roughly 6.626 /9.53 * 1e11.

6.626 /9.53 is about 0.695, so 0.695e11 = 6.95e10 rad^-1.

Wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let's re-do:

Denominator: 8π² * I = 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 * 1.2068 = approx 95.29e-46 = 9.529e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.529e-45 = (6.626 /9.529) * 1e( -34 +45 )= 0.695 * 1e11 = 6.95e10 rad^-1.

So B is approximately 6.95e10 rad^-1.

Now, the energy difference for rotation from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. So E_rot = 2 * 6.95e10 = 1.39e11 rad^-1.

Wait, but what is the actual energy in joules? Because E_rot = B J(J+1), so the change from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. Remember that B is in units of rad^-1, but energy is (rad^-1)(action), but let me think.

Alternatively, since B has units of rad/s (because it's h/(8π² I), and h is J·s, I is kg·m², so h/(I) is (J·s)/(kg·m²) )= ( (kg m²/s²) · s ) / (kg m²) ) = 1/s. So B is in s^-1, which is rad/s.

So E_rot is in J because B is s^-1, and J(J+1) is dimensionless, so E_rot = B * J(J+1) in J.

So for the rotational change, the energy required is 2B. So 2 * 6.95e10 s^-1.

Wait, but energy is E = h * (frequency). So perhaps it's better to express the energy in terms of h multiplied by the frequency.

Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1). But I might be mixing up terms. Alternatively, B is sometimes defined as h/(8π² c I), but perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to calculate the energy difference in terms of wavenumbers or something else.

Wait, another approach: the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in energy units. Alternatively, B can be expressed as (h/(8π² I)) where I is the moment of inertia. So in this case, B is in units of energy per J(J+1), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B. Let me compute that as an energy in joules.

Wait, B is 6.95e10 rad/s. So, energy E_rot = B * (J(J+1)). So for J=0, E_rot =0. For J=1, E_rot= 2B.

So the energy required for the rotational transition is 2B. Let's compute 2B: 2 * 6.95e10 = 1.39e11 rad/s.

But to get the energy in joules, since E=ħ * angular frequency. Or wait, no. Energy E = B * J(J+1) * h? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the rotational constant and actual energy. Wait, let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (h² / (8π² I)) * J (J +1). So E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B = h²/(8π² I). Wait, no, B is h/(8π² I) multiplied by something? I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no. The rotational energy is given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (h/(2π)). So E_rot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I ). So the rotational constant B is h/(8 π² I ), which has units of s^-1.

So E_rot = B * J (J+1) * h? Or wait, no: because E_rot is in joules, and B has units of s^-1, so E_rot = B * J (J+1) * h ?

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. Let me correct this. B is h/(8 π² I ), so E_rot is (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I ) = h * B * J(J+1). So E_rot is h multiplied by B multiplied by J(J+1).

So for J=0 to J=1, the change in energy is (h B)(2) - 0 = 2 h B.

Wait, that makes sense. So the energy difference is 2 h B.

Wait, let me check:

E_rot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I ) = (h / (8 π² I )) * h J (J+1) ?

Wait, no, perhaps E_rot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I ). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E = (h² * 2) / (8 π² I ) = h²/(4 π² I ).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute B in terms of energy.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute B in terms of energy per J(J+1). Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual energy for the rotational transition.

B is h/(8 π² I ), which is 6.626e-34 J·s / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 kg·m² )

Wait, let me re-calculate B:

I = μ r² = (3.017e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34) / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 )

Compute denominator:

8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 *1.2068 = approx 95.29, so 95.29e-46 = 9.529e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.529e-45 = approx 6.626 / 9.529 = 0.695, multiplied by 1e11 (because 1e-34 / 1e-45 = 1e11), so 0.695e11 = 6.95e10 s^-1.

So B is 6.95e10 s^-1.

Thus, the energy difference for the rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) is ΔE_rot = 2 h B.

Wait, no: the energy for J=1 is E = h B J (J+1) / (something?), wait no:

Wait, earlier calculation says E_rot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I ). So for J=1, E_rot = (h² * 2 ) / (8 π² I ) = (h² ) / (4 π² I ). The energy difference is this minus zero, so ΔE_rot = (h²) / (4 π² I ).

Alternatively, since B = h/(8 π² I ), then h = 8 π² I B.

So substituting into ΔE_rot:

ΔE_rot = ( (8 π² I B )^2 ) / (4 π² I ) )

= (64 π^4 I² B² ) / (4 π² I )

= 16 π² I B².

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's easier to compute using B as s^-1.

Wait, E_rot = B * J (J+1) in energy terms, but B is h/(8 π² I ), which is 6.95e10 s^-1. So when you multiply by J (J+1), you get s^-1 multiplied by a dimensionless number, but that doesn't give you energy. So I must be missing something.

Wait, no, actually, the correct formula for E_rot is:

E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I )

Where ħ is h/(2 π). So E_rot = ( (h/(2 π))^2 J (J+1) ) / (2 I )

= (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I )

Which is the same as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 π² I )

Wait, that makes sense. So B is h²/(8 π² I ), which is in units of (J·s)^2/(kg·m²) )? Wait, no:

Wait, h has units of J·s. So h squared is (J·s)^2. Divided by I (kg·m²). So (J² s²)/(kg m²). J is kg m²/s², so J² is kg^2 m^4 / s^4. So numerator is kg^2 m^4 s^2 / s^4 = kg^2 m^4 s^-2. Divided by denominator kg m²: so (kg^2 m^4 s^-2) / (kg m²) ) = kg m^2 s^-2.

Wait, that doesn't seem to give the right units. Wait, perhaps I should just compute B in terms of energy per J(J+1).

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of energy, so that E_rot is in joules.

Wait, here's a better approach:

E_rot for J=1 is E_rot = (h² * 2 )/(8 π² I )

Similarly, the vibrational energy difference is E_vib = h w.

We need to compare E_rot and E_vib to see which is smaller because the molecule will transition to the state requiring the least energy.

Compute E_rot:

E_rot = (h² * 2 ) / (8 π² I )

I have I = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

So plug in the numbers:

E_rot = ( (6.626e-34)^2 * 2 ) / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx (4.39e-67) * 2 = 8.78e-67.

Denominator: 8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 = 8 * 9.8696 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 8 * 9.8696 = 78.9568; 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 95.29e-46 = 9.529e-45.

So E_rot ≈ 8.78e-67 / 9.529e-45 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, 8.78e-67 / 9.529e-45 is 8.78/9.529 ≈ 0.921, and exponents: 1e-67 / 1e-45 = 1e-22. So 0.921e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

Now, E_vib is h w = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

Which is way bigger than 9.21e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

So the molecule will transition to J=1, v=0, which is the next lowest energy state.

So the photon needs to have energy equal to the rotational energy difference, which is 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about momentum, not energy. The photon's momentum p is related to its energy E. The energy of a photon is E = p c, where c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

But let me recall that the momentum of a photon is p = E/c. Since E = h f = h c / λ, then p = (h c / λ) / c = h/(λ). But alternatively, since for a photon, E = pc, so p = E/(c).

So, the photon's momentum is p = E_rot / c.

Where E_rot is 9.21e-23 J.

Speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near 3e-31. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I messed up a calculation step.

Wait, let's re-do E_rot:

E_rot = (h² * 2 ) / (8 π² I )

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 π² I = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

8 *9.8696≈78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 *1.2068e-46≈95.29e-46=9.529e-45.

So E_rot = (4.39e-67 * 2) / 9.529e-45.

4.39e-67 *2=8.78e-67.

8.78e-67 / 9.529e-45 = approx 9.21e-23 J. That's correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the photon's momentum is p = E / c, but E is given in joules.

p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.21 /3 )e-31 kg·m/s → approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in determining the transition.

Wait, perhaps the next state is not a rotational transition but a vibrational one, but that can't be because the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the transition to the first excited vibrational state, which has higher energy, but that would require a higher energy photon. But the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, so that would be the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model requires considering both rotational and vibrational changes, but I don't think that's the case. The question is about the next lowest state, so it's the smallest possible ΔE.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Moment of inertia I = μ r².

μ = (m1 m2)/(m1 + m2) = (20 amu *2 amu)/(22 amu) = (40 amu²)/(22 amu) = 20/11 amu.

20/11 amu is approx 1.818 amu. But wait, the masses are 20 and 2 amu.

Wait, wait: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) =40 /22 = 20/11 amu ≈1.818 amu.

Then, converting μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu = approx 1.818 * 1.66e-27.

1.818 *1.66 ≈3.016. So μ≈3.016e-27 kg.

So I = μ r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20=1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = h/(8 π² I ) =6.626e-34 / (8 * π^2 *1.2064e-46 )

8 * π^2≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2064e-46 =approx 95.29e-46=9.529e-45 kg m².

So B=6.626e-34 /9.529e-45 =approx6.95e10 s^-1.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 h B.

Wait, no. E_rot is (h² / (8 π² I )) * J (J+1) = B * h * J (J+1).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, E_rot = (ħ^2 J (J+1))/(2 I )

ħ is h/(2 π), so:

E_rot = ( (h/(2 π))^2 J (J+1) ) / (2 I )

= (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I )

Which is the same as E_rot = h²/(8 π² I ) * J (J+1) = B * J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 π² I )

Wait, but that can't be because B was defined as h/(8 π² I ). So perhaps I got the definition of B wrong.

Wait, let me clarify: the rotational constant B is usually defined as h/(8 π² I ), which has units of s^-1 (since I is kg m², h is J s = kg m²/s, so h/(I) is s^-1).

So, E_rot = B J (J+1) * h/(2 π). Wait, no, because E_rot = (ħ^2 J (J+1))/(2 I ) = (h²/(4 π² )) J (J+1)/(2 I ) = h² J (J+1)/(8 π² I )

Which is (h/(8 π² I )) * h J (J+1) / something? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express E_rot in terms of wavenumbers. Or perhaps I should just compute the energy difference in terms of B and h.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy required for the rotational transition is 2 h B, because from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is (2B h) - 0 = 2Bh.

Wait, because E_rot = B h J (J+1).

Wait, no, E_rot = (h/(8 π² I )) * J (J+1).

Wait, but that would give units of (J s)/(kg m²) * s^-1 (from J (J+1)), but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the energy difference in terms of the rotational constant B, which is in units of cm^-1 (wavenumbers), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the photon is given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes. But in this case, the smallest possible energy would come from just the rotational change.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to compute the energy difference again:

E_rot = (h² *2)/(8 π² I )

Which is ( (6.626e-34)^2 *2 ) / (8 * π² *1.2068e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67, times 2 is 8.78e-67.

Denominator: 8 * π²≈78.9568, multiplied by 1.2068e-46 gives 95.29e-46 =9.529e-45.

So E_rot = 8.78e-67 /9.529e-45 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J. Photon's momentum is p = E/c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, none of these match 3e-31. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the next state. Maybe the next state is a combination of vibrational and rotational. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the smallest ΔE.

Wait, maybe the molecule is already in the v=0, J=0 state. The next possible state could be v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=1. But the lowest energy would be v=0, J=1, as we found.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental state as the lowest vibrational and rotational state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which requires more energy than the rotational transition. But earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition requires less energy, so why is the answer not matching?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering rotational transitions because it's a diatomic molecule and the selection rules allow only certain transitions. Wait, in the rigid rotor model, rotational transitions require ΔJ = ±2, which is a bit tricky. But in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps ΔJ can be ±1. Wait, but in the dipole approximation, for rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So J can go from 0 to 1.

Wait, but if the molecule is in J=0, then it can transition to J=1. So that's allowed.

So back to the calculation. The energy of the photon is 9.21e-23 J, which translates to a momentum p=3.07e-31 N·s. But the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using a different approach. Let me compute the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, the rotational constant in wavenumbers is given by B = h/(8 π² c I ), where c is the speed of light. Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed as (h/(8 π² I )) in units of cm^-1 when multiplied by 1/(c).

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in cm^-1.

Let me compute I again.

I = μ r².

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-8 cm.

So r² = (2e-8 cm)^2 =4e-16 cm².

μ is (20 *2 amu) / (20 +2 amu) )=40/22 amu ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu ≈1.66e-24 g, so μ=1.818 *1.66e-24 g ≈3.016e-24 g =3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, so I =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m )^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m².

But if I express r in cm: 2e-8 cm.

So I = μ r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-8 cm)^2.

Wait, but that's getting into mixed units. Let me convert everything to cgs units.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-8 cm.

μ =3.016e-27 kg = 3.016e-24 g.

So I = μ r² =3.016e-24 g * (2e-8 cm)^2 =3.016e-24 g *4e-16 cm².

3.016e-24 *4e-16 =1.206e-39 g cm².

Then, B in wavenumbers (cm^-1) is B = h/(8 π² c I ), where h is Planck's constant in cgs units.

h =6.626e-27 erg s.

c =3e10 cm/s.

So:

B = (6.626e-27 erg s) / (8 * π² *3e10 cm/s * 1.206e-39 g cm² )

Compute denominator:

8 * π²≈78.9568.

Multiply by 3e10 cm/s: 78.9568 *3e10 ≈2.3687e12.

Multiply by I (1.206e-39 g cm²): 2.3687e12 *1.206e-39 =2.857e-27 cm/s *g cm².

Wait, units: denominator is (cm/s) * g cm² = g cm^3/s.

So B = (6.626e-27 erg s ) / (2.857e-27 g cm^3/s )

1 erg =1 g cm²/s².

So numerator is 6.626e-27 g cm²/s² * s =6.626e-27 g cm²/s.

Denominator is 2.857e-27 g cm^3/s.

So B = (6.626e-27 g cm²/s ) / (2.857e-27 g cm^3/s ) )= (6.626 /2.857 ) * (1/(cm )).

6.626/2.857 ≈2.32.

So B≈2.32 cm^-1.

Thus, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1. But to find the energy in joules, we need to convert cm^-1 to joules.

1 cm^-1 corresponds to E = hc cm^-1.

h is Planck's constant in cgs units: 6.626e-27 erg s. c is 3e10 cm/s.

So E = (6.626e-27 erg s ) * (3e10 cm/s) ) * (1 cm^-1 )

But 1 erg =1 g cm²/s². So E = (6.626e-27 *3e10 ) erg cm * (1 cm^-1 )

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

E = hc * (wavenumber) = (6.626e-27 erg s) * (3e10 cm/s) * (1 cm^-1 )

=6.626e-27 *3e10 erg

=1.9878e-16 erg.

Convert erg to joules: 1 erg =1e-7 J.

So E =1.9878e-16 *1e-7 J =1.9878e-23 J.

But wait, B is 2.32 cm^-1, so the energy for J=1 is E_rot = B * J (J+1) =2.32 * 2 =4.64 cm^-1.

So E_rot =4.64 * hc erg.

So E_rot =4.64 *6.626e-27 erg *3e10 cm/s * (1 cm^-1 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the energy as E = B * hc.

E = 2.32 cm^-1 * 6.626e-27 erg s *3e10 cm/s.

So E =2.32 *6.626e-27 *3e10 erg.

6.626e-27 *3e10 =1.9878e-16.

Multiply by 2.32: 4.59e-16 erg.

Convert to joules: 4.59e-16 erg *1e-7 J/erg=4.59e-23 J.

So E_rot is about 4.59e-23 J, which is roughly similar to the earlier calculation of 9.21e-23 J. Wait, but earlier calculation was about 9e-23, this is 4.5e-23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation when converting from cm to m. Maybe the difference comes from that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy difference as the vibrational energy minus the rotational energy. But in any case, the photon's momentum is E/c.

So if E_rot is 4.59e-23 J, then p=4.59e-23 J /3e8 m/s =1.53e-31 N·s.

Still not matching the options. So perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem requires the photon to provide energy for both a vibrational and rotational transition. But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy", which would be the smallest ΔE. So the minimal ΔE is the rotational transition.

Wait, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recheck μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ= (20 *2)/(20+2 )=40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.66e-27 kg. So μ=1.818 *1.66e-27 ≈3.016e-27 kg.

r=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

I=μ r²=3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.016e-27 *4e-20=1.2064e-46 kg m².

B= h/(8 π² I )=6.626e-34 / (8 * π² *1.2064e-46 )

Compute denominator:8 * pi^2≈78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈95.29e-46=9.529e-45.

B=6.626e-34 /9.529e-45 ≈6.95e10 s^-1.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 * (h B) = 2 *6.626e-34 J·s *6.95e10 s^-1= 2 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10.

6.626e-34 *6.95e10≈4.606e-23.

Multiply by 2:9.21e-23 J.

So p=9.21e-23 J /3e8 m/s=3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question's interpretation.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next allowed state, which could be either vibrational (v=1, J=0) or rotational (v=0, J=1). From previous calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy (9.21e-23 J versus 2.65e-19 J).

But none of the options match 3e-31. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is actually the sum of both the vibrational and rotational changes. But that would require a larger energy, which also doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the fundamental state as the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the next state is v=1, which requires a photon with energy h w. But earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition is lower energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't allow for rotational transitions and only considers vibrational. But that would contradict the question's mention of the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy for an R branch transition (rotational plus vibrational), but that would have higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the change in energy due to rotation but about the photon's energy being such that the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state, which could be either rotation or vibration, whichever is lower. But I calculated that rotation is lower.

But the momentum I calculated is 3e-31 N·s, which is much smaller than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when computing E_rot. Let me recheck:

Wait, E_rot = (h² *2 )/(8 π² I ) → correct.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

I is 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So 6.626e-34 squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Multiply by 2:8.78e-67.

Divide by 8 pi^2 I → 8 *9.8696 *1.2064e-46 =95.29e-46.

So 8.78e-67 /95.29e-46 = 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the photon's momentum as p = h / λ. Since E =h f = pc → p = E/c = h f /c = h/(lambda). But without knowing the wavelength, perhaps we can find it in terms of w.

Wait, alternatively, since the photon's energy is E = h w_photon, and p = E/c = h w_photon / c.

Wait, but the energy E_photon is equal to the energy difference between the states, which is 9.21e-23 J.

So, p_photon = E_photon / c =9.21e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Still doesn't match any options.

So, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me look at the options.

Options:

A)1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, these are much larger than my calculated 3e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the energy difference.

Wait, maybe the transition isn't rotational but vibrational. Let's compute the vibrational photon's momentum.

E_vib =h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p_vib=E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is close to half of that. Hmm, but why would the photon's momentum be half?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the next state, but the next vibrational state. But earlier I thought rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the model considers that the molecule can't change vibrational state without a certain amount of rotational change. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy for a transition that involves both a change in vibration and rotation, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the moment of inertia and frequency. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, let's try another approach: the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (1/2) I ω^2 (J (J+1)), where ω is the angular velocity. But I don't know ω for the rotational state. So perhaps I should find ω in terms of the bond length and the moment of inertia.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the centrifugal distortion model, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is much simpler and I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the photon's momentum is related to the rotational partition function, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe the question is simply asking for the photon's momentum needed to excite the molecule from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1. So the energy required is the rotational energy difference, and the photon's momentum is p = E/c.

So from earlier, E_rot =9.21e-23 J → p=3.07e-31 N·s. But no options match.

So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the molecule transitions to the next state which is vibrational, not rotational.

If that's the case, E_vib=2.65e-19 J. p_vib=8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, which is about a fifth of that. Option D is 1.4e-28, also less than a third. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) but with some rotational state, and the photon excites it to a higher rotational state. But no, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the energy difference between two adjacent rotational states, but I'm probably missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy for the rotational transition is 2B, not 2 h B. Let me compute that.

If B is 6.95e10 s^-1, then 2B=1.39e11 s^-1.

So E_rot = h * 2B =6.626e-34 *1.39e11 =9.21e-23 J. Same result as before.

So I'm not getting any closer. Maybe the mistake is in the calculation of μ.

Wait, Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ= (20 *2 )/(20+2 )=40/22=20/11=1.81818 amu.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for μ. Let me recheck.

1 amu =1.660539e-27 kg.

So μ=1.81818 amu *1.660539e-27 kg/amu =approx 3.017e-27 kg.

Which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, which doesn't account for bond length changes. But the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which does account for bond length changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the moment of inertia should be calculated using the reduced mass and the bond length, which I did.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is looking for the photon's momentum that causes a transition to the next higher rotational state, which would be J=1 → J=2. But that would require a higher energy.

Wait, J=0 → J=1 requires 2B, J=1→J=2 requires 6B, which is 3 times higher. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first overtone vibrational transition, but that requires more energy.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A)1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, my calculation for the vibrational transition gives p=8.83e-28 Ns. The closest option is A)1.9e-28.

But that's about a fifth of my result. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the vibrational transition but only the zero-point energy. Wait, no, the fundamental state is v=0, and the next is v=1.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like considering the energy levels as quantized in a harmonic oscillator, but I don't think that changes the energy calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the wavenumber (cm^-1) for the vibrational transition and not converting it to joules correctly.

Wait, the vibrational frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

Alternatively, sometimes the vibrational frequency is given in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), which is w/(2 pi c), where c is the speed of light.

So, wavenumber ν̃ = w/(2 pi c).

w=4e14 rad/s → ν̃=4e14/(2 pi *3e8)≈4e14/(6e9)=approx 6.666e4 cm^-1.

Then, the energy per photon for the vibrational transition is E=h c ν̃.

h c =12400 eV·Å → but wait, in joules, h c ≈1.986e-25 J·m.

So E=1.986e-25 J·m * 6.666e4 cm^-1.

Wait, cm is 0.01 m. So 6.666e4 cm^-1 =6.666e6 m^-1.

So E=1.986e-25 J·m *6.666e6 m^-1 =1.986e-25 *6.666e6 =1.324e-18 J.

Which is close to h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J. So the discrepancy is because ν̃ is w/(2 pi c), which brings it down by a factor of 2 pi.

Wait, so perhaps I should compute E_vib as h ν̃ c.

Wait, no, E= h ν̃ c.

ν̃=6.666e4 cm^-1.

E= h * ν̃ * c =6.626e-34 J·s *6.666e4 cm^-1 *3e10 cm/s.

Compute:

6.626e-34 *6.666e4=4.417e-29.

Multiply by 3e10:1.325e-18 J.

So p= E/c=1.325e-18 /3e8=4.417e-27 N·s.

Looking at the options, option C is1.1e-27, B is2.3e-27.

4.4e-27 is between B and C.

Hmm, but this is an alternative approach. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, which is 1.4e-28, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact E for the vibrational transition.

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

Which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but about 4.6 times larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the selection rules and only certain transitions are allowed, but I'm not sure.

I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess. Based on the earlier calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy, but the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps the vibrational transition is the intended path.

If the photon's momentum is 8.83e-28 N·s, the closest option is A (1.9e-28), but it's about 4.6 times lower. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for E_vib.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_vib=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is A)1.9e-28, but it's about a factor of 4.6 off.

Another option: perhaps the problem is asking for the momentum of the photon that causes the molecule to go from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. So the energy is E_vib = h w. Thus, p=8.83e-28 N·s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)1.4e-28, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy, and the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27.

Wait, 1.1e-27 is 1e-27, which is about 1e3 times larger than 3e-31.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy as E_rot = B, not 2B.

Wait, earlier I thought the energy for J=1 is 2B. But if for some reason the energy is just B, then E_rot =6.95e10 s^-1 *6.626e-34 J·s =4.606e-23 J.

p=4.606e-23 /3e8=1.535e-31 N·s. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is B/2, but that would make it even smaller.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the reduced mass and the bond length to compute the moment of inertia, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, which is 2 angstroms=2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the rotational energy as E_rot = (h c B) J (J+1), where c is the speed of light. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the rotational constant in wavenumbers.

Earlier, I found B ≈2.32 cm^-1. So the energy is E_rot =2.32 cm^-1 * hc.

hc=12400 eV·Å.

So E_rot =2.32 *12400 eV·Å / (1 cm =100 Å).

Wait, cm^-1 * eV·Å/cm → not sure.

Alternatively, hc=12400 eV·Å.

So E_rot = B (cm^-1) * hc (eV·Å) / 100 Å/cm.

Wait, because 1 cm=1e8 Å? No, 1 cm=1e8 Å? Wait, no: 1 Å is 1e-8 cm. So 1 cm=1e8 Å.

So E_rot = B (cm^-1) * hc (eV·Å) * (1 cm / 1e8 Å) )

Which is B * hc * 1e-8 eV.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute E_rot in eV.

B=2.32 cm^-1.

hc=12400 eV·Å.

So E_rot = B * hc / (1 cm → in Å) → 2.32 cm^-1 * 12400 eV·Å * (1 cm / 1e8 Å )

Wait, cm and Å cancel out.

So E_rot =2.32 *12400 *1e-8 eV =2.32 *1.24e3 *1e-8 =2.32 *1.24e-5 eV →≈2.88e-5 eV.

Convert to joules: 1 eV=1.602e-19 J. So 2.88e-5 eV=4.613e-24 J.

Which is 4.6e-24 J. Then, p= E/c =4.6e-24 /3e8=1.53e-32 N·s. Even smaller than before.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 N·s, which is about 1e-27.

But I can't see where that comes from. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy and the calculation yields p=8.83e-28 Ns, and the closest option is A)1.9e-28, but it's about a factor of 4.6 off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the units again. Momentum p=Energy/c.

If I have E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s. So option A is 1.9e-28, which is close to 8.83e-28 divided by 4.64.

Wait, 8.83e-28 /4.64≈1.9e-28. So perhaps the problem is considering the selection rule for vibrational transitions, which only allows changes in v by ±1, but for rotational, it's ±2, so perhaps the photon's energy is considering only part of the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average energy difference, but I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option C)1.1e-27, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D)1.4e-28.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking about the momentum of the photon that causes the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which could involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the vibrational transition's photon momentum. If the photon's energy is h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, then p=8.83e-28 N·s. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, but it's about 4.6 times smaller.

Hmm. I'm not getting any closer. In the interest of time, I'll have to make a choice based on the available options and my calculations. The closest option to the vibrational transition is A)1.9e-28. But my calculation gives 8.83e-28. So perhaps the intended answer is A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the only one in the same order of magnitude is option A:1.9e-28. But it's about 4.6 times smaller. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But why the discrepancy? Maybe I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is actually ½ h w. No, that would be for the zero-point energy, but the transition is from v=0 to v=1, which is h w.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is ½ h w. But that doesn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck and have to go with the closest option. So I'll choose option A)1.9e-28 Ns.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Masses**:  
   - \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} = 3.32 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \)  
   - \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} = 3.32 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)  
   - Reduced mass:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{(20)(2)}{22} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]

2. **Bond Length**:  
   \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

3. **Moment of Inertia**:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

4. **Rotational Constant**:  
   \[
   B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 (1.2064 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 6.95 \times 10^{10} \, \text{s}^{-1}.
   \]

5. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition (J=0 → J=1)**:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 (6.95 \times 10^{10}) = 1.39 \times 10^{11} \, \text{s}^{-1}.
   \]  
   Converting to joules:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = h \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (1.39 \times 10^{11}) \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

6. **Energy Difference for Vibrational Transition (v=0 → v=1)**:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\( 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) compared to the vibrational transition (\( 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)).  
- Therefore, the molecule will transition to the next lowest energy state via the **rotational transition** (J=0 → J=1).

### Photon Momentum:
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:  
\[
p = \frac{E}{c}.
\]  
For the rotational transition:  
\[
p = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
\]  
This value is much smaller than any of the provided options, suggesting a possible discrepancy in the interpretation of the problem or the options.

### Vibrational Transition (Alternative Consideration):
If the problem instead considers the vibrational transition, the photon momentum would be:  
\[
p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
\]  
The closest option to this value is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)**, though it is about a factor of 4.6 smaller.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated rotational momentum and the provided options, and assuming the problem may intend for the vibrational transition, the most reasonable choice is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and some quantum stuff. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see if I can work through it.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that a molecule absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is in its fundamental state, so that's the ground state, right? And we're modeling it using the rotation-vibration model, which I think is a bit more advanced than the rigid rotor model because it allows for some stretching of the bond.

Wait, the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is the same as the rotation-vibration model. So it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy states.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe means the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). When it absorbs a photon, it will transition to the next possible state with the lowest energy. So what's the next state?

In the quantum mechanical model, energy levels for vibrations are quantized. The fundamental vibrational state is v=0. The first excited vibrational state is v=1. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, transitions can involve changes in both vibrational and rotational states. But what's the next lowest energy? Because sometimes the next state might involve a change in rotation without vibration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." The next state would be the one that requires the least energy to reach. So maybe the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or increase its rotational state. Which of these requires less energy?

So I need to calculate the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next possible state. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy?

I think the energy levels for rotation (J) are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, the energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

Wait, but the fundamental state (v=0) has E_vib = (1/2) h w. If the molecule moves to v=1, the energy increases by h w. Alternatively, moving from J=0 to J=1 in rotation: the rotational energy increases by B (1*(1+1)) - B(0*(0+1)) = 2B. So the energy difference for rotation is 2B.

So which is smaller: h w or 2B?

We can calculate both and compare.

Given that the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So the vibrational energy difference is h*w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

But wait, the first transition in vibration is from v=0 to v=1, which requires an energy of h*w. So that's the energy needed for that.

Now for the rotational part. The rotational constant B is given by (h/(8π² I)) * (1), where I is the moment of inertia. I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r². μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

So let's compute μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. One amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So:

Mx = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg
My = 2 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-27 kg

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27)

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (3.32e-26)*(3.32e-27) = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 = approx 11.0224e-53 = 1.10224e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 (1 + 0.1) )= 3.32e-26 * 1.1 = 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.10224e-52) / (3.652e-26) ) = approximately (1.10224 / 3.652) * 1e-52+26 = 0.3017 * 1e-26 = 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that again. 1.10224e-52 / 3.652e-26 = (1.10224 / 3.652) * 1e-52+26? Wait, no: when you divide exponents, subtract. So 1e-52 / 1e-26 is 1e-26. So 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, 1.10224 / 3.652 is approximately 0.3017. So yeah, 3.017e-27 kg.

Now, the moment of inertia I is μ r². r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = (3.017e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Then, B = h/(8π² I). Let's compute that.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So B = 6.626e-34 / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 )

Compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 95.3e-46 ≈ 9.53e-45.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 9.53e-45 ≈ approx 6.95e9 rad^-1.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

6.626e-34 divided by 9.53e-45 is roughly 6.626 /9.53 * 1e11.

6.626 /9.53 is about 0.695, so 0.695e11 = 6.95e10 rad^-1.

Wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let's re-do:

Denominator: 8π² * I = 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 * 1.2068 = approx 95.29e-46 = 9.529e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.529e-45 = (6.626 /9.529) * 1e( -34 +45 )= 0.695 * 1e11 = 6.95e10 rad^-1.

So B is approximately 6.95e10 rad^-1.

Now, the energy difference for rotation from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. So E_rot = 2 * 6.95e10 = 1.39e11 rad^-1.

Wait, but what is the actual energy in joules? Because E_rot = B J(J+1), so the change from J=0 to J=1 is 2B. Remember that B is in units of rad^-1, but energy is (rad^-1)(action), but let me think.

Alternatively, since B has units of rad/s (because it's h/(8π² I), and h is J·s, I is kg·m², so h/(I) is (J·s)/(kg·m²) )= ( (kg m²/s²) · s ) / (kg m²) ) = 1/s. So B is in s^-1, which is rad/s.

So E_rot is in J because B is s^-1, and J(J+1) is dimensionless, so E_rot = B * J(J+1) in J.

So for the rotational change, the energy required is 2B. So 2 * 6.95e10 s^-1.

Wait, but energy is E = h * (frequency). So perhaps it's better to express the energy in terms of h multiplied by the frequency.

Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J(J+1). But I might be mixing up terms. Alternatively, B is sometimes defined as h/(8π² c I), but perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to calculate the energy difference in terms of wavenumbers or something else.

Wait, another approach: the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in energy units. Alternatively, B can be expressed as (h/(8π² I)) where I is the moment of inertia. So in this case, B is in units of energy per J(J+1), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B. Let me compute that as an energy in joules.

Wait, B is 6.95e10 rad/s. So, energy E_rot = B * (J(J+1)). So for J=0, E_rot =0. For J=1, E_rot= 2B.

So the energy required for the rotational transition is 2B. Let's compute 2B: 2 * 6.95e10 = 1.39e11 rad/s.

But to get the energy in joules, since E=ħ * angular frequency. Or wait, no. Energy E = B * J(J+1) * h? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the rotational constant and actual energy. Wait, let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (h² / (8π² I)) * J (J +1). So E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B = h²/(8π² I). Wait, no, B is h/(8π² I) multiplied by something? I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no. The rotational energy is given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (h/(2π)). So E_rot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I ). So the rotational constant B is h/(8 π² I ), which has units of s^-1.

So E_rot = B * J (J+1) * h? Or wait, no: because E_rot is in joules, and B has units of s^-1, so E_rot = B * J (J+1) * h ?

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. Let me correct this. B is h/(8 π² I ), so E_rot is (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I ) = h * B * J(J+1). So E_rot is h multiplied by B multiplied by J(J+1).

So for J=0 to J=1, the change in energy is (h B)(2) - 0 = 2 h B.

Wait, that makes sense. So the energy difference is 2 h B.

Wait, let me check:

E_rot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I ) = (h / (8 π² I )) * h J (J+1) ?

Wait, no, perhaps E_rot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I ). So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E = (h² * 2) / (8 π² I ) = h²/(4 π² I ).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute B in terms of energy.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute B in terms of energy per J(J+1). Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual energy for the rotational transition.

B is h/(8 π² I ), which is 6.626e-34 J·s / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 kg·m² )

Wait, let me re-calculate B:

I = μ r² = (3.017e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34) / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 )

Compute denominator:

8 * π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 *1.2068 = approx 95.29, so 95.29e-46 = 9.529e-45.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 9.529e-45 = approx 6.626 / 9.529 = 0.695, multiplied by 1e11 (because 1e-34 / 1e-45 = 1e11), so 0.695e11 = 6.95e10 s^-1.

So B is 6.95e10 s^-1.

Thus, the energy difference for the rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) is ΔE_rot = 2 h B.

Wait, no: the energy for J=1 is E = h B J (J+1) / (something?), wait no:

Wait, earlier calculation says E_rot = (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I ). So for J=1, E_rot = (h² * 2 ) / (8 π² I ) = (h² ) / (4 π² I ). The energy difference is this minus zero, so ΔE_rot = (h²) / (4 π² I ).

Alternatively, since B = h/(8 π² I ), then h = 8 π² I B.

So substituting into ΔE_rot:

ΔE_rot = ( (8 π² I B )^2 ) / (4 π² I ) )

= (64 π^4 I² B² ) / (4 π² I )

= 16 π² I B².

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's easier to compute using B as s^-1.

Wait, E_rot = B * J (J+1) in energy terms, but B is h/(8 π² I ), which is 6.95e10 s^-1. So when you multiply by J (J+1), you get s^-1 multiplied by a dimensionless number, but that doesn't give you energy. So I must be missing something.

Wait, no, actually, the correct formula for E_rot is:

E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I )

Where ħ is h/(2 π). So E_rot = ( (h/(2 π))^2 J (J+1) ) / (2 I )

= (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I )

Which is the same as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 π² I )

Wait, that makes sense. So B is h²/(8 π² I ), which is in units of (J·s)^2/(kg·m²) )? Wait, no:

Wait, h has units of J·s. So h squared is (J·s)^2. Divided by I (kg·m²). So (J² s²)/(kg m²). J is kg m²/s², so J² is kg^2 m^4 / s^4. So numerator is kg^2 m^4 s^2 / s^4 = kg^2 m^4 s^-2. Divided by denominator kg m²: so (kg^2 m^4 s^-2) / (kg m²) ) = kg m^2 s^-2.

Wait, that doesn't seem to give the right units. Wait, perhaps I should just compute B in terms of energy per J(J+1).

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of energy, so that E_rot is in joules.

Wait, here's a better approach:

E_rot for J=1 is E_rot = (h² * 2 )/(8 π² I )

Similarly, the vibrational energy difference is E_vib = h w.

We need to compare E_rot and E_vib to see which is smaller because the molecule will transition to the state requiring the least energy.

Compute E_rot:

E_rot = (h² * 2 ) / (8 π² I )

I have I = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

So plug in the numbers:

E_rot = ( (6.626e-34)^2 * 2 ) / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx (4.39e-67) * 2 = 8.78e-67.

Denominator: 8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 = 8 * 9.8696 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 8 * 9.8696 = 78.9568; 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 95.29e-46 = 9.529e-45.

So E_rot ≈ 8.78e-67 / 9.529e-45 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, 8.78e-67 / 9.529e-45 is 8.78/9.529 ≈ 0.921, and exponents: 1e-67 / 1e-45 = 1e-22. So 0.921e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

Now, E_vib is h w = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

Which is way bigger than 9.21e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

So the molecule will transition to J=1, v=0, which is the next lowest energy state.

So the photon needs to have energy equal to the rotational energy difference, which is 9.21e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about momentum, not energy. The photon's momentum p is related to its energy E. The energy of a photon is E = p c, where c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

But let me recall that the momentum of a photon is p = E/c. Since E = h f = h c / λ, then p = (h c / λ) / c = h/(λ). But alternatively, since for a photon, E = pc, so p = E/(c).

So, the photon's momentum is p = E_rot / c.

Where E_rot is 9.21e-23 J.

Speed of light c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near 3e-31. The options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I messed up a calculation step.

Wait, let's re-do E_rot:

E_rot = (h² * 2 ) / (8 π² I )

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 π² I = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

8 *9.8696≈78.9568.

Multiply by I: 78.9568 *1.2068e-46≈95.29e-46=9.529e-45.

So E_rot = (4.39e-67 * 2) / 9.529e-45.

4.39e-67 *2=8.78e-67.

8.78e-67 / 9.529e-45 = approx 9.21e-23 J. That's correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the photon's momentum is p = E / c, but E is given in joules.

p = 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.21 /3 )e-31 kg·m/s → approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in determining the transition.

Wait, perhaps the next state is not a rotational transition but a vibrational one, but that can't be because the rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the transition to the first excited vibrational state, which has higher energy, but that would require a higher energy photon. But the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, so that would be the rotational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model requires considering both rotational and vibrational changes, but I don't think that's the case. The question is about the next lowest state, so it's the smallest possible ΔE.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Moment of inertia I = μ r².

μ = (m1 m2)/(m1 + m2) = (20 amu *2 amu)/(22 amu) = (40 amu²)/(22 amu) = 20/11 amu.

20/11 amu is approx 1.818 amu. But wait, the masses are 20 and 2 amu.

Wait, wait: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 ) =40 /22 = 20/11 amu ≈1.818 amu.

Then, converting μ to kg: 1.818 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu = approx 1.818 * 1.66e-27.

1.818 *1.66 ≈3.016. So μ≈3.016e-27 kg.

So I = μ r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20=1.2064e-46 kg m².

So B = h/(8 π² I ) =6.626e-34 / (8 * π^2 *1.2064e-46 )

8 * π^2≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2064e-46 =approx 95.29e-46=9.529e-45 kg m².

So B=6.626e-34 /9.529e-45 =approx6.95e10 s^-1.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 h B.

Wait, no. E_rot is (h² / (8 π² I )) * J (J+1) = B * h * J (J+1).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, E_rot = (ħ^2 J (J+1))/(2 I )

ħ is h/(2 π), so:

E_rot = ( (h/(2 π))^2 J (J+1) ) / (2 I )

= (h² J (J+1)) / (8 π² I )

Which is the same as E_rot = h²/(8 π² I ) * J (J+1) = B * J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 π² I )

Wait, but that can't be because B was defined as h/(8 π² I ). So perhaps I got the definition of B wrong.

Wait, let me clarify: the rotational constant B is usually defined as h/(8 π² I ), which has units of s^-1 (since I is kg m², h is J s = kg m²/s, so h/(I) is s^-1).

So, E_rot = B J (J+1) * h/(2 π). Wait, no, because E_rot = (ħ^2 J (J+1))/(2 I ) = (h²/(4 π² )) J (J+1)/(2 I ) = h² J (J+1)/(8 π² I )

Which is (h/(8 π² I )) * h J (J+1) / something? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express E_rot in terms of wavenumbers. Or perhaps I should just compute the energy difference in terms of B and h.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy required for the rotational transition is 2 h B, because from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is (2B h) - 0 = 2Bh.

Wait, because E_rot = B h J (J+1).

Wait, no, E_rot = (h/(8 π² I )) * J (J+1).

Wait, but that would give units of (J s)/(kg m²) * s^-1 (from J (J+1)), but that doesn't make sense. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the energy difference in terms of the rotational constant B, which is in units of cm^-1 (wavenumbers), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the photon is given by the sum of the vibrational and rotational changes. But in this case, the smallest possible energy would come from just the rotational change.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to compute the energy difference again:

E_rot = (h² *2)/(8 π² I )

Which is ( (6.626e-34)^2 *2 ) / (8 * π² *1.2068e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67, times 2 is 8.78e-67.

Denominator: 8 * π²≈78.9568, multiplied by 1.2068e-46 gives 95.29e-46 =9.529e-45.

So E_rot = 8.78e-67 /9.529e-45 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J. Photon's momentum is p = E/c.

c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.21e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm, none of these match 3e-31. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the next state. Maybe the next state is a combination of vibrational and rotational. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the smallest ΔE.

Wait, maybe the molecule is already in the v=0, J=0 state. The next possible state could be v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=1. But the lowest energy would be v=0, J=1, as we found.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental state as the lowest vibrational and rotational state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which requires more energy than the rotational transition. But earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition requires less energy, so why is the answer not matching?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering rotational transitions because it's a diatomic molecule and the selection rules allow only certain transitions. Wait, in the rigid rotor model, rotational transitions require ΔJ = ±2, which is a bit tricky. But in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps ΔJ can be ±1. Wait, but in the dipole approximation, for rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So J can go from 0 to 1.

Wait, but if the molecule is in J=0, then it can transition to J=1. So that's allowed.

So back to the calculation. The energy of the photon is 9.21e-23 J, which translates to a momentum p=3.07e-31 N·s. But the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using a different approach. Let me compute the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers.

Wait, the rotational constant in wavenumbers is given by B = h/(8 π² c I ), where c is the speed of light. Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed as (h/(8 π² I )) in units of cm^-1 when multiplied by 1/(c).

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in cm^-1.

Let me compute I again.

I = μ r².

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-8 cm.

So r² = (2e-8 cm)^2 =4e-16 cm².

μ is (20 *2 amu) / (20 +2 amu) )=40/22 amu ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu ≈1.66e-24 g, so μ=1.818 *1.66e-24 g ≈3.016e-24 g =3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, so I =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m )^2 = 3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m².

But if I express r in cm: 2e-8 cm.

So I = μ r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-8 cm)^2.

Wait, but that's getting into mixed units. Let me convert everything to cgs units.

r = 2 angstroms = 2e-8 cm.

μ =3.016e-27 kg = 3.016e-24 g.

So I = μ r² =3.016e-24 g * (2e-8 cm)^2 =3.016e-24 g *4e-16 cm².

3.016e-24 *4e-16 =1.206e-39 g cm².

Then, B in wavenumbers (cm^-1) is B = h/(8 π² c I ), where h is Planck's constant in cgs units.

h =6.626e-27 erg s.

c =3e10 cm/s.

So:

B = (6.626e-27 erg s) / (8 * π² *3e10 cm/s * 1.206e-39 g cm² )

Compute denominator:

8 * π²≈78.9568.

Multiply by 3e10 cm/s: 78.9568 *3e10 ≈2.3687e12.

Multiply by I (1.206e-39 g cm²): 2.3687e12 *1.206e-39 =2.857e-27 cm/s *g cm².

Wait, units: denominator is (cm/s) * g cm² = g cm^3/s.

So B = (6.626e-27 erg s ) / (2.857e-27 g cm^3/s )

1 erg =1 g cm²/s².

So numerator is 6.626e-27 g cm²/s² * s =6.626e-27 g cm²/s.

Denominator is 2.857e-27 g cm^3/s.

So B = (6.626e-27 g cm²/s ) / (2.857e-27 g cm^3/s ) )= (6.626 /2.857 ) * (1/(cm )).

6.626/2.857 ≈2.32.

So B≈2.32 cm^-1.

Thus, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1. But to find the energy in joules, we need to convert cm^-1 to joules.

1 cm^-1 corresponds to E = hc cm^-1.

h is Planck's constant in cgs units: 6.626e-27 erg s. c is 3e10 cm/s.

So E = (6.626e-27 erg s ) * (3e10 cm/s) ) * (1 cm^-1 )

But 1 erg =1 g cm²/s². So E = (6.626e-27 *3e10 ) erg cm * (1 cm^-1 )

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

E = hc * (wavenumber) = (6.626e-27 erg s) * (3e10 cm/s) * (1 cm^-1 )

=6.626e-27 *3e10 erg

=1.9878e-16 erg.

Convert erg to joules: 1 erg =1e-7 J.

So E =1.9878e-16 *1e-7 J =1.9878e-23 J.

But wait, B is 2.32 cm^-1, so the energy for J=1 is E_rot = B * J (J+1) =2.32 * 2 =4.64 cm^-1.

So E_rot =4.64 * hc erg.

So E_rot =4.64 *6.626e-27 erg *3e10 cm/s * (1 cm^-1 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the energy as E = B * hc.

E = 2.32 cm^-1 * 6.626e-27 erg s *3e10 cm/s.

So E =2.32 *6.626e-27 *3e10 erg.

6.626e-27 *3e10 =1.9878e-16.

Multiply by 2.32: 4.59e-16 erg.

Convert to joules: 4.59e-16 erg *1e-7 J/erg=4.59e-23 J.

So E_rot is about 4.59e-23 J, which is roughly similar to the earlier calculation of 9.21e-23 J. Wait, but earlier calculation was about 9e-23, this is 4.5e-23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation when converting from cm to m. Maybe the difference comes from that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy difference as the vibrational energy minus the rotational energy. But in any case, the photon's momentum is E/c.

So if E_rot is 4.59e-23 J, then p=4.59e-23 J /3e8 m/s =1.53e-31 N·s.

Still not matching the options. So perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem requires the photon to provide energy for both a vibrational and rotational transition. But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy", which would be the smallest ΔE. So the minimal ΔE is the rotational transition.

Wait, but the options don't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me recheck μ.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ= (20 *2)/(20+2 )=40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.66e-27 kg. So μ=1.818 *1.66e-27 ≈3.016e-27 kg.

r=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

I=μ r²=3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.016e-27 *4e-20=1.2064e-46 kg m².

B= h/(8 π² I )=6.626e-34 / (8 * π² *1.2064e-46 )

Compute denominator:8 * pi^2≈78.9568.

78.9568 * 1.2064e-46 ≈95.29e-46=9.529e-45.

B=6.626e-34 /9.529e-45 ≈6.95e10 s^-1.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 * (h B) = 2 *6.626e-34 J·s *6.95e10 s^-1= 2 *6.626e-34 *6.95e10.

6.626e-34 *6.95e10≈4.606e-23.

Multiply by 2:9.21e-23 J.

So p=9.21e-23 J /3e8 m/s=3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the question's interpretation.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be the next allowed state, which could be either vibrational (v=1, J=0) or rotational (v=0, J=1). From previous calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy (9.21e-23 J versus 2.65e-19 J).

But none of the options match 3e-31. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is actually the sum of both the vibrational and rotational changes. But that would require a larger energy, which also doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the fundamental state as the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the next state is v=1, which requires a photon with energy h w. But earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition is lower energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't allow for rotational transitions and only considers vibrational. But that would contradict the question's mention of the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy for an R branch transition (rotational plus vibrational), but that would have higher energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the change in energy due to rotation but about the photon's energy being such that the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state, which could be either rotation or vibration, whichever is lower. But I calculated that rotation is lower.

But the momentum I calculated is 3e-31 N·s, which is much smaller than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when computing E_rot. Let me recheck:

Wait, E_rot = (h² *2 )/(8 π² I ) → correct.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

I is 1.2064e-46 kg m².

So 6.626e-34 squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Multiply by 2:8.78e-67.

Divide by 8 pi^2 I → 8 *9.8696 *1.2064e-46 =95.29e-46.

So 8.78e-67 /95.29e-46 = 9.21e-23 J.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the photon's momentum as p = h / λ. Since E =h f = pc → p = E/c = h f /c = h/(lambda). But without knowing the wavelength, perhaps we can find it in terms of w.

Wait, alternatively, since the photon's energy is E = h w_photon, and p = E/c = h w_photon / c.

Wait, but the energy E_photon is equal to the energy difference between the states, which is 9.21e-23 J.

So, p_photon = E_photon / c =9.21e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Still doesn't match any options.

So, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me look at the options.

Options:

A)1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, these are much larger than my calculated 3e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the energy difference.

Wait, maybe the transition isn't rotational but vibrational. Let's compute the vibrational photon's momentum.

E_vib =h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p_vib=E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is close to half of that. Hmm, but why would the photon's momentum be half?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the next state, but the next vibrational state. But earlier I thought rotational transition requires less energy.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the model considers that the molecule can't change vibrational state without a certain amount of rotational change. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy for a transition that involves both a change in vibration and rotation, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the rotational energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the moment of inertia and frequency. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, let's try another approach: the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (1/2) I ω^2 (J (J+1)), where ω is the angular velocity. But I don't know ω for the rotational state. So perhaps I should find ω in terms of the bond length and the moment of inertia.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the centrifugal distortion model, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is much simpler and I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the photon's momentum is related to the rotational partition function, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe the question is simply asking for the photon's momentum needed to excite the molecule from v=0, J=0 to v=0, J=1. So the energy required is the rotational energy difference, and the photon's momentum is p = E/c.

So from earlier, E_rot =9.21e-23 J → p=3.07e-31 N·s. But no options match.

So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the molecule transitions to the next state which is vibrational, not rotational.

If that's the case, E_vib=2.65e-19 J. p_vib=8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, which is about a fifth of that. Option D is 1.4e-28, also less than a third. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) but with some rotational state, and the photon excites it to a higher rotational state. But no, the fundamental state is v=0, J=0.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the energy difference between two adjacent rotational states, but I'm probably missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy for the rotational transition is 2B, not 2 h B. Let me compute that.

If B is 6.95e10 s^-1, then 2B=1.39e11 s^-1.

So E_rot = h * 2B =6.626e-34 *1.39e11 =9.21e-23 J. Same result as before.

So I'm not getting any closer. Maybe the mistake is in the calculation of μ.

Wait, Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ= (20 *2 )/(20+2 )=40/22=20/11=1.81818 amu.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for μ. Let me recheck.

1 amu =1.660539e-27 kg.

So μ=1.81818 amu *1.660539e-27 kg/amu =approx 3.017e-27 kg.

Which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model, which doesn't account for bond length changes. But the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which does account for bond length changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the moment of inertia should be calculated using the reduced mass and the bond length, which I did.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is looking for the photon's momentum that causes a transition to the next higher rotational state, which would be J=1 → J=2. But that would require a higher energy.

Wait, J=0 → J=1 requires 2B, J=1→J=2 requires 6B, which is 3 times higher. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first overtone vibrational transition, but that requires more energy.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A)1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, my calculation for the vibrational transition gives p=8.83e-28 Ns. The closest option is A)1.9e-28.

But that's about a fifth of my result. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the vibrational transition but only the zero-point energy. Wait, no, the fundamental state is v=0, and the next is v=1.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like considering the energy levels as quantized in a harmonic oscillator, but I don't think that changes the energy calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the wavenumber (cm^-1) for the vibrational transition and not converting it to joules correctly.

Wait, the vibrational frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

Alternatively, sometimes the vibrational frequency is given in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), which is w/(2 pi c), where c is the speed of light.

So, wavenumber ν̃ = w/(2 pi c).

w=4e14 rad/s → ν̃=4e14/(2 pi *3e8)≈4e14/(6e9)=approx 6.666e4 cm^-1.

Then, the energy per photon for the vibrational transition is E=h c ν̃.

h c =12400 eV·Å → but wait, in joules, h c ≈1.986e-25 J·m.

So E=1.986e-25 J·m * 6.666e4 cm^-1.

Wait, cm is 0.01 m. So 6.666e4 cm^-1 =6.666e6 m^-1.

So E=1.986e-25 J·m *6.666e6 m^-1 =1.986e-25 *6.666e6 =1.324e-18 J.

Which is close to h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J. So the discrepancy is because ν̃ is w/(2 pi c), which brings it down by a factor of 2 pi.

Wait, so perhaps I should compute E_vib as h ν̃ c.

Wait, no, E= h ν̃ c.

ν̃=6.666e4 cm^-1.

E= h * ν̃ * c =6.626e-34 J·s *6.666e4 cm^-1 *3e10 cm/s.

Compute:

6.626e-34 *6.666e4=4.417e-29.

Multiply by 3e10:1.325e-18 J.

So p= E/c=1.325e-18 /3e8=4.417e-27 N·s.

Looking at the options, option C is1.1e-27, B is2.3e-27.

4.4e-27 is between B and C.

Hmm, but this is an alternative approach. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, which is 1.4e-28, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact E for the vibrational transition.

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

Which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but about 4.6 times larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the selection rules and only certain transitions are allowed, but I'm not sure.

I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess. Based on the earlier calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy, but the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps the vibrational transition is the intended path.

If the photon's momentum is 8.83e-28 N·s, the closest option is A (1.9e-28), but it's about 4.6 times lower. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for E_vib.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_vib=6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is A)1.9e-28, but it's about a factor of 4.6 off.

Another option: perhaps the problem is asking for the momentum of the photon that causes the molecule to go from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. So the energy is E_vib = h w. Thus, p=8.83e-28 N·s.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option D)1.4e-28, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy, and the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27.

Wait, 1.1e-27 is 1e-27, which is about 1e3 times larger than 3e-31.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy as E_rot = B, not 2B.

Wait, earlier I thought the energy for J=1 is 2B. But if for some reason the energy is just B, then E_rot =6.95e10 s^-1 *6.626e-34 J·s =4.606e-23 J.

p=4.606e-23 /3e8=1.535e-31 N·s. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is B/2, but that would make it even smaller.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the reduced mass and the bond length to compute the moment of inertia, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, which is 2 angstroms=2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the rotational energy as E_rot = (h c B) J (J+1), where c is the speed of light. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the rotational constant in wavenumbers.

Earlier, I found B ≈2.32 cm^-1. So the energy is E_rot =2.32 cm^-1 * hc.

hc=12400 eV·Å.

So E_rot =2.32 *12400 eV·Å / (1 cm =100 Å).

Wait, cm^-1 * eV·Å/cm → not sure.

Alternatively, hc=12400 eV·Å.

So E_rot = B (cm^-1) * hc (eV·Å) / 100 Å/cm.

Wait, because 1 cm=1e8 Å? No, 1 cm=1e8 Å? Wait, no: 1 Å is 1e-8 cm. So 1 cm=1e8 Å.

So E_rot = B (cm^-1) * hc (eV·Å) * (1 cm / 1e8 Å) )

Which is B * hc * 1e-8 eV.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute E_rot in eV.

B=2.32 cm^-1.

hc=12400 eV·Å.

So E_rot = B * hc / (1 cm → in Å) → 2.32 cm^-1 * 12400 eV·Å * (1 cm / 1e8 Å )

Wait, cm and Å cancel out.

So E_rot =2.32 *12400 *1e-8 eV =2.32 *1.24e3 *1e-8 =2.32 *1.24e-5 eV →≈2.88e-5 eV.

Convert to joules: 1 eV=1.602e-19 J. So 2.88e-5 eV=4.613e-24 J.

Which is 4.6e-24 J. Then, p= E/c =4.6e-24 /3e8=1.53e-32 N·s. Even smaller than before.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Based on the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C)1.1e-27 N·s, which is about 1e-27.

But I can't see where that comes from. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy and the calculation yields p=8.83e-28 Ns, and the closest option is A)1.9e-28, but it's about a factor of 4.6 off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the units again. Momentum p=Energy/c.

If I have E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s. So option A is 1.9e-28, which is close to 8.83e-28 divided by 4.64.

Wait, 8.83e-28 /4.64≈1.9e-28. So perhaps the problem is considering the selection rule for vibrational transitions, which only allows changes in v by ±1, but for rotational, it's ±2, so perhaps the photon's energy is considering only part of the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average energy difference, but I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option C)1.1e-27, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D)1.4e-28.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking about the momentum of the photon that causes the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which could involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the vibrational transition's photon momentum. If the photon's energy is h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, then p=8.83e-28 N·s. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, but it's about 4.6 times smaller.

Hmm. I'm not getting any closer. In the interest of time, I'll have to make a choice based on the available options and my calculations. The closest option to the vibrational transition is A)1.9e-28. But my calculation gives 8.83e-28. So perhaps the intended answer is A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the only one in the same order of magnitude is option A:1.9e-28. But it's about 4.6 times smaller. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But why the discrepancy? Maybe I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is actually ½ h w. No, that would be for the zero-point energy, but the transition is from v=0 to v=1, which is h w.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is ½ h w. But that doesn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck and have to go with the closest option. So I'll choose option A)1.9e-28 Ns.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences for both rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Information:
1. **Masses**:  
   - \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} = 3.32 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \)  
   - \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} = 3.32 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)  
   - Reduced mass:  
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{(20)(2)}{22} \, \text{amu} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.016 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]

2. **Bond Length**:  
   \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

3. **Moment of Inertia**:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.016 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2064 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
   \]

4. **Rotational Constant**:  
   \[
   B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 (1.2064 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 6.95 \times 10^{10} \, \text{s}^{-1}.
   \]

5. **Energy Difference for Rotational Transition (J=0 → J=1)**:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 (6.95 \times 10^{10}) = 1.39 \times 10^{11} \, \text{s}^{-1}.
   \]  
   Converting to joules:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = h \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (1.39 \times 10^{11}) \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

6. **Energy Difference for Vibrational Transition (v=0 → v=1)**:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\( 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) compared to the vibrational transition (\( 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)).  
- Therefore, the molecule will transition to the next lowest energy state via the **rotational transition** (J=0 → J=1).

### Photon Momentum:
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:  
\[
p = \frac{E}{c}.
\]  
For the rotational transition:  
\[
p = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
\]  
This value is much smaller than any of the provided options, suggesting a possible discrepancy in the interpretation of the problem or the options.

### Vibrational Transition (Alternative Consideration):
If the problem instead considers the vibrational transition, the photon momentum would be:  
\[
p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
\]  
The closest option to this value is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)**, though it is about a factor of 4.6 smaller.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated rotational momentum and the provided options, and assuming the problem may intend for the vibrational transition, the most reasonable choice is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)**.

Answer: A
