Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an ester, especially when the ester is more stable than the acid. Wait, wait, no, actually, when you have an ester reacting with something like HI, sometimes it's a different kind of reaction. Oh, wait! Red phosphorus and HI are used to hydrolyze esters to carboxylic acids. So, if Compound X is an ester, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI would produce a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing things up. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of esters, correct. The reaction is called the hydrolysis of esters under acidic conditions, but using red phosphorus as a catalyst. So the ester would convert into a carboxylic acid.

So, the first task is to figure out what Compound X is. The data given are the IR and NMR spectra.

Looking at the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1 suggests an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H, but since it's in that range, O-H is more likely. But wait, 3400–2500 is a broad region, which could indicate an -OH group. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably an ester or maybe a ketone or aldehyde. But an ester's carbonyl is around 1720-1740. So that's a clue.

Another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has a benzene ring. So maybe it's an aromatic ester, like a benzoate ester.

Now looking at the 1H NMR: Let's go through each peak.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably an -OH proton. But wait, in the NMR, if it's a broad singlet, it's an acidic proton. If it's an aldehyde, that proton is around 9-10 ppm, but this is 10.5, which is more like a carboxylic acid. But wait, in an ester, the carbonyl is present, but the -OH is not. Unless it's a free acid, but the reaction is the ester being hydrolyzed, so maybe the initial compound has an ester group.

Wait, but if the initial compound has an ester, then the -OH in the NMR would be from something else. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a phenol group, but that doesn't fit with the ester carbonyl. Wait, no, the IR shows a peak at 1720, which would be consistent with an ester.

Wait, but in the NMR, if there's a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, that could be a carboxylic acid proton. But if the compound is an ester, then why is there an -OH in the NMR? Oh wait, perhaps the ester is an aromatic ester, and there's a phenolic -OH elsewhere. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but 10.5 is a bit high for an aldehyde. So let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a methyl benzoate or similar. Wait, but the ester would have an OR group. Hmm.

Let me look at the other NMR peaks.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating to two protons. That's likely aromatic protons. Benzene ring with two H in a doublet—maybe a para-substituted ring with two substituents. Wait, if it's a para-substituted benzene, then each pair of protons would be a doublet. For example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the protons on the ring would be in two doublets.

Wait, let me think. In the para-disubstituted benzene, each pair of adjacent protons would be a doublet. So in toluene, the ortho and para positions have certain shifts. But in this case, the 8.0 ppm is a d (doublet) of 2H, and 7.2 ppm is another d of 2H. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents in the para position. Wait, no, that's not possible—because a benzene ring has six carbons. Wait, perhaps it's para to one substituent and another substituent in another position.

Wait, more accurately, if the benzene ring has two substituents, one in position 4 and another in position 1, then the protons would be arranged in a particular way. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with an ester group and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the benzene has two substituents. Let me think: in the NMR, the two doublets each have 2H. That suggests a disubstituted benzene in the para positions. Because in para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to the substituent are each a doublet, and the para protons would be as well, but wait, no—if you have substituents in para positions, the protons might be more like a quartet or something else. Wait, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, like p-xylene, but with substituents that cause splitting.

Wait, if it's a para-substituted benzene with two identical groups, perhaps the H's on each side would be in doublets. Hmm, maybe I should think of a substituent that causes two sets of doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group and another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group (like an OAc group) and a methyl group in the para position. Let me think about that.

Then, looking at the other peaks:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. That could be a CH group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen or a carbonyl.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet of 2H, perhaps a CH2 group next to a carbonyl or a branching point.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of 3H, likely a CH3 group attached to a CH, such as in an isopropyl group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, probably a CH2CH3 group (ethyl) attached to something.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like an ethyl group attached to a branching point, like CH(CH2CH3)CH2-something, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let me think about the possible structure.

The IR has a strong carbonyl (1720 cm-1), so that's probably an ester (COO-) group. So the structure would have a benzene ring with an ester substituent.

In the NMR, the 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm are two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene. Let's say, for example, the benzene has an ester group in one position and another substituent in the para position.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent like OAc (acetate) and another substituent in the para position. So, for example, para-acetoxy phenyl with another substituent.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet for 1H. That doesn't fit with the acetate ester, because the ester's OAc group would have a CH3COO- which doesn't have an -OH.

Hmm, perhaps the compound is a methyl benzoate derivative, but with other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a chain that includes an ester group. Let me try to piece it together.

So, the benzene is substituted in the para position with an ester group, perhaps. For example, maybe the structure is something like benzene-4-O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

Now, looking at the NMR:

At 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): that would fit a para-substituted benzene. The substituent is at position 4, so the protons adjacent (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded and appear around 8.0, and the protons opposite (positions 2 and 6) would be more shielded, appearing around 7.2 ppm. That fits, so the substituent is in the para position.

So, substituent at position 4: perhaps an ester group, like OAc (but that might not explain the other peaks).

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-R. The ester group would be O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-O-R', so perhaps the structure is O-CO-R attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzyl ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone, but the IR doesn't show a peak around 1700 if it's a ketone; wait, no, esters and ketones are both around 1700. Hmm.

Wait, the IR peaks: 3400-2500: broad, maybe an -OH group. But wait, if the substituent is an ester, why would there be an -OH in the NMR? Unless it's a free -OH elsewhere, like a phenol group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl benzoate group, with another substituent on the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group and an alkyl chain that also has a CH3 group attached. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) might be the CH group adjacent to the carbonyl. So R-O-CO-CH2-... No, wait, perhaps the structure is an ester where the R group is a branched alkyl.

Looking at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, bs): Could be an -OH from a carboxylic acid, but if the initial compound is an ester, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, it's an aldehyde proton, but 10.5 is a bit high for that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial compound is a phenyl ester, like methyl benzoate, but with another substituent that results in the NMR peaks.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a propionyl group, like CH2CH2COO-. So perhaps the structure is something like 4-(something) benzoate.

Wait, let's think about the substituent on the benzene. Let's say it's a propionyl group attached to the benzene ring via the oxygen. So the substituent is O-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is a branched chain.

Looking at the NMR again: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

That seems like a chain: perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, or something like that.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group attached to a CH2. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is likely a CH3 attached to a CH. So maybe it's a isopropyl group or a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's consider the structure: if the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached via an oxygen to the benzene ring. So, the substituent would be O-CO-sec-Butyl.

Wait, but wait, the substituent is part of an ester. So if the substituent is O-CO-O-R? No, wait ester is R-O-CO-O-R'? No, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'.

Ah, so if the substituent on the benzene is O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group.

So, the structure would be benzene ring with O-CO-R attached at the para position.

So, the R group would have the NMR signals we're seeing.

Looking at the NMR of R:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Probably a CH group adjacent to a branching point. So R might be a chain like CH(CH2CH3)CH2- something.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could be a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl or a branching point.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. So perhaps R is a CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, but where is the connection.

Wait, maybe R is a isobutyl group. Let me think: isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) something? Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), no, wait. Wait, sec-butyl is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), is that right? No, wait: the structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's not correct. Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2, and sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ester oxygen.

So, the ester would be O-CO-O-sec-butyl, but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'.

Wait, no, the structure would be O-CO-R, where R is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is O-CO-sec-butyl.

Wait, but then the NMR would show the sec-butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a propyl chain with a methyl branch. Let me see.

Another approach: let's look at the options and see which one fits.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus + HI, which I thought is for hydrolysis of esters to acids. So if X is an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

So, let's see the options. Options C is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group. Option A is a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group. Option B is a substituted benzene with an isobutyl group. Option D is a substituted benzene with a sec-butyl and a methyl group.

Wait, but the reaction is hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. So the product would be a carboxylic acid. So the options should have a COOH group.

Looking at the options, options A and C are acids. B and D are hydrocarbons.

So the final product should be either A or C.

Looking at the description, the initial compound X's NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be an -OH from a carboxylic acid, but if X is an ester, then after hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but X is the starting material. If X is an ester, then its NMR wouldn't have the -OH peak. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps X is not an ester. Let me re-examine. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So that could be an ester, but it could also be a ketone, aldehyde, or acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is higher, so more likely an ester.

But then the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is probably an -OH. So if X is an ester, then why is there an -OH?

Hmm, perhaps the initial structure is a phenol ester. Wait, but phenol esters would have the phenol -OH, but in the NMR, phenol protons are usually around 5-7 ppm, but this is 10.5, which is more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is a phenyl ester. Let me think—like methyl benzoate. The structure would be O=C(OCH3)-Ph. But then, in the NMR, the ester's OCH3 would show up as a singlet around 3.9 ppm. But in given NMR, I don't see a peak around there. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the ester is attached to a branched chain. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a substituted benzoic acid ester. For example, ethyl 4-(something)benzoate.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplett at 0.9 ppm, which is likely a CH2CH3 group, so perhaps it's an ethyl ester. So the ester would be something like O-CO-OCH2CH3. But that would show up as a triplet around 4-5 ppm, which isn't present here. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a chain that includes an ester group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached via an ester. So the substituent would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3? But that would imply an ethyl group, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a CH2CH3. So perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)2 or similar.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR.

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): that's a CH group, maybe between a carbonyl and another group.

At 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to a branching point.

At 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): CH3 attached to a CH.

At 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)CH2-... No, wait, perhaps it's O-CO-CH2CH(CH2CH3) something. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the group is O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)2. No, that would give a triplet for each CH3, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that would give more protons.

Wait, perhaps it's a longer chain. Let me think: the substituent is O-CO-(CH2)2CH(CH3), but that would require more protons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps it's O-CO-CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's O-CO-CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. That would be a pentyl group, but that may not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, let's try to think of it as a four-carbon chain attached to the ester.

Looking at the NMR, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a terminal CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2, and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH.

So perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)2. No, that would have a different NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent would be O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3. But that seems too long.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)2. But wait, CH(CH3)2 is a neopentyl group, which would be a triplet for the CH2 and a singlet for the CH(CH3)2.

But then, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would correspond to the CH2CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Options A and C are the possible carboxylic acids, so perhaps the product would be one of them.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

C)4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

So, the product would be either a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group or a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.

Assuming that Compound X is an ester, which upon hydrolysis gives the acid.

So, let's see what the IR and NMR of X would look like.

If X is the ester of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with, say, methanol, then X would be methyl 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate.

The IR of X would have a strong ester carbonyl around 1720 cm-1 and an aromatic ring (peaks around 1600 and 1450 cm-1).

The NMR of X would show:

- The aromatic protons as two doublets (since it's para-substituted), integrating to 2H each. The substituent is at position 4.

- The ester oxygen would split into OCH3, which would be a singlet around 3.9 ppm. But in our NMR data, there's no such peak. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is attached differently.

Wait, if the substituent is a propionyl group (like CH2CH2COO-) attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H). So maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the ester.

Wait, perhaps it's a pentyl group, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, let me think about the substituent R as part of the ester O-CO-R.

The NMR shows:

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → CH3 attached to a CH.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → CH2CH3.

So perhaps the R group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, that would make R as CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-O-CO- attached to benzene.

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps R is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

But then the NMR would show the CH2 groups and the CH(CH3) group.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH(CH3) group, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the adjacent CH2 groups, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is the methyl on the CH, and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is the terminal CH2CH3.

Hmm, that fits. So the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but that structure would be O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, which is a pentyl group with a branch.

But wait, the NMR would then have:

The CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group:

- The CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)

- The adjacent CH2 groups (on either side) at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)

- The CH3 attached to CH at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)

- The terminal CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

Yes, that seems to fit.

So, the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but wait, that's a propyl group attached to a methyl branch. So perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3, which would be a pentyl group with a branch.

But the product after hydrolysis would be benzoic acid with that substituent.

Wait, but the product options are either 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C) or 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid (option A).

Wait, if the substituent is sec-butyl (CH2CH(CH3)CH2-), then the ester would be O-CO-sec-butyl attached to the benzene.

So the substituent would be O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that would make the substituent at position 4, so the ester would be 4-(sec-butoxy carbonyl) benzene.

But I'm not sure about the numbering.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. If the ester is attached to the benzene ring at position 4, then after hydrolysis, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring in the para position.

So, the initial compound X would be the ester, 4-(sec-butoxy carbonyl)benzoic acid's ester.

Wait, no, the ester would be 4-(sec-butoxy carbonyl)benzene, but that's not possible because benzene can't have two substituents unless specified.

Wait, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is the ester group, O-CO-R, where R is a sec-butyl group.

So, the structure would be benzene-4-O-CO-sec-butyl.

Wait, so the ester would be methyl 4-(sec-butoxy carbonyl) benzene? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-sec-butyl attached to the benzene ring at position 4.

So, when you hydrolyze that ester with red phosphorus and HI, you'd get 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Looking back at the NMR data of X, which is the ester:

- The aromatic protons would be as two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm), as the substituent is at position 4, para.

- The ester's carbonyl would be at 1720 cm-1.

- The O-CO-R group would have the R group as a sec-butyl chain.

So, the R group is a sec-butyl chain: CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but the NMR data for R would be:

- CH2 group next to the carbonyl (COO-) would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) as the CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3? No, that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the R group is (CH2)2CH(CH3), making the ester O-CO-CH2CH2CH(CH3).

Hmm, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-(CH2)2CH(CH3).

Wait, but the NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a CH group. So perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that would require a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is O-CO-CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the product.

If the product after hydrolysis is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the starting material X would be the ester, which is 4-(sec-butoxy carbonyl)benzene. So, the structure would be benzene with an O-CO-sec-butyl group in the para position.

So, the NMR of X (the ester) would have:

- Aromatic protons as two doublets: 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

- Ester OCH2 group: but wait, in an ester, the R-O-CO- group's R would be the sec-butyl group, so O-CO-sec-butyl.

The NMR of the ester's R group (sec-butyl) would have:

- The CH(CH3) group: perhaps at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)

- The adjacent CH2 groups: at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)

- The CH3 attached to CH: at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)

- The terminal CH2CH3: at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

Yes, that fits.

So, the substituent is O-CO-sec-butyl attached to the benzene ring in the para position.

Thus, the starting material X is methyl 4-(sec-butoxy carbonyl)benzoate? No, wait, the ester would be O-CO-sec-butyl, so the structure is Ph-O-CO-sec-butyl.

Wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So in this case, R is the phenyl group, and R' is the sec-butyl group.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The ester would be R-O-CO-R', where R is the benzene ring, and R' is the sec-butyl group.

Wait, but that would make the structure benzene-O-CO-sec-butyl, which is an ester. So, it's 4-(sec-butoxy carbonyl)benzene.

Wait, but that would be more accurately called sec-butyl benzoate, but I'm not sure.

In any case, when this ester is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it would hydrolyze to benzoic acid with the same substituent, which is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, option C.

So, the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The IR and NMR data provided suggest that Compound X is an ester with a benzene ring and a substituent containing a carbonyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI indicates hydrolysis of the ester to form a carboxylic acid.

### Analysis of IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Suggests the presence of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid after hydrolysis.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with an ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, confirming the presence of a benzene ring.

### Analysis of NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, likely from an -OH proton of a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group adjacent to a branching point.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet for 3H, likely a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet for 3H, likely a terminal CH₂CH₃ group.

### Structure of Compound X:
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is an ester with a para-substituted benzene ring and a substituent containing a carbonyl group. The substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl group** (CH₂CH(CH₃)CH₂-) based on the NMR peaks:
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** corresponds to the CH group in the sec-butyl chain.
- The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** corresponds to the CH₂ groups in the sec-butyl chain.
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to the CH₃ group attached to the CH in the sec-butyl chain.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to the terminal CH₂CH₃ group in the sec-butyl chain.

Thus, Compound X is **4-(sec-butoxy carbonyl)benzene**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction of Compound X with red phosphorus and HI results in the hydrolysis of the ester group to form a carboxylic acid. The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, where the ester group is replaced by a carboxylic acid group.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the substituent is not an ethyl group, and the product is not a propanoic acid.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the reaction conditions.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct, as it matches the structure of the product after hydrolysis.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the reaction conditions.

### Final Answer:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
