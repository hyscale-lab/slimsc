Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by understanding what's given and what I need to do.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). 

The non-Gaussianity measure is given by del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the state |psi> and tau is that of a reference Gaussian state. I need to compute this for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, what's a Gaussian state? Oh right, Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions. They include coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. The density matrix of a Gaussian state has a certain form, and I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity compares the state's entropy to that of the most Gaussian state (I'm not sure if that's the case here, though).

But the question gives me a formula to compute del_b. So I don't need to worry about what tau is exactly, because the problem gives the measure as the difference between rho and tau's entropies. So I just have to compute rho and tau, compute their entropies, and subtract.

Wait, but wait. How do I get tau? The problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. I'm not told what that reference state is. Oh, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the reference Gaussian state is the one that maximizes the entropy under certain constraints, or perhaps it's the closest Gaussian to rho? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, maybe for the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, the reference state is typically the closest Gaussian state to the non-Gaussian state in some sense. But I don't remember exactly.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first and second moments as the state rho. That is, the Gaussian state that matches the first and second moments of the non-Gaussian state. Because Gaussian states are uniquely determined by their first and second moments (since higher moments are determined by lower ones for Gaussians). So maybe tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho.

But wait, the state |psi> given is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian. So perhaps the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, and tau is the Gaussian state that best approximates it in terms of moments.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps I can compute rho and tau, then compute their entropies.

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is a thermal state or a coherent state. But without more information, it's tricky. Oh, wait, perhaps the reference state is the fully mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state |psi> but not necessarily. I'm a bit stuck on this point.

Wait, but maybe the problem gives me a shortcut. Because the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian, but the superposition of two Gaussian states is non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, and the reference Gaussian state is the state that is Gaussian and perhaps has the same first and second moments as |psi>.

Hmm. Let me think. The relative entropy (or relative entropy difference) is given as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau. So I need to compute S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the entropy.

But I'm not sure how to compute tau. Without knowing more about the reference state, it's hard. Unless the problem is providing a standard way to compute this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the non-Gaussianity in another way, like using the Hilbert-Schmidt distance or something else, but the question specifically says to use the relative entropy measure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reference Gaussian state is the closest Gaussian state to the given state |psi>, in terms of quantum relative entropy. For that, the reference Gaussian state would be the one that minimizes the relative entropy, which I think is known to be the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho.

So then, to calculate S(rho) - S(tau), which is the measure of non-Gaussianity.

But wait, if the state is a superposition of two coherent states, perhaps the first and second moments can be calculated, and then tau is the Gaussian state with those moments.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute the state |psi> for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

So let's calculate N first.

N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)).

Given phi=-pi/4, so 2*phi = -pi/2.

sin(-pi/2) is -1.

exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So the term inside the square root is 1 + (-1)*(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935.

So N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So |psi> is [cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, but wait: cos(-pi/4) is cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071; sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> = [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

So the state is a symmetric superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, scaled by 1/sqrt(2) each, because cos(phi) and sin(phi) are sqrt(2)/2 and -sqrt(2)/2 respectively when phi is -pi/4.

Wait, but wait, that might not be correct. Let me recalculate.

Wait, phi is -pi/4.

So cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So the state is [0.7071 |0.5> + (-0.7071)|-0.5> ] / N.

Hmm, then N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2 alpha²)).

2phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So 1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is (0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Now, to construct the density matrix rho: it's |psi><psi|.

But computing the entropy for this might be complicated.

Wait, but perhaps the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which are themselves Gaussian. But the state |psi> is a non-Gaussian state because it's a superposition. So tau is the Gaussian state that matches the first and second moments of rho.

But how to compute the first and second moments of rho.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a two-mode squeezed state or something else, but perhaps not. Let me think.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

Now, the coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are eigenstates of the annihilation operator a, with eigenvalues alpha and -alpha, respectively.

The state |psi> is (|alpha> + e^{i phi} |-alpha> ) / N, but wait in our case, phi is -pi/4, so e^{i phi} is e^{-i pi/4} = (sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i), but wait. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, our state is (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ) / N. So with phi=-pi/4, that's (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha> ) / N.

So perhaps the state can be written as (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2) * (1/N'), where N' is sqrt(2) * N. But not sure if that helps.

Wait, but for a coherent state |alpha>, its density matrix is diagonal in the Fock basis, but when you take a superposition, the off-diagonal terms become non-zero, which is why the state is non-Gaussian.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on how to compute rho and tau.

Wait, perhaps a smarter approach is needed. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated as S(rho) - S(tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state.

I remember that when a state is a pure state, its entropy is zero. But wait, no. Wait, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) = -Tr(rho ln rho). For a pure state, rho is a projector, so Tr(rho ln rho) = -ln(1) = 0. So yes, for a pure state, the entropy is zero.

Wait, but wait. The state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is pure, and S(rho)=0. But the reference state tau is a Gaussian state, which could be mixed or pure, depending on what it is.

Wait, but if the relative entropy is zero, that would imply that the state is Gaussian. But in this case, the state is non-Gaussian, so the entropy difference should be positive.

Wait, but if rho is pure, then S(rho)=0. But what is S(tau)?

If tau is the Gaussian state that is the closest to rho, perhaps a thermal state or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the fully mixed state, which would have maximum entropy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state that would be obtained by taking the expectation values of n and n(n-1) from the state |psi> and constructing a Gaussian state with those moments.

Wait, because for Gaussian states, the density matrix is determined by the first and second moments. So maybe tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho.

So, to compute tau, I need to compute the average photon number and the photon number variance from rho, and then construct a Gaussian state (like a squeezed or coherent state) with those properties.

But how?

Wait, maybe I can compute the average photon number <n> and the variance Var(n) from the state |psi>, and then construct the Gaussian state with those <n> and Var(n), and compute its entropy.

Then, the non-Gaussianity would be S(rho) - S(tau).

But wait, S(rho)=0 because rho is pure. So del_b = - S(tau)?

Wait, no, del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Wait, rho is pure, so trace(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b = - trace(tau ln tau). But that can't be right because del_b would then be negative, which doesn't make sense for a measure of non-Gaussianity, which should be non-negative.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state tau is the Gaussian state with the same first moments as rho. But for a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the first moments would be zero. Because |alpha> and |-alpha> have expectation values a and -a respectively. So if the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N, then the expectation value of a would be [alpha * cos(phi) - (-alpha) sin(phi)] / N.

Wait, let's compute that. The expectation value <a> for rho is [ <alpha| a cos(phi) + < -alpha | a (-sin(phi)) ] / N^2.

Wait, <alpha| a |alpha> is alpha, and similarly < -alpha | a | -alpha> is -alpha.

So <a> = [ alpha cos(phi) - (-alpha)( - sin(phi) ) ] / N^2.

Wait, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2.

So <a> = [ alpha * (sqrt(2)/2) - alpha (sqrt(2)/2) ] / N^2.

Because sin(phi) is negative, so - sin(phi) is positive sqrt(2)/2. So the second term is (- alpha) * (sqrt(2)/2).

Wait, wait, let me compute this again.

Wait, the expectation value is [ cos(phi) * <alpha| a |alpha> + sin(phi) * < -alpha | a | -alpha> ] / N^2.

So <alpha| a |alpha> is alpha, and < -alpha | a | -alpha> is -alpha.

So <a> is [ cos(phi) * alpha + sin(phi) * (-alpha) ] / N^2.

Wait, that's [ alpha (cos(phi) - sin(phi)) ] / N².

Plugging in phi = -pi/4:

cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So cos(phi) - sin(phi) = (0.7071) - (-0.7071) = 1.4142.

Wait, no, wait, sin(phi) is negative, so subtracting a negative is adding.

So 0.7071 - (-0.7071) = 1.4142.

So <a> = alpha * 1.4142 / N².

But alpha is 0.5, so 0.5 * 1.4142 ≈ 0.7071.

N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275, so N² is 0.3935.

So <a> ≈ 0.7071 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.8.

Wait, that's a pretty large value. So <a> is about 1.8.

Wait, but wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check.

Wait, actually, the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N. So the expectation value of a is [ cos(phi) * alpha + sin(phi) * (-alpha) ] / N².

Wait, with phi = -pi/4, so:

cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So cos(phi) * alpha is 0.7071 * 0.5 ≈ 0.3536.

sin(phi) * (-alpha) is (-0.7071) * (-0.5) ≈ 0.3536.

So the numerator is 0.3536 + 0.3536 ≈ 0.7072.

So <a> = 0.7072 / (0.3935) ≈ 1.8.

Hmm, but wait, that's the expectation value of a. But coherent states have expectation values at alpha and -alpha, but this state is a superposition, so perhaps the expectation value is non-zero.

But I'm not sure if this is right. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the expectation value of a in |psi> is zero.

Because the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N.

The expectation value of a is [ <alpha| a |alpha> - <alpha| a |-alpha> ] / N² + [ < -alpha| a |alpha> - < -alpha| a |-alpha> ] / N².

Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

The state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N. Let me compute <a> = <psi| a |psi>.

So <psi| a |psi> = [ (cos(phi)*<alpha| + sin(phi)*< -alpha| ) / N ] * a [ (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N ].

So that's [ (cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha| ) a (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) | -alpha> ) ] / N².

Expanding this, we get cos²(phi) <alpha| a |alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| a |-alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha | a |alpha> + sin²(phi) < -alpha | a |-alpha>.

Now, <alpha| a |alpha> = alpha.

Similarly, < -alpha | a |-alpha> = -alpha.

But what about <alpha| a |-alpha>?

Hmm, I think that's zero, because a | -alpha > is -alpha | -alpha >, but when you take <alpha| a |-alpha>, it's -alpha <alpha| - alpha >, but <alpha| - alpha> is zero because they're orthogonal (coherent states with different alphas are orthogonal).

Wait, but actually, coherent states are not orthogonal unless the alphas are different in a certain way. Wait, no, coherent states |alpha> and |beta> are orthogonal only when their alphas are orthogonal in the complex plane. But for alpha and -alpha, the inner product is exp( -|alpha|² - |beta|² + alpha beta^* + beta alpha^* ) when beta = -alpha.

Wait, let me compute <alpha| -alpha>:

<alpha| -alpha> = exp( -|alpha|² - | -alpha |² + alpha (-alpha)^* + (-alpha) alpha^* )

But | -alpha |² = |alpha|², so that's exp( -2 |alpha|² + alpha (-alpha^*) + (-alpha) alpha^* )

Which is exp( -2 |alpha|² - |alpha|^2 (1 +1) )? Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Wait, alpha is 0.5. So <0.5| -0.5> is exp( -0.25 -0.25 + 0.5*(-0.5)^* + (-0.5) (0.5)^* )

Wait, but wait, ( -0.5 )^* is -0.5, so 0.5 * (-0.5) is -0.25.

Similarly, (-0.5) * (0.5)^* = (-0.5) * 0.5 = -0.25.

So the exponent becomes -0.5 -0.5 + (-0.25) + (-0.25) ) = (-1) + (-0.5) = -1.5.

So <0.5 | -0.5> = exp( -1.5 ) ≈ 0.2231.

Wait, but coherent states are not orthogonal, but the inner product is non-zero. So <alpha| a | -alpha> is not zero.

Wait, a | -alpha > = -alpha | -alpha >.

So <alpha| a | -alpha> = -alpha <alpha| -alpha> = -alpha * exp( -|alpha|² - | - alpha |² + alpha (-alpha)^* + (-alpha) alpha^* )

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

But perhaps in this specific case, the expectation value of a is zero, which would make sense because the state is symmetric in some way.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested it's about 1.8. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me compute <a> again.

Wait, given |psi> = (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N, then <a> = (alpha - (-alpha)) / N² ?

Wait, because <alpha| a |alpha> = alpha, and < -alpha | a | -alpha> = -alpha.

So when I expand <psi| a |psi>, I get [ cos^2(phi) * alpha + sin^2(phi) * (-alpha) + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| a |-alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha | a | alpha> ] / N².

But if the cross terms are zero, then <a> would be [ cos^2(phi) alpha - sin^2(phi) alpha ] / N².

Which is alpha [ cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) ] / N².

But cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) = cos(2phi).

In our case, phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2.

cos(-pi/2) is zero. So <a> is zero.

Ah! That's a relief. So the expectation value of a is zero.

So <a> = 0.

Hmm, that makes sense because the state is symmetric in a certain way. So now, the Gaussian state tau would have <a> = 0.

Now, to compute Var(n) for the state rho.

Wait, Var(n) is the variance of the photon number, which for a state |psi> is <n²> - <n>².

Since <n> is the expectation value of the number operator n = a† a.

So let's compute <n> and <n²> for rho.

But this seems complicated as the state is a superposition, so the expectation values might be non-zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <n> using the state |psi>.

<n> = <psi| a† a |psi>.

Let me compute this.

<psi| a† a |psi> = (1/N²) [ cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha| ] a† a [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) | -alpha> ].

Expanding this, we get:

cos^2(phi) <alpha| a† a |alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| a† a |-alpha> 

+ sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha | a† a | alpha> 

+ sin^2(phi) < -alpha | a† a | -alpha >.

Now, <alpha| a† a |alpha> is |alpha|^2, which is alpha².

Similarly, < -alpha | a† a | -alpha > is | -alpha |² = alpha².

So the first and last terms are cos²(phi) alpha² and sin²(phi) alpha².

Now, the cross terms are cos(phi) sin(phi) [ <alpha| a† a |-alpha> + < -alpha | a† a | alpha> ].

But a† a is the number operator, so a† a | -alpha > = a† (a | -alpha > ) = a† (-alpha | -alpha > ) = - alpha a† | -alpha >.

Hmm, perhaps better to compute <alpha| a† a |-alpha>.

a† a is n, so <alpha| n |-alpha> = <alpha| a† a |-alpha> = < alpha | a† a | -alpha >.

But a | -alpha > = - alpha | -alpha >, so a† a | -alpha > = a† (- alpha | -alpha > ) = - alpha a† | -alpha >.

Wait, but a† | -alpha > is the lowering operator applied to | -alpha >? No, a is the annhilation operator. a† is the creation operator.

Wait, perhaps I can compute <alpha| a† a |-alpha> as follows:

a | -alpha > = -alpha | -alpha >.

So a† a | -alpha > = a† ( -alpha | -alpha > ) ) = - alpha a† | -alpha >.

Then <alpha | a† a | -alpha > = - alpha <alpha | a† | -alpha >.

But a† | -alpha > = d alpha |alpha +1>, where d is some factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a general expression.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the fact that a |beta> = beta |beta> and a† |beta> = beta^* |beta+1>, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that <alpha | a† a | -alpha > = <alpha | n | -alpha >.

But n | -alpha > = a† a | -alpha > = (a a† - 1) | -alpha > = ( (a† a) +1 - 1 ) | -alpha >? No, perhaps better to compute it directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross terms are zero. Let me think: for a coherent state |beta>, a |beta> = beta |beta>, and a† |beta> = beta^* |beta +1>.

But when I compute <alpha| a† a |-alpha>, that's <alpha| a† a | -alpha >.

Which is <alpha| a† (a | -alpha > ) = <alpha| a† ( - alpha | -alpha > ) = - alpha <alpha | a† | -alpha >.

But a† | -alpha > = (d/d alpha) | -alpha > ), so <alpha | a† | -alpha > is the derivative of <alpha | -alpha > with respect to alpha*, maybe?

But perhaps another approach: using the generating function for coherent states.

The inner product <alpha | beta> = exp( -|alpha|²/2 - |beta|²/2 + alpha^* beta ).

So <alpha | a† | beta > = d/d beta <alpha | beta> = [ alpha^* - beta ] exp( -|alpha|²/2 - |beta|²/2 + alpha^* beta ).

Wait, perhaps I can compute <alpha | a† | -alpha >.

Let me set beta = -alpha.

So <alpha | a† | -alpha > = (alpha^* - (-alpha)) ) exp( -0.25 - 0.25 + alpha^* (-alpha) )

Simplify the exponent: -0.5 + (- |alpha|² ), since alpha^* (-alpha) = - |alpha|^2.

So exponent is -0.5 - 0.25 = -0.75? Wait, wait alpha is 0.5, so |alpha|^2 is 0.25.

So exponent is -0.25 - 0.25 + (alpha^* (-alpha)) = -0.5 + (-0.25) = -0.75.

Wait, no, wait: alpha =0.5. So alpha^* =0.5, and beta = -0.5.

So alpha^* beta = (0.5)*(-0.5) = -0.25.

So exponent is -0.25 -0.25 + (-0.25) = -0.75.

The coefficient is (alpha^* - beta) = (0.5 - (-0.5)) ) = 1.

So <alpha | a† | -alpha > = 1 * exp( -0.75 ) ≈ 0.4724.

So <alpha| a† a |-alpha > = - alpha * <alpha| a† | -alpha > = -0.5 * 0.4724 ≈ -0.2362.

Similarly, < -alpha | a† a | alpha > = (-alpha) < -alpha | a† | alpha >.

Wait, let's compute < -alpha | a† | alpha >.

Using the same formula: <beta | a† | gamma > = (beta^* - gamma) exp( -|beta|^2/2 - |gamma|^2/2 + beta^* gamma ).

Here, beta = -alpha, gamma = alpha.

So < -alpha | a† | alpha > = ( (-alpha)^* - alpha ) exp( -0.25 -0.25 + (-alpha)^* alpha ).

(-alpha)^* is -alpha^*, which is -0.5.

So ( (-alpha)^* - alpha ) = (-0.5) - 0.5 = -1.

The exponent is -(0.25 + 0.25) + (-0.5 * 0.5) ) = -0.5 + (-0.25) )= -0.75.

So < -alpha | a† | alpha > = (-1) * exp( -0.75 ) ≈ -0.4724.

Thus, < -alpha | a† a | alpha > = (-alpha) * < -alpha | a† | alpha > = (-0.5) * (-0.4724) ≈ 0.2362.

So putting it all together:

<n> = [ cos^2(phi) alpha² + sin^2(phi) alpha² + cos(phi) sin(phi) ( term1 + term2 ) ] / N².

But term1 is <alpha| a† a |-alpha> ≈ -0.2362.

Term2 is < -alpha | a† a | alpha > ≈ 0.2362.

So term1 + term2 = (-0.2362) + 0.2362 = 0.

So <n> = [ (cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi)) alpha² ] / N².

But cos^2 + sin^2 = 1, so <n> = alpha^2 / N².

With alpha =0.5, so alpha²=0.25.

N² is 0.3935.

So <n> = 0.25 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.6353.

Hmm, that's the expectation value of n.

Now, to compute <n²>, which is <n^2> = <n(n-1)> + <n>.

Because n(n-1) = n² -n.

So <n²> = <n(n-1)> + <n>.

But <n(n-1)> is the expectation value of the number of photons taken two at a time, which is related to the second moment.

But calculating <n(n-1)> for the state |psi> is going to be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <n²> directly.

But given the time constraints, maybe it's better to think of a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the state |psi> is a single-mode state, so perhaps not a two-mode squeezed state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the density matrix elements to find <n²>.

But this might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps the variance of n for the state |psi> can be computed using the properties of the state.

Wait, but since it's a superposition state, the variance might be higher than that of a coherent state.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps the state |psi> is a Schrödinger cat state, which is known to have a higher photon number variance compared to a coherent state.

But in any case, perhaps I can proceed with the calculation.

So <n> is approximately 0.6353.

Now, I need to compute <n²> = <psi| a† a a† a |psi>.

Which can be written as <psi| a† a a† a |psi>.

But a a† = a† a + 1.

So a† a a† a = a† (a a†) a = a† (a† a + 1) a )= a† a† a a + a† a.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the normally ordered form:

a† a a† a = (a†)^2 a^2 + a† a.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <n²> using the properties of the state.

But perhaps it's better to proceed with the expansion.

So, <n²> = (1/N^4) [ cos^2(phi) <alpha| a† a a† a |alpha> + ... ]

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Another approach: perhaps the state |psi> can be written as (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N, so the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The density matrix would have elements like <m| rho |n> = ( cos(phi) <m|alpha> - sin(phi) <m| -alpha> ) ( cos(phi) <alpha|n> - sin(phi) < -alpha|n> ) / N².

But computing this for all m and n is going to be time-consuming, but perhaps I can find the average photon number and variance without explicitly computing the entire density matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for a coherent state |alpha>, the photon number distribution is Poissonian, and for the state |psi>, which is a superposition, the photon number distribution is a superposition of two Poissonians.

But that might not be directly helpful.

Wait, but given that the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha> )/N, perhaps when calculating <n²>, the cross terms would involve terms like <alpha| a†^2 a^2 | -alpha>, which might be zero due to orthogonality.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <n²> as follows:

<n²> = <psi| a† a a† a |psi> = <psi| a† a (a a† ) a |psi>.

Wait, a a† = a† a + 1, so:

a† a (a a† ) a = a† a (a† a + 1) a = a† a ( a† a a + a ) = a† a^2 a† a + a† a^2.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <n²> using the fact that:

<n²> = <n> + Var(n), but that's circular because Var(n) = <n²> - <n>^2.

Wait, but I need <n²> to compute Var(n).

I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try to find another way.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is a squeezed vacuum state, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the thermal state with the same average photon number as rho.

Wait, but for a thermal state, the average photon number is <n> = (e^{2 r} - 1)/(e^{2 r} +1), where r is the squeezing parameter. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the coherent state with the same <a> as rho, which is zero. So tau is the vacuum state.

Wait, if tau is the vacuum state, then its density matrix is |0><0|.

The von Neumann entropy of the vacuum state is zero, because it's pure.

But then del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 0 = 0.

But that can't be right because the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the thermal state with the same average photon number as rho.

Because for a thermal state, the entropy is maximum for a given <n>.

So if tau is the thermal state with <n> = <n>_{psi}, then S(tau) would be maximum, and del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau) = negative, which doesn't make sense because non-Gaussianity should be a positive measure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first and second moments as rho. So I need to compute Var(n) for rho and then construct tau as a Gaussian state with the same <n> and Var(n).

But how to compute Var(n) for rho?

Wait, Var(n) = <n²> - <n>².

So I need <n²>.

But without the explicit form, perhaps I can find an expression for <n²> in terms of <alpha| a†^2 a^2 |alpha>, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the state's properties.

Wait, the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so the probability of finding n photons is |<n| psi>|^2.

Which is | ( cos(phi) <n|alpha> - sin(phi) <n| -alpha> ) / N |^2.

But since |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, their overlaps with Fock states |n> are known.

But calculating this for each n and then computing <n> and <n²> would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the generating function approach.

The generating function for |alpha> is e^{alpha a† - alpha^* a}, so for the state |psi>, the generating function would be ( cos(phi) e^{alpha a† - alpha^* a} - sin(phi) e^{-alpha a† + alpha^* a} ) / N.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <n²> using the expectation values of a^2 and (a†)^2 for the state |psi>.

Because <n²> can be written in terms of these.

We know that n = a† a.

So n² = (a† a)^2 = a† a a† a = a† (a a†) a = a† (a† a + 1) a = a†^2 a^2 + a† a.

So <n²> = <a†^2 a^2> + <a† a>.

But <a† a> is <n> which we already found to be approximately 0.6353.

So <n²> = <a†^2 a^2> + <n>.

Now, <a†^2 a^2> = <psi| a†^2 a^2 |psi>.

Which can be written as <psi| a† a a† a |psi>.

But a a† = a† a + 1, so a† a a† a = a† (a a†) a = a† (a† a +1) a = a†^2 a^2 + a† a.

Wait, this seems to bring us back to the same expression, so perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute <a^2> and <a†^2> for |psi>.

Because:

a^2 |psi> = a^2 (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N.

So <a^2> = <psi| a^2 |psi> = (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) <alpha| a^2 |alpha> - cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| a^2 | -alpha> - sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha | a^2 | alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha | a^2 | -alpha> ].

But <alpha| a^2 |alpha> = alpha^2.

Similarly, < -alpha | a^2 | -alpha > = ( - alpha )^2 = alpha^2.

The cross terms are <alpha| a^2 | -alpha> and < -alpha | a^2 | alpha >.

Hmm, but perhaps for a coherent state |beta>, <alpha | a^2 | beta> = (beta^2) <alpha | beta> e^{-|beta|^2} e^{|alpha|^2} e^{alpha beta^*} } ? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that a^2 |beta> = (beta^2) |beta> + something else. Wait, no, a^2 |beta> = beta (beta -1) |beta> ?

Wait, a|beta> = beta |beta>, so a^2 |beta> = a (a |beta> ) = a (beta |beta> ) = beta a |beta> = beta^2 |beta>.

Wait, that's only true if |beta> is an eigenstate of a^2, which it's not. Wait, actually, a^2 |beta> = a (a |beta> ) = a (beta |beta> ) = beta a |beta> = beta^2 |beta>.

Wait, that would imply that a^2 |beta> = beta^2 |beta>, which would mean |beta> is an eigenstate of a^2 with eigenvalue beta^2.

But I don't think that's correct. Because a |beta> = beta |beta>, but a^2 |beta> = a (a |beta> ) = a (beta |beta> ) = beta a |beta> = beta^2 |beta> .

Wait, but that would imply that a^2 |beta> = beta^2 |beta>, which is correct because |beta> is an eigenstate of a, not a^2.

So <alpha| a^2 |beta> = alpha^2 <alpha|beta>.

So in our case, <alpha| a^2 |-alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha| -alpha> = alpha^2 <alpha| -alpha>.

But earlier, we found <alpha| -alpha> = exp( -|alpha|^2 - |-alpha|^2 + alpha (-alpha)^* + (-alpha) alpha^* )

Wait, alpha is 0.5, so <alpha| -alpha> = exp( -0.25 -0.25 + (0.5)(-0.5)^* + (-0.5)(0.5)^* )

Well, (-0.5)^* is -0.5, so 0.5 * (-0.5) = -0.25.

Similarly, (-0.5) *0.5^* = (-0.5)*(0.5) = -0.25.

So exponent becomes -0.5 + (-0.25 -0.25) )= -0.5 -0.5 = -1.

So <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-1) ≈ 0.3679.

So <alpha| a^2 | -alpha> = (0.5)^2 * 0.3679 ≈ 0.25 * 0.3679 ≈ 0.09197.

Similarly, < -alpha | a^2 | alpha> = (-alpha)^2 < -alpha | alpha> = (0.5)^2 * 0.3679 ≈ 0.09197.

So now, <a^2> = (1/N²) [ cos²(phi) * alpha^2 + sin²(phi) alpha^2 - 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) * 0.09197 ].

Because phi is -pi/4.

cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So cos²(phi) = 0.5, sin²(phi)=0.5.

So [0.5 * 0.25 + 0.5 * 0.25 ] = 0.5 * 0.25 * 2 = 0.25.

The cross terms: -2 * (sqrt(2)/2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) * 0.09197.

Wait, no, the cross terms are - cos(phi) sin(phi) * 0.09197 for each cross term, so overall it's -2 cos(phi) sin(phi) * 0.09197.

But cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2.

So cos(phi) sin(phi) = (sqrt(2)/2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 ) = - (2/4) = -0.5.

So -2 * (-0.5) * 0.09197 = 2 * 0.5 * 0.09197 ≈ 0.09197.

So <a^2> ≈ (0.25 + 0.09197 ) / N².

Wait, N² is 0.3935.

So (0.34197) / 0.3935 ≈ 0.869.

Similarly, <a†^2> would be the complex conjugate of <a^2>, which is 0.869.

Because a†^2 is (a^2)^†, so <a†^2> = [ <a^2> ]^*.

But since <a^2> is real (as we've calculated, 0.869), <a†^2> = 0.869.

Now, <a† a> = <n> = 0.6353.

Then, <n^2> = <a† a a† a> = <a†^2 a^2> + <a† a>.

But wait, <a†^2 a^2> can be written as <a^2 a†^2>^*, but perhaps I should compute it using the known values.

Wait, <a†^2 a^2> = <a^2 a†^2>^*.

But a^2 a†^2 = (a†^2 a^2 )^†, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the identity:

a†^2 a^2 = (a† a)^2 + a† a.

Wait, no. Wait, let me compute a†^2 a^2.

a†^2 a^2 = a† a† a a a.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity:

a a† = a† a + 1.

So, a† a = a a† - 1.

But this might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can expand a a† in terms of a† a.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express <a†^2 a^2> in terms of <n^2> and <n>:

Wait, a†^2 a^2 = a† a† a a = a† (a a† ) a = a† ( a† a +1 ) a = a† a† a a + a† a.

But a† a = n, so:

a†^2 a^2 = a† a† a a + n.

But a† a a = a† (a a) = a† a^2.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using normal ordering:

a†^2 a^2 = :a†^2 a^2: + 2 a† a.

Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute <a†^2 a^2> = <a^2 a†^2>^*.

But I don't know <a^2 a†^2>.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I should proceed with the approximation that <n^2> is approximately <n> + Var(n) of the Gaussian state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the options provided.

Looking at the options, option D is 0, which would be the case if the state were Gaussian, but it's a superposition, so non-Gaussian, so D is unlikely.

Option B is 0.25, which is a small value. Option C is 1.38, and option A is 2.48.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero, but that can't be the case.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the state |psi> is a Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity is zero. But wait, no, because it's a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian, but their superposition is non-Gaussian.

Wait, no, wait. A superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian, so the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again about the problem.

The problem asks to calculate the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. The given formula is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

But wait, rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state. The von Neumann entropy of a pure state is zero, so trace(rho ln rho) is zero.

So del_b = 0 - trace(tau ln tau) = - trace(tau ln tau).

But the relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau) ), but in this case, the formula given is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the definition where del_b is the difference between the entropy of rho and that of tau. So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau).

But since rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so del_b = - S(tau).

But the non-Gaussianity should be positive, which would require that S(tau) is negative, which is impossible because entropy is non-negative.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau)] + [trace(tau ln tau) - trace(tau ln rho)].

Wait, no, that would not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), but since rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so del_b= - S(tau). But that would give a negative value, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually S(tau) - S(rho), which would make del_b positive if rho is non-Gaussian and tau is Gaussian. Because a Gaussian state can have higher entropy than a non-Gaussian state with the same moments.

But in any case, perhaps the problem expects me to compute S(rho) - S(tau), which is 0 - S(tau), leading to del_b = - S(tau).

But S(tau) is non-negative, so del_b would be negative, which can't be correct because non-Gaussianity is a positive measure.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility is that the relative entropy is defined as S(tau || rho), which is trace(tau ln tau) - trace(tau ln rho). But since rho is pure, this would be trace(tau ln tau) - trace(tau ln rho).

But I'm getting into a muddle here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition, such as del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S(rho) is the entropy of the non-Gaussian state, and S(tau) is that of the Gaussian state. But since S(rho)=0, del_b would be - S(tau), which would be negative. But the options don't have negative values, so perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.

The relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Ah, so it's the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau.

So if rho is non-Gaussian, and tau is Gaussian, then del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau).

But S(rho) is zero, so del_b = - S(tau).

But that would mean del_b is negative, which can't be right because non-Gaussianity is a positive measure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually [trace(rho ln tau) - trace(tau ln rho)].

But that's the relative entropy S(rho || tau), which is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem's formula is correct, even if it seems to lead to a negative value.

But the options are all positive numbers, so perhaps the correct answer is zero.

Wait, but the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state tau is the same as rho's Gaussian approximation.

Wait, perhaps for the given state |psi>, the reference Gaussian state tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho.

So, in that case, the entropy of rho would be higher than that of tau, but since rho is pure, S(rho)=0, and S(tau) would be positive (since it's a mixed Gaussian state), so del_b would be 0 - S(tau) = negative, which can't be the case.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of this differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the non-Gaussianity as the logarithm of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between rho and tau, but the question says to use relative entropy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually a Gaussian state.

Wait, but a superposition of two coherent states with equal and opposite amplitudes would have zero mean, but what about their higher moments?

Wait, a coherent state is Gaussian, but a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, which would mean that the non-Gaussianity is non-zero.

But looking at the options, the only zero option is D. So perhaps the correct answer is D), but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the state is a Gaussian state despite being a superposition. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought. The state |psi> is given as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)| -alpha> )/N.

If phi is such that the state is a coherent state, then it would be Gaussian. But phi is given as -pi/4, which is not zero, so that's not the case.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> is a squeezed vacuum state. Because a squeezed vacuum state can be written as a superposition of two coherent states with equal and opposite amplitudes. But wait, a squeezed vacuum state is a single-mode state, and a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases would give a squeezed state.

Wait, but in that case, the state's density matrix would be Gaussian. So perhaps the state |psi> is a Gaussian state, making the non-Gaussianity zero.

But is that the case?

Wait, no. A squeezed vacuum state is a Gaussian state, but the state |psi> as given is a superposition of two coherent states. Such a state is typically non-Gaussian, unless the coefficients are arranged in a way that the state remains Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps if the state is a coherent state, then it's Gaussian, but given the phi is -pi/4, it's not a coherent state.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the state |psi> is Gaussian.

Wait, let me think again.

Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian, which includes coherent, squeezed, thermal, and cat states? No, wait, cat states are non-Gaussian.

Wait, cat states are superpositions of coherent states and are known to be non-Gaussian. So the state in question is a cat state, thus non-Gaussian.

So the non-Gaussianity should be positive. But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is C) 1.38.

But I'm not sure how to compute it without more detailed calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually a Gaussian state. But I'm not convinced.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> can be rewritten as a squeezed vacuum state.

Let me explore that.

A squeezed vacuum state can be written as S(r) |0>, where S(r) is the squeezing operator.

The squeezing operator in the displacement representation is S(r) = exp( (r a^2 - r^* a†^2 ) / 2 ), where r is a complex squeezing parameter.

But our state |psi> is (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N.

Wait, can this be rewritten as a squeezed state?

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that |alpha> - |-alpha> = something involving the number states.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> can be expressed in terms of a squeezed vacuum state.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the non-Gaussianity is zero, which would be option D.

But I'm not confident. Another possibility is that the state |psi> is a Gaussian state, making the non-Gaussianity zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> is a coherent state, making it Gaussian.

Wait, wait. Let me check.

If phi=0, then |psi> would be (|alpha> ) / N, which is a coherent state, hence Gaussian.

But in our case, phi is -pi/4, so the state is a superposition, making it non-Gaussian.

So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, but without further computation, I can't choose the exact option.

Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is C) 1.38.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B) 0.25.

I think I'm stuck, but I'll make an educated guess that the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. But I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\). The relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state \(|\psi\rangle\), and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Properties**: The given state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\). Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is generally non-Gaussian. This suggests that the state \(|\psi\rangle\) is non-Gaussian.

2. **Relative Entropy**: The relative entropy measure \(\Delta_b\) compares the von Neumann entropy of the non-Gaussian state \(\rho\) to that of the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). Since \(\rho\) is pure (as \(|\psi\rangle\) is a single pure state), \(\text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) = 0\). Thus, \(\Delta_b = -\text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau)\). For non-Gaussian states, \(\Delta_b\) is expected to be positive.

3. **Reference Gaussian State**: The problem does not explicitly specify the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). A common choice is the Gaussian state that matches the first and second moments of \(\rho\), such as a squeezed or thermal state. However, without explicit details, the calculation of \(\tau\) and its entropy remains unclear.

4. **Special Case for \(\phi = -\pi/4\)**: Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the normalization constant \(N\) is computed as:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} = \sqrt{1 - e^{-0.5}} \approx 0.6275.
   \]
   The state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(-\pi/4)|0.5\rangle + \sin(-\pi/4)|-0.5\rangle}{N}.
   \]
   This is a symmetric superposition of two coherent states with opposite amplitudes.

5. **Gaussianity of the State**: While the state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of Gaussian states, the superposition itself is non-Gaussian. This implies that the non-Gaussianity \(\Delta_b\) should be positive.

6. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (2.48)**: This is a high value for non-Gaussianity, which seems unlikely given the parameters.
   - **Option B (0.25)**: A small positive value, plausible for a weakly non-Gaussian state.
   - **Option C (1.38)**: A moderate positive value, also plausible.
   - **Option D (0)**: Suggests the state is Gaussian, which contradicts the fact that it is a superposition of coherent states.

7. **Final Consideration**: The problem may involve approximations or simplifications not explicitly stated. However, based on the reasoning, the non-Gaussianity should be positive. Among the options, **C (1.38)** is the most reasonable choice.

### Conclusion:
The non-Gaussianity of the state is best represented by **Option C (1.38)**.

Answer: C
