Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. We’re told that when measuring the position, none of the particles were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So the wave function must be zero outside the region 1 ≤ x ≤ 3. 

Wait, but I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being square-integrable, and the probability of finding the particle must integrate to 1 over all space. But in this case, the measurements show that the particle is only in x from 1 to 3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval.

Looking at the given wave function: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a complex function. So the wave function ψ(x) has a real part and an imaginary part. But for the wave function to be valid, it needs to be normalized, and the probability density |ψ(x)|² must integrate to 1 between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that none were found at x<1 and x>3. So the wave function must be zero outside 1 to 3. That suggests that the wave function is zero outside that interval. But the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So does this hold for all x, or is this expression only valid in the region where the particle exists?

Oh, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So for x < 1 and x >3, ψ(x) must be zero. But wait, in the given expression, if x is 0, for example, sqrt(1+0)=1, so a/1 -0.5i. But that would mean ψ(0) = a -0.5i, which isn't zero. So that can't be right because the particle isn't found there. So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in the allowed region, and zero elsewhere. But the given expression is for where it can exist, meaning x between 1 and 3.

Wait, perhaps the given wave function is for the region 1 ≤ x ≤3. So in this region, ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. And zero elsewhere. But for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 must equal 1.

So the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to3 of |ψ(x)|² dx =1. Let's compute |ψ(x)|².

ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the magnitude squared is [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]² + [ (-0.5) ]², because the real and imaginary parts are squared and added.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25).

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Breaking this integral into two parts:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 + integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 = 1.

Compute each part:

First integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from1 to3.

At x=3: ln(4), x=1: ln(2). So the first integral is a² (ln(4) - ln(2)) ) = a² (ln(2)).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute that numerically. ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202. Thus, a = sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because I thought the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. But maybe I made a mistake in the normalization. Let me make sure I did the integral correctly.

The real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)), so squared is a²/(1+x). The imaginary part is -0.5, so squared is 0.25. The sum is a²/(1+x) + 0.25. The integral of that from 1 to3.

Yes, that's correct. So integrating that over x=1 to3 gives the normalization condition. So yes, the integral is as I computed.

So a is sqrt(0.5 / ln2). Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute ln(2): about 0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.7202.

sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85, which matches.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function is non-zero only in the region \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), as the particle is never found outside this interval. The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this region equals 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The probability density is given by:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

Breaking this into two integrals:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

The closest option to \( a \approx 0.8485 \) is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

So the total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So solving for a²:

a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute that numerically. ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202. Thus, a = sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485.

Yes, that's correct. So integrating that over x=1 to3 gives the normalization condition. So yes, the integral is as I computed.

So a is sqrt(0.5 / ln2). Let me compute that more accurately.

Compute ln(2): about 0.69314718056.

0.5 / 0.69314718056 ≈ 0.7202.

sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is 0.85, which matches.
