Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read through it again and see what it's asking.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength for each star's black body radiation, right? Then, the radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Wait, so the question is about luminosity. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: Luminosity (L) = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L depends on R squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Hmm, so I need to find the ratio L1/L2. Since L is proportional to R²T⁴, the ratio would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). 

We know R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So R1²/R2² is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that part is straightforward. But what about the temperatures?

The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength of their black body radiation. I remember Wien's law which states λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same? Wait, no. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ_max is the same for both, then their temperatures would also be the same. So T1 = T2?

Wait, but wait a second. The radial velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so it's not moving towards or away from us much, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. How does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, that's about Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving away or towards us, the observed wavelength shifts. But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So does that mean their intrinsic (rest frame) wavelengths are the same, or does the Doppler shift affect the peak wavelength?

Wait, that's a crucial point. So the peak wavelength observed would be affected by the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving away, its emitted light is redshifted, so the observed peak wavelength would be longer than the intrinsic one. Conversely, if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted.

So the problem says the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. Let me model this.

Assuming that the stars emit their peak wavelengths at λ_rest for each. Then, due to their velocities, their observed λ_obs is λ_rest multiplied by a Doppler factor.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the radial velocity. Since v is 0 for Star_1, its observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. For Star_2, v is 700 km/s. But wait, 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light, but what is the speed of light? Approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 is about 0.002333c. So v/c is small, but perhaps we can use a linear approximation for the Doppler shift.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The Doppler effect can be approximated as (1 + v/c) when the velocity is much less than c. But wait, since the star is moving away, the observed wavelength would be longer, so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) when v is positive for moving away. Or wait, actually, the exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And z is approximately v/c for small velocities.

Alternatively, another approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c) when v is small compared to c. So for Star_1, v is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. For Star_2, v is 700 km/s, moving away, so λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). But the problem states that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

Wait, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, and λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c). And these are equal.

So λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But wait, alternatively, if Star_2 is moving away, then its observed λ_max is longer than its rest λ_max. But the problem states that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But earlier, I thought that λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 because their observed λ_max are the same, but that might not be correct because Star_2's λ_rest could be different, but due to the Doppler shift, the observed λ_max is the same.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it step by step.

Let me denote:

For Star_1: v1 = 0 km/s.

For Star_2: v2 = 700 km/s (assuming it's moving away, since radial velocity is positive when moving away? Or depends on convention. But let's proceed.)

The observed wavelength for each is given by the Doppler shift formula. Let me think about the exact formula. The relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but when v is much less than c, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

So for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But according to the problem, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c).

But from Wien's law, we have λ_rest is inversely proportional to temperature: λ_rest = b / T.

So λ_rest1 = (b / T1), λ_rest2 = (b / T2).

So substituting into the earlier equation:

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Divide both sides by b:

(1 / T1) = (1 / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Multiply both sides by T2 T1:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, no, let me do it properly.

Wait, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Multiply both sides by T2:

T2 / T1 = (1 + v2/c)

So T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c)

But wait, the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So Star_2 has a temperature T2 that is lower than T1 because when a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer, implying a lower temperature. Hmm, but let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, v2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute v2/c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333...

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * (1.002333)

So T2 is higher than T1? Wait, wait, no. Wait, because if λ_obs for Star_2 is longer due to moving away, that would imply that its temperature is lower, because λ_max is longer.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wien's law says λ_max = b / T. So if a star is moving away, its emitted λ_max_rest is b / T. But due to the Doppler shift, the observed λ_max_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) ≈ λ_rest (as v is small, but positive for moving away).

So if a star is moving away, the observed λ_max is longer than the rest λ_max. But according to the problem, the observed λ_max of both stars are the same. So:

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 (since v1=0) = λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c)

So λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 (1 + v2/c)

But λ_rest = b / T, so:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 + v2/c) / T2

So T2 = (1 + v2/c) T1.

So T2 is larger than T1. Wait, but that can't be right. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max is longer, which would imply a lower temperature than Star_1. But according to this, T2 is larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let me think about the Doppler shift again. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so the observed temperature is lower. So Star_2's observed temperature is lower than its actual temperature. Wait, no. Alternatively, the observed temperature is T_obs = T_rest / (1 + v/c). Because the observed wavelength is longer, so temperature is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the relationship.

Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T_rest.

After Doppler shift, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) for source moving away.

So λ_obs = (b / T_rest) * (1 + v/c)

But from Wien's law for observed spectrum, λ_obs = b / T_obs.

So,

b / T_obs = (b / T_rest) * (1 + v/c)

Cancel b:

1 / T_obs = (1 + v/c) / T_rest

So,

T_obs = T_rest / (1 + v/c)

So for Star_2, T_obs2 = T_rest2 / (1 + v2/c)

But the problem states that the observed λ_max for Star_1 is the same as for Star_2, which implies their observed temperatures are the same. Because λ_obs is determined by T_obs.

Wait, no. Because λ_obs is the same for both stars, so their T_obs must be the same. So T_obs1 = T_obs2.

But T_obs1 is the temperature we observe for Star_1, which is the same as its actual temperature because v1=0. So T_obs1 = T1.

For Star_2, T_obs2 = T_rest2 / (1 + v2/c) = T2_obs.

So T_obs2 = T_obs1.

So T_rest2 = T_obs2 * (1 + v2/c) = T_obs1 * (1 + v2/c) = T1 (1 + v2/c).

So T_rest2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, that makes T_rest2 higher than T_rest1. Because (1 + v2/c) is about 1.002333.

So Star_2's actual temperature is higher than Star_1's.

But that's a bit counterintuitive because Star_2 is moving away, so we see its light as redder. But perhaps because it's hotter, the observed peak shifts to a longer wavelength.

Wait, but maybe I should think about this in terms of the observed flux or the observed spectrum. Anyway, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation.

Now, back to the luminosity.

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

But wait, what's T in the luminosity formula? It's the effective temperature of the star, which is its rest frame temperature.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

We know R1 = 1.5 R2

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) → from earlier, since T_rest2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, from earlier:

We have T_rest2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So:

L1/L2 = [ ( (1.5 R2 )^2 ) * T1^4 ] / [ R2^2 * (T1 (1 + v2/c) )^4 ]

Simplify this:

= ( (1.5^2 R2²) * T1^4 ) / ( R2² * T1^4 (1 + v2/c)^4 )

R2² cancels, T1^4 cancels:

= (1.5^2) / ( (1 + v2/c )^4 )

1.5^2 is 2.25.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / ( (1 + 700e3 / (3e5) )^4 )

Calculate the denominator.

700,000 m/s divided by 3e5,000 m/s? Wait, wait. c is about 3e5 km/s, so 300,000 km/s.

So v2 is 700 km/s.

v2/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.00233333...

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.00233333.

Now, compute (1.00233333)^4.

We can compute this using the approximation for small x: (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx + (n(n-1)/2) x² + ... etc.

But since x is about 0.002333, which is 2.333e-3, so x is small.

Compute the fourth power:

(1.00233333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4*(0.002333) + (4*3/2)*(0.002333)^2 + (4*3*2/6)*(0.002333)^3 + (4*3*2*1/24)*(0.002333)^4 )

But let me compute it numerically.

Compute 1.00233333^4:

1.00233333^2 is approximately (since (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b², where a=1, b=0.00233333):

1^2 = 1.

2ab = 2 * 1 * 0.00233333 = 0.00466666.

b² = (0.00233333)^2 ≈ 5.444e-6.

So 1 + 0.00466666 + 0.000005444 ≈ 1.0046721.

Then, square this result to get the fourth power.

So (1.0046721)^2.

Again, using the same approach:

(1 + 0.0046721)^2 = 1 + 2*(0.0046721) + (0.0046721)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.0093442 + (0.00002182).

Adding: 1 + 0.0093442 = 1.0093442; plus 0.00002182 gives 1.009366.

So (1.00233333)^4 ≈ 1.009366.

So the denominator is ~1.009366.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ let's compute that.

2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ divide 2.25 by 1.009366.

Let me compute 1.009366 * 2.228 = ?

Wait, better to compute 2.25 / 1.009366.

Approximate division:

1.009366 × 2.228 ≈ 2.25.

Wait, 1.009366 × 2.228 would be about:

= 2.228 * 1 = 2.228

Plus 2.228 * 0.009366 ≈ 0.02087.

Total ≈ 2.24887, which is close to 2.25.

So 2.228 * 1.009366 ≈ 2.25.

So 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.228.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

Compute 2.25 / 1.009366.

Well, 1.009366 is approximately 1.009366.

We can write it as 1 + 0.009366.

So, 2.25 / (1 + 0.009366) ≈ 2.25 * (1 - 0.009366 + 0.009366² - ...) using the approximation 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x + x² - x³ + ... for small x.

Here, x = 0.009366.

So,

≈ 2.25 * (1 - 0.009366 + (0.009366)^2 )

Calculate each term:

1 - 0.009366 = 0.990634.

0.009366^2 ≈ 0.0000877.

So,

≈ 2.25 * (0.990634 + 0.0000877) = 2.25 * 0.9907217 ≈ 

2.25 * 0.9907217 = ?

Well,

2 * 0.9907217 = 1.9814434.

0.25 * 0.9907217 ≈ 0.2476804.

Total ≈ 1.9814434 + 0.2476804 = 2.2291238.

Which is about 2.229.

So L1/L2 ≈ ~2.229.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So the closest is D) ~2.23.

Wait, but wait I got around 2.229, which is 2.23 when rounded.

So the correct answer should be D. 

But wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of (1.002333)^4. Let me compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (1.00233333)^4 step by step.

First, compute (1.00233333)^2.

1.00233333 * 1.00233333.

Calculating:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.00233333 = 0.00233333.

0.00233333 * 1 = 0.00233333.

0.00233333 * 0.00233333 ≈ 0.000005444.

Adding all together:

1 + 0.00233333 + 0.00233333 + 0.000005444 ≈ 1 + 0.00466666 + 0.000005444 = 1.0046721.

So (1.00233333)^2 ≈ 1.0046721.

Now compute (1.0046721)^2.

1.0046721 * 1.0046721.

Again, breaking it down:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.0046721 = 0.0046721.

0.0046721 * 1 = 0.0046721.

0.0046721 * 0.0046721 ≈ (0.0046721)^2.

Compute 0.0046721^2:

= (4.6721e-3)^2 = (4.6721)^2 * 1e-6.

4.6721^2 ≈ 21.828.

So 21.828e-6 = 0.000021828.

Now sum all terms:

1 + 0.0046721 + 0.0046721 + 0.000021828 = 

1 + (0.0046721 + 0.0046721) + 0.000021828.

0.0046721 * 2 = 0.0093442.

So total: 1 + 0.0093442 + 0.000021828 ≈ 1.009366.

So yes, the exact value is 1.009366.

So 2.25 / 1.009366 = ?

Let me compute this division more accurately.

Compute:

1.009366 × 2.228 ≈ 2.25.

Wait, but perhaps I should do it another way.

Let me compute 2.25 ÷ 1.009366.

Let me set up the division.

1.009366 × x = 2.25. Solve for x.

Using approximation.

We can write x = 2.25 / 1.009366.

Let me compute 1.009366 × 2.228 ≈ 

Calculate 1.009366 × 2.228.

Break it down:

= (1 + 0.009366) × 2.228

= 2.228 + (0.009366 × 2.228)

Compute 0.009366 × 2.228:

= 0.009366 * 2 = 0.018732

0.009366 * 0.228 = 0.0021395

So total is 0.018732 + 0.0021395 = 0.0208715.

So total x ≈ 2.228 + 0.0208715 = 2.2488715.

Which is slightly less than 2.25.

So 2.228 × 1.009366 ≈ 2.2488715, which is about 2.2489, which is less than 2.25.

So what's 2.25 - 2.2488715 = 0.0011285.

So we need a slight increase in x to account for the remaining 0.0011285.

Let me compute how much more x should be.

The additional x will contribute 1.009366 × (Δx) = 0.0011285.

So Δx = 0.0011285 / 1.009366 ≈ 0.001118.

So x ≈ 2.228 + 0.001118 ≈ 2.229118.

So x ≈ 2.2291.

So 2.25 / 1.009366 ≈ 2.2291.

Which is approximately 2.229, so about 2.23.

So the ratio is approximately 2.23.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is ~2.23.

So the correct answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the radii
The radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Relating the temperatures
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law, the peak wavelength is related to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \), so \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \). For Star_2, \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), and the observed wavelength is redshifted due to the Doppler effect:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate the rest wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

Using \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = b / T \), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1 + v_2/c}{T_2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
\]

The velocity of Star_2 is \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \approx 1.002333
\]

So:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the temperature ratio
The temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1.002333
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the luminosity ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1.002333)^4}
\]

First, calculate \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). Next, approximate \( (1.002333)^4 \) using the small-angle approximation for \( x = 0.002333 \):

\[
(1 + x)^n \approx 1 + nx + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^2
\]

For \( n = 4 \):

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 4(0.002333) + \frac{4(3)}{2}(0.002333)^2
\]

\[
(1.002333)^4 \approx 1 + 0.009332 + 0.0000218 \approx 1.009354
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009354} \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 5: Comparing with the options
The closest option to \( 2.229 \) is:

**D) ~2.23**

Answer: D
