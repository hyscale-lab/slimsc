Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to understand it. So, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. When they collide, new particles are produced. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average.

Wait, the problem says that on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options given are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm, okay. So, the current situation is that with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third make it. We need to find the new Lorentz factor where two-thirds make it. So, I'm thinking this has to do with the time the particles survive before decaying. Because if a particle decays before it can reach the wall, it won't be detected. So, the lifetime of the particle in its own rest frame multiplied by the Lorentz factor (gamma) determines how far it can travel before decaying.

Wait, right. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. From our frame, the lifetime is gamma times tau. The distance the particle travels before decaying is then gamma * tau * c. But since the particles are moving at a high speed (ultra-relativistic, so v ≈ c), the distance is approximately gamma * tau * c.

So, the detector's radius is 30 meters. Let's denote the distance as L = 30 m.

So, the particles that reach the detector walls must have a decay length greater than or equal to L. So, gamma * tau * c >= L.

The probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is... Well, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(tau)). Here, t is the time it takes to reach the wall, which is L/(gamma c) because in our frame, the lifetime is gamma tau, but wait, let me think.

Wait, no. The time experienced in the lab frame for the particle to reach the wall is t = L/(gamma c). Because the particle's speed is v = beta c, which is approximately c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). For ultra-relativistic, beta is close to 1, so gamma is large.

Wait, no, the correct time is t = L/(beta c). Because the particle is moving at speed v = beta c. So, time to reach the wall is t = L/(beta c). But since beta is approximately 1, we can approximate t ≈ L/(c).

But for the decay, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. So, the particle's lifetime in our frame is gamma tau. So, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is exp(- t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, wait. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is the same as the probability that its lifetime is longer than t. So, the survival probability is exp(- t/(gamma tau)).

But wait, t is the time it takes to reach the wall. So, the survival probability is P = exp(- t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, but t = L/(beta c). Hmm, but since the particle is ultra-relativistic, beta is close to 1, so t ≈ L/(c).

Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as:

The decay length is gamma * beta c * tau. Because in the particle's frame, it lives for tau, so in our frame, time is gamma tau, so distance is beta c * gamma tau.

So, the decay length D = gamma beta c tau.

If D >= L, then the particle will reach the wall. So, the probability that a particle decays before reaching the wall is the same as the probability that D < L.

Wait, but that's not exactly how it works. Because the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that the particle decays before reaching the wall is 1 - exp(-L/(gamma beta c tau)).

Wait, let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau. The mean lifetime is gamma tau. The particle's speed is beta c, so the average distance it travels before decaying is beta c * gamma tau = gamma beta c tau.

So, if the average decay length is greater than L, then a significant fraction of particles will reach the wall.

But the problem states that when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So, one third of the particles have decay lengths >= 30 m. Wait, but maybe that's not exactly the case. Let me think in terms of the survival probability.

The survival probability is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall. So, if the wall is at 30m, the survival probability P is exp(- L/(gamma beta c tau)).

Wait, maybe I should model it as, the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = L/(beta c). The decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

So, the survival probability (reach the wall) is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Thus, for the current situation, when gamma is 20, the survival probability P is 1/3. So,

1/3 = exp( - (L/(beta c)) / (gamma tau) )

But since beta is close to 1, let's approximate beta as 1. So,

1/3 ≈ exp( - L/(gamma tau c) )

So, taking natural logs,

ln(1/3) = - L/(gamma tau c )

=> L/(gamma tau c) = - ln(1/3) = ln(3)

So,

gamma tau c = L / ln(3)

But wait, we can write this as:

gamma tau = L/(c ln(3)) )

Wait, but I think I should be careful with units. The units of L are in meters, c is in m/s, and tau is in seconds. So, let me compute the current case.

But perhaps another approach is better. Let's express gamma tau as a variable. Let me define gamma tau = G.

So, the survival probability is exp( - L/(c G) )

Because, in the current case, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3.

So,

1/3 = exp( - 30/(c G) )

Take natural logs,

ln(1/3) = -30/(c G )

=> 30/(c G ) = ln(3 )

=> G = 30/( c * ln(3) )

But wait, wait, let me compute that.

But I think perhaps I should set up a ratio. Let me denote the original Lorentz factor as gamma1 = 20, and the new one as gamma2 (what we're trying to find).

In the original case, the survival probability is P1 = 1/3, which is the fraction reaching the wall.

In the new case, the survival probability should be P2 = 2/3.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls when gamma is 20. So P1 = 1/3.

We need to find gamma2 where P2 = 2/3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read the problem again.

"on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the detector inner walls."

Wait, so when gamma is 20, P (reaching the wall) is 1/3.

We need to find gamma where P is 2/3.

So, the survival probability is increasing as gamma increases. Because higher gamma means longer lifetime, so higher chance of reaching the wall.

Wait, but when gamma increases, the survival probability increases, meaning more particles reach the wall. So, to go from P=1/3 to P=2/3, gamma must increase.

So, let's model this.

Assuming that beta is approximately 1, so we can ignore it in the denominator.

So, the survival probability P is exp( - L/(gamma c tau) )

Wait, let me write it again:

P = exp( - L/(gamma c tau) )

We have two cases:

Case 1: gamma = 20, P = 1/3.

Case 2: gamma = gamma2, P = 2/3.

So,

For case 1:

1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau) )

Take ln of both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau )

=> 30/(20 c tau ) = ln(3 )

=> 3/(2 c tau) = ln(3 )

So,

c tau = 3/(2 ln(3) )

Now, for case 2:

2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma2 c tau) )

Take ln:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma2 c tau )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3/2) = 30/(gamma2 c tau )

From case 1, we know that 30/(20 c tau ) = ln(3 ), so 30/(c tau ) = 20 ln(3 )

So, substituting into case 2:

ln(3/2) = 30/(gamma2 c tau )

= (30)/(c tau ) * (1/gamma2 )

= (20 ln(3 )) * (1/gamma2 )

So,

ln(3/2) = (20 ln(3 )) / gamma2

Solving for gamma2:

gamma2 = (20 ln(3 )) / ln(3/2 )

Hmm, let's compute that.

We can compute ln(3) and ln(3/2).

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

So,

gamma2 ≈ (20 * 1.0986) / 0.4055

Compute numerator: 20 * 1.0986 ≈ 21.972

Divide by 0.4055: 21.972 / 0.4055 ≈ 54.14

So, gamma2 is approximately 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54.

Wait, but let me double-check the reasoning. Because I might have made a mistake in the exponents or the setup.

So, starting again, the survival probability is P = exp(-L/(gamma c tau)).

We have two scenarios:

At gamma1 =20, P1=1/3.

At gamma2=?, P2=2/3.

So,

ln(P1) = - L/(gamma1 c tau )

ln(P2) = - L/(gamma2 c tau )

Let me take the ratio of the two equations.

ln(P2) / ln(P1) = (gamma1 c tau / gamma2 c tau ) )

Wait, no, not exactly. Let me rearrange.

From the first equation,

L = - gamma1 c tau ln(P1 )

Similarly,

L = - gamma2 c tau ln(P2 )

Since L is the same, equate:

-gamma1 c tau ln(P1 ) = - gamma2 c tau ln(P2 )

The c tau terms cancel out.

gamma1 ln(P1 ) = gamma2 ln(P2 )

So,

gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(P1) / ln(P2 )

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, let's make it step by step.

We have,

gamma1 * ln(P1) = gamma2 * ln(P2 )

So,

gamma2 = gamma1 * (ln(P1) / ln(P2) )

Wait, because gamma1 * ln(P1 ) = gamma2 * ln(P2 )

So,

gamma2 = gamma1 * (ln(P1) / ln(P2) )

Wait, but ln(P1) and ln(P2) are negative because P is less than 1.

So, P1=1/3, ln(1/3)= -1.0986.

P2=2/3, ln(2/3)= -0.4055.

So,

gamma2 = 20 * ( (-1.0986) / (-0.4055) )

The negatives cancel, so:

gamma2 = 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055 )

Compute 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.708

So, gamma2 ≈20 * 2.708 ≈54.16.

So, about 54, which is option A.

But wait, why is the gamma increasing when P is increasing? Because higher gamma implies longer lifetime, so more particles survive to reach the wall. That makes sense.

So, the correct answer would be option A, 54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the survival probability of the particles. The survival probability is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{L}{\gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau}\right),
\]

where \(L = 30 \, \text{m}\) is the detector's radius, \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(\tau\) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Case 1: \(\gamma_1 = 20\), \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}\)
For the initial case, substituting \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\gamma_1 = 20\), we solve for the relationship between \(\gamma\), \(c\), and \(\tau\):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{L}{\gamma_1 \cdot c \cdot \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{L}{\gamma_1 \cdot c \cdot \tau} = \ln(3).
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma_1 \cdot c \cdot \tau = \frac{L}{\ln(3)}.
\]

### Case 2: \(\gamma_2 = ?\), \(P_2 = \frac{2}{3}\)
For the second case, substituting \(P_2 = \frac{2}{3}\), we have:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{L}{\gamma_2 \cdot c \cdot \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{L}{\gamma_2 \cdot c \cdot \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Equating the expressions for \(\gamma \cdot c \cdot \tau\) from both cases, we get:

\[
\gamma_1 \cdot \ln(3) = \gamma_2 \cdot \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Solving for \(\gamma_2\):

\[
\gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Numerical Calculation
Using approximate values:
- \(\ln(3) \approx 1.0986\),
- \(\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055\),
- \(\gamma_1 = 20\),

we compute:

\[
\gamma_2 = 20 \cdot \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.708 \approx 54.16.
\]

### Conclusion
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls is approximately \(54\). This corresponds to option **A**.
