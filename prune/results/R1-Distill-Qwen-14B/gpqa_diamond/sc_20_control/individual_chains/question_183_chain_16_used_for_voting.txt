Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I think red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, maybe that's when it's in a different context. Alternatively, I remember that red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydroboration reaction, but I'm not so sure. Or wait, another thought: maybe it's for the elimination of halides? No, wait, that's more like E2 mechanisms, but with HI, which is a strong acid. Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amides or acids. But wait, the starting material here has a formyl group and a vinyl group, so maybe it's about something else.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the starting material. 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, cyclohexene ring, with substituents at position 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). And the ring itself has a double bond at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene). So the ring has one double bond, and then there's the formyl and vinyl substituents.

So the structure: cyclohexene with substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl). So the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, I suppose.

Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens? Red phosphorus and HI are known for their use in the Wittig reaction, but wait, the Wittig reagent is phosphorus ylide. Oh, wait, maybe this is a different reaction. Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus can be used to reduce triple bonds or maybe in the formation of ylides.

Wait, another thought: the starting material has a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde. When aldehydes react with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a type of elimination or addition reaction.

Wait, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction? No, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, and reduces ketones to alkanes. But the starting material already has an aldehyde group, which is a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is undergoing some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is reacting. Wait, the vinyl group is a CH2=CH- group attached to the cyclohexene ring. The reaction with HI and red phosphorus... wait, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation. But with excess HI, perhaps we're looking at adding HI across double bonds.

Wait, but red phosphorus is sometimes used in the hydroboration reaction, but that's typically for alkynes or alkenes. Wait, or maybe it's about the addition to alkenes. Let me think: when alkenes react with HI, they undergo addition, typically with H adding to one end and I to the other, following Markovnikov's rule.

But the starting material has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and another in the vinyl group. So maybe both will react with HI.

Wait, but we're using red phosphorus. Oh, wait! Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to form amines or the addition to carbonyl groups. Or wait, another reaction: the formation of the ylide in the Wittig reaction. But the starting material here is an aldehyde, so perhaps it's undergoing a Wittig reaction. But wait, red phosphorus is used in the preparation of the ylide. Oh, wait, the starting material is an aldehyde, and if it reacts with a ylide, it would form an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of the double bonds. Let's think about how many double bonds are present.

The starting molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (one double bond) and the vinyl group (another double bond, since vinyl is CH2=CH-). So that's two double bonds.

If HI is added to each of them, what would happen? But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus. Oh! Wait, I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the form of the HPHal (like HPHI) which is a strong acid and can cause elimination reactions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deoxygenative process.

Wait, another thought: when an aldehyde reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's usually part of a reaction to form an alkane. For example, the reduction of aldehydes to alkanes. Wait, that rings a bell. The Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl to reduce ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. But Clemmensen isn't applicable here because it's an acid, not Hg in HCl. Wait, but what about the use of red phosphorus and HI in the presence of aldehydes?

Wait, I think the reaction is the reduction of the aldehyde group. So, the formyl group (CHO) is getting reduced. But what's the product when an aldehyde is treated with red phosphorus and HI? I remember that this is the conditions for the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to alkanes. Like the Clemmensen but different reagents. Oh wait, no—Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl. Maybe this is another method.

Alternatively, I think that under certain conditions, like with H2O and Hg, but that's not it. Alternatively, the reaction of aldehydes with red phosphorus and HI could lead to the formation of alkanes. So, the CHO group would be reduced to CH2OH? Or wait, no, maybe to CH3.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about each part. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, it's a cyclohexene ring with substituents. The formyl group is at position 2, and the vinyl at position 5.

When it reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is being hydrogenated. But wait, red phosphorus and HI—maybe the HI is the source of H and I, but under certain conditions, could it be adding across the double bonds.

Wait, but the presence of red phosphorus might be part of a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds are being reduced. For example, the cyclohexene ring's double bond (position 3) and the vinyl group's double bond (position 5) could be hydrogenated.

Wait, but if the reaction is adding HI across the double bonds, that would lead to dihalides. But the presence of red phosphorus might cause elimination instead. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of the aldehyde group. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should first figure out what the product looks like after the reaction.

Let me think about each functional group in the starting material:

1. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond. So, in the ring, positions 3 and 4 are double bonded.
2. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO).
3. At position 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH-).

So, with reaction conditions of red phosphorus and excess HI:

Option 1: Reduction of double bonds.

If the reaction reduces the double bonds, the cyclohexene ring would become cyclohexane, and the vinyl group would become CH2CH2 (but that's just an ethyl group, I guess). Wait, but the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so adding HI would add H and I across the double bond. But with excess HI, perhaps it adds twice? Or maybe it's a hydrohalogenation. Wait, but adding HI to a double bond typically adds once, giving a diiodide if using excess HI? No, wait, each addition of HI would add H and I. So for a vinyl group, the CH2=CH- would become CH2-I-CH2-I? No, that doesn't make sense. Instead, it would add HI to each double bond, but maybe each double bond reacts once.

Wait, but for each double bond, adding HI would give a vicinal diiodide. So, the cyclohexene (one double bond) would become a cyclohexane with two adjacent iodines? Wait, no, because in a six-membered ring, adding HI across the double bond would lead to a vicinal diiodide, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not adding HI but causing elimination. Wait, but without a good leaving group, elimination is less likely. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is deoxygenation, but I'm not seeing that clearly.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a halogenation via the addition of HI. Let's consider each double bond:

The cyclohexene ring has a double bond. Adding HI would give a diiodide. But wait, in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's something else. Oh! Wait, I think I remember that red phosphorus and HI can form the triiodide ion. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of the formyl group. Wait, the starting material is a carboxylic acid, so maybe the formyl group is being oxidized or reduced. But with red phosphorus and HI, I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the formyl group (CHO) can undergo a reaction. For instance, aldehydes can react with HI in a nucleophilic addition. The aldehyde's carbonyl group (CHO) could react with HI, leading to the formation of a geminal diiodide (CH(I)IO). Then, in the presence of a strong base like red phosphorus, perhaps elimination occurs to form an alkene. But wait, that might not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is reduced to a CH2OH group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the reaction mechanism. Maybe I should think about the product structure based on the reagents. Red phosphorus and excess HI—what is this reagent combination typically used for?

I recall that red phosphorus is used in the preparation of the ylide in the Wittig reaction, but in that case, the ylide is generated from alkenes and triphenylphosphine. Wait, but in this case, the starting material already has alkenes. So perhaps the reaction is forming a ylide and then attacking the formyl group. Let me think: the Wittig reaction typically converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with a ylide. But in this case, the starting material is the aldehyde, so if the reaction creates a ylide from one of the double bonds, then it would react with the aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the starting molecule: cyclohexene ring with substituents. The presence of a formyl group and a vinyl group suggests that after the reaction, these substituents might change.

But what's the index of hydrogen deficiency? That's a measure of the number of rings plus double bonds in the molecule. So, each ring or double bond contributes one to the index.

So, after the reaction, how many rings and double bonds are present in the product?

The starting material has:

- 1 ring (cyclohexene)
- 1 double bond in the ring (cyclohexene)
- 1 double bond in the vinyl group (CH2=CH-)

So, the starting material's index of hydrogen deficiency would be: 1 (ring) + 1 (double bond in ring) +1 (vinyl double bond) = 3. But the question is about the product.

So, the product's index would depend on how the reaction affects the rings and double bonds.

If the reaction adds HI across the double bonds, the number of double bonds would decrease, but the rings would remain unless opened.

Alternatively, if the reaction reduces the double bonds, converting them into single bonds. Each double bond (in the ring and in the vinyl group) would then become single bonds.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction in detail. When you have a compound with double bonds reacting with HI and red phosphorus, what typically happens?

Wait, I think that when alkenes react with HI, they undergo addition, not elimination. So, the cyclohexene's double bond would add HI, forming a cyclohexane ring with two adjacent iodine atoms. The vinyl group's double bond would similarly add HI, turning into a vicinal diiodide as well.

But wait, if that's the case, then each double bond is saturated, so the number of double bonds would decrease by two, and the index would decrease by two.

Wait, but the starting index is 3 (1 ring, 2 double bonds). If both double bonds are saturated, then the index would drop by 2, so from 3 to 1. But wait, the ring is a cyclohexane, which is a six-membered ring, so that's one ring. If the double bonds are gone, then the index would be 1 (ring) + 0 (double bonds) = 1. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond). The vinyl group is a substituent with another double bond. So, the total index is 1 (ring) + 2 (double bonds) = 3.

If both double bonds are saturated, the rings remain, so the index would be 1 (ring) + 0 (double bonds) = 1.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the ring is opened. If the cyclohexene ring is opened, that would eliminate the ring and the double bond. But I don't see a reason for that here.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't adding HI but doing something else. Let me think again about the reagents.

Red phosphorus and excess HI—could this be the conditions for the hydroboration reaction? No, I think hydroboration typically uses a different setup, like BH3 and THF.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the double bonds. For example, using H2 with a catalyst would reduce double bonds, but here the reagents are red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) in the starting material is a carbonyl. When treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it undergoes a reduction. For example, the formyl group could be reduced to CH2I. Wait, no, because HI is present. Alternatively, the aldehyde group could be converted into a primary alcohol. But how?

Wait, I think the reaction could be the reduction of the aldehyde group. For example, using red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde (CHO) could be reduced to CH2OH. But I'm not entirely sure about this.

Alternatively, I've heard that in the presence of red phosphorus and aqueous HI, nitriles are hydrolyzed. But our starting material doesn't have a nitrile group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. The formyl group is an electron-deficient group, and the vinyl group is a conjugated diene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is undergoing a Wittig reaction. If the starting material has a double bond, perhaps it's generating a ylide that reacts with the formyl group. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is adding HI across the double bonds, leading to more substituents but not changing the ring structure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each functional group's behavior. The cyclohexene's double bond and the vinyl group's double bond are both likely to react with HI.

So, for the cyclohexene (C3 double bond), adding HI would give a cyclohexane ring with two adjacent iodine atoms, perhaps at C3 and C4 positions. Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would add HI, turning into CH2-I-CH2-I? No, that can't be right. Each addition of HI to a double bond would add H and I across it, so the vinyl group would become CH2-CH2I? Wait, no. Let me think again.

When HI adds to a double bond, it adds H to one carbon and I to the adjacent. So, for the vinyl group (CH2=CH-), adding HI would give CH2-I-CH2- attached to the ring. Wait, no, that's not correct. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so when HI adds across the double bond, each carbon would get an H and an I. So it becomes CH2I-CH2I? No, that's not possible because each double bond has two carbons.

Wait, no, each addition is across the double bond, so for a vinyl group (CH2=CH-), adding HI would make CH2I-CH2H (but that doesn't make sense). Wait, no, the correct addition would be CH2I-CH3 (but then HI is a strong acid). Wait, perhaps it's CH2I-CH2I, but that would require adding two HI molecules, which is possible if there's excess HI.

But wait, the starting vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which is a substituent on the cyclohexene ring. Adding HI across that would add H and I to each end. So the vinyl becomes CH2I-CH2- attached to the ring. Wait, but that would be a single bond between the two CH2I groups. So the substituent would go from CH2=CH- to CH2I-CH2-.

Wait, but that would change the substituent from a vinyl group (double bond) to a single bond with two iodines. So the number of double bonds would decrease by one (the vinyl's), and the cyclohexene ring's double bond would also react, so another double bond is lost.

So, initial index: cyclohexene (ring, 1) + two double bonds (from ring and vinyl) → 3.

After reaction, cyclohexene's double bond is gone (saturated), and the vinyl's double bond is gone. So the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (1 ring, no double bond)
- The substituents would be CH2I-CH2- (from the vinyl group) and whatever happens to the formyl group.

Wait, but what about the formyl group (CHO)? How does it react?

In the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the formyl group (CHO) might undergo reduction. For example, the aldehyde group could be reduced to CH2OH or perhaps even further to CH3.

Wait, I think that aldehydes can be reduced to primary alcohols. So, if the CHO is reduced, it would become CH2OH.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is not reacting, but I need to think.

So, putting it all together, after reaction, the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bond)
- A substituent from the vinyl group that was CH2=CH- becoming CH2I-CH2- (but that's a single bond now)
- The formyl group becoming CH2OH (if reduced)

So, what about the index of hydrogen deficiency? The product would have:

- 1 ring (cyclohexane), which contributes 1 to the index
- No double bonds in the ring or substituents, since both the ring and vinyl double bonds are saturated.

So the index would be 1.

Wait, but let me double-check. The product would have:

1 ring (so +1) and no double bonds (so +0), so index =1.

So the answer would be 1, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps the formyl group is also converted into something else. For instance, if it's reduced to a CH2I group. But that might not change the index, as it's a single bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is not reacting, so it remains as a CHO group. But then there would be a carbonyl group, which is a double bond, so the index would go up.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if the formyl group's carbonyl becomes a double bond, that adds to the index.

Wait, so let me re-examine. Starting material has three double bonds: ring (1), vinyl (1), and formyl (1 as a carbonyl group). Wait no, wait: the formyl group is CHO, which is a carbonyl group (C=O), so that's another double bond. So the starting material's index is 1 (ring) + 2 (double bonds in ring and vinyl) + 1 (formyl carbonyl) = 4.

Wait, wait that's incorrect. Because the formyl group is a substituent on the ring, and each substituent's structure adds to the overall index. So the starting material's structure:

- cyclohexene ring: 1 ring, 1 double bond
- substituents: formyl (CHO), which has a carbonyl (C=O), so that's another double bond. And vinyl (CH2=CH-), which is another double bond.

So the starting material has 1 ring and 3 double bonds. So index is 1 + 3 = 4.

But the question is about the product after reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI.

If the reaction reduces the ring's double bond and the vinyl's double bond, but leaves the formyl's double bond untouched, then the product would have:

- cyclohexane (1 ring, no double bond)
- substituents: formyl (CHO → still a carbonyl, so another double bond) and vinyl (now a single bond)

So the product's index would be 1 (ring) + 1 (formyl's C=O) = 2.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is reduced, which would remove the carbonyl double bond.

So, if the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH, then the carbonyl (double bond) is gone. So the product's index would be 1 (ring) if all other double bonds are gone.

Hmm, so the key is whether the formyl group's carbonyl is affected by the reaction conditions.

Given that the reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps the aldehyde is reduced. How?

In the Clemmensen reduction, aldehydes and ketones are reduced to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl. But with red phosphorus and HI, maybe a similar reduction occurs.

Alternatively, I think that red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce aldehydes to alkanes. For example, the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to CH3.

Wait, if that's the case, then the product's formyl group would be CH3, which has no double bonds.

So, product structure:

- cyclohexane ring (no double bonds)
- substituents: CH3 (from formyl) and CH2I-CH2- (from vinyl)

In this case, the product has only the cyclohexane ring as a ring (no double bonds elsewhere), so index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.

But I'm not entirely certain about whether the formyl group is reduced. Let's think about the reaction steps.

Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the Wittig reaction, but that's when the ylide is formed. Alternatively, when reacting with aldehydes, I think the aldehyde can be reduced to an alkane.

In this case, the reaction is with excess HI. So perhaps the aldehyde is being converted to an alkane. How?

Wait, the reduction of aldehydes with red phosphorus and HI leads to the formation of alkanes. For example, RCHO + (P/HI) → RCH2I. No, wait, that would be the case if it's a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is being converted to a primary alcohol. So, the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2OH.

But the presence of excess HI might lead to further reactions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an imine, but that usually involves amines, which we don't have here.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group doesn't react because it's protected in some way. But I don't think that's the case.

So, to sum up, the reaction would likely reduce the double bonds in the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group. If both are reduced, the product would have no double bonds except possibly in the formyl group. But if the formyl group's carbonyl is also reduced, then the product would have no double bonds and the index would be 1 (only the ring).

So, the index of hydrogen deficiency would be 1, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the sum of the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:
   - The molecule is a cyclohexene ring with:
     - A formyl group (CHO) at position 2.
     - A vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) at position 5.
     - A double bond in the cyclohexene ring (cyclohex-3-ene).
   - This gives the starting material an **index of hydrogen deficiency = 1 (ring) + 2 (double bonds in the ring and vinyl group) + 1 (carbonyl group in the formyl group) = 4**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce double bonds and carbonyl groups.
   - The cyclohexene ring's double bond is reduced, converting it into a single bond (cyclohexane ring).
   - The vinyl group's double bond is also reduced, converting it into a single bond (CH₂CH₂ group).
   - The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH₃, eliminating the carbonyl double bond.

3. **Structure of the Product**:
   - The cyclohexane ring remains intact (1 ring).
   - All double bonds (in the ring, vinyl group, and formyl group) are reduced, leaving no double bonds in the product.
   - The substituents on the ring are:
     - CH₃ (from the reduced formyl group).
     - CH₂CH₂ (from the reduced vinyl group).

4. **Index of Hydrogen Deficiency of the Product**:
   - The product contains 1 ring and no double bonds.
   - Therefore, the **index of hydrogen deficiency = 1**.

### Conclusion:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.
