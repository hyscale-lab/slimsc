Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and their redshift detection. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, I remember that redshift is related to how much the wavelength of light stretches as an object moves away from us. Oh right, because of the expansion of the universe.

The question says these clouds absorb light from quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, Lyman alpha is a specific emission line in hydrogen. Oh, right, it's the transition from n=2 to n=1, so it's in the ultraviolet range. But why is the cloud absorbing it?

So, when a background quasar emits light, if there's a cloud of neutral hydrogen in front, it can absorb this specific wavelength. But since the cloud is moving away, the wavelength gets redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms.

The problem is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh, wait, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because Earth's atmosphere blocks it (UV is mostly absorbed by the atmosphere). So the redshifted wavelength must be in the optical range for us to see it.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. For it to be observed in the optical, the redshifted wavelength must be less than the UV cutoff. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

The optical range is roughly 400-700 nm. Wait, 1 nanometer is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Wait, no. Wait, 1 nm is 10 A. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. Oh, right, 1 nm = 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. But optical light is up to about 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, but wait again. Wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the ultraviolet. So if the cloud is at some redshift z, the observed wavelength would be lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). That lambda_obs must be in the optical range so that ground-based telescopes can detect it.

So we need 1216 A * (1 + z) <= 7000 A? Because 7000 A is 700 nm, which is the upper end of optical. So setting lambda_obs = 7000 A.

Wait, is the upper limit of optical 7000 Angstroms? Or is it lower? Let me think. The visible spectrum is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So yes, 7000 A is the max.

So solving for z: (1 + z) = 7000 / 1216.

Calculating that: 7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.756. So 1 + z ≈ 5.756 → z ≈ 4.756.

Wait, but wait a second. Because if the observed wavelength is longer than 7000 Angstroms, it's in the infrared, which optical telescopes cannot detect. So the maximum z that can be detected is when lambda_obs is exactly 7000 A.

So the lower limit on redshift would be this value. Wait, no. The question says "lower limit" on the redshift. Oh wait, wait. So if the clouds are at a redshift higher than this value, the Lyman alpha would be redshifted beyond optical. So for the cloud to be detected, the wavelength must be within optical, so z can't be higher than this. But wait, the question is about the lower limit. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait the question says, "lower limit on the redshift of this object such that they can be detected." So for the object to be detected, the redshift must be at least a certain value. No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the redshift is too high, the wavelength is too long, beyond optical. So to be detected, the redshift needs to be below a certain value. So the lower limit would be the redshift where the wavelength is just entering the optical. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the Lyman alpha is absorbed at 1216 Angstroms. So quasars emit light in many wavelengths, but the hydrogen cloud absorbs at 1216. When the cloud is moving away, this absorption line shifts into longer wavelengths.

If the cloud has a redshift z, then the absorbed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

For the absorption to be in the optical range, the wavelength must be less than 7000 Angstroms (since optical is up to 700 nm). So 1216*(1+z) <= 7000.

So 1+z <= 7000/1216 ≈ 5.756. So z <= ~4.756.

So the maximum possible redshift that allows detection is about 4.756. But the question is about the lower limit on redshift. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because lower redshifts would mean less redshift, so the observed wavelength would be less than Lyman alpha, which is shorter. Wait no, wait. If z is higher, the observed wavelength is longer.

Wait, wait, if z is higher, the observed wavelength is longer.

So, for the quasar's Lyman alpha to be observed in the optical, the redshift must be high enough to shift it into the optical. But if the cloud is at a low redshift, then the Lyman alpha would be in the UV, which we can't see from the ground. So the lower limit would be the redshift where Lyman alpha is just entering the optical.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

If the cloud is at a redshift z, the absorption is at 1216*(1+z) A. For this to be in optical (<=7000 A), the z must be such that 1216*(1+z) <=7000.

So (1+z) <= 7000/1216 ≈5.756 → z≈4.756.

So any cloud with z less than about 4.756 would have Lyman alpha in the optical or UV.

Wait, but if z is less than 4.756, then 1216*(1+z) is less than 7000 A. So as z increases, the observed wavelength increases.

Wait, but wait—optical is from 4000 A to 7000 A, I think. Wait, no. 400 nm is 4000 A, so the optical range is 4000-7000 A. So if the cloud's Lyman alpha is redshifted into this range, it's visible.

So when z is low, say z=0, the wavelength is 1216 A, which is UV. So we can't see it from the ground.

We need the Lyman alpha to be in the visible range. So 1216*(1+z) should be between 4000 and 7000 A.

So the lower limit would be when 1216*(1+z) =4000 A. So (1+z)=4000/1216≈3.29 → z≈2.29.

Wait, no. Wait, because if z is lower than that, the observed wavelength is less than 4000 A, which is in the UV. So ground-based telescopes can't see it. So the lower limit on z is when Lyman alpha just enters the optical, i.e., when 1216*(1+z) is 4000 A. So z=(4000/1216)-1≈(3.29)-1=2.29.

But wait, the options don't have 2.29. Let me check the options again.

Options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, so 2.29 is close to option C)2.4. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me recalculate 4000/1216.

1216 is roughly 1200 +16=1216. 1216 *3=3648. 3648 + 1216=4864. Wait, wait, 4000/1216 is approximately 3.290? Let me compute: 1216 *3 =3648. 4000-3648=352. 352/1216=0.289 approx. So 3.289. So 1 +z=3.289 → z≈2.289. So z≈2.29.

But the options are 2.4 and 1.9. So why is 2.4 present? Oh, perhaps the question is about the lower limit for the cloud to be detected as a Lyman break, but perhaps I'm getting the approach wrong.

Wait, another approach: Neutral hydrogen clouds at high redshifts absorb the quasar's light, creating a Gunn-Peterson trough if the universe is neutral. But our question is about when that absorption is in the optical.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about when the Lyman-alpha emission is in the optical. Wait, no, the question says the clouds absorb the light from quasars.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the quasar emits light at Lyman alpha, and the neutral hydrogen cloud in front of the quasar absorbs it. So the quasar's own Lyman alpha emission would be absorbed by the cloud. Wait, no, quasars don't primarily emit at Lyman alpha—they emit a broad range of wavelengths. So when the quasar's light passes through the neutral hydrogen cloud, the cloud absorbs the quasar's light at the Lyman alpha wavelength (1216 A), but that absorption is shifted to a longer wavelength if the cloud is at a higher redshift.

Wait, the quasar's light that we observe could have the Lyman-alpha absorption line from the intervening cloud. So the observed wavelength of that absorption line would be (1+z_cloud) * 1216 A.

If that's the case, then for the absorption line to be in the optical, (1+z_cloud) *1216 <=7000. So again, same as before.

So the maximum z for the cloud is about 4.756, but the question is about the lower limit on z. Hmm, maybe I got the question backwards. The lower limit is the minimum z where the cloud is still detectable. So if the cloud has a z value lower than a certain value, we can't see it because the absorption line is in UV.

So the lower limit would be when the Lyman alpha is just in the optical. Wait, no. Because for z=0, the wavelength is 1216 A, which is UV. So for the cloud to be detectable via its Lyman alpha absorption in optical, the redshift must be such that the absorption line is in the optical. So the minimum redshift would be when the Lyman-alpha line is just entering the optical, i.e., when (1+z) is such that 1216*(1+z) is in optical.

Wait, but the optical starts at 4000 A. So 1216*(1+z) >=4000 A.

So (1+z) >=4000/1216≈3.29 → z>=2.29.

So the minimum (lower limit) redshift is about 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest is option C)2.4, and option A is 3. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the quasar's emission is in the optical, and the absorption is at a longer wavelength. So if the quasar is at a high redshift, but the Lyman alpha absorption is at a lower redshift? No, that's not right. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Or wait, no, the cloud is in between us and the quasar, so the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The quasar is at a certain redshift, say z_q. The cloud is in front of it, so it's at a lower redshift, z_cloud < z_q.

The quasar emits light, and the cloud absorbs at Lyman alpha (1216 A). So the absorption line we see is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) A.

If the cloud has a z_cloud such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is within the optical (4000-7000 A), then we can see the absorption line.

So the minimum z_cloud where we can see the line is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) =4000 A.

So z_cloud = (4000/1216) -1 ≈3.29 -1≈2.29.

So the lower limit is about 2.29. But the options don't have this. The closest is C)2.4, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum z_cloud is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) =7000 A. So z_cloud = (7000/1216) -1 ≈5.756-1≈4.756.

So for the cloud to be detected, its redshift must be between approximately 2.29 and 4.756.

So the lower limit is about 2.29. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate 4000/1216 exactly.

4000 ÷ 1216 = ?

Let me compute:

1216 × 3 = 3648.

4000 -3648 = 352.

352 ÷1216 = 0.2895.

So 3.2895. So 1 + z =3.2895 → z=2.2895.

So approximately 2.29. So option C is 2.4, which is higher than that. So perhaps 2.29 is not an option, but the closest higher option is C. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the lower limit, meaning the minimum z where the cloud can be detected. So perhaps a higher z would make the line move to longer wavelengths, which are into the infrared, which optical telescopes can't see. So the lower limit is when the line is just entering the optical. So the minimum z is 2.29, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option C)2.4, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using 400 nm as the lower limit for optical, which is 4000 A. So the calculation is as above.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the quasar's light is observed in the optical, but the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the near-infrared. So ground-based telescopes can't detect it because it's beyond the optical. So for detection, the Lyman-alpha absorption must be within the visible range.

Wait, but ground-based optical telescopes can detect near-infrared? No, I think most optical telescopes are limited by the atmosphere. Near-infrared is observed with instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope, but ground-based telescopes can use adaptive optics and some IR observing, but perhaps the question is assuming that only the visible is accessible.

So for the absorption line to be in the visible, the redshift must satisfy 1216*(1+z) <=7000.

So z_max = (7000/1216) -1 ≈5.756-1=4.756.

So any cloud with z_cloud <=4.756 can have their Lyman-alpha absorption in the visible. But the question is about the lower limit.

Wait, if the cloud is at a lower redshift, the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the UV, which can't be observed from the ground. So the lower limit is when the Lyman-alpha is just in the visible. So that's when z_cloud ≈2.29. So the lower limit is z_cloud ≈2.29.

But the options don't have 2.29, but option C is 2.4, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the correct answer is C)2.4, or maybe the question is set with a slightly different threshold.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the Lyman-alpha emission line from the cloud itself. But that's unlikely because the question says the cloud absorbs the quasar's light.

Wait another angle: Maybe the quasar's light is at a certain wavelength, and the hydrogen cloud's absorption is at Lyman alpha, which is redshifted into the optical. So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud.

So the cloud's Lyman alpha is observed at (1 + z_cloud) *1216 A. To be in optical (<=7000 A), z_cloud <= (7000/1216)-1 ≈4.756.

So the quasar's light could be much further away, but the absorption is due to a cloud at a lower redshift.

The question is, what's the lower limit on the redshift of the cloud (z_cloud) such that the absorption can be detected. So the lower limit is when z_cloud is as low as possible, but the Lyman-alpha absorption is just in the optical.

Wait, but if z_cloud is very low, the absorption would be in the UV. So the minimum z_cloud is when (1 + z_cloud) *1216 >=4000 A → z_cloud >=2.289. So the lower limit is z_cloud >=2.289.

So looking at the options, the closest is option C)2.4.

But wait, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So 2.289 is closer to option C)2.4 than to any other option. So I think the correct answer is C)2.4.

But wait, another point: The question says "lower limit on the redshift of this object such that they can be detected". So if the object is at a higher redshift, the line is shifted further into the infrared, beyond optical. So the lower limit would be the redshift where the line is just entering the optical. So the minimum z is 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the objects must have z >=2.29 to be detected. Wait no, that's not correct. Because, for lower z, the line is at a shorter wavelength, which is UV, undetectable. So to be detectable, the cloud must have z >=2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, which is the minimum z for which the cloud can be detected. So the answer is the smallest option which is >=2.29.

Looking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Only option A)3 and C)2.4 are above 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimum redshift is about 2.3. So any cloud with z >=2.3 can be detected. The question asks for the lower limit, so that's the minimum z. So the correct answer would be the first option that is above 2.3. So the options are A=3, C=2.4. So 2.4 is the closest.

Wait, but the lower limit would be the minimum z required. So if the clouds have z_cloud >=2.29, then the lower limit is 2.29. So the possible answers are A)3, C)2.4.

But the options don't have 2.3. So perhaps the calculation is done without considering that the optical range starts at 400 nm (4000 A), but perhaps the question assumes that the optical goes up to 1216*(1+z) = 7000 A, but the lower end is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial threshold. Let me think: What is the wavelength limit for optical? Let's think in Angstrom.

The visible spectrum is roughly 4000 A (400 nm) to about 7000 A (700 nm). So for Lyman alpha to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be between 4000 and 7000 A.

So (1 + z) * 1216 A must be >=4000 A → (1 + z) >=4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z >=2.29.

So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the clouds must have a redshift of at least approximately 2.3 to be detected. So the options that are above 2.3 are C)2.4 and A)3. So the lower limit is 2.3, so the correct answer is the smallest option that is >=2.3, which is 2.4 (option C).

But let me think again. The question says, "Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this object such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes?"

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering that the quasar's light is observed in the optical, but the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the near-infrared, which can't be detected. So only when the Lyman-alpha absorption is in the optical can it be detected.

Wait, no, the cloud's Lyman-alpha absorption would be in the quasar's spectrum. So if the absorption is in the optical, it is detectable. If it's in the UV, it's not.

So the clouds at z_cloud >=2.29 have their Lyman-alpha absorption in the optical, so they are detectable. Those with lower z have it in UV, undetectable.

So the lower limit is z_cloud =2.29. Since this isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is the next higher option, which is C)2.4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using 5000 A as the upper limit of optical. Let me recalculate with 5000 A.

5000/1216 ≈4.097 → z=3.097. So the lower limit would be when the wavelength is 4000 A → z=2.29.

But again, the options don't include 2.3, but option C is 2.4.

Wait another thought: Maybe the question is about the quasar's emission line being at Lyman-alpha, which is then redshifted into the optical.

Wait, but the quasar emits a broad range of wavelengths, but the Lyman-alpha emission line is at 1216 A. So if the quasar is at a high redshift z_quasar, the Lyman-alpha emission would be observed at 1216*(1 + z_quasar).

But in this question, the cloud is absorbing the quasar's light, so the quasar's light would be missing a certain wavelength. That wavelength is at 1216 A in the cloud's frame, but observed at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) A.

So if the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar, then the Lyman-alpha absorption line would be at a wavelength shorter than the quasar's own Lyman-alpha emission.

But perhaps this isn't affecting the calculation.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the cloud's redshift, and for the absorption to be in the optical. So the redshift of the cloud must be such that 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is within the optical range.

Thus, the lower limit is when 1216*(1 + z_cloud) is just entering the optical, which is 4000 A. So z_cloud ≈2.29. So the correct answer is the option closest to that, which is C)2.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Lyman-alpha Absorption Wavelength**: The Lyman-alpha emission line of hydrogen occurs at a rest wavelength of \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \). When a neutral hydrogen cloud is at a redshift \( z \), the observed wavelength of this absorption line is given by:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z)
   \]

2. **Optical Telescope Detection**: Optical ground-based telescopes can detect wavelengths in the range \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å} \). For the Lyman-alpha absorption to be detectable, the redshift \( z \) must satisfy:
   \[
   4000 \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000
   \]
   Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \cdot (1 + z) \), we get:
   \[
   4000 \leq 1216 \cdot (1 + z) \leq 7000
   \]

3. **Lower Limit on Redshift**: To find the lower limit on \( z \), we solve for the condition where the observed wavelength just enters the optical range:
   \[
   1216 \cdot (1 + z) \geq 4000
   \]
   Dividing through by 1216:
   \[
   1 + z \geq \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
   \]
   Subtracting 1:
   \[
   z \geq 3.29 - 1 \approx 2.29
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**: The calculated lower limit on \( z \) is approximately \( 2.29 \). Among the provided options:
   - \( \mathbf{A) \, 3} \): Higher than the calculated limit.
   - \( \mathbf{B) \, 1.2} \): Lower than the calculated limit.
   - \( \mathbf{C) \, 2.4} \): Closest to the calculated limit.
   - \( \mathbf{D) \, 1.9} \): Lower than the calculated limit.

   The closest option to the calculated lower limit is \( \mathbf{C) \, 2.4} \).

5. **Conclusion**: The lower limit on the redshift of the neutral hydrogen clouds, such that their Lyman-alpha absorption can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \). Among the given options, the best match is \( 2.4 \).
