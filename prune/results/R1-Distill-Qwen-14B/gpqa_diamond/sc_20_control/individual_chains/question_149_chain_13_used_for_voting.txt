Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a peptidic compound analysis. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my NMR and organic chemistry, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like what's expected, except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, they aren't splitting each other because the coupling is ruled out. Wait, why can't it be spin-spin coupling? Oh, the question says they ruled it out based on the coupling pattern. So it's not like one peak is splitting the other into a doublet or something.

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So, same molecular weight, but two separate entities. Since the NMR shows some splitting but same mass, it's not a fragment or a different compound entirely. So the options are more about isomerism or something else.

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. That would mean the MS would show the precursor and the product. But the question says both LC-MS peaks have same mass as expected. So probably not A.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in an achiral environment they would be separate in chiral columns, but in regular LC, they might co-elute. Wait, but if the LC is using a regular column, the enantiomers might not separate. Oh, but the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks. So perhaps the LC is a normal column and they're not chiral, but maybe they are diastereomers? Or maybe the LC is a chiral column. Hmm, but if it's a chiral column, then enantiomers would split into two. But if it's not, they'd elute together. So if the LC shows two peaks, maybe it's not enantiomers because they wouldn't split. But wait, the question says "elevated temperature." I'm not sure how that affects. Also, NMR for enantiomers would look the same because they're not chiral in solution? Wait, no, in NMR, if the sample is in a chiral environment, like maybe in a chiral solvent, or if the molecule is chiral, the peaks would be split. But wait, the NMR here shows two peaks for the same proton. Hmm, not sure.

C) 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling isn't a term I remember clearly. Maybe it refers to some kind of coupling that leads to multiple peaks. But in the NMR, the two peaks are for the same proton. Wait, but in an amide bond, the alpha protons are deshielded. If during the reaction, perhaps some coupling leads to two signals. But the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling, so it's not splitting from neighboring protons. Another thought: maybe it's a diastereomeric mixture. Like, in the case of diastereomers, the NMR signals can split because the environments are different.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But in this case, the two peaks have similar shifts, right? So why would that be? Well, maybe the diastereomers are enantiomers of each other in some parts. Wait, no, diastereomers are not mirror images. So if two diastereoisomers are present, their alpha protons might have slightly different shifts, but if the diastereomers are close in structure, their shifts might be similar. So in this case, the two peaks could be from two different diastereomers. Since their shifts are similar, perhaps the substituents around the alpha protons are the same, but the overall structure makes the shifts a bit different. Also, in the LC-MS, they both have the same mass, which makes sense for diastereomers because they have the same molecular formula. So, the LC would separate them because they have different physical properties, hence two peaks.

But wait, what about the NMR? The integral adds up to 1H. So each peak is about 0.5H. If it's a diastereomer mixture, each diastereomer would have the same number of protons. So for each alpha proton, in each diastereomer, there's one proton. So in the NMR, each diastereomer would contribute one peak. If the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, their peaks would add up. But wait, each diastereomer would have the same number of protons, so if the sample is a 50:50 mix, each would contribute the same number of protons. So for each proton in the structure, each diastereomer has one, so in the NMR, you'd see two peaks each integrating to 0.5H, adding up to 1H.

Why wouldn't it be a diastereomer mixture? Because diastereomers have different physical properties, so in the NMR, their protons would appear as separate signals. But why are the shifts similar? Maybe the diastereomers are enantiomers or have similar environments around the alpha protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of epimers, which are a type of diastereomers, differing only in the configuration of one stereocenter.

So putting it together: The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because there are two diastereomers present. Each contributes a peak, and their shifts are similar because the environment is almost the same. The LC-MS shows two peaks because the diastereomers have different retention times but same mass.

Looking back at the options, D says the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. That fits.

Option B is enantiomers. Enantiomers' NMR would look the same if the instrument isn't chiral. But in the NMR, if the machine isn't equipped to separate enantiomers, then you'd see a single peak. But the question says the NMR shows two peaks. Wait, but that's confusing. If the compound is a racemic mixture of enantiomers, their NMR would appear as a single peak because they are mirror images and have the same environment. But in this question, the NMR shows two peaks, which doesn't fit a racemic mixture unless the environment is chiral. Hmm, but the question says that the NMR shows two peaks. So maybe the sample is not a racemic mixture but a mixture of diastereomers. So D makes more sense.

So, the correct answer should be D.

The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Contaminated with a precursor**  
   If the compound were contaminated with a precursor, the LC-MS would show peaks with different masses corresponding to the precursor and the product. However, the question specifies that both LC-MS peaks have the same mass as the expected molecule, ruling out contamination with a precursor.  

2. **Option B: Mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are mirror images and would not split into separate peaks in a non-chiral LC column. If the LC-MS shows two peaks, it suggests the presence of compounds with different physical properties, which is inconsistent with enantiomers. Additionally, in an NMR, enantiomers would appear as a single peak unless the environment is chiral, which is not indicated here.  

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide-bond formation**  
   The question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling has been ruled out as the cause of the duplicate peaks. Furthermore, "double coupling" is not a well-defined term in this context and does not align with the observations in the LC-MS or NMR data.  

4. **Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and can produce separate peaks in LC-MS due to differences in retention times, as observed here. In the NMR, each diastereomer contributes its own signal for the alpha-proton, leading to two peaks with similar chemical shifts if the environments around the alpha-proton are nearly identical. The integrals of the peaks adding up to 1H is consistent with a 50:50 mixture of two diastereoisomers, each contributing 0.5H for the alpha-proton. This explanation aligns well with both the NMR and LC-MS data.

### Conclusion:  
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
