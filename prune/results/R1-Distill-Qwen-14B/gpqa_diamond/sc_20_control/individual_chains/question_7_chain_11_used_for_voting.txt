Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process gamma-gamma annihilating into electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, so we're talking really high-energy gamma-rays.

I remember that this process is related to the photon's lifetime in the universe. High-energy gamma-rays can interact with the CMB photons because their high energy allows them to meet the threshold needed for pair production. So the gamma-ray's lifetime is determined by the probability of this interaction happening before other processes—like expansion of the universe or other interactions—limit its existence.

The process in question is the inverse Compton scattering or maybe the photon-photon interaction. Wait, no, the specific process here is gamma + gamma -> e+ e-. For that to happen, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least enough to create the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so the threshold energy would be 2 * 0.511 MeV, right? Or wait, is it just the sum of the energies? No, wait, the threshold occurs when the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the electron mass. So the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c². 

But wait, for two photons colliding, the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (but since photons are massless, their momentum is E/c, direction matters). But when considering the photons moving in opposite directions, the expression might simplify. Let me think about this.

The formula for the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs probably depends on the energies of the photons. I remember that the cross-section rises above the threshold energy, and the threshold occurs when the product of the photon energies is around (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, for the two photons, E1 * E2 ~ (m_e c²)^2. So that's the condition for the process to be possible. The threshold is when E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2. Because when they collide, their combined energy must create the rest mass of the pair.

But in this problem, one photon is from the CMB, which has an average energy of 1e-3 eV. So E2 is about 1e-3 eV. The other photon is the high-energy gamma-ray, E1 is the energy we're solving for.

So setting E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2. Let's compute that.

m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV. So let's convert that into eV: 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV. So (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 eV^2 = approx 2.6e11 eV^2.

E1 * E2 = 2.6e11 eV^2.

E2 is 1e-3 eV, so E1 = (2.6e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.6e14 eV.

Wait, 2.6e14 eV is 2.6e8 GeV. But wait, that's way higher than the options given. The options are up to 3.9e5 GeV. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I get the formula wrong?

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me double-check the threshold condition. The threshold for two photons (E1 and E2) to produce an electron-positron pair is indeed when the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the rest mass of the electron. So the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c². 

But s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. The invariant s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are massless, E = |p| c, so for photons moving in opposite directions, p1 and p2 are in opposite directions. Let me consider them moving head-on. So p1 is +p and p2 is -p', say.

Wait, maybe an easier way. The minimum condition for two photons colliding to produce a pair is that the product of their energies in the center-of-mass frame must be at least (m_e c²)^2. Alternatively, there's a formula: when two photons of energies E and E' collide, the threshold condition is E * E' ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when the photons are moving in the same direction, the energy in the center of mass is lower, but when moving opposite, it's higher. So the maximum energy is when they are head-on.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Or maybe it's E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2? I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct condition is that the product of the photon energies times (1 - cos θ) must be greater than (m_e c²)^2, where θ is the angle between them. But when they're head-on, cos θ = -1, so (1 - (-1)) = 2. So the condition becomes E1 * E2 * 2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2. So E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 2.

Hmm, that would change the numbers. Let me recalculate.

So E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2 / 2.

m_e c² is 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV.

(m_e c²)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = approx 2.61e11 eV².

Divide by 2: 1.305e11 eV².

E2 is 1e-3 eV, so E1 = (1.305e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 1.305e14 eV.

Convert that to GeV: 1e9 eV is 1 GeV. So 1.305e14 eV = 1.305e5 GeV. That's 130,500 GeV. Hmm, that's 1.3e5 GeV, which is close to option B or C.

Looking at the options:

A) 9.5e4 GeV → 95,000 GeV

B) 1.8e5 GeV → 180,000 GeV

C) 2.6e5 GeV → 260,000 GeV

D) 3.9e5 GeV → 390,000 GeV.

Wait, 1.3e5 GeV would be about 130,000 GeV, which isn't an option. The closest is option B, 1.8e5 GeV, but that's higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the CMB photon's energy is an average. Or perhaps I should consider that the CMB photon's energy is much lower, so the gamma photon must be much higher. Alternatively, maybe the formula requires the gamma photon's energy to be on the order of (m_e c²)^2 / E_CMB.

Wait, wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the cross-section formula for this process. The cross-section for photon-photon to e+ e- is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2) [1 - (E1/E2) - (E2/E1)]².

Wait, but this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, the mean free path λ for a gamma-ray in the CMB would be the inverse of the cross-section multiplied by the number density of CMB photons.

The number density n of CMB photons is about 1e8 per cubic meter. Wait, no, at the present universe, the CMB photon density is about 411 photons per cm³, which is 411e6 per m³. But let me think in terms of energy.

The average energy of a CMB photon is E_cmb = 1e-3 eV. The energy density u is about 0.23 eV/m³ (since u = 8π g * (k_B T)^4 / h^3 c^3, but for T≈2.7 K, u ≈ 0.23 eV/m³).

But perhaps another approach is to calculate the optical depth τ for a gamma-ray traveling through the universe. The optical depth is n σ λ, where λ is the mean distance over which the number density is approximately uniform. But that's getting a bit involved.

Alternatively, the lifetime τ of the gamma-ray is determined by the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate Γ is given by n σ v_rel, where v_rel is the relative velocity between the gamma-ray and CMB photons.

Wait, in the rest frame of the CMB, the gamma-ray is moving at speed v ≈ c. The CMB photons have a thermal distribution. The number of CMB photons with energy E' around E is given by the Planck distribution.

But perhaps an approximation is to use the fact that the interaction rate is proportional to n σ v, but maybe in the frame where one photon is moving and the other is at rest, but no, because the CMB is isotropic.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the photon's lifetime due to this interaction. The lifetime τ is given by τ ≈ 1 / (n σ v), where n is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity.

But in this case, the gamma-ray is moving at speed v ≈ c, and the CMB photons are moving at speed c in random directions. So the relative velocity between the gamma-ray and a typical CMB photon would be about c.

Wait, but the cross-section for the process depends on the energies of both photons. So the cross-section σ is a function of E1 and E2.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about approximate expressions. I remember that the interaction length for a high-energy photon with the CMB is given by something like L ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 / (n σ E1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the interaction probability. The probability P that a gamma-ray of energy E1 will interact with a CMB photon (E2) is P ≈ n σ v, where σ is the cross-section.

But the cross-section for the process γγ → e+ e- is given by the formula:

σ = (8 π/3) (m_e^4 c^6) / (s) [where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy].

Wait, but s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are massless, E = |p| c. So p1 is E1/(c), and p2 is E2/(c). So if the photons are moving in opposite directions, p1 and p2 are in opposite directions, so p1 c + p2 c = (E1/(c) * c) + (-E2/(c) * c) ) = E1 - E2 if they're moving opposite.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact expression. So let's think about the process in the center-of-mass frame. The minimum energy required is when the two photons have just enough energy to create the pair. So the condition is E1 + E2 ≥ 2 m_e c². But when E1 and E2 are much larger than m_e c², this condition is satisfied.

Wait, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, because E2 is the CMB photon, which is 1e-3 eV. So E1 would have to be about 2m_e c² - E2, but that's not relevant because E2 is negligible compared to E1.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The process is called the photon-photon interaction, and the cross-section increases as the photon energies increase. The cross-section for pair production is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^4 c^6) / (E1 E2) [ (1 - (E1/E2))² + ... ]. But when E1 ≫ E2, this simplifies.

Wait, when E1 is much larger than E2, which is the case here since E2 is 1e-3 eV and E1 is in GeV range, so E1 >> E2. So, in this limit, the cross-section can be approximated as σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2) * (something?).

Wait, let me check: the cross-section for pair production when E1 ≫ E2 is approximately σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2). So that's σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E1 E2).

Then, the interaction probability per unit length is P ≈ n σ v, where n is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity between the gamma-ray and the photon. But since both are moving at speed c, and the CMB is isotropic, the relative velocity is about c. So v ≈ c.

Wait, but the number density n of CMB photons is about 1e8 per cubic meter? Wait, let me think: the CMB has a photon density of about 411 photons/cm³, which is 411e6 photons/m³. So n = 411e6 m^-3.

Now, let's put it all together. The lifetime τ (or mean lifetime) of the gamma-ray would be τ ≈ 1/(n σ v).

But wait, the lifetime is the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate Γ is given by Γ = n σ v, so τ = 1/Γ ≈ 1/(n σ v).

So, substituting in the values:

σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E1 E2)

v ≈ c

n = 411e6 m^-3

E2 = 1e-3 eV

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV.

So let's compute σ:

σ = (8π/3) * ( (5.11e5 eV)^2 c^4 ) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

Wait, but units are a bit messy here. Let me make sure all terms are in compatible units.

Wait, let's write everything in eV and meters, seconds.

But perhaps it's easier to compute in natural units where c=1, and then convert back.

Wait, maybe I can proceed step by step.

Compute σ:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / (E1 E2 )

Let me compute (m_e c^2)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 eV² = approx 2.61e11 eV².

E1 is the gamma energy in eV, E2 = 1e-3 eV.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e11) / (E1 * 1e-3 ) eV

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14) / E1 eV^{-1} ?

Wait, wait, let me be precise.

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (m_e c^2)^2 / (E1 E2 )

= (8π/3) * (5.11e5 eV)^2 / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e11 / 1e-3) eV / E1

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14) eV / E1

So, σ ≈ (8π/3 * 2.61e14) / E1 eV^{-1}.

Now, the interaction rate Γ is n σ v.

n = 411e6 m^-3.

v ≈ c, which is ~3e8 m/s.

So,

Γ = n σ v

= 411e6 m^-3 * [ (8π/3 * 2.61e14 eV) / E1 ] * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, but units don't match. Let me think about the units.

Wait a second, I'm mixing eV and meters. Let's handle units appropriately. Let me express everything in terms of eV and seconds.

Wait, Planck's constant h is about 4.1357e-15 eV·s.

So, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. But maybe using eV and s is better.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the rate in Hz (per second) and then find the lifetime.

So, Γ (Hz) = n σ v / (speed factor) ?

Hmm, maybe another approach is better. Let me compute the cross-section in cm².

Because natural units can be tricky here.

Wait, cross-section σ has units of cm².

1 barn is 1e-24 cm². Common cross-sections are on the order of 1e-26 to 1e-28 cm².

So, let's compute σ in cm².

First, compute (m_e c^2)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 ≈ 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

E1 is in eV, E2 = 1e-3 eV.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV) )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14 eV) / E1.

Hmm, but I need σ in cm².

Wait, we can relate eV to ergs: 1 eV = 1.602e-12 erg.

And 1 erg = 1 g cm²/s².

So, 1 eV = 1.602e-12 g cm²/s².

Then, the cross-section σ has units of cm².

So each eV in the numerator would contribute (g cm²/s²), but I'm getting lost in units here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between eV and inverse meters. Because 1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of 12400 / (1 eV) Angstroms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between eV and cm^-1.

1 eV = 8.0e13 cm^-1 (since hc ≈ 12400 eV·Å = 12400 eV * 1e-8 cm = 1.24e-4 eV cm, so 1 eV = 1/(1.24e-4 cm) ≈ 8.06e3 cm^-1). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, hc = 12400 eV·Å = 12400 eV * 1e-10 m = 12400 eV * 1e-8 cm = 1.24e-4 eV cm.

So, 1 eV = (hc)^-1 → 1 eV = 1/(1.24e-4 cm) ≈ 8065.5 cm^-1.

So, 1 eV = 8.0655e3 cm^-1.

So, 1 eV / cm = 8.0655e3 cm^-2.

Wait, maybe using this can help.

So, σ has units of cm².

From the formula,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14 eV) / E1.

But to express this in cm², we can write each eV as 8.0655e3 cm^-1.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e14 * (8.0655e3 cm^-1)) / E1.

Wait, because each eV is 8.0655e3 cm^-1, so 1 eV = 8.0655e3 cm^-1.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e14) * (8.0655e3 cm^-1 ) ) / E1.

Wait, but E1 is in eV, so each eV in the denominator becomes 8.0655e3 cm^-1.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e14 eV) * (8.0655e3 cm^-1 / eV ) ) / E1.

Because 1 eV = 8.0655e3 cm^-1, so 1 cm^-1 = 1/(8.0655e3) eV.

Wait, perhaps I should express E1 in terms of cm^-1.

E1 (eV) = E1_cm^{-1} * (8.0655e3 cm^-1 / eV )

So, E1 in cm^-1 is E1_eV * 8.0655e3.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1_eV * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14 eV) / E1_eV.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's compute the cross-section numerically.

Compute the numerator first:

(8π/3) ≈ 8.37758.

(8.37758) * (2.61e14 eV) ≈ 2.19e15 eV.

So σ ≈ (2.19e15 eV) / E1 / (1e-3 eV) )

Wait, no, the denominator is E1 * 1e-3 eV, so 2.19e15 eV / (E1 * 1e-3 eV ) ) → 2.19e15 / (E1 * 1e-3 ) [eV / eV] → 2.19e18 / E1.

Wait, but this is in (eV)^-1, but we need cm².

Hmm, perhaps I should find a way to express σ in cm².

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the cross-section in terms of eV and then convert into cm² using the relation between eV and cm^-1.

Wait, 1 barn is 1e-24 cm².

So, perhaps I should compute the cross-section in barns.

But I'm getting stuck on the unit conversion here. Maybe I can proceed with the numerical calculation without units first.

So, let me compute the cross-section σ:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / (E1 E2 )

= (8π/3) * (5.11e5 eV)^2 / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14 eV) / E1.

So,

σ = (8π/3 * 2.61e14) / E1 eV^{-1}.

Now, n is 411e6 m^-3.

But 1 m^-3 = (1e2 cm)^-3 = 1e-6 cm^-3.

Wait, no, 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m^-3 = (100 cm)^-3 = 1e-6 cm^-3. So, 411e6 m^-3 = 411e6 * 1e-6 cm^-3 = 411 cm^-3.

So, n = 411 cm^-3.

v = c ≈ 3e10 cm/s.

Now, the interaction rate Γ is n σ v.

But σ is in cm², so:

Γ = n [cm^-3] * σ [cm²] * v [cm/s] → units are 1/s, which is Hz.

So,

Γ = 411 * σ * 3e10.

But σ is (8π/3 * 2.61e14 eV) / (E1 eV) → so σ = (8π/3 * 2.61e14) / E1 * (cm² per eV) ?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think about the units.

Wait, when I have σ in terms of eV, I need to convert it into cm². So, each eV in the denominator corresponds to 8.0655e3 cm^-1.

So, σ = (8π/3 * 2.61e14 eV) / E1.

But 1 eV = 8.0655e3 cm^-1, so 1/cm → 8.0655e3 eV.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section in cm² is:

σ = [ (8π/3 * 2.61e14 eV) / E1 ] * (1 cm² / (8.0655e3 eV)) )

Wait, because 1 eV corresponds to 8.0655e3 cm^-1, so 1 cm^-1 is 1/(8.0655e3) eV.

Thus, 1 cm² = (8.0655e3 cm^-1)^{-2} (eV)^2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe a better approach is to use the formula with all quantities in SI units.

Alternative approach: Use natural units where c=1, but then convert back.

Alternatively, use the formula for the photon-photon cross-section in terms of eV and meters.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated for the time I have. Let's think of the problem another way.

The key point is that the process γγ → e+ e- is only significant when the product of the two photon energies is around (m_e c²)^2. So,

E1 * E2 ≈ (m_e c²)^2.

But wait, in the previous calculation, I think that was the threshold condition. So,

E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2 → E1 = (m_e c²)^2 / E2.

E2 is 1e-3 eV, so E1 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) = (2.61e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, 2.6e5 GeV is option C. But wait, earlier I thought when E1 >> E2, the cross-section is proportional to 1/(E1 E2), so maybe I'm missing a factor. Because when E1 is much greater than E2, the threshold condition might not directly apply.

But according to this calculation, E1 would be approximately 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C: 2.6e5 GeV.

But wait, in the previous step, when I thought about the condition E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2, I got E1 = 2.6e14 eV = 2.6e5 GeV. So that would be option C.

But wait, in the initial calculation, when I considered the interaction rate, I ended up with a much higher energy (around 1.3e5 GeV), but that was when I used the cross-section formula. But perhaps I made a mistake in the cross-section.

Wait, perhaps the correct threshold condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Because when the photons are moving in the same direction, the minimum energy is higher. But if they're moving in opposite directions, the required energy is lower.

Since the CMB photons are isotropic, the average would involve considering both scenarios. But for a gamma-ray traveling through the CMB, the most probable direction for a CMB photon would be opposite to the gamma-ray's direction, maximizing the energy available for pair production.

So, perhaps the correct threshold is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 4. So,

E1 = (m_e c²)^2 / (4 * E2).

So,

E1 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 / (4 * 1e-3 eV) ) = (2.61e11 eV²) / (4e-3 eV) ) = 6.525e13 eV = 6.525e5 GeV.

But that's even higher than before. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use E1 = (m_e c²)^2 / (2 * E2).

So,

E1 = (2.61e11 eV²) / (2e-3 eV) ) = 1.305e14 eV = 1.305e5 GeV.

Which is 1.3e5 GeV, which is close to option B (1.8e5 GeV) or option C (2.6e5 GeV).

But this is getting confusing. Another approach: perhaps the energy is around 1e5 GeV. So looking at the options, the closest higher value is option B or C.

Wait, but the initial condition I thought was correct was E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2, giving 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The process requires the combined energy of the two photons to be sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair, with the rest mass energy of the pair being $2m_e c^2 \approx 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$. 

The threshold condition for two photons of energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ to produce an electron-positron pair is given by:

\[
E_1 \cdot E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2
\]

Here, $E_2$ is the energy of a CMB photon, which is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. The energy of the gamma-ray, $E_1$, can be solved for using the threshold condition:

\[
E_1 = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}
\]

Substituting the values:
- $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV}$,
- $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$,

we calculate:

\[
E_1 = \frac{(5.11 \times 10^5)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{2.61 \times 10^{11}}{10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]

Converting to GeV:
\[
E_1 = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This matches option C, which is $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Therefore, the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process gamma-gamma annihilating into electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, so we're talking really high-energy gamma-rays.

I remember that this process is related to the photon's lifetime in the universe. High-energy gamma-rays can interact with the CMB photons because their high energy allows them to meet the threshold needed for pair production. So the gamma-ray's lifetime is determined by the probability of this interaction happening before other processes—like expansion of the universe or other interactions—limit its existence.

The process in question is the inverse Compton scattering or maybe the photon-photon interaction. Wait, no, the specific process here is gamma + gamma -> e+ e-. For that to happen, the combined energy of the two photons must be at least enough to create the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so the threshold energy would be 2 * 0.511 MeV, right? Or wait, is it just the sum of the energies? No, wait, the threshold occurs when the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the electron mass. So the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c². 

But wait, for two photons colliding, the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 (but since photons are massless, their momentum is E/c, direction matters). But when considering the photons moving in opposite directions, the expression might simplify. Let me think about this.

The formula for the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs probably depends on the energies of the photons. I remember that the cross-section rises above the threshold energy, and the threshold occurs when the product of the photon energies is around (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, for the two photons, E1 * E2 ~ (m_e c²)^2. So that's the condition for the process to be possible. The threshold is when E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2. Because when they collide, their combined energy must create the rest mass of the pair.

But in this problem, one photon is from the CMB, which has an average energy of 1e-3 eV. So E2 is about 1e-3 eV. The other photon is the high-energy gamma-ray, E1 is the energy we're solving for.

So setting E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2. Let's compute that.

m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV. So let's convert that into eV: 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV. So (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 eV^2 = approx 2.6e11 eV^2.

E1 * E2 = 2.6e11 eV^2.

E2 is 1e-3 eV, so E1 = (2.6e11 eV^2) / (1e-3 eV) = 2.6e14 eV.

Wait, 2.6e14 eV is 2.6e8 GeV. But wait, that's way higher than the options given. The options are up to 3.9e5 GeV. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I get the formula wrong?

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me double-check the threshold condition. The threshold for two photons (E1 and E2) to produce an electron-positron pair is indeed when the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the rest mass of the electron. So the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2 m_e c². 

But s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame. The invariant s is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are massless, E = |p| c, so for photons moving in opposite directions, p1 and p2 are in opposite directions. Let me consider them moving head-on. So p1 is +p and p2 is -p', say.

Wait, maybe an easier way. The minimum condition for two photons colliding to produce a pair is that the product of their energies in the center-of-mass frame must be at least (m_e c²)^2. Alternatively, there's a formula: when two photons of energies E and E' collide, the threshold condition is E * E' ≥ (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when the photons are moving in the same direction, the energy in the center of mass is lower, but when moving opposite, it's higher. So the maximum energy is when they are head-on.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Or maybe it's E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2? I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct condition is that the product of the photon energies times (1 - cos θ) must be greater than (m_e c²)^2, where θ is the angle between them. But when they're head-on, cos θ = -1, so (1 - (-1)) = 2. So the condition becomes E1 * E2 * 2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2. So E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 2.

Hmm, that would change the numbers. Let me recalculate.

So E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2 / 2.

m_e c² is 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV.

(m_e c²)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = approx 2.61e11 eV².

Divide by 2: 1.305e11 eV².

E2 is 1e-3 eV, so E1 = (1.305e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) = 1.305e14 eV.

Convert that to GeV: 1e9 eV is 1 GeV. So 1.305e14 eV = 1.305e5 GeV. That's 130,500 GeV. Hmm, that's 1.3e5 GeV, which is close to option B or C.

Looking at the options:

A) 9.5e4 GeV → 95,000 GeV

B) 1.8e5 GeV → 180,000 GeV

C) 2.6e5 GeV → 260,000 GeV

D) 3.9e5 GeV → 390,000 GeV.

Wait, 1.3e5 GeV would be about 130,000 GeV, which isn't an option. The closest is option B, 1.8e5 GeV, but that's higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the CMB photon's energy is an average. Or perhaps I should consider that the CMB photon's energy is much lower, so the gamma photon must be much higher. Alternatively, maybe the formula requires the gamma photon's energy to be on the order of (m_e c²)^2 / E_CMB.

Wait, wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the cross-section formula for this process. The cross-section for photon-photon to e+ e- is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2) [1 - (E1/E2) - (E2/E1)]².

Wait, but this might be getting too complicated. Alternatively, the mean free path λ for a gamma-ray in the CMB would be the inverse of the cross-section multiplied by the number density of CMB photons.

The number density n of CMB photons is about 1e8 per cubic meter. Wait, no, at the present universe, the CMB photon density is about 411 photons per cm³, which is 411e6 per m³. But let me think in terms of energy.

The average energy of a CMB photon is E_cmb = 1e-3 eV. The energy density u is about 0.23 eV/m³ (since u = 8π g * (k_B T)^4 / h^3 c^3, but for T≈2.7 K, u ≈ 0.23 eV/m³).

But perhaps another approach is to calculate the optical depth τ for a gamma-ray traveling through the universe. The optical depth is n σ λ, where λ is the mean distance over which the number density is approximately uniform. But that's getting a bit involved.

Alternatively, the lifetime τ of the gamma-ray is determined by the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate Γ is given by n σ v_rel, where v_rel is the relative velocity between the gamma-ray and CMB photons.

Wait, in the rest frame of the CMB, the gamma-ray is moving at speed v ≈ c. The CMB photons have a thermal distribution. The number of CMB photons with energy E' around E is given by the Planck distribution.

But perhaps an approximation is to use the fact that the interaction rate is proportional to n σ v, but maybe in the frame where one photon is moving and the other is at rest, but no, because the CMB is isotropic.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the photon's lifetime due to this interaction. The lifetime τ is given by τ ≈ 1 / (n σ v), where n is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity.

But in this case, the gamma-ray is moving at speed v ≈ c, and the CMB photons are moving at speed c in random directions. So the relative velocity between the gamma-ray and a typical CMB photon would be about c.

Wait, but the cross-section for the process depends on the energies of both photons. So the cross-section σ is a function of E1 and E2.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about approximate expressions. I remember that the interaction length for a high-energy photon with the CMB is given by something like L ≈ (m_e c^2)^2 / (n σ E1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the interaction probability. The probability P that a gamma-ray of energy E1 will interact with a CMB photon (E2) is P ≈ n σ v, where σ is the cross-section.

But the cross-section for the process γγ → e+ e- is given by the formula:

σ = (8 π/3) (m_e^4 c^6) / (s) [where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy].

Wait, but s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are massless, E = |p| c. So p1 is E1/(c), and p2 is E2/(c). So if the photons are moving in opposite directions, p1 and p2 are in opposite directions, so p1 c + p2 c = (E1/(c) * c) + (-E2/(c) * c) ) = E1 - E2 if they're moving opposite.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact expression. So let's think about the process in the center-of-mass frame. The minimum energy required is when the two photons have just enough energy to create the pair. So the condition is E1 + E2 ≥ 2 m_e c². But when E1 and E2 are much larger than m_e c², this condition is satisfied.

Wait, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, because E2 is the CMB photon, which is 1e-3 eV. So E1 would have to be about 2m_e c² - E2, but that's not relevant because E2 is negligible compared to E1.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The process is called the photon-photon interaction, and the cross-section increases as the photon energies increase. The cross-section for pair production is given by σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^4 c^6) / (E1 E2) [ (1 - (E1/E2))² + ... ]. But when E1 ≫ E2, this simplifies.

Wait, when E1 is much larger than E2, which is the case here since E2 is 1e-3 eV and E1 is in GeV range, so E1 >> E2. So, in this limit, the cross-section can be approximated as σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2) * (something?).

Wait, let me check: the cross-section for pair production when E1 ≫ E2 is approximately σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2). So that's σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E1 E2).

Then, the interaction probability per unit length is P ≈ n σ v, where n is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity between the gamma-ray and the photon. But since both are moving at speed c, and the CMB is isotropic, the relative velocity is about c. So v ≈ c.

Wait, but the number density n of CMB photons is about 1e8 per cubic meter? Wait, let me think: the CMB has a photon density of about 411 photons/cm³, which is 411e6 photons/m³. So n = 411e6 m^-3.

Now, let's put it all together. The lifetime τ (or mean lifetime) of the gamma-ray would be τ ≈ 1/(n σ v).

But wait, the lifetime is the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate Γ is given by Γ = n σ v, so τ = 1/Γ ≈ 1/(n σ v).

So, substituting in the values:

σ ≈ (8π/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E1 E2)

v ≈ c

n = 411e6 m^-3

E2 = 1e-3 eV

m_e c^2 = 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV.

So let's compute σ:

σ = (8π/3) * ( (5.11e5 eV)^2 c^4 ) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

Wait, but units are a bit messy here. Let me make sure all terms are in compatible units.

Wait, let's write everything in eV and meters, seconds.

But perhaps it's easier to compute in natural units where c=1, and then convert back.

Wait, maybe I can proceed step by step.

Compute σ:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / (E1 E2 )

Let me compute (m_e c^2)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 eV² = approx 2.61e11 eV².

E1 is the gamma energy in eV, E2 = 1e-3 eV.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e11) / (E1 * 1e-3 ) eV

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14) / E1 eV^{-1} ?

Wait, wait, let me be precise.

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (m_e c^2)^2 / (E1 E2 )

= (8π/3) * (5.11e5 eV)^2 / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e11 / 1e-3) eV / E1

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14) eV / E1

So, σ ≈ (8π/3 * 2.61e14) / E1 eV^{-1}.

Now, the interaction rate Γ is n σ v.

n = 411e6 m^-3.

v ≈ c, which is ~3e8 m/s.

So,

Γ = n σ v

= 411e6 m^-3 * [ (8π/3 * 2.61e14 eV) / E1 ] * 3e8 m/s.

Wait, but units don't match. Let me think about the units.

Wait a second, I'm mixing eV and meters. Let's handle units appropriately. Let me express everything in terms of eV and seconds.

Wait, Planck's constant h is about 4.1357e-15 eV·s.

So, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. But maybe using eV and s is better.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the rate in Hz (per second) and then find the lifetime.

So, Γ (Hz) = n σ v / (speed factor) ?

Hmm, maybe another approach is better. Let me compute the cross-section in cm².

Because natural units can be tricky here.

Wait, cross-section σ has units of cm².

1 barn is 1e-24 cm². Common cross-sections are on the order of 1e-26 to 1e-28 cm².

So, let's compute σ in cm².

First, compute (m_e c^2)^2 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 ≈ 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

E1 is in eV, E2 = 1e-3 eV.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV) )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14 eV) / E1.

Hmm, but I need σ in cm².

Wait, we can relate eV to ergs: 1 eV = 1.602e-12 erg.

And 1 erg = 1 g cm²/s².

So, 1 eV = 1.602e-12 g cm²/s².

Then, the cross-section σ has units of cm².

So each eV in the numerator would contribute (g cm²/s²), but I'm getting lost in units here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relation between eV and inverse meters. Because 1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of 12400 / (1 eV) Angstroms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between eV and cm^-1.

1 eV = 8.0e13 cm^-1 (since hc ≈ 12400 eV·Å = 12400 eV * 1e-8 cm = 1.24e-4 eV cm, so 1 eV = 1/(1.24e-4 cm) ≈ 8.06e3 cm^-1). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, hc = 12400 eV·Å = 12400 eV * 1e-10 m = 12400 eV * 1e-8 cm = 1.24e-4 eV cm.

So, 1 eV = (hc)^-1 → 1 eV = 1/(1.24e-4 cm) ≈ 8065.5 cm^-1.

So, 1 eV = 8.0655e3 cm^-1.

So, 1 eV / cm = 8.0655e3 cm^-2.

Wait, maybe using this can help.

So, σ has units of cm².

From the formula,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14 eV) / E1.

But to express this in cm², we can write each eV as 8.0655e3 cm^-1.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e14 * (8.0655e3 cm^-1)) / E1.

Wait, because each eV is 8.0655e3 cm^-1, so 1 eV = 8.0655e3 cm^-1.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e14) * (8.0655e3 cm^-1 ) ) / E1.

Wait, but E1 is in eV, so each eV in the denominator becomes 8.0655e3 cm^-1.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e14 eV) * (8.0655e3 cm^-1 / eV ) ) / E1.

Because 1 eV = 8.0655e3 cm^-1, so 1 cm^-1 = 1/(8.0655e3) eV.

Wait, perhaps I should express E1 in terms of cm^-1.

E1 (eV) = E1_cm^{-1} * (8.0655e3 cm^-1 / eV )

So, E1 in cm^-1 is E1_eV * 8.0655e3.

So,

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1_eV * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14 eV) / E1_eV.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's compute the cross-section numerically.

Compute the numerator first:

(8π/3) ≈ 8.37758.

(8.37758) * (2.61e14 eV) ≈ 2.19e15 eV.

So σ ≈ (2.19e15 eV) / E1 / (1e-3 eV) )

Wait, no, the denominator is E1 * 1e-3 eV, so 2.19e15 eV / (E1 * 1e-3 eV ) ) → 2.19e15 / (E1 * 1e-3 ) [eV / eV] → 2.19e18 / E1.

Wait, but this is in (eV)^-1, but we need cm².

Hmm, perhaps I should find a way to express σ in cm².

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the cross-section in terms of eV and then convert into cm² using the relation between eV and cm^-1.

Wait, 1 barn is 1e-24 cm².

So, perhaps I should compute the cross-section in barns.

But I'm getting stuck on the unit conversion here. Maybe I can proceed with the numerical calculation without units first.

So, let me compute the cross-section σ:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / (E1 E2 )

= (8π/3) * (5.11e5 eV)^2 / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e11 eV²) / (E1 * 1e-3 eV )

= (8π/3) * (2.61e14 eV) / E1.

So,

σ = (8π/3 * 2.61e14) / E1 eV^{-1}.

Now, n is 411e6 m^-3.

But 1 m^-3 = (1e2 cm)^-3 = 1e-6 cm^-3.

Wait, no, 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m^-3 = (100 cm)^-3 = 1e-6 cm^-3. So, 411e6 m^-3 = 411e6 * 1e-6 cm^-3 = 411 cm^-3.

So, n = 411 cm^-3.

v = c ≈ 3e10 cm/s.

Now, the interaction rate Γ is n σ v.

But σ is in cm², so:

Γ = n [cm^-3] * σ [cm²] * v [cm/s] → units are 1/s, which is Hz.

So,

Γ = 411 * σ * 3e10.

But σ is (8π/3 * 2.61e14 eV) / (E1 eV) → so σ = (8π/3 * 2.61e14) / E1 * (cm² per eV) ?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think about the units.

Wait, when I have σ in terms of eV, I need to convert it into cm². So, each eV in the denominator corresponds to 8.0655e3 cm^-1.

So, σ = (8π/3 * 2.61e14 eV) / E1.

But 1 eV = 8.0655e3 cm^-1, so 1/cm → 8.0655e3 eV.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section in cm² is:

σ = [ (8π/3 * 2.61e14 eV) / E1 ] * (1 cm² / (8.0655e3 eV)) )

Wait, because 1 eV corresponds to 8.0655e3 cm^-1, so 1 cm^-1 is 1/(8.0655e3) eV.

Thus, 1 cm² = (8.0655e3 cm^-1)^{-2} (eV)^2.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe a better approach is to use the formula with all quantities in SI units.

Alternative approach: Use natural units where c=1, but then convert back.

Alternatively, use the formula for the photon-photon cross-section in terms of eV and meters.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated for the time I have. Let's think of the problem another way.

The key point is that the process γγ → e+ e- is only significant when the product of the two photon energies is around (m_e c²)^2. So,

E1 * E2 ≈ (m_e c²)^2.

But wait, in the previous calculation, I think that was the threshold condition. So,

E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2 → E1 = (m_e c²)^2 / E2.

E2 is 1e-3 eV, so E1 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) ) = (2.61e11 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) ) = 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e5 GeV.

Wait, 2.6e5 GeV is option C. But wait, earlier I thought when E1 >> E2, the cross-section is proportional to 1/(E1 E2), so maybe I'm missing a factor. Because when E1 is much greater than E2, the threshold condition might not directly apply.

But according to this calculation, E1 would be approximately 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C: 2.6e5 GeV.

But wait, in the previous step, when I thought about the condition E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2, I got E1 = 2.6e14 eV = 2.6e5 GeV. So that would be option C.

But wait, in the initial calculation, when I considered the interaction rate, I ended up with a much higher energy (around 1.3e5 GeV), but that was when I used the cross-section formula. But perhaps I made a mistake in the cross-section.

Wait, perhaps the correct threshold condition is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 4. Because when the photons are moving in the same direction, the minimum energy is higher. But if they're moving in opposite directions, the required energy is lower.

Since the CMB photons are isotropic, the average would involve considering both scenarios. But for a gamma-ray traveling through the CMB, the most probable direction for a CMB photon would be opposite to the gamma-ray's direction, maximizing the energy available for pair production.

So, perhaps the correct threshold is E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 4. So,

E1 = (m_e c²)^2 / (4 * E2).

So,

E1 = (5.11e5 eV)^2 / (4 * 1e-3 eV) ) = (2.61e11 eV²) / (4e-3 eV) ) = 6.525e13 eV = 6.525e5 GeV.

But that's even higher than before. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use E1 = (m_e c²)^2 / (2 * E2).

So,

E1 = (2.61e11 eV²) / (2e-3 eV) ) = 1.305e14 eV = 1.305e5 GeV.

Which is 1.3e5 GeV, which is close to option B (1.8e5 GeV) or option C (2.6e5 GeV).

But this is getting confusing. Another approach: perhaps the energy is around 1e5 GeV. So looking at the options, the closest higher value is option B or C.

Wait, but the initial condition I thought was correct was E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2, giving 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the annihilation process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$, we analyze the threshold condition for this interaction. The process requires the combined energy of the two photons to be sufficient to produce an electron-positron pair, with the rest mass energy of the pair being $2m_e c^2 \approx 1.022 \, \text{MeV}$. 

The threshold condition for two photons of energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ to produce an electron-positron pair is given by:

\[
E_1 \cdot E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2
\]

Here, $E_2$ is the energy of a CMB photon, which is given as $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$. The energy of the gamma-ray, $E_1$, can be solved for using the threshold condition:

\[
E_1 = \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}
\]

Substituting the values:
- $m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.11 \times 10^5 \, \text{eV}$,
- $E_2 = 10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$,

we calculate:

\[
E_1 = \frac{(5.11 \times 10^5)^2}{10^{-3}} = \frac{2.61 \times 10^{11}}{10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
\]

Converting to GeV:
\[
E_1 = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV} = 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This matches option C, which is $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$. Therefore, the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process is approximately $2.6 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}$.

Answer: C
