Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that an organic chemist did two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II. Each reaction uses a different starting material and a different reagent. After both reactions are completed, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. We need to find out how many peaks appear in each chromatogram.

Alright, let's first break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, looking at the structure, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure would be:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexane is six carbons. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO. So it's CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, let me count:

Positions 1 to 6: 1, 2, 3 (carbonyl), 4,5,6.

So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, perhaps better to write it as:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3? Or maybe I should think of it as:

The carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. So, positions are:

1: CH3

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH3

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe it's:

(CH2)2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Not quite, because hexane is six carbons. So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's hexan-3-one. So, the carbonyl is at position 3 between two CH2 groups.

But wait, the compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the 5 position is a methoxy group. So replacing the hydrogen on carbon 5 with OCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, carbon 3 is the carbonyl, so carbon 4 is adjacent. Let me number it:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no. Let me number from the ketone. Hexan-3-one is:

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, 3 is the carbonyl. So adjacent to 3 are carbons 2 and 4.

So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I should write it as:

1: CH3

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)

6: CH3

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is:

(CH3)CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that would be longer.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe a better way is to think of the position. Hexan-3-one is:

(CH2)2CO. So, the molecule is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's:

The positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, position 3 is the carbonyl. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? That doesn't make sense because that's seven carbons. Wait, no, hexane is six carbons. So, the structure would be:

Positions 1 and 6 are the ends. So, position 3 is the carbonyl.

So, 1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH3

But wait, the compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So on carbon 5, which is next to the carbonyl, there's a methoxy group.

So, the structure becomes:

Positions 1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

So, the structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So, when we treat this with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent. LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH-OH.

So, the product after LAH would be:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

But wait, wait, the starting material is a ketone at position 3, so the product after reduction would be a secondary alcohol at position 3.

Wait, that's right. So the product would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

But wait, also, the starting material is (S) configuration. So the reduction with LAH would preserve the configuration because LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically does not change the configuration (stereoselectively reduces), but I think LAH in this context just adds H- from the left, so it would give the same configuration. Or wait, no, LAH's mechanism involves a hydride attack from the less hindered side. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up with something else.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The reaction is:

R2C=O + LAH → R2CH(OH) + LiAl(OH)3 (as part of the byproducts).

But in this case, the starting material is a chiral center at position 5? Wait, no, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Wait, wait, the starting material has a methoxy group on carbon 5, which is adjacent to the ketone. So, carbon 5 is CH(OCH3). But when we reduce the ketone, which is at carbon 3, the carbon 5 remains as is.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So, the ketone is at carbon 3, and the methoxy is at carbon 5.

After reduction with LAH, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol, so the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone, the configuration of the adjacent chiral centers may or may not change. But in this case, when reducing the ketone, you're converting a planar carbonyl group into a chiral center. Oh wait, no. Wait, no, the starting material already has a chiral center at position 5. Because the structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. So, the carbon at position 5 is CH(OCH3) attached to two CH2 groups and one CH3. So, the structure is:

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3) connected to CH2 (from C4), CH3 (from C6?), and two other CH2 groups.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(=O)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

So, carbon 5 is CH(OCH3) attached to carbon 4 (CH2) and carbon 6 (CH3), and the other two bonds are to the oxygen (OCH3) and a hydrogen. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait a second—carbon 5 is connected to which groups?

Wait, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C(=O)-

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, so carbon 5 is attached to:

- Carbon 4 (CH2-)

- Carbon 6 (CH3)

- OCH3 (methoxy)

- And a hydrogen.

Because it's CH(OCH3), which implies it's a CH group with one H. Therefore, carbon 5 is a chiral center because it's attached to four different groups: CH2 (from C4), CH3 (from C6), OCH3, and a hydrogen. So it's a chiral center with R or S configuration. The starting material is (S) configuration.

When we reduce the ketone (C3) to an alcohol, the new structure becomes:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, so now, the molecule has two chiral centers: one at C3 (the new OH group) and the existing one at C5 (OCH3 group). But wait, the configuration at C3 depends on the reduction.

Wait, wait. When you reduce a ketone (sp² hybridized) to an alcohol (sp³), the new chiral center will have a certain configuration depending on the method of reduction. LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically causes the hydride to attack from the less hindered side. But in this case, the starting material is (S) at C5, which might affect the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but the reduction of the ketone (C3) to the alcohol (C3) would create a new chiral center. Wait, no, is that correct? Let me think again. The ketone is at C3, which is (CH2)2CO. When you reduce that, you get (CH2)2CH(OH). So, the carbon that was C3 (originally sp²) becomes sp³ with four substituents: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), the OH group, and the hydrogen.

Wait, so that makes it a chiral center. So, after reduction, C3 becomes a chiral center. But wait, the starting material was (S) configuration at C5, but the C3 is not a chiral center in the starting material. So, the configuration at C3 after reduction is determined by the reducing agent. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically results in a syn addition, but wait, no, maybe it's more about the approach of the hydride. Wait, LAH is a source of H⁻, which attacks the carbonyl carbon.

In the reduction of a ketone by LAH, the hydride attacks from the less hindered side, leading to the formation of the alcohol. The configuration (R or S) depends on where the hydride comes from. But wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer (S) at C5. How would that influence the reduction at C3?

I think that if the starting material is (S) at C5, the spatial arrangement around C5 could influence the approach of the hydride at C3. However, I'm not entirely sure if this leads to a specific configuration at C3. Alternatively, perhaps the configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction, and since the starting material is chiral, the product might be a diastereomer or perhaps a racemic mixture. But wait, no, because the reaction is done on a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration.

Wait, let me think. The starting material is (S) at C5. When you reduce the ketone at C3, you're adding a hydride to the carbonyl carbon. The approach of the hydride would depend on the structure's stereochemistry. But I'm a bit confused here. Maybe it's easier to think that the reduction of the ketone at C3 would create a new chiral center, and the configuration would be determined by the reaction conditions and the starting material's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration at C3 in the product will be R or S based on the starting material's configuration, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, maybe I should think about the mechanism. In the reduction of a ketone, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. So the position of the methoxy group at C5 may influence this.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. Let's imagine the structure. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the groups around C5 are arranged in a particular way. When the hydride attacks the C3, perhaps the approach is influenced by the substituents around C5, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is not stereoselective in this case because the carbonyl is at a distance from the chiral center. So the product could form as a racemic mixture or perhaps as a single enantiomer.

Wait, no. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically leads to the formation of the most stable (most substituted) alcohol. But in this case, the reduction is of a simple ketone, so the product's configuration would be determined by the hydride's approach. If the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product would have a certain configuration at C3 but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration at C3 doesn't matter because the product isn't chiral at C3. Wait, no, C3 after reduction would have four different substituents: two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4), one OH, and one H. So it's a chiral center. Therefore, the product would have a new chiral center at C3. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, would the product be a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture?

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to a single stereoisomer because the approach of the hydride is influenced by the existing stereochemistry at C5. But I'm not entirely clear on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product will have both the original chiral center at C5 and a new one at C3. Thus, the product would be a diastereomer, but if the reduction leads to a specific configuration, it would be a single compound. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product has two stereocenters, at C3 and C5. Since the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction is stereoselective, the product could have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single compound. So the product would have two chiral centers (C3 and C5), making it a diastereomer with a certain configuration.

Wait, but considering that the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reaction is done in such a way that the reduction creates a new chiral center.

Hmm. This is getting a bit complicated, and maybe I should proceed to Reaction II first, and then come back to this.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)CH2(CO)CH2CH3. Wait, no, pentane is five carbons. So pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups at positions 2 and 4. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would be more than five carbons. Let me count: positions 1 to 5.

So position 2 is carbonyl, position 4 is another carbonyl. So structure is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3?

Wait, but that would make it six carbons. Hmm, no, perhaps pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me write it correctly.

Pentane-2,4-dione:

Positions 1, 2,3,4,5.

Positions 2 and 4 have carbonyl groups. So, structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Ah, that makes sense. It's a five-carbon chain with ketones at C2 and C4. So, it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait. The structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So, two ketone groups at positions 2 and 4, making it a diketone.

Now, when treated with excess NaBH4. NaBH4 is a reducing agent, but it's a weaker reducing agent compared to LAH. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but it can't reduce esters or amides, for example.

So, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups. When treated with excess NaBH4, both ketones would be reduced. Each ketone would become a secondary alcohol.

So, the product would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, the structure is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, pentanediol with two secondary alcohols on C2 and C4.

So, each of the two ketone groups in the starting material becomes a CH(OH) group. Now, looking at the product, do these alcohols create any chiral centers?

Each of the C2 and C4 in the product would have four different substituents. Let's check:

At C2: connected to:

- C1 (CH3)

- C3 (CH2)

- OH group

- and another CH2 group?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure after reduction is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because each of the C2 and C4 positions in the starting material (pentane-2,4-dione) is a ketone. So, upon reduction, each becomes a CH(OH) group.

So, each of the C2 and C4 positions in the product would have:

For C2:

- Connected to C1 (CH3),

- C3 (CH2),

- OH,

- and another CH2? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, the structure after reduction is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, each of the C2 and C4 positions is a CH(OH) group. Now, looking at C2: the groups are CH3, CH(OH), CH2, and what else?

Wait, no, the structure is:

C1: CH3

C2: CH(OH)

C3: CH2

C4: CH(OH)

C5: CH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The starting molecule is:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3 → No, wait, no. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? That would be six carbons. Oh, wait, no, pentane is five carbons. So, the correct structure is:

CH2(CO)CH2CH2CO. Wait, no. The correct structure for pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. No, that's six carbons. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to write the correct structure.

Pentane-2,4-dione has five carbons in total. So, the positions are:

1: CH3

2: C=O

3: CH2

4: C=O

5: CH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the molecule is symmetrical, with two ketone groups at positions 2 and 4.

When reduced with NaBH4, each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So, the product is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Now, each of the C2 and C4 positions (now C2 and C4) have the structure CH(OH). Let's check if these are chiral centers.

At C2:

- Connected to C1 (CH3),

- C3 (CH2),

- OH,

- and another CH2 group (since it's CH(OH)CH2...).

Wait, no. Let me see. The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, each of the central CH(OH) groups (C2 and C4) are connected like this:

For C2:

- Two CH2 groups: one on each side (C1 is CH3, which is connected via a single bond, and C3 is CH2, which is connected via a single bond, or wait, no.

Wait, the molecule is symmetrical. So, for C2 (and similarly for C4), the substituents are:

- One CH3 (from C1),

- One CH2 (from C3),

- One OH,

- And one CH2 group from the same chain.

Wait, but in the product, each C2 and C4 is CH(OH) connected to two CH2 groups, a CH3, and an OH. So, are these chiral centers?

Each of the C2 and C4 in the product will have four different groups attached? Let's see.

For C2:

- One CH3 group (from C1),

- One OH group,

- Two CH2 groups (from C3 and perhaps from the other side?), no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the structure after reduction is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, each of the OH-bearing carbons (C2 and C4) is attached to:

- C1: CH3,

- C3: CH2,

- C5: CH3 (for C4),

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong again. Let me number the carbons:

1: CH3-

2: C(OH)H-

3: CH2-

4: C(OH)H-

5: CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct because the original structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

After reduction, it's CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So, each of the C2 and C4 in the product has:

For C2:

- Connected to C1 (CH3),

- C3 (CH2),

- OH,

- and another CH2 group (since C2 is connected to C3 and C1 and has an OH and a H? Wait, no. Wait, each C2 and C4 in the product is CH(OH) attached to two CH2 groups and an OH and a H?

Wait, no, the structure is:

At C2: CH(OH) is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and another group. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

At C2: groups are CH3, CH2 (to C3), OH, and H?

No, because CH(OH) implies that the carbon has an OH, a CH3 (from C1), a CH2 (from C3), and a hydrogen. So, four substituents: CH3, CH2, OH, and H. Therefore, the C2 and C4 each have four different substituents, making them chiral centers.

But wait, for C2:

Groups attached are:

- CH3 (from C1),

- CH2 (from C3),

- OH,

- H.

So, yes, four different groups: so each is a chiral center. However, since the starting material is symmetrical (2 and 4 are mirror images), the reduction could lead to a meso compound.

Wait, because the original molecule is symmetrical. So, when both ketones are reduced, each is converted to a secondary alcohol. Because the molecule is symmetrical, the product would have two chiral centers but in a meso form. So, the product would be a meso compound, meaning it has two stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

So, the product would be meso-2,4-pentanediol. That means it has two stereocenters but is not chiral because of the internal plane of symmetry. So, the product is a single compound, not a mixture of enantiomers.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think: the molecule would have two OH groups on C2 and C4. If each of those is a chiral center, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center, then the two stereocenters would be mirror images of each other, making the molecule achiral (meso).

So, the product from Reaction II is a single compound, meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Now, going back to Reaction I. The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers: one at C3 (new) and the existing one at C5 (original S configuration).

Wait, earlier I thought the product would have two chiral centers. So, the product from Reaction I is a molecule with two chiral centers. But how many stereoisomers could that produce?

Each chiral center can be R or S, but because they're in the same molecule, the total number depends on whether the centers are independent or related.

Wait, but the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction creates a new chiral center at C3. So, the product after Reaction I would have two chiral centers, but depending on their configurations, there could be multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, but the initial starting material is a single enantiomer. So, when you reduce it, would the product have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single stereoisomer, or would it form a mixture?

Hmm, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer because the reaction is stereoselective. Wait, the reaction's stereoselectivity would depend on the approach of the hydride. But maybe in this case, due to the existing chiral center at C5, the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, but that doesn't seem right because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again. The starting material is (S) at C5. When the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, a new chiral center forms at C3. The configuration at C3 will depend on the approach of the hydride. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product's configuration at C3 might be influenced by the existing stereochemistry, leading to a single diastereomer.

Therefore, the product from Reaction I would have two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer with a specific configuration. But how many stereoisomers are possible?

But wait, wait. The product from Reaction I would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. The original configuration at C5 is S, and the new configuration at C3 depends on the reaction. So, how many possible stereoisomers does this create?

Well, in general, two chiral centers can produce up to four stereoisomers (2^2 = 4), but if the molecule has any symmetry, the number may be less.

In this case, the molecule after Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The two chiral centers are at C3 and C5.

So, possible configurations at C3: R or S.

At C5: S (original).

So, the product could be either R at C3 and S at C5, or S at C3 and S at C5.

But wait, wait. Wait, no. The starting material was (S) at C5. Upon reduction, the configuration at C5 remains the same because we're only modifying the C3 group. So, the configuration at C5 remains S.

The new chiral center at C3 could be R or S, depending on the reaction's stereoselectivity.

But wait, if the starting material is (S) at C5, does that influence the configuration at C3 after reduction? That is, would the product form a specific enantiomer at C3 due to the existing stereochemistry, or would it form a racemic mixture?

I think that the reaction is stereoselective, leading to a specific configuration at C3. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be a single stereoisomer, with specific configurations at both C3 and C5.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, but that would produce two stereoisomers. But considering that the starting material is a single enantiomer, that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3. Let me think about the mechanism. The hydride (from LAH) attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. The existing stereochemistry at C5 might influence which side is more hindered.

If the starting material is (S) at C5, that would arrange the substituents around C5 in a certain way. The approach of the hydride to C3 might be influenced by that arrangement, leading to a specific configuration at C3.

But I'm not exactly sure. However, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, with specific configurations at C3 and C5.

Now, moving on. After both reactions, the products are combined. Then run on HPLC columns.

So, the products from Reaction I and Reaction II are:

Reaction I: (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with specific configurations at C3 and C5).

Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol.

So, how many compounds are we dealing with?

From Reaction I: one compound (since it's a single stereoisomer, assuming the product is a single diastereomer).

From Reaction II: one compound (the meso compound).

So, in total, two compounds would be present when the products are combined.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Reaction I: the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with two chiral centers. So, if the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reaction leads to a specific configuration at C3, then the product would be a single stereoisomer.

Reaction II: produces a single meso compound, as discussed.

Thus, the combined products would be two compounds: one from Reaction I, one from Reaction II.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, no, because the products are combined. So, the total number of compounds is two: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single stereoisomer) and 2,4-pentanediol (meso compound, single compound).

But wait, let me think about the actual products.

Wait, Reaction I produces 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with two chiral centers. But is this molecule chiral? Because if the two chiral centers are not related by a plane of symmetry, then the molecule would be chiral and could have multiple stereoisomers.

But since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at C3 and C5, making it a single stereoisomer.

So, for Reaction I: one compound.

Reaction II: one compound.

Combined, two compounds.

Then, when run on HPLC columns.

But wait, the question says the products are combined and run on both a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral stationary phase HPLC.

So, what would each type of HPLC do?

Normal-phase HPLC is based on the interaction between the stationary phase (usually polar, like silica) and the analytes. It separates molecules based on their polarity. So, in normal-phase HPLC, each compound would elute based on their polarity. Each distinct compound would give a separate peak.

On the other hand, a chiral stationary phase HPLC is used to separate enantiomers. If the analytes are chiral, each enantiomer would elute at a different time. But if the analytes are not chiral, they would not separate, and only one peak would appear.

So, how many chiral compounds are in the mixture?

Looking at the two products:

1. Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This compound has two chiral centers. If the molecule isn't a meso compound, it would be chiral and have multiple stereoisomers. But since the product is a single stereoisomer (from the (S) starting material), this molecule is chiral and would be a single enantiomer. Wait, but wait. No, it's a diastereomer, not an enantiomer. Hmm.

Wait, the molecule has two chiral centers. If it's not a meso compound, then it would have four stereoisomers in theory. But in our case, it's a single stereoisomer, so it's chiral and would show up as one peak in a chiral HPLC. No, wait, the chiral HPLC would separate enantiomers. But this molecule is a single diastereomer, so in a chiral HPLC, if it's not a meso compound, it would have multiple peaks only if it's a pair of enantiomers. But in our case, it's a single diastereomer, so it would elute as a single peak.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Chiral HPLC columns are used to separate enantiomers. If a compound is not chiral, it won't separate on a chiral column. So, if the molecule from Reaction I is chiral (has no plane of symmetry), then it would have enantiomers. But in our case, the product is a single stereoisomer, so it's a single enantiomer. So, on a chiral column, it would appear as a single peak.

The second product from Reaction II is a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral because they have an internal plane of symmetry. So, on a chiral HPLC column, since it's achiral, it would elute as a single peak.

So, in the chiral HPLC, how many peaks would we see? Let's see:

- Product from Reaction I: chiral, so one peak.

- Product from Reaction II: achiral, so one peak.

So, total of two peaks on the chiral HPLC.

Wait, but wait. Reaction I's product: is it chiral? Let's think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

The structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with chiral centers at C3 and C5. Are these centers symmetrical in any way? Let's imagine the structure.

The molecule is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, it's:

(CH3)CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, the positions are 3 and 5. So, the structure is:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CH(OH)-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

So, the molecule has two chiral centers at C3 and C5. Are these centers symmetrical? Let's think. C3 has groups: CH2 (C2), CH(OH), CH2 (C4), and H. C5 has groups: CH2 (C4), CH(OCH3), CH3 (C6), and H.

So, no, the two chiral centers are not symmetrical. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. So, it's chiral and would have enantiomers. But the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer (specific configuration at C3 and C5), so it's a single enantiomer. Therefore, on a chiral column, it would appear as one peak.

The second product from Reaction II is a meso compound, which is achiral, so it would appear as one peak on the chiral column.

So, the chiral HPLC would show two peaks.

On the normal-phase HPLC, which is based on polarity, each distinct compound would give a separate peak. So, since we have two distinct compounds (one from each reaction), the normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks.

Wait, but wait. Reaction I's product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Reaction II's product: 2,4-pentanediol (meso). Are these two compounds structurally similar enough that they might have similar polarities? Probably not, as their structures are quite different. So, each would elute at a different time, leading to two peaks.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group, which is an electron-donating group. 2,4-pentanediol is a diol with two secondary alcohols. Both are somewhat polar, but their structures are different enough that they would have different retention times on a normal-phase HPLC, leading to two separate peaks.

So, in the normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: two peaks.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

So, according to my analysis, the chiral HPLC would have two peaks (one for each compound), and the normal-phase HPLC would have two peaks as well.

But wait, none of the options match this. The options have either 2 or 3 or 4 peaks. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers. No, I thought the product is a single stereoisomer because the starting material was a single enantiomer and the reaction is stereoselective. So, it's a single diastereomer, which is chiral, so on a chiral column, it's one peak.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, so it's one peak on the chiral column.

So, two peaks in total on the chiral column.

But on the normal-phase column, each of the two compounds would elute as a single peak. So, two peaks.

So, the chromatograms would show two peaks on both columns. But none of the options have two peaks in both. The options are either 3, 4, etc.

Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one stereoisomer. Let me think again about Reaction I.

The product from Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. After reduction, does this molecule have any possibility of forming more than one stereoisomer?

The starting material is (S) at C5. When the ketone is reduced, the new chiral center (C3) could form either R or S, depending on the approach of the hydride.

But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the reaction is stereoselective, leading to a specific configuration at C3. So, only one product is formed, making it a single stereoisomer.

But perhaps the product is a racemic mixture. No, LAH typically gives high yields of the desired product with good stereocontrol. So, probably, the product is a single stereoisomer.

So, Reaction I: one compound.

Reaction II: one compound.

So, combined, two compounds.

Thus, on both HPLC columns, two peaks. But none of the options have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction I.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers. But that would require the product to be a racemic mixture, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product from Reaction I has a different number of stereocenters. Let me think again.

Original starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol, introducing a new chiral center at C3. So, the product now has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

But wait, C5 was originally a chiral center (S), and the reduction doesn't affect it. So, the product has two chiral centers. So, the product could be a diastereomer, but whether it's a single stereoisomer or a pair of enantiomers depends on the reaction's selectivity.

In this case, the product would be a single stereoisomer because the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reaction is stereoselective. Thus, the product is a single diastereomer, making it a chiral molecule. So, on a chiral HPLC, it would show as one peak.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound (one peak on chiral HPLC).

So, chiral HPLC: two peaks.

Normal-phase HPLC: each product is a different compound, so two peaks.

Hmm. But the options don't have two peaks in both. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces more than one product. Let me re-examine.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH, which reduces the ketone to an alcohol. So, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. If the reaction is 100% efficient, only one product is formed.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4. The product is 2,4-pentanediol (meso compound), which is a single product.

So, two compounds in total.

But wait, perhaps the reaction conditions cause some side reactions. For example, perhaps some elimination occurs in Reaction I, leading to more than one product. But the question states that the reactions are 100% completed, so I think we can assume they proceed as planned.

Another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two stereoisomers, but I thought the product was a single stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereoisomers. Let's think again.

If a molecule has two chiral centers and is not a meso compound, it can have up to four stereoisomers. But in our case, the starting material is a single stereoisomer, so the product would have a specific configuration at C3 and C5, leading to a single stereoisomer. So, it's a single molecule, hence one peak in both HPLCs.

Wait, but perhaps in Reaction I, the product is a racemic mixture. But that would require the reaction to have no stereochemical control, which is unlikely with LAH.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound. Let me think: If the product has two chiral centers and is a meso compound, then it would be achiral. But in our case, would the product be a meso compound?

The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's see if it has a plane of symmetry. The structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Looking for a plane of symmetry through the center. The groups on either side of the plane would need to mirror each other.

But the groups on either side are not symmetrical. For example, the C3 and C5 are different: C3 has an OH, and C5 has a methoxy group. So, the molecule isn't symmetrical, hence not a meso compound. Therefore, it's chiral and would show up as a single peak on a chiral HPLC.

So, the two products (from Reaction I and II) are two distinct compounds, chiral and achiral respectively. Thus, on the chiral HPLC, two peaks; on the normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

But looking back at the options, none of them have two peaks in both. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II's product is a pair of enantiomers. No, no, Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral, so it would be a single peak on both HPLCs.

Wait, but the options don't have two peaks on both columns. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the products.

Wait, another possibility: Reaction II's product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So, even though the product has two chiral centers, it's achiral and would elute as a single peak on both HPLC columns.

Reaction I's product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is chiral and a single stereoisomer, so one peak on chiral HPLC and one on normal-phase.

Thus, the combined products give two peaks on each column. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products. Let's think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → treated with LAH → product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with two chiral centers. If this product is a single stereoisomer, then one peak on chiral HPLC and one on normal-phase.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → product is meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is a single compound. So, one peak on both HPLCs.

So, in total, two peaks on both columns.

But the options don't include two peaks in both. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product is a mixture of diastereomers. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereoselective, so I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but that would require the reaction to have no stereocontrol, which isn't the case here.

Another angle: perhaps the two products from the reactions are the same compound, but that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol could have multiple stereoisomers. Let me think: if the molecule is not a meso compound, it would have four stereoisomers. But since only one is formed, it would appear as one peak on the chiral HPLC.

Wait, but in that case, the chiral HPLC would show one peak for Reaction I's product and one for Reaction II's product, totaling two.

But according to the options, the closest is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase. Or option D: 3 in both.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Reaction I produces two different compounds. For example, perhaps the reduction leads to more than one product.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction is a straightforward reduction. So, it's unlikely to produce more than one product.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diol, but no, it's only a secondary alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the reaction conditions cause some rearrangement. But the question states that the reactions are 100% completed, so probably not.

Another possibility: maybe I miscalculated the number of peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.

In normal-phase HPLC, each compound is separated based on polarity. So, the two products would each have a distinct polarity, leading to two peaks. But what if the two products are isomers that have similar polarities? Unlikely, but possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are enantiomers and have the same polarity, so they would co-elute. But that's only if the column is achiral. Wait, no, in normal-phase HPLC, enantiomers typically elute at the same time because the stationary phase doesn't distinguish them. So, if two compounds are enantiomers, they would be a single peak on normal-phase HPLC. But our two products are different compounds, so they would have different polarities and elute separately.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the analysis.

Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single stereoisomer).

Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol (single compound).

So, two compounds, each with a distinct structure.

Therefore, on normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: Reaction I's product is chiral (two chiral centers, not meso), so it would be a single enantiomer → one peak.

Reaction II's product is achiral → one peak.

Total: two peaks on both columns.

But this isn't an option. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, meaning the reaction produces a racemic mixture. So, two enantiomers, which would appear as a single peak on normal-phase HPLC but two peaks on chiral HPLC.

But the starting material was a single enantiomer, so the product would be a single stereoisomer, not a racemic mixture.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound. Let me see.

In 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, if the two chiral centers are arranged symmetrically, it would be a meso compound, making it achiral.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Is there a plane of symmetry here? Let's imagine a mirror plane through the center of the molecule.

Looking at C3 and C5, they're not mirror images because C3 has OH and C5 has OCH3. So, no symmetry. Hence, it's not a meso compound. Therefore, it's chiral.

So, on a chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak (since it's a single enantiomer), and on normal-phase, a single peak.

Reaction II's product is meso, so also a single peak on both.

Thus, two peaks on both columns. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the products are actually more than two. Let me think.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduces to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's one compound.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → reduces to 2,4-pentanediol (meso), one compound.

Thus, two compounds in total.

Wait, but perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two stereoisomers. But I thought the product is a single stereoisomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. But that would require the reaction to produce a racemic mixture, which it doesn't.

Hmm. I'm stuck because according to my analysis, the correct answer isn't among the options. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers. Wait, no, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so it can't form a racemic mixture.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces two diastereomers.

No, if the product has two chiral centers, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at both centers, making it a single stereoisomer.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound. Let me think again.

If the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, then it would be achiral, giving one peak on both HPLC columns.

But in this case, the starting material is (S) at C5, and the product has chiral centers at C3 and C5. If the product is a meso compound, then the configurations at C3 and C5 would make it achiral.

Wait, can that happen?

Let me imagine the structure:

If the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, and the configurations at C3 and C5 are such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

For example, if C3 is R and C5 is S, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

But in this case, the starting material was (S) at C5. The product's configuration at C3 would depend on the reaction.

But if the product's configuration at C3 is R, and C5 remains S, then the molecule would have two chiral centers (C3: R, C5: S), making it a diastereomer, not a meso compound.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a meso compound, but I can't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound if C3 and C5 have opposite configurations, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture. But that would require the reaction to have no stereocontrol, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has four stereoisomers possible, but the reaction produces two of them. So, leading to two peaks on the chiral HPLC.

But that would require the reaction to form a diastereomeric mixture, which I don't think is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound, and the product from Reaction II is a pair of enantiomers. But no, Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction II is a pair of enantiomers. No, because it's a meso compound, which is achiral.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 5 and 4

B) 3 and 2

C) 4 and 2

D) 3 and 3

From my analysis, I would expect two peaks on both columns, but that's not an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the number of products.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Reaction II's product is a mixture of two diastereomers. But no, Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is a single structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction products are not what I thought.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

So, two compounds.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, but that would mean the reaction produced a racemic mixture, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound, and the product from Reaction II is a pair of enantiomers.

But no, Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is a single compound.

So, I'm back to two peaks on both columns. Since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products. Let me think again.

Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. How many stereoisomers does this have?

It has two chiral centers, so 2^2 =4 possible stereoisomers. But the product is a single stereoisomer, so only one is formed.

Reaction II: meso-2,4-pentanediol (one stereoisomer).

So, two compounds in total.

Thus, the normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks.

The chiral HPLC would show two peaks: one for the chiral compound and one for the achiral.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral, 2 in normal-phase. But I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, giving two peaks on the chiral column and one on the normal-phase.

Wait, but that would require the product to be a racemic mixture, which it isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is not chiral, but I don't think that's the case.

I'm stuck. Based on my analysis, the correct answer isn't among the options. But since I have to choose, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the number of stereoisomers in Reaction I's product.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, which would be achiral, giving one peak on both columns.

If the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, then:

Reaction I: one peak on both columns.

Reaction II: one peak on both.

Total: two peaks on both columns.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction II's product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso). So, one compound.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction II is not meso. Let me think again.

The structure after reduction is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Are the two chiral centers (C2 and C4) symmetrical?

Yes, because the molecule is symmetrical along the central axis. So, C2 and C4 are mirror images of each other. Thus, the molecule is meso, and hence achiral. So, one peak on both HPLCs.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a match. Perhaps the correct answer is B: 3 and 2.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the products from Reaction I and II are more than two.

Wait, perhaps in Reaction I, the product is a diastereomer with more than one stereoisomer. But I thought it was a single stereoisomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces more than one product. For example, LAH could cause elimination in addition to reduction, but the question states that the reactions are 100% completed, so I think they're purely reductions.

Another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a meso compound. Let me imagine that.

If the product from Reaction I is a meso compound, then it would be achiral, giving one peak on both columns.

Thus, Reaction I: one peak on both.

Reaction II: one peak on both.

Total: two peaks on both.

But again, no option matches.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on my analysis, the correct answer should be two peaks on both columns. However, since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, but I don't see why that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers because the reduction leads to a new chiral center without any stereoselectivity. But LAH is typically stereoselective.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I'll have to go with the assumption that the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks on the chiral HPLC and one on the normal-phase. Reaction II's product is a meso compound (one peak on both). So, total peaks:

Chiral: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (Reaction II) = 3.

Normal-phase: 1 (Reaction I) + 1 (Reaction II) = 2.

So, option B: 3 and 2.

But why would Reaction I's product be a racemic mixture? Because the reaction is not stereoselective. But LAH is stereoselective, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, leading to two peaks on a chiral column. But no, I'm not sure.

Hmm. I think I've spent enough time, and the most plausible answer based on my analysis is that there are two peaks on both columns. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase and chiral HPLC chromatograms after combining the products.

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagents**: LAH (a strong reducing agent) followed by acidic workup.
- **Reaction**: LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, forming 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This introduces a new chiral center at C3, in addition to the existing chiral center at C5 in the starting material. The product is a single stereoisomer due to the stereoselective nature of LAH.
- **Product**: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, a chiral compound with two chiral centers (C3 and C5).

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione.
- **Reagents**: NaBH4 (a reducing agent) followed by acidic workup.
- **Reaction**: NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to secondary alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

### Combined Products:
- **Reaction I**: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral, single stereoisomer).
- **Reaction II**: 2,4-pentanediol (meso compound, achiral).

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Separates compounds based on polarity.
   - 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol are structurally distinct and have different polarities.
   - **Expected Peaks**: 2 peaks.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Separates enantiomers. A meso compound (achiral) does not separate, while a chiral compound with a single stereoisomer does.
   - 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is chiral and appears as 1 peak.
   - 2,4-pentanediol is achiral and appears as 1 peak.
   - **Expected Peaks**: 2 peaks.

### Conclusion:
The analysis predicts 2 peaks in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC. However, none of the provided options match this result. Based on the reasoning, the closest plausible answer is **Option B**, where 3 peaks are observed in the chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in the normal-phase HPLC. This discrepancy may arise from an assumption that the product from Reaction I could form additional stereoisomers, leading to more peaks.

**Answer: B**
