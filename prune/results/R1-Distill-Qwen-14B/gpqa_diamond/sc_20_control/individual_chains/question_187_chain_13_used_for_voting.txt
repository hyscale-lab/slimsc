Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT. It's designed for things like radial velocity measurements, right? The question is about detecting stars based on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel in one hour.

The key here is figuring out the S/N for each star. I think the S/N depends on the star's brightness, which is determined by its magnitude. The formula for S/N involves the star's flux, exposure time, and the instrument's capabilities.

Wait, I remember that the signal is proportional to the square root of the exposure time. So if the exposure is one hour, that's the time we're considering. Also, the noise is related to the background and the readout, but maybe for this question, we can consider that the noise is lower for brighter stars.

Let me recall the formula. I think the S/N ratio is given by S/N = (F * t^0.5) / sqrt(R), where F is the flux, t is time, and R is the noise. Or maybe it's more about the star's magnitude and how it affects flux.

Magnitude scales are a bit tricky. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star is at a standard distance (10 parsecs). So if a star is farther away, its apparent magnitude increases (gets dimmer). The formula to convert absolute magnitude (M) to apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5, where d is distance in parsecs.

So for each star, I can calculate their apparent V magnitude. Once I have that, I can figure out their brightness relative to a reference, like a zero-point magnitude for the instrument.

Wait, I need to know what the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity is. Oh right, I think ESPRESSO has a certain limit magnitude, which is the faintest star it can detect. Or perhaps it's based on the S/N.

The question gives each star's absolute magnitude as 15, except for Canopus and Polaris. Wait, what about those two? Canopus is a bright star, I think. Polaris is also bright, around magnitude 2 or so in V. The other stars are absolute magnitude 15, but at different distances.

Wait, absolute magnitude is M. So for each star, the apparent magnitude m can be calculated using m = M + 5 log10(d/10). Because M is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc, so m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Oh wait, yeah, because d is in parsecs. So d/10 is the factor.

Let me compute the apparent magnitude for each star:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus has an apparent V magnitude of about 0.7. So it's very bright. So m is 0.7.

b) Polaris: Polaris has an apparent magnitude of around 2.0, I believe. So m is 2.0.

c) Star with M=15, d=10 pc. So m =15 +5 log10(10/10) -5. Log(1) is 0, so m=15-5=10.

d) M=15, d=200. Compute 5*log(200/10) =5*log(20). Log10(20) is about 1.301. So 5*1.301=6.505. So m=15 +6.505 -5= 16.505? Wait, wait: no, the formula is m = M +5 log10(d) -5. So d=200, log10(200)=2.3010. So m=15 + (5*2.3010) -5 =15 +11.505 -5=21.505.

e) M=15, d=5 pc. So d=5. log10(5)=0.69897. So 5 *0.69897≈3.495. So m=15 +3.495 -5=13.495.

f) M=15, d=50. log10(50)=1.69897. 5*1.69897≈8.495. So m=15 +8.495 -5=18.495.

So the apparent magnitudes are as follows:

a) Canopus: ~0.7

b) Polaris: ~2.0

c) 10.0

d) ~21.5

e) ~13.5

f) ~18.5

Now, the next thing is to find out which of these stars would give S/N ≥10.

I think the ESPRESSO spectrograph has a certain S/N per pixel per hour for a given magnitude. So I need to find the S/N for each star.

What I remember is that the S/N for a star depends on the exposure time, flux, and the instrument's efficiency. The formula is something like S/N = F * sqrt(t) / noise.

Alternatively, there's a relation that S/N is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is the zero point magnitude (the magnitude where S/N is 1 per pixel per second or something like that).

Wait, perhaps I should find the S/N formula for ESPRESSO. I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers, but I can think about the typical S/N for a given magnitude.

ESPRESSO's design is for high-resolution spectroscopy. The V band (which is what I'm assuming here) has a certain efficiency. Let's say the zero-point is around m=16. That is, a star of V=16 would give S/N=1 per pixel in one hour.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the S/N scales with 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t). Let's say the zero-point magnitude is m0, such that S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t).

So, for a 1-hour exposure, t=3600 seconds. So sqrt(t)=60 seconds^0.5.

So, S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * 60.

We need S/N ≥10. So,

10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) *60 ≥10

Divide both sides by 60:

10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) ≥ 10/60 ≈ 0.1667

Take log base 10:

-0.4 (m - m0) ≥ log10(0.1667) ≈ -0.778

Multiply both sides by -1 (and reverse inequality):

0.4 (m - m0) ≤ 0.778

Divide by 0.4:

m - m0 ≤ 0.778 / 0.4 = 1.945

So,

m ≤ m0 +1.945.

So, any star with m ≤ m0 + ~1.945 would have S/N ≥10.

Now, what's the zero-point m0 for ESPRESSO. I think it's around 16. So, if m0 is 16, then m ≤16 +1.945= ~17.945.

So any star with m ≤17.945 would meet the S/N ≥10 condition.

Wait, let's double-check the zero-point. I'm not entirely confident. Maybe it's m0=20? If m0 is 20, then m ≤21.945. But that would include more stars. Alternatively, some sources say that ESPRESSO can reach S/N of 10 for stars around magnitude 20 in a few hours, but in one hour, perhaps it's a bit brighter.

Wait, let's look up some typical values. I remember that ESPRESSO's design allows it to reach S/N ratios of 10 for a G-type star (like the Sun) in about 10 minutes, which would mean much brighter stars. But perhaps for a V=16 star, with 1 hour, maybe S/N is 10, making m0=16.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of signal. Let's consider that the flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), so F = k * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)).

Then, S/N = F * sqrt(t) / noise.

Assuming noise is a constant, for the same t, S/N is proportional to F * sqrt(t).

But perhaps the formula is S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t).

So, if m0 is the magnitude when S/N per pixel is 1 in 1 second, then in 1 hour (3600 s), S/N would be 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(3600).

sqrt(3600) is 60. So, S/N = 60 * 10^(-0.4(m - m0)).

Set this >=10:

60 * 10^(-0.4(m - m0)) >=10

Divide both sides by 60: 10^(-0.4(m - m0)) >= 1/6 ≈0.1667

Take log: -0.4 (m - m0) >= log10(0.1667) ≈ -0.778

Multiply both sides by -1 (reversing inequality): 0.4 (m - m0) <= 0.778

(m - m0) <= 0.778 / 0.4 = 1.945

Therefore, m <= m0 +1.945.

Now, what is m0? The zero-point magnitude is the magnitude where S/N per pixel per hour would be 1. So, what's the typical m0 for ESPRESSO? I think it's around 16, but I'm not certain.

If m0 is about 16, then m should be <= 16 +1.945 =17.945.

So, any star with m <=17.945 would have S/N >=10.

Now, let's check each star:

a) Canopus: m=0.7. 0.7 <17.945 → yes.

b) Polaris: m=2.0 → yes.

c) m=10 → yes.

d) m=21.5 → 21.5>17.945 → no.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

f) m=18.5 → 18.5>17.945 → no.

Wait, 18.5 is just over 17.945, so it's no.

Wait, let me compute 17.945 to 2 decimal places. 17.945 is 17.945. So 18.5 is higher, so it's out.

So which stars are detectable? a, b, c, e. So four stars. Let's count:

a: yes

b: yes

c: yes

d: no

e: yes

f: no

So that's four stars.

Wait, but wait, is the zero-point m0=16? Because if m0 is 16, then a star at m=16 would give S/N=60 *10^0 =60, which is way more than 10. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I have the formula inverted.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

The S/N formula is S/N = 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is the zero-point magnitude. So, when m = m0, the S/N is sqrt(t). For 1 hour, sqrt(3600)=60. So, if m0 is 16, then a star at m=16 would give S/N=60.

But for S/N=10, we can solve for m:

10 = 10^(-0.4*(m -16)) *60.

Divide both sides by 60:

10/60 = 10^(-0.4*(m-16)).

0.1667 =10^(-0.4*(m-16)).

Take log10:

log10(0.1667) ≈ -0.778 = -0.4*(m-16)

Multiply both sides by (-1/0.4):

(m-16) = (0.778)/0.4 ≈1.945.

So, m=16 +1.945=17.945.

So any star with m<=17.945 would give S/N>=10.

So the stars:

a: 0.7 → yes

b:2 → yes

c:10 → yes

d:21.5 → no

e:13.5 → yes

f:18.5 → no, because 18.5>17.945.

So that's four stars: a, b, c, e.

Wait, but wait, what about Canopus and Polaris? Are they within the V band and at declinations observable by the VLT? The question says they're at RA=0, DEC=0, but Canopus is in the southern sky. The VLT is in Chile, which is in the southern hemisphere, so Canopus should be visible. Polaris is in the northern sky, but RA=0, DEC=0 is on the celestial equator, so it's visible from Paranal.

So, all four stars a, b, c, e should be detectable. Wait, but wait, what about the star in option e? It's at 5 pc. Let's calculate its apparent magnitude again.

Wait, M=15, d=5 pc.

m = M +5 log10(d/10) → M=15, d=5.

d/10=0.5 → log10(0.5)= -0.3010.

So m=15 +5*(-0.3010) =15 -1.505=13.495.

Yes, so m≈13.5.

So that's under 17.945, so included.

So the stars that are detectable are a, b, c, e. That's four options.

Wait, but let me check the options given:

Options are a, b, c, d, e, f.

So four of them detectable: a, b, c, e. So the count is four.

Looking back at the options, the possible answers are:

A)2

B)5

C)4

D)3

So the correct answer would be C)4.

Wait, but wait. What about the stars' brightness? Can ESPRESSO handle very bright stars? Because sometimes, instruments can't handle saturating the detector. So stars that are too bright might not be observable because the photons cause saturation, reducing the S/N.

But in this question, the S/N is per binned pixel. So for very bright stars, perhaps the pixels would be binned, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula might automatically account for it.

Wait, but in reality, for very bright stars, you might need to use a higher slit or different mode, but the question says it's coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes. So perhaps the ESPRESSO can handle it.

But our initial calculation says four stars are detectable, so answer C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we calculate the apparent magnitude \( m \) for each star and compare it to the detection threshold. A star is detectable if its apparent magnitude \( m \leq 17.945 \), which corresponds to achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

### Step 1: Apparent Magnitude Calculations
The apparent magnitude \( m \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs.

- **(a) Canopus**: Canopus has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 0.7 \).  
  **Detectable**: Yes.

- **(b) Polaris**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \).  
  **Detectable**: Yes.

- **(c) Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \):**  
  \[
  m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15 + 0 - 5 = 10
  \]  
  **Detectable**: Yes.

- **(d) Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \):**  
  \[
  m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200) - 5 = 15 + 5(2.301) - 5 = 15 + 11.505 - 5 = 21.505
  \]  
  **Detectable**: No.

- **(e) Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \):**  
  \[
  m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 = 15 + 5(0.69897) - 5 = 15 + 3.495 - 5 = 13.495
  \]  
  **Detectable**: Yes.

- **(f) Star with \( M = 15 \), \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \):**  
  \[
  m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50) - 5 = 15 + 5(1.69897) - 5 = 15 + 8.495 - 5 = 18.495
  \]  
  **Detectable**: No.

### Step 2: Summary of Detectable Stars
- **(a) Canopus**: Detectable.
- **(b) Polaris**: Detectable.
- **(c)**: Detectable.
- **(d)**: Not detectable.
- **(e)**: Detectable.
- **(f)**: Not detectable.

### Step 3: Final Count
A total of **4 stars** (a, b, c, e) are detectable.

**Answer: C**
