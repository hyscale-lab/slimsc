Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, Planet_1 or Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, so I'm guessing they have similar sizes, but I don't know for sure. The question gives me several pieces of information that I need to piece together.

First, both planets were detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means their minimum masses are known, along with their orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, 100 days, Planet_1's is 33 days. Shorter period means it's closer to its star, right?

The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. Usually, more massive stars are bigger, but here they have the same size. Maybe because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, which might mean it's a subgiant or something, but I'm not sure how that affects the size. Oh, the question says both have the same radii, so that's important.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. The main formula I remember is that the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2, but wait, that's not exactly right. Oh right, the geometric probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / a) * (something?), wait. Actually, the transit probability P is given by (R_p / a) * ( (R_star + R_p) / R_star ), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. The probability that a planet transits its star from our point of view is roughly equal to the ratio of the planet's orbital plane's inclination to the line of sight. But more accurately, the probability is (R_planet + R_star) / (semi-major axis), but wait, no, that's not right either. Alternatively, I think the transit probability P is given by the formula P = (R_p / a) * ( (R_* + R_p) / R_* ), but maybe I'm getting confused with other terms.

Wait, no, another approach. The transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The more edge-on the orbit, the higher the chance. But the actual probability (without prior RV detection) is given by (R_p + R_*) / (a) multiplied by a factor involving the star's size and the planet's distance. Oh, maybe I should think about it as the area.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a transit is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbital plane cuts through the sky. Hmm, perhaps more accurately, the probability is (R_p + R_*) / a, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I should look up the formula. Oh, wait, I can't look it up right now. Let me think about it logically. The probability of the planet passing in front of the star (from our perspective) depends on how likely the orbit is aligned such that the planet's path crosses our line of sight. The formula I remember is:

P = (R_p + R_*) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5 )

But wait, for circular orbits, e=0, so it simplifies to (R_p + R_*) / a.

But wait, the actual formula is (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^0.5 ), but since e=0 for both, it's just R_p / a.

Wait, but no, I think I'm mixing up the true transit probability. I think the correct formula is:

P = (R_p + R_*) / a

Wait, no, actually, I think it's (R_p) / (a) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_p + R_*) / a, but that doesn't sound right because R_p is much smaller than R_*. So perhaps it's approximated as (R_p / a) * (R_* / R_*), which would be R_p / a. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is aligned such that it crosses the star's disk. The chance for that is higher when the planet is closer to the star because the star appears smaller in the sky from the planet's perspective. So, higher probability when a (semi-major axis) is smaller, given the same star size.

Wait, but the formula for the transit probability when the inclination is random is:

P = (R_p + R_*) / a

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth, but that's not quite right either.

Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. No, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, another way: the probability that the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight is P = (R_p) / (a) multiplied by the solid angle. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, since the orbits are randomly oriented, the probability is (R_p + R_*) / a. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I found a source in my mind: the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is approximately (R_p + R_*) / (a), but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, it's (R_p / a) multiplied by (1 / (1 - e²)^0.5 ), but since e=0, it's just R_p / a.

Wait, another angle: in the case of the RV method, the planet's orbit must have a certain inclination so that its velocity causes Doppler shift. But for transits, the inclination needs to be even more edge-on. Wait, but in this question, the RV method has already detected the planets, so their orbits are known to have certain inclinations. Wait, no, because RV measures the velocity along our line of sight, which depends on the inclination. So the RV method can't determine the exact inclination, only a minimum mass because it depends on sin(i), where i is the inclination angle.

Wait, but for the transit, the probability depends on the inclination. If a planet has already been detected via RV, that tells us that the inclination is high enough that sin(i) is non-zero. So the prior probability for the transit is higher than a random orientation, but how much higher?

Wait, but in this question, both planets have already been detected via RV, so their orbital inclinations must be such that sin(i) is sufficient to produce the observed RV signal. Thus, their true masses are known (not just minimum masses). But for the purpose of transit probability, the inclination is not perfectly known. So the probability is conditioned on the RV detection.

Hmm, this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the RV detection doesn't influence the geometric transit probability because we are considering the transit probability given that the planet exists, not the probability of detecting it via transit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach the problem step by step.

The transit probability for a given planet is the probability that, from our viewing angle, the planet's orbit passes in front of the star. For randomly oriented orbits, this probability is (R_p + R_*) / a, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the formula I've heard is P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 - e^2)^0.5 ), but since e=0 (both are circular orbits), the formula simplifies to R_p / a.

Wait, no, maybe it's (R_p + R_*) / a multiplied by some factor, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p) / (a) multiplied by (R_* + R_p) / R_*, which simplifies to (R_p (R_* + R_p)) / (a R_*). But since R_p << R_*, this reduces to R_p^2 / (a R_*), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relative size. For a given star, a planet with a smaller semi-major axis (a) is more likely to transit because it's closer and the chance that its orbit crosses our line of sight is higher.

But wait, the transit probability also depends on the size of the star and the planet. So, for two planets, which has a higher (R_p / a) ratio? Because a higher ratio would imply a higher probability of transit.

But wait, the problem states that both planets have the same mass. So if they have the same mass, and if we assume similar densities (which isn't stated, but perhaps the question expects that), their radii would be similar. Let's say R_p1 ≈ R_p2. So, same planet radius.

But perhaps the stars have the same radius. The problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_*1 = R_*2.

Thus, the transit probability for each planet would depend on their semi-major axes (a), since a is in the denominator.

Wait, but the semi-major axis (a) is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The formula is a^3 = (G(M_* + M_p) * P^2 ) / (4π²). Since M_p << M_*, we can approximate a^3 ≈ (G M_* P²) / (4 π²). So a is proportional to (M_* * P)^1/3.

Wait, wait, let's get the exact formula. Kepler's third law is a³ = (G (M_*) P²) / (4 π² (1 - e²)), but since e=0, it's a³ = (G M_* P²) / (4 π²). So a ∝ (M_* * P)^(1/3).

So, for each planet:

a1 = ( (G (2 M_2) P1²) / (4 π²) )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Wait, let me define M_*1 as the mass of Planet_1's star, and M_*2 as Planet_2's star.

From the question, M_*1 = 2 * M_*2.

Planet_1 has orbital period P1, Planet_2 P2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So, for Planet_1, a1 = [ (G M_*1 P1² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 = [ (G M_*2 P2² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Since M_*1 = 2 M_*2, and P1 = P2 /3.

Let me substitute:

a1 = [ (G (2 M_*2) (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify (P2/3)^2 = P2² /9.

So:

a1 = [ (2 G M_*2 P2² ) / (9 *4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Which is [ (2 /9) * (G M_*2 P2²) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

But the term (G M_*2 P2² ) / (4 π² ) is inside the cube root for a2. So a2 = [ (G M_*2 P2² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Thus, a1 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3) * a2

Because the other terms are the same as a2's.

So, [2/9]^(1/3) is approximately (0.222)^(0.333) ≈ 0.6.

So a1 ≈ 0.6 * a2.

That means Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

But wait, the transit probability is (R_p / a) * something, but if I'm assuming R_p is similar for both, and R_* is same, let's see.

Wait, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_p + R_*) / a, but since R_* is same and much larger than R_p, this is roughly (R_* / a ) * (R_p / R_* ). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a ) * ( R_* / (R_* + R_p) ) )^2, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size and the orbital distance.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis, given fixed star and planet sizes. Because a larger a makes the orbit less likely to cross our line of sight.

Wait, but if a is smaller, the probability is higher. So since a1 is smaller than a2, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

But how much higher?

Let me compute the ratio of their transit probabilities.

Assuming that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a), and R_p is same for both, and R_* is same, then:

P1 / P2 = (R_p1 / a1) / (R_p2 / a2) )

Since R_p1 = R_p2, and a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So (R_p1/R_p2) is 1, and (a2/a1) is 1/(0.6) = approx 1.666.

Thus, P1/P2 = (1/(0.6)) ) = 5/3 ≈ 1.666.

So Planet_1 has about 1.666 times higher probability than Planet_2.

But wait, wait, I think I may have inverted it. Because a1 is smaller, so (R_p/a1) is larger than (R_p/a2 ), so P1 is larger than P2. So the ratio P1/P2 is (a2 / a1) because P is inversely proportional to a.

Wait, let's think again. If a is smaller, then (R_p / a) is larger. So P1 = (R_p) / a1, P2 = (R_p) / a2.

So P1/P2 = (a2) / (a1 )

Since a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a2 / a1 = 1/(0.6) ≈ 1.666.

So P1 is about 1.666 times higher than P2.

Wait, but the options don't have 1.66 times for Planet_1 as an option. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) Planet_2, 2.25 times higher.

B) Planet_2, 1.5 times.

C) Planet_1, ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1, 2.7 times.

So option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So according to my calculation, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, about 1.666 times that of Planet_2. So option C is correct.

But wait, I should make sure whether the transit probability is P = (R_p / a) or something else.

Wait, another way to think about it: the transit probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the planet's orbit. The area of the star is π R_*². The area of the orbit is π a². So the probability is (R_*² / a²) * (something else). Wait, that can't be right because for a circular orbit, the transit probability would be (R_* / a )^2, but that doesn't align with other intuitions.

Wait, no, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's angular radius to the planet's orbital angular radius. The star's angular radius is θ_* = R_* / a. The planet's orbital angular radius θ_orbit is a. Wait, no, I think I confused the terms.

Wait, the star's angular size is θ_* = (R_*) / (a), because from Earth, the apparent size is R_* at a distance a. So the probability that the planet's transit path crosses the star is the ratio of the star's angular size to the planet's orbital angular radius, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So (2 R_*) / (2 a) ) = R_* / a.

Wait, but that's not the case, because the planet's path is a circle of diameter 2a, and the star's disk is a circle of diameter 2 R_*.

Wait, the probability that the planet's path crosses the star is equal to the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit.

So, Area_star / Area_orbit = (π R_*²) / (π a²) ) = (R_* / a )^2.

But that can't be right because if a is very large, the probability is very small, which makes sense. But for small a, the probability increases.

Wait, but this would suggest that the transit probability is (R_* / a )^2. But I'm not sure if this is correct, because the actual probability also depends on the distance between the two centers. Oh, right, the probability is the area of the overlapping region divided by the area of the orbit, but the calculation gets more complicated.

Alternatively, another formula I've heard is that the probability is approximately (R_p + R_*) / a, but with the same reasoning, that would be (R_* / a) since R_p << R_*.

So, if the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a ), then for each planet, P = k (R_* / a ), where k is a constant.

Given that both stars have the same R_*, then P1 / P2 = a2/a1.

From earlier, a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

So a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(0.333) ≈ 1.65.

So the ratio P1/P2 is approximately 1.65, so Planet_1 has a higher probability, about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So the correct answer is C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given information:

1. **Key Parameters**:
   - Both planets have the same mass and circular orbits.
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), meaning it is closer to its star.
   - The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\( M_{*1} = 2M_{*2} \)).
   - Both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{*1} = R_{*2} \)).

2. **Transit Probability**:
   The transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star. For circular orbits, the probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_p}{a} \), where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like and their host stars have the same radius, we assume \( R_{p1} \approx R_{p2} \). Thus, the transit probability depends primarily on \( a \), with smaller \( a \) leading to higher probabilities.

3. **Semi-Major Axis**:
   Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), we calculate the semi-major axes:
   \[
   a_1 \propto (M_{*1} P_1^2)^{1/3}, \quad a_2 \propto (M_{*2} P_2^2)^{1/3}.
   \]
   Substituting \( M_{*1} = 2M_{*2} \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):
   \[
   a_1 \propto (2M_{*2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2)^{1/3} = (2 \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9})^{1/3} \cdot M_{*2}^{1/3}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   a_1 = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} a_2 \approx 0.6 a_2.
   \]
   Thus, Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

4. **Transit Probability Ratio**:
   Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of the probabilities is:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
   \]
   This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the calculations, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, Planet_1 or Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, so I'm guessing they have similar sizes, but I don't know for sure. The question gives me several pieces of information that I need to piece together.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach the problem step by step.

The transit probability for a given planet is the probability that, from our viewing angle, the planet's orbit passes in front of the star. For randomly oriented orbits, this probability is (R_p + R_*) / a, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the formula I've heard is P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (1 - e^2)^0.5 ), but since e=0 (both are circular orbits), the formula simplifies to R_p / a.

Wait, no, maybe it's (R_p + R_*) / a multiplied by some factor, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p) / (a) multiplied by (R_* + R_p) / R_*, which simplifies to (R_p (R_* + R_p)) / (a R_*). But since R_p << R_*, this reduces to R_p^2 / (a R_*), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relative size. For a given star, a planet with a smaller semi-major axis (a) is more likely to transit because it's closer and the chance that its orbit crosses our line of sight is higher.

But wait, the transit probability also depends on the size of the star and the planet. So, for two planets, which has a higher (R_p / a) ratio? Because a higher ratio would imply a higher probability of transit.

But wait, the problem states that both planets have the same mass. So if they have the same mass, and if we assume similar densities (which isn't stated, but perhaps the question expects that), their radii would be similar. Let's say R_p1 ≈ R_p2. So, same planet radius.

But perhaps the stars have the same radius. The problem states that both host stars have the same radii. So R_*1 = R_*2.

Thus, the transit probability for each planet would depend on their semi-major axes (a), since a is in the denominator.

Wait, but the semi-major axis (a) is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The formula is a^3 = (G(M_* + M_p) * P^2 ) / (4π²). Since M_p << M_*, we can approximate a^3 ≈ (G M_* P²) / (4 π²). So a is proportional to (M_* * P)^1/3.

Wait, wait, let's get the exact formula. Kepler's third law is a³ = (G (M_*) P²) / (4 π² (1 - e²)), but since e=0, it's a³ = (G M_* P²) / (4 π²). So a ∝ (M_* * P)^(1/3).

So, for each planet:

a1 = ( (G (2 M_2) P1²) / (4 π²) )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Wait, let me define M_*1 as the mass of Planet_1's star, and M_*2 as Planet_2's star.

From the question, M_*1 = 2 * M_*2.

Planet_1 has orbital period P1, Planet_2 P2, and P1 = P2 /3.

So, for Planet_1, a1 = [ (G M_*1 P1² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Similarly, a2 = [ (G M_*2 P2² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Since M_*1 = 2 M_*2, and P1 = P2 /3.

Let me substitute:

a1 = [ (G (2 M_*2) (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify (P2/3)^2 = P2² /9.

So:

a1 = [ (2 G M_*2 P2² ) / (9 *4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

Which is [ (2 /9) * (G M_*2 P2²) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

But the term (G M_*2 P2² ) / (4 π² ) is inside the cube root for a2. So a2 = [ (G M_*2 P2² ) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Thus, a1 = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3) * a2

Because the other terms are the same as a2's.

So, [2/9]^(1/3) is approximately (0.222)^(0.333) ≈ 0.6.

So a1 ≈ 0.6 * a2.

That means Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

But wait, the transit probability is (R_p / a) * something, but if I'm assuming R_p is similar for both, and R_* is same, let's see.

Wait, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_p + R_*) / a, but since R_* is same and much larger than R_p, this is roughly (R_* / a ) * (R_p / R_* ). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a ) * ( R_* / (R_* + R_p) ) )^2, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the planet's size to the star's size and the orbital distance.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis, given fixed star and planet sizes. Because a larger a makes the orbit less likely to cross our line of sight.

Wait, but if a is smaller, the probability is higher. So since a1 is smaller than a2, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

But how much higher?

Let me compute the ratio of their transit probabilities.

Assuming that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a), and R_p is same for both, and R_* is same, then:

P1 / P2 = (R_p1 / a1) / (R_p2 / a2) )

Since R_p1 = R_p2, and a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So (R_p1/R_p2) is 1, and (a2/a1) is 1/(0.6) = approx 1.666.

Thus, P1/P2 = (1/(0.6)) ) = 5/3 ≈ 1.666.

So Planet_1 has about 1.666 times higher probability than Planet_2.

But wait, wait, I think I may have inverted it. Because a1 is smaller, so (R_p/a1) is larger than (R_p/a2 ), so P1 is larger than P2. So the ratio P1/P2 is (a2 / a1) because P is inversely proportional to a.

Wait, let's think again. If a is smaller, then (R_p / a) is larger. So P1 = (R_p) / a1, P2 = (R_p) / a2.

So P1/P2 = (a2) / (a1 )

Since a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.6 a2.

So a2 / a1 = 1/(0.6) ≈ 1.666.

So P1 is about 1.666 times higher than P2.

Wait, but the options don't have 1.66 times for Planet_1 as an option. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) Planet_2, 2.25 times higher.

B) Planet_2, 1.5 times.

C) Planet_1, ~1.65 times.

D) Planet_1, 2.7 times.

So option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So according to my calculation, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, about 1.666 times that of Planet_2. So option C is correct.

But wait, I should make sure whether the transit probability is P = (R_p / a) or something else.

Wait, another way to think about it: the transit probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the planet's orbit. The area of the star is π R_*². The area of the orbit is π a². So the probability is (R_*² / a²) * (something else). Wait, that can't be right because for a circular orbit, the transit probability would be (R_* / a )^2, but that doesn't align with other intuitions.

Wait, no, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's angular radius to the planet's orbital angular radius. The star's angular radius is θ_* = R_* / a. The planet's orbital angular radius θ_orbit is a. Wait, no, I think I confused the terms.

Wait, the star's angular size is θ_* = (R_*) / (a), because from Earth, the apparent size is R_* at a distance a. So the probability that the planet's transit path crosses the star is the ratio of the star's angular size to the planet's orbital angular radius, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So (2 R_*) / (2 a) ) = R_* / a.

Wait, but that's not the case, because the planet's path is a circle of diameter 2a, and the star's disk is a circle of diameter 2 R_*.

Wait, the probability that the planet's path crosses the star is equal to the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbit.

So, Area_star / Area_orbit = (π R_*²) / (π a²) ) = (R_* / a )^2.

But that can't be right because if a is very large, the probability is very small, which makes sense. But for small a, the probability increases.

Wait, but this would suggest that the transit probability is (R_* / a )^2. But I'm not sure if this is correct, because the actual probability also depends on the distance between the two centers. Oh, right, the probability is the area of the overlapping region divided by the area of the orbit, but the calculation gets more complicated.

Alternatively, another formula I've heard is that the probability is approximately (R_p + R_*) / a, but with the same reasoning, that would be (R_* / a) since R_p << R_*.

So, if the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a ), then for each planet, P = k (R_* / a ), where k is a constant.

Given that both stars have the same R_*, then P1 / P2 = a2/a1.

From earlier, a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

So a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ (4.5)^(0.333) ≈ 1.65.

So the ratio P1/P2 is approximately 1.65, so Planet_1 has a higher probability, about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given information:

1. **Key Parameters**:
   - Both planets have the same mass and circular orbits.
   - Planet_1 has an orbital period \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \), meaning it is closer to its star.
   - The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of the host star of Planet_2 (\( M_{*1} = 2M_{*2} \)).
   - Both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{*1} = R_{*2} \)).

2. **Transit Probability**:
   The transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star. For circular orbits, the probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_p}{a} \), where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since both planets are Earth-like and their host stars have the same radius, we assume \( R_{p1} \approx R_{p2} \). Thus, the transit probability depends primarily on \( a \), with smaller \( a \) leading to higher probabilities.

3. **Semi-Major Axis**:
   Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), we calculate the semi-major axes:
   \[
   a_1 \propto (M_{*1} P_1^2)^{1/3}, \quad a_2 \propto (M_{*2} P_2^2)^{1/3}.
   \]
   Substituting \( M_{*1} = 2M_{*2} \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):
   \[
   a_1 \propto (2M_{*2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2)^{1/3} = (2 \cdot \frac{P_2^2}{9})^{1/3} \cdot M_{*2}^{1/3}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   a_1 = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} a_2 \approx 0.6 a_2.
   \]
   Thus, Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's.

4. **Transit Probability Ratio**:
   Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the ratio of the probabilities is:
   \[
   \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.6} \approx 1.67.
   \]
   This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Based on the calculations, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, approximately 1.65 times that of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
