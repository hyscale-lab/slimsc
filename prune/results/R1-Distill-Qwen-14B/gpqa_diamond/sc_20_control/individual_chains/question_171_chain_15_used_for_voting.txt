Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives six substances, and each undergoes an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. That means I need to figure out which of these substituents directs the incoming bromine to the para position the most, and then order them accordingly.

Wait, wait. Electrophilic substitution reactions on benzene rings are influenced by the directing groups attached. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can be ortho/para directors or meta directors. Right.

So each of these substituents is attached to a benzene ring. Let me list them again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyl ethyl ester)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene, maybe?)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, no, the substituents are:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ester group)
3) Cl
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

So, for each substituent, I need to determine whether they are activating or deactivating, and whether they are ortho/para or meta directors.

Let me go one by one.

1) CH3 (methyl): methyl is an activating group, because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. It's an ortho/para director. So when bromine is added in electrophilic substitution, the para position will be major. Wait, but in the presence of activating groups, the ring is more reactive, so substitution occurs more readily. But the directing is about where the substituent goes.

Wait, methyl group is activating (since it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons via induction). So it's ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the incoming Br will go para to CH3.

But wait, wait. No, the substituent directs the incoming electrophile. So if the substituent is activating and ortho/para, the major product will be at the para position. So if the substituent is a methyl group, the major bromination would be para to it.

2) COOEt (ester group): the ester group is a deactivating group, because it's an electron-withdrawing group. Wait, esters are meta directors. Or wait, I think the ester group is an electron-withdrawing via the carbonyl group, so it's a deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, let me think. The ester group is a carbonyl group attached to an OR group. The carbonyl is electron-withdrawing through induction, which makes it deactivating. So it's a meta-directing group. So when bromine adds, the Br will go meta to the ester group.

3) Cl: Chlorine is a substituent. Chlorine is electronegative. So it's a deactivating group. But wait, chlorine is an interesting case. It's an electron-withdrawing by induction (since Cl is more electronegative than C), but it's also has lone pairs which can donate electrons through resonance, making it a weakly activating group. Wait, no, I think chlorine is a deactivating group because the inductive effect outweighs the resonance effect. So it's a deactivating, ortho/para director.

Wait wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: substituents with lone pairs (like -O-, -NH2) can donate electrons through resonance, activating the ring and being ortho/para directors. But chlorine, though it has lone pairs, the inductive effect is stronger. So chlorine (Cl-) is a deactivating group (because the ring becomes less reactive) but it's still an ortho/para director. So bromine substitution would occur at the ortho and para positions relative to Cl.

4) NO2: Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Because NO2 is highly electron-withdrawing, it makes the ring less reactive, and directs the incoming electrophile to the meta positions.

5) C2H5 (ethyl): Similar to CH3, it's an activating, ortho/para directing group. Because it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons through induction, activating the ring, and directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions.

6) COOH (carboxylic acid group): COOH is a deactivating group. It's electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl group and the -OH group, which can't donate electrons through resonance as effectively as, say, -O- groups. So carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating (ring less reactive) and meta-directing group. So when bromine adds, the Br would go meta to COOH.

So now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. That implies the percentage of the product that is the para-substituted derivative. So, for each substituent, which positions are favored, and how much para is formed.

So, for each substituent:

1) CH3: ortho/para. So para is a major product, along with ortho. But since the question is about the weight fraction, which substituent leads to the highest proportion of para isomer?

But wait, the substituent's directing effect determines the major product. For activating groups, the substituent directs the incoming electrophile to ortho and para. But the question is about the proportion of para in the product. So for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer may not be the major but a significant portion.

Wait, but when a substituent is a strong ortho/para director, like -NH2, the para isomer is typically the major product because the ring is symmetric, but for weaker directors, more ortho may form. Alternatively, some substituents may have a preference for para over ortho, like in toluene.

Wait, let's think about each substituent and the amount of para product.

- Substituents that are ortho/para directors: the incoming electrophile (Br+) can add either ortho or para relative to the substituent. For substituents that are weakly activating, perhaps the para is the major product. But wait, it's possible that for substituents like methyl, the para isomer is more favored than ortho, because of steric hindrance? Or maybe in some cases, the ortho is more reactive.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think of each substituent and the likely major product.

Substituent 1: CH3 is an activating, ortho/para director. So bromine can add ortho, meta, or para? No, wait, the substituent directs so the Br adds ortho or para. So the product would be a mixture of ortho and para. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. Which substituent leads to more para?

Wait, but the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects the reactivity. Also, steric factors might influence where the substitution occurs. For example, if the substituent is bulky, the ortho position is harder to reach, so para might be favored. But in the case of methyl, which is not very bulky, both ortho and para are possible. So maybe the para isomer is the major product.

Substituent 2: COOEt (ester group). Since it's a meta director, the Br would add meta to it. So the para isomer would not be formed in any significant amount. So the weight fraction of para would be low, perhaps zero or negligible.

Substitutent 3: Cl. Ortho/para director. So the Br would add to ortho and para positions. But Cl is a deactivating group. So the ring is less reactive, but the substituent still directs. The para and ortho would be the main products. Which one is more? Hmm, I think that for substituents like Cl, the para product is major because the substituent is in a position that when the ring is symmetric, the para is more accessible. Or maybe not. Wait, I'm not certain. Maybe for Cl, the para is the major product, but I'm not sure.

Substituent 4: NO2. It's a meta director, so Br adds meta to the NO2 group. So para is not a product. So the para fraction is low.

Substituent 5: C2H5 (ethyl group). Similar to CH3, it's an activating, ortho/para director. So Br adds to ortho and para positions. Again, the question is which is more. Maybe para is major.

Substituent 6: COOH. It's a meta director, so the Br adds meta to it. So the para product isn't formed. So the para fraction is low.

Wait, but wait. For substituents that are meta directors, the para product would be minor or zero. So substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors. So their para products would be negligible, so their weight fractions would be low.

Substituents 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors. So their para products are major.

But the question is about the order of increasing weight fraction of the para isomer. So the substances with low para fractions come first, then higher ones.

Wait, but wait. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, some might have a higher tendency to produce para over ortho. For instance, if the substituent is a strong activating group, perhaps para is favored more. Alternatively, steric factors may lead to para being more favored if the substituent is bulky.

So let's consider each substituent:

1) CH3 (methyl): activating, o/p director. The para product is a major, but does the para product contribute more than the ortho? I think in toluene bromination, the para isomer is the major, followed by ortho. But I'm not sure about the exact ratio. I remember that for toluene, the bromination gives a mixture, but para is the major product.

3) Cl (chlorine): deactivating, o/p director. So the ring is less reactive but the substituent still directs to o and p. Since Cl is a deactivating group, perhaps the para isomer is the major product. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe when the substituent is deactivating, the para product might be less than when activating. Not sure.

5) C2H5 (ethyl): similar to CH3. Activating, o/p director. So para is major.

So, among substituents 1,3,5, which gives the highest weight fraction of para isomer?

I think the activating groups (1,5) would have a higher para fraction. The deactivating o/p director (3) might have a lower para fraction because the ring is less reactive.

So for substituent 3, the para fraction would be lower than that of 1 and 5.

Wait, but the substituent's activating strength affects how much the ring is activated, but since all three are o/p directors, the para fraction would be higher than substituents that are meta directors.

So the order, from lowest to highest para fraction (weight):

The meta directors (2,4,6) have the lowest para fractions. So they are first in the order.

Now, among the meta directors, which has the highest para fraction? Wait, no, no. Because substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so their para fractions are low. So all meta director substituents would be at lower positions in the order.

But wait, the question is about increasing order of weight fraction of para. So the lowest para comes first.

Wait, perhaps I should list all substituents and their expected para fractions.

Let me outline:

Substituent | Director Type | Para Fraction
--- | --- | ---
1 (CH3) | o/p, activating | High (major para)
2 (COOEt) | meta | Low (para negligible)
3 (Cl) | o/p, deactivating | Moderate? Or lower than 1 and 5?
4 (NO2) | meta | Very low (para negligible)
5 (C2H5) | o/p, activating | High (major para)
6 (COOH) | meta | Very low (para negligible)

Wait, but substituent 3 is Cl, which is a deactivating o/p director. So when the ring is less activated, the para product may not be as dominant as in activating groups. So perhaps substituent 3's para fraction is lower than 1 and 5 but higher than meta directors.

Wait, but meta directors have negligible para product. So among the substituents:

Lowest para fraction:
Substituents 4, 2, 6: they are meta directors. So their para fractions are very low, possibly in the order of 4 (NO2) being the most deactivating, leading to the least reaction, but in terms of para isomer, they have none. So perhaps all meta directors have similar or negligible para fractions.

Wait, no. The meta directors would direct the incoming Br to the meta position. So for these, the para isomer would not be formed, so their weight fraction of para is zero, assuming only meta product.

But wait, the problem states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So for meta directors, the product is meta, so the para fraction is zero. But that can't be, because the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So perhaps in these cases, the para isomer isn't formed, so their weight fraction is zero.

Wait, but the question says 'the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.' So if a substituent is meta-directing, the para isomer is not formed, so its weight fraction is zero. So substances 2,4,6 would have 0% para, and substances 1,3,5 have some para fraction.

But wait, the problem says 'arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the para-isomer.'

So the order would have the substituents with the lowest para fractions first, then the higher ones.

Wait, but substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para. So their order among themselves is... but all are zero. So perhaps the order is based on the actual substituents' directing abilities, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The question is about whether the substituent is ortho/para or meta directing, and the weight fraction of the para isomer in the product.

Wait, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is formed. For meta directors, the para isomer isn't formed, so their para fraction is zero.

So, substituents 2,4,6 (meta directors): para fraction ≈ 0.

Substituents 1,3,5 (ortho/para directors): para fraction > 0.

Thus, in the order of increasing para fraction, the meta directors come first, followed by the ortho/para directors.

But wait, the question is about increasing weight fraction, so:

The lowest para fraction is for meta directors (0), then the ortho/para directors.

Within the ortho/para directors, which has the lowest para fraction?

But wait, for the ortho/para directors, the para fraction depends on how strong the activating group is. Stronger activating groups would lead to higher para fractions because they direct better.

Wait, but wait: substituents 1 (methyl), 3 (Cl), 5 (ethyl). All are o/p directors.

Substituents 1 and 5 are activating groups, so they make the ring more reactive. Therefore, their para fractions are higher.

Substituent 3 is a deactivating o/p director (Cl), so the ring is less reactive, but the directing effect is still o/p. So the para fraction would be lower than 1 and 5, but higher than the meta directors.

So the order of para fractions from lowest to highest:

Substituents 2,4,6 (0% para) < substituent 3 (some para) < substituents 1,5 (higher para).

Wait, but substituent 3 is a deactivating o/p director. So the para fraction would be lower than substituents 1 and 5 but higher than meta directors. Wait, no, substituent 3 is a o/p director, so the para fraction is higher than meta, but lower than activating groups.

So the order would be:

Substituents 2,4,6 (0%) < substituent 3 (some) < substituents 1,5 (more).

Wait, but substituent 5 is ethyl, which is a stronger activating group than methyl? I'm not sure. I think that larger alkyl groups are more activating because they're better at donating electrons through induction. So ethyl is more activating than methyl. So substituent 5 (ethyl) would have a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (methyl). Or perhaps the opposite, since ethyl is bulkier, leading to more para substitution because the ortho is harder to reach.

Wait, steric hindrance can favor para substitution. So substituents that are bulky, like ethyl, would lead to more para substitution because the ortho positions are harder to attack. So substituent 5 (ethyl) would have a higher para fraction than substituent 1 (methyl).

Substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating o/p director, so the para fraction is lower than 1 and 5, but higher than meta directors.

So the order of increasing para fractions:

2,4,6 (0%) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) < ... Wait, but substituent 6 is a meta director, so para fraction is 0. So overall, the order would be:

2,4,6 (0%) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5) < possibly others? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should arrange all six substituents in order of their para fractions from lowest to highest.

Let me try to list each substituent with their expected para fraction:

1) CH3: o/p, activating. Para is a major product. So high para fraction. Let's say 50% or so.

2) COOEt: meta. Para fraction ≈ 0%.

3) Cl: o/p, deactivating. Para is a major product, but since the ring is less reactive, perhaps the para fraction is lower than 1 and 5. Let's say 30%.

4) NO2: meta. Para fraction ≈ 0%.

5) C2H5: o/p, activating. Perhaps higher para fraction than CH3 due to steric hindrance. Let's say 60%.

6) COOH: meta. Para fraction ≈ 0%.

So, arranging from lowest to highest para fraction:

2 (0%) < 4 (0%) <6 (0%) <3 (30%) <1 (50%) <5 (60%).

Wait, but substituent 3's para fraction is higher than the meta directors. So in the order, the meta directors come first, then substituent 3, then substituents 1 and 5.

So the order is: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But wait, substituent 5 is higher than 1. So the correct order is 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but substituent 5 (C2H5) has a higher para fraction than 1 (CH3). So in the order, substituents 2,4,6 come first (para fraction 0), then substituent 3 (Cl) with a moderate para fraction, then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5).

Wait, but substituent 3 (Cl) is a o/p director but deactivating. So its para fraction is higher than meta directors but lower than activating groups.

So the order should be:

2,4,6 (0) <3 (say 30%) <1 (CH3, say 40%) <5 (C2H5, say 50%).

Wait, but what about substituent 3's para fraction?

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3's para fraction is lower than 1 and 5. So 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but substituent 3 is a deactivating group. So even though it's an o/p director, the ring is less reactive, but the substituent still directs the Br to o and p. So maybe the para fraction is lower than substituents 1 and 5.

So the order would be:

Substituents with 0% (2,4,6) → then substituent 3 → then substituents 1 and 5.

Wait, but substituent 5 (C2H5) is a stronger activating group than 1 (CH3), and due to steric effects, the para is favored more. So substituent 5 has the highest para fraction.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction:

2,4,6 (0) <3 (Cl, maybe 20%) <1 (CH3, 40%) <5 (C2H5, 60%).

Wait, but what about substituent 3's position? Let me think again.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is an o/p director but deactivating. So the ring is less reactive, but the substituent still directs to o/p. So the para product is formed, but perhaps in lower amounts compared to the activating groups.

So the order is:

Substituents 2,4,6 (0) < substituent 3 (Cl) < substituent 1 (CH3) < substituent 5 (C2H5).

But wait, another possibility is substituent 3 has a higher para fraction than substituents 2,4,6 but lower than 1 and 5.

So the order would be: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but substituent 6 is a meta director, so it's in the 0% group.

So the six substituents in order of increasing para fraction:

2,4,6 →3→1→5.

Wait, but the substituents are 1,2,3,4,5,6. The order for the six would be:

2,4,6 (0%) →3 (Cl) →1 (CH3) →5 (C2H5).

Wait, but substituent 3 is a o/p director but deactivating. So perhaps its para fraction is higher than the meta directors but lower than activating groups.

Substituent 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5) are activating, o/p directors. So their para fractions are higher.

So the order is:

2,4,6 (0%) <3 <1 <5.

But wait, substituent 5 is ethyl, which is a bigger group than methyl. So, in ethylbenzene, the para substitution is favored more than in toluene because the bulky ethyl group makes the ortho positions less accessible. So substituent 5 would have a higher para fraction than substituent 1.

So the order would be:

2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but wait: substituent 5 is ethyl, which is more bulky than methyl, so steric hindrance is higher. So bromination at the para position is favored, leading to a higher para fraction. So substituent 5's para fraction is higher than substituent 1's.

So the order is: 2,4,6 →3 →1 →5.

So now, the arrangement is:

2,4,6 (0%) →3 →1 →5 (highest).

But wait, substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating o/p director. So, in its case, the para is formed but in lower amounts compared to activating groups.

So the order of increasing para fraction is:

2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but substituents 2,4,6 are all meta directors, so their para fractions are 0. So they all come first.

So the order is:

Substituents 2,4,6 (0%) →3 →1 →5.

But the options are:

Option A) 4<2<6<3<1<5
Option B)6<2<4<5<1<3
Option C)4<6<2<1<5<3
Option D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, perhaps I should look at each option and see which fits my analysis.

But I think I may have made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating o/p director, but the ring is less reactive, so the para product is formed but in smaller amounts compared to activating groups. So substituent 3's para fraction is higher than meta directors but lower than 1 and 5.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction:

Substituents 2,4,6 (0%) < substituent 3 < substituent 1 < substituent5.

But the options don't have all three meta directors (2,4,6) in the first position. So perhaps I need to arrange substituents 2,4,6 in some order, but their para fractions are all 0.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer is not formed, so their weight fraction is zero. So they all have the same value (zero) and are tied for the lowest.

But the options don't treat them as tied. So perhaps there's another factor I'm missing.

Wait, maybe I was wrong about substituent 3. Perhaps Cl is a deactivating group, but the para product isn't as favored as in activating groups. Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituents 2,4,6. No, that can't be, since substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors and have zero para.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating o/p director but because the ring is less reactive, the reaction doesn't proceed as much. So the para fraction of substituent 3 would be lower than that of 1 and 5, but higher than the meta directors. But since the meta directors have 0%, substituent 3 would be next.

So the order is: 2,4,6 (0) <3 <1 <5.

But in the options, the first three are in a specific order.

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe the question isn't about the para fraction but the meta fraction. Or perhaps the para fraction is the major product's percentage, regardless of where.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which substituents lead to the para product being the major, and which lead to it being minor.

Wait, substituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) result in the para product not being formed, so their weight fraction is zero. Then, substituent 3 (Cl) is a o/p deactivating director, so the para product is formed but perhaps in lower amounts. Substituents 1 and 5 are o/p activating directors, so para product is higher.

But the question asks for the order of increasing weight fraction of para isomer. So the substituents with the lowest para fractions come first.

Substituent 2,4,6 have 0% para. So they are first.

Among them, perhaps their reactivity varies. Wait, but since their para fractions are zero, they are all in the same group.

Wait, but the options don't treat them as a group. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the order of the reactivity of the substituents, but that's not what the question is asking.

Wait, let me think again about each substituent's effect on the para product.

Substituent 1: CH3 → activating, o/p → para is major. So high para fraction.

Substituent 2: COOEt → deactivating, meta → no para. So 0% para.

Substituent 3: Cl → deactivating, o/p → para is formed, but less than in activating groups.

Substituent 4: NO2 → deactivating, meta → 0% para.

Substituent 5: C2H5 → activating, o/p → para is major, perhaps higher than substituent 1 due to steric hindrance.

Substituent 6: COOH → deactivating, meta → 0% para.

So the order of para fractions is:

2,4,6 →3 →1 →5.

So substituents 2,4,6 have 0% para, so they are first.

Then comes substituent 3 (Cl), which has some para fraction.

Then substituent 1 (CH3), then substituent 5 (C2H5), which has the highest para fraction.

So the order is 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

But looking at the options, none of them list all three (2,4,6) before 3. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors, so their para fractions are zero, but substituent 3 (Cl) is an o/p director, but because it's deactivating, the para fraction is lower than substituent 1 and 5.

So the order would be:

2,4,6 (0) <3 (Cl) <1 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

No, because 3 comes after 2,4,6.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

No, that's not correct.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4.

Nope.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3.

No, because substituent 5 has higher para.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the meta directors and their positions. Let me list each substituent's para fraction:

Substituent | Para Fraction
--- | ---
1 | High (activating, o/p)
2 | 0 (meta)
3 | Moderate (deactivating, o/p)
4 | 0 (meta)
5 | High (activating, o/p)
6 | 0 (meta)

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction is:

Substituents 2,4,6 (0) →3 →1 →5.

But the options don't show 2,4,6 as first. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituents 2,4,6 have non-zero para fractions? No, because meta directors would produce meta product, not para.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about substituent 3. Maybe Cl is a meta director.

Wait, no, I'm pretty sure Cl is an o/p director. Because it has lone pairs, which can donate electrons through resonance, but its inductive effect is stronger, making it deactivating. So Cl is an o/p director.

Wait, but some sources say that Cl is a meta director in some cases. Hmm, maybe I should double-check. No, wait, Cl is an ortho/para director because of its lone pairs, despite being deactivating.

So substituent 3 (Cl) is o/p, so para is formed.

So substituent 3's para fraction is higher than the meta directors (2,4,6), which have 0.

So the order is 2,4,6 <3 <1<5.

But looking at the options, let's see:

Option A:4 <2<6<3<1<5.

So 4 comes after 2, which is a meta director. That would imply substituent 4 has higher para fraction than substituent 2. But both are meta directors; their para fractions are zero. So the order between 2,4,6 is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents 2,4,6 are arranged in the order of their activating or deactivating strength, but their para fractions are zero.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the para fraction but about the meta fraction. No, the question clearly states para.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the order of the substituents' ability to produce the para isomer, regardless of the actual percentage. So substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating o/p director, so its para product is minor. So substituent 3 is after the meta directors but before the activating groups.

So the order would be: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, which one fits this? Let's see each option:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

So 4 is first, a meta director. Then 2, another meta, then 6, another meta. Then 3, which is correct. Then 1 and 5.

But in my order, substituents 2,4,6 are all grouped before 3. So the order in option A would have 4 before 2 and 6, but I don't see why 4 would come before 2.

Alternatively, maybe substituent 4 (NO2) is a stronger deactivating group than 2 and 6, so it's more deactivating, leading to less reaction, hence lower para fraction. But since all have 0, their order is irrelevant.

But according to the options, perhaps the correct order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but substituent 4 is a stronger deactivator than 2 and 6. So the bromination would not proceed as much, leading to less product. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer, so if the reaction doesn't proceed, perhaps the para fraction is undefined, but in the context, it's assumed that the reaction occurs.

Wait, perhaps substituent 4 is a stronger deactivator, so the ring is less reactive, making para product less likely. But since all meta directors have 0 para, their order is not determined by reactivity but by substituent identity.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's priority is based on their -I effect.

But I'm confused. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

My analysis suggests that substituents 2,4,6 are first (0% para), then 3 (Cl) (moderate), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5).

Looking for an option that groups 2,4,6 first, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Option A has 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So 4 is first, then 2, then 6, then 3, 1, 5.

But why would substituent 4 come before 2 and 6? Maybe because substituent 4 is a stronger deactivating group. But that's about reactivity, not the para fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 4 has a higher percentage of para product than 2 and 6. No, because they're all meta directors, so their para fractions are zero.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Maybe substituent 3 (Cl) is a meta director. No, I don't think so. Cl is an o/p director.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the directing effects of each substituent:

- Methyl (CH3): o/p, activating.
- COOEt: meta, deactivating.
- Cl: o/p, deactivating.
- NO2: meta, deactivating.
- C2H5: o/p, activating.
- COOH: meta, deactivating.

So substituents 2,4,6 are meta directors (para fraction 0). Substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors (para fraction >0).

So the correct order is substituents 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, which option follows this?

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → No, it's 4,2,6,3,1,5.

But I have 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5. But in the options, 2,4,6 are in different orders.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering substituent 3's para fraction as higher than substituents 1 and 5, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) is a meta director. No, that's incorrect.

Wait, maybe I should think that substituent 3's para fraction is lower than substituents 1 and 5, but higher than meta directors.

So the order is 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, none have 2,4,6 first. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is based on the priority of substituents in terms of their activating/deactivating strength and their effect on para product.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the meta product instead of para. But the question clearly states para.

Wait, maybe the question is about the major product percentage, not the para fraction. But that's a different thing.

Wait, for substituents that are meta directors, the major product is meta, so para is minor. But in the problem statement, the para fraction is asked.

Hmm, perhaps I should refer to the options again.

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5, which is option A.

Because substituent 4 is the most deactivating (NO2), so the para fraction is the lowest. Then 2 (COOEt, ester), then 6 (COOH), then 3 (Cl), then 1 (CH3), then 5 (C2H5).

Wait, but substituents 2,4,6 are all meta directors, so their para fractions are 0. So the order between them doesn't matter for the para fraction but perhaps the question is considering their reactivity.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 4 is the strongest deactivator, so the reaction doesn't proceed as much, but the para fraction is zero in any case.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should make an educated guess.

Given that substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating o/p director, its para fraction is higher than the meta directors but lower than the activating groups. So the order would be:

2 <4 <6 <3 <1 <5.

So looking at the options, that's option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

Wait, no. Option A is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, substituent 4 comes before 2 and 6, but in this case, the para fraction is zero for all.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic substitution with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents attached to the benzene ring. Substituents can be either ortho/para (o/p) or meta directors, and they can be activating or deactivating. The weight fraction of the para-isomer depends on the substituent's directing effect and its influence on the reactivity of the benzene ring.

### Analysis of Substituents:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)**:  
   - Activating, o/p director.  
   - The para-isomer is a major product due to the activating nature of the methyl group.

2. **C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (Ester group)**:  
   - Deactivating, meta director.  
   - The para-isomer is not formed in significant amounts, resulting in a negligible weight fraction.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**:  
   - Deactivating, o/p director.  
   - The para-isomer is formed, but in lower amounts compared to activating groups due to the deactivating nature of chlorine.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)**:  
   - Deactivating, meta director.  
   - The para-isomer is not formed, resulting in a negligible weight fraction.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)**:  
   - Activating, o/p director.  
   - The para-isomer is a major product, and due to steric hindrance, it is favored over the ortho-isomer.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)**:  
   - Deactivating, meta director.  
   - The para-isomer is not formed, resulting in a negligible weight fraction.

### Order of Increasing Weight Fraction of the Para-Isomer:
- Substituents that are meta directors (2, 4, 6) have the lowest weight fraction of the para-isomer (effectively 0%).  
- Among the o/p directors, substituent 3 (Cl) has a lower para fraction than the activating groups 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5).  
- Substituent 5 (C2H5) has the highest para fraction due to its strong activating effect and steric hindrance favoring para substitution.

Thus, the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:  
**2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Correct Option:
**A) 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**
