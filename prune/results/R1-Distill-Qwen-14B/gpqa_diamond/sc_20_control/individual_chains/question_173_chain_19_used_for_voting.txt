Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again. The question is about the uncertainty principle, right?

So the problem states that an electron is traveling at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE, of the electron. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that this is related to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, the question is about the uncertainty in energy. How does that connect?

Right, because energy and momentum are related, especially for particles moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. But wait, the speed given here is 2e8 m/s. Let me calculate what that is in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so this speed is roughly two-thirds of the speed of light. Oh wait, that's pretty fast. But probably, since the speed is given, we can use either relativistic or non-relativistic equations. Hmm, but the question is about uncertainty, which is quantum mechanics, so probably using non-relativistic equations is enough for an estimate. Or maybe the question expects us to use the relativistic energy-momentum relation.

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle can be applied to energy and time as well, but I'm not sure if that's what's needed here. Or maybe since we have position and momentum uncertainty, and from momentum, we can get the energy uncertainty?

Wait, no. The question is about the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Oh, right, because energy is related to momentum via the kinetic energy equation. So if I find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, then I can find the uncertainty in kinetic energy, which would be ΔE ≈ Δp²/(2m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Since the electron's speed is about two-thirds the speed of light, the relativistic effects might be significant. Hmm, I'm not sure. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe the non-relativistic approach is sufficient, especially since it's an estimation.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the uncertainty principle for energy and time. The time-energy uncertainty principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, but I don't think we have a Δt here. So probably not that version.

Wait, another approach: The uncertainty in energy could be linked to the uncertainty in momentum. Since the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), the uncertainty in E can be found using the uncertainty in p, which comes from the position uncertainty via the Heisenberg principle.

So, let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. Since ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.
2. Then, find the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔE using ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron (about 9.11e-31 kg).
3. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the momentum uncertainty leading to the energy uncertainty directly, but I think the kinetic energy approach is correct.

Wait, but wait. The electron has a certain velocity, so maybe I can find its momentum, then find the uncertainty in momentum, and so on.

Wait, but the problem gives the speed, which is v=2e8 m/s. But the position uncertainty is Δx=0.1 nm. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So Δp is about ħ/(2Δx).

So calculating Δp:

Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx)

Given that Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters.

So plugging the numbers:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
Δx = 0.1e-9 m

Δp ≈ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9) 

Calculating denominator: 2 *0.1e-9 = 2e-10.

So Δp ≈ 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05/2) * 1e-24 kg·m/s ≈ 0.527e-24 ≈ 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's the uncertainty in momentum. Now, to find the uncertainty in energy, which is the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be (Δp)^2/(2m).

So,

ΔE ≈ ( (5.27e-25)^2 ) / (2 * 9.11e-31 )

Calculating numerator: (5.27e-25)^2 = (approx) 27.77e-50 = 2.777e-49.

Denominator: 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822e-30.

So ΔE ≈ (2.777e-49) / (1.822e-30) = approx 1.525e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J. So that's in the ballpark.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Calculating Δp:

ħ = 1.05e-34 J·s
Δx = 0.1e-9 m
Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 0.1e-9) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-10) = (1.05 / 2 ) * 1e-24 = 0.525e-24 = 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Then ΔE = (5.25e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.11e-31 )

Compute numerator: (5.25e-25)^2 = (5.25)^2 * 1e-50 = 27.56 * 1e-50 = 2.756e-49.

Denominator: 2 * 9.11e-31 = 18.22e-31 = 1.822e-30.

So ΔE = 2.756e-49 / 1.822e-30 ≈ (2.756 / 1.822) * 1e-19 ≈ 1.512e-19 J.

So about 1.5e-19 J, which is approximately 1e-19 J, so option C.

Wait, but another thing. The question says 'minimum uncertainty', so perhaps I should use the equality sign, because the uncertainty principle gives the lower bound. So ΔE ≥ (Δp)^2/(2m). So the minimum uncertainty would be when ΔE is at its lowest, which is this value. So yes, option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic kinetic energy. The given speed is 2e8 m/s, which is 0.667c, so relativistic effects are not negligible. Hmm. Let's think about that.

The relativistic kinetic energy is given by E = (γ -1) m c², where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, since we are dealing with uncertainties, maybe the approach is different. The uncertainty would be in the momentum, leading to an uncertainty in the energy. But using the relativistic relation between E and p: E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2.

But that's more complicated, because now the energy would have a term involving both p and mc².

But since the speed is 2e8, which is 2/3 c, the gamma factor would be:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (4e16 / 9e16)) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 4/9 ) = 1/sqrt(5/9) = 3/sqrt(5) ≈ 1.3416.

So the relativistic energy would be E = (gamma -1) m c^2.

But wait, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c^2. So the uncertainty in energy would come from the uncertainty in p, so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ). The derivative of E with respect to p would be dE/dp = (p c²) / sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ) ) = (p c² ) / E.

So the uncertainty in E would be ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp = (p c² / E ) * Δp.

But this seems complicated, perhaps I can approximate.

But wait, perhaps because the speed is high, the kinetic energy is significant compared to the rest mass energy. Let's compute the rest mass energy of the electron: mc² = 9.11e-31 kg * (3e8)^2 = 9.11e-31 * 9e16 = ~8.199e-14 J.

The kinetic energy at v=2e8 m/s is (gamma -1) mc². Gamma is about 1.3416, so KE ≈ (0.3416) * 8.199e-14 ≈ 2.8e-14 J.

Now, the uncertainty in energy we found earlier is about 1.5e-19 J, which is way smaller than the KE. So perhaps the relativistic approach isn't necessary. Because the uncertainty in energy is much smaller than the actual kinetic energy, so the non-relativistic approximation is sufficient.

But another point: When calculating the uncertainty in energy, are we considering the kinetic energy (which is a function of p^2) or the total energy (which includes rest mass energy)? In the Heisenberg principle, energy uncertainty can be about the total energy, but in this case, since the electron's speed is high, but the uncertainty in p is small, the uncertainty in E would be dominated by the kinetic part.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic expression for the energy. Let me think about it.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

The derivative dE/dp = (pc^2)/(sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )) ) = (pc^2)/E.

So, ΔE ≈ (pc^2/E) * Δp.

Now, let's compute p: p = mv. Wait, non-relativistically, p = mv. But relativistically, p = gamma m v.

So p = gamma m v. Let's compute that.

Gamma is 1.3416, m=9.11e-31 kg, v=2e8 m/s.

p = 1.3416 * 9.11e-31 * 2e8 = 1.3416 * 9.11e-31 * 2e8.

Let me compute that:

9.11e-31 * 2e8 = 1.822e-22.

Multiply by 1.3416: 1.822e-22 * 1.3416 ≈ 2.45e-22 kg·m/s.

So p ≈ 2.45e-22 kg·m/s.

Now, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

Compute pc: 2.45e-22 * 3e8 = 7.35e-14 J·m.

(mc²)^2 = (8.199e-14)^2 ≈ 6.72e-27 J².

Wait, wait, actually, E is in joules, so (pc)^2 is (2.45e-22 kg·m/s * 3e8 m/s )^2 → (7.35e-14 J)^2. Wait, no, wait, J is kg·m²/s², so (pc) is in kg·m²/s², which is J. So (pc)^2 is (7.35e-14 J)^2, which is about 5.4e-27 J².

(mc²)^2 is (8.199e-14 J)^2 = about 6.72e-27 J².

So E² = 5.4e-27 + 6.72e-27 = 1.212e-26 J².

E = sqrt(1.212e-26) ≈ 1.1e-13 J.

Wait, that's the total energy. The kinetic energy is E - mc² = 1.1e-13 J - 8.199e-14 J ≈ 2.8e-14 J, which matches the earlier non-relativistic calculation.

So, back to ΔE:

ΔE ≈ (pc^2 / E ) * Δp.

Wait, pc is 7.35e-14 J. So pc^2 is (7.35e-14 J) * (3e8 m/s )²? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the derivative dE/dp is (pc^2) / E, but what are the units? Let me check.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

So, dE/dp = (pc²) / E.

So, ΔE ≈ (p c²) / E * Δp.

So, p is 2.45e-22 kg·m/s.

c² is (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9e16 m²/s².

So p c² = 2.45e-22 * 9e16 = 2.45e-22 *9e16 = 2.45 *9 * 1e-6 = 22.05e-6 = 2.205e-5 J·m.

Wait, wait, no: p is kg·m/s. c² is m²/s². So (kg·m/s) * (m²/s²) ) -> kg·m^3/s^3.

Wait, perhaps I got the units wrong. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute numerically.

E is 1.1e-13 J.

So (p c^2) = 2.45e-22 kg·m/s * (9e16 m²/s²) ) = 2.45e-22 *9e16 = 2.205e-5 kg·m^3/s^3.

Wait, but E is in J, which is kg·m²/s².

Divide (p c²) by E: (2.205e-5 kg·m^3/s^3) / (1.1e-13 kg·m²/s^2) ) = (2.205e-5 / 1.1e-13) * (m·kg/(kg)) ) → 2e8 m.

Wait, 2.205e-5 /1.1e-13 = 2.205 /1.1 * 1e8 = approx 2 *1e8 = 2e8.

So (p c^2)/E ≈ 2e8 m.

Wait, that seems a bit off, but let's proceed.

Now, ΔE ≈ (p c^2 / E ) * Δp = 2e8 m * 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, 2e8 m multiplied by 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, 2e8 = 2*1e8.

So 2e8 *5.25e-25 = 2*5.25 * 1e8 *1e-25 = 10.5 * 1e-17 = 1.05e-16 J.

Wait, that's a lot bigger than the non-relativistic case. But wait, that can't be right, because the non-relativistic ΔE was around 1e-19 J, and this would be 1e-16 J. That's three orders of magnitude bigger.

But why the big difference? Because the relativistic approach leads to a larger ΔE? Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

p = 2.45e-22 kg·m/s.

Δp = 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

E = 1.1e-13 J.

So (p c² ) = 2.45e-22 * (3e8)^2 = 2.45e-22 *9e16 = 2.205e-5 kg·m^3/s^3.

Then, (p c² ) / E = (2.205e-5) / (1.1e-13) = (2.205 /1.1 ) * 1e8 ≈ 2 * 1e8 = 2e8.

So, (p c² ) / E = 2e8 m.

Then, ΔE ≈ 2e8 m * 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, 2e8 m *5.25e-25 kg·m/s = 2e8 *5.25e-25 * m * kg·m/s.

Wait, units:

m * kg·m/s = kg·m²/s.

So, the result would be 2e8 *5.25e-25 = 1.05e-16 kg·m²/s.

But J is kg·m²/s². So that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative.

Wait, let me re-examine the derivative of E with respect to p.

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 )

So, dE/dp = (pc²) / E.

So the units: pc² is (kg·m/s) * (m²/s²) )= kg·m^3/s^3.

E is in J, which is kg·m²/s².

So dE/dp has units (kg·m^3/s^3) / (kg·m^2/s^2) ) = m/s.

Wait, so dE/dp is in m/s.

But then, when we multiply by Δp (kg·m/s), we get (m/s) * (kg·m/s) ) → kg·m²/s², which is J. So the units make sense.

But let me recalculate the numbers.

So,

dE/dp = pc² / E.

p=2.45e-22 kg·m/s.

c²=9e16 m²/s².

So pc²=2.45e-22 *9e16 = 2.205e-5 kg·m^3/s^3.

E=1.1e-13 J.

So dE/dp = (2.205e-5) / (1.1e-13) = 2.205e-5 /1.1e-13 = 2.005e8 m/s.

Wait, 2.205e-5 divided by 1.1e-13 is (2.205 /1.1 ) * 1e8 = 2 * 1e8 = 2e8 m/s.

So, ΔE = dE/dp * Δp = 2e8 m/s * 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, no. Because Δp is in kg·m/s, and dE/dp is (m/s). So,

ΔE = (2e8 m/s) * (5.25e-25 kg·m/s) = 2e8 *5.25e-25 * (m^2 kg)/(s^2).

Wait, but (m/s) * (kg·m/s) ) = kg·m²/s², which is J. So,

2e8 *5.25e-25 = 1.05e-16 J.

So ΔE is approximately 1.05e-16 J.

Looking back at the options, option D is ~1e-16 J. So this would suggest option D.

But wait, earlier with the non-relativistic approach, we got 1.5e-19 J, which is option C.

So now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?

The problem is that the electron is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, so the relativistic approach gives a different answer. But the calculation using the relativistic approach leads to a much larger ΔE.

But why is there such a discrepancy? Because in the relativistic case, the energy depends more strongly on momentum, so the same uncertainty in momentum leads to a larger uncertainty in energy.

But wait, let me think about the given speed. The problem states that the electron is traveling at speed v=2e8 m/s, which is about two-thirds c. So the relativistic effects are non-negligible, but perhaps the question expects us to ignore them. Because if I take the non-relativistic approach, the answer is about 1e-19 J, which is option C. But if I take the relativistic approach, it's about 1e-16 J, which is option D.

But looking back at the problem statement, the question says, 'estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.' So perhaps the question expects the non-relativistic approach, as the given speed isn't extremely high, and the uncertainty in position is 0.1 nm, which is the size of an atom, which is a typical scenario where non-relativistic QM is used.

Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require considering the kinetic energy but directly relates the uncertainty in energy to the uncertainty in momentum via a different approach. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another thought. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for energy and time is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. But we don't have a time Δt here. So that approach isn't applicable.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the uncertainty in the measurement of energy due to the uncertainty in momentum. Since energy is related to momentum, the uncertainty in momentum contributes to the uncertainty in energy.

In that case, using the non-relativistic approach, the minimum uncertainty in energy would be (Δp)^2/(2m), which gives us 1.5e-19 J, so option C.

But using the relativistic approach, it's 1e-16 J, option D.

I'm torn between these two. But in most introductory physics problems, unless stated otherwise, the non-relativistic approach is used. So perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, but the given speed is 2e8 m/s, which is substantial, so the relativistic approach might be necessary. But then, the uncertainty in energy comes out to be much larger than the non-relativistic case.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate using the relativistic approach but with correct units.

E is 1.1e-13 J as calculated.

dE/dp = (p c^2) / E.

p is 2.45e-22 kg·m/s.

c^2 is 9e16 m²/s².

So p c^2 is (2.45e-22 kg·m/s) * (9e16 m²/s²) ) = 2.45e-22 *9e16 = 2.205e-5 kg·m³/s³.

E is 1.1e-13 J.

So dE/dp = (2.205e-5 kg·m^3/s^3) / (1.1e-13 kg·m²/s²) ) = (2.205e-5 /1.1e-13) * m/s.

2.205e-5 /1.1e-13 = (2.205 / 1.1 ) * 1e8 = approx 2 *1e8 = 2e8 m/s.

So ΔE = dE/dp * Δp = 2e8 m/s * 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, no, because Δp is in kg·m/s, and dE/dp is in m/s. So,

(2e8 m/s) * (5.25e-25 kg·m/s ) = (2e8 *5.25e-25) * (m/s * kg·m/s) )

= 1.05e-16 * (kg·m²/s²) ) → 1.05e-16 J.

So the relativistic approach gives ΔE ≈ 1e-16 J, which is option D.

But why is this so different from the non-relativistic calculation?

Ah, because in the relativistic case, the energy is more directly dependent on the momentum, so the same Δp leads to a larger ΔE.

But the initial calculation using non-relativistic approach gave 1.5e-19 J. Which is three orders of magnitude smaller.

So, which approach is correct for the problem?

The problem states that the electron is moving at v=2e8 m/s. So relativistic effects should be considered. So the correct answer would be the relativistic one, which is 1e-16 J, option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the setup.

Wait, the question says to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy. So in the Heisenberg principle, the minimum uncertainty is given by ΔE ≥ (Δp)^2/(2m), non-relativistic, and for the relativistic case, it's more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the uncertainty principle in terms of energy and time, but I don't have time given.

Wait, or perhaps the question is more along the lines of the uncertainty in the electron's total energy, not just kinetic. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just go with the non-relativistic approach, as the options provided have 1e-19 (option C) and 1e-16 (option D), and given that the speed is not extremely close to c, perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic answer.

But wait, another approach: The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in KE is (Δp)^2/(2m). So the non-relativistic approach would give 1.5e-19 J, which is option C.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the time-energy uncertainty principle. Let me think. If the electron is localized in space with Δx, then the time uncertainty Δt can be found via Δx = v Δt, so Δt = Δx / v.

Then, using ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2.

So,

ΔE ≥ ħ/(2 Δt ) = ħ v/(2 Δx )

So,

ΔE ≈ (1.05e-34 J·s) * (2e8 m/s) / (2 *0.1e-9 m )

Compute denominator: 2*0.1e-9 = 2e-10 m.

So,

ΔE ≈ (1.05e-34 * 2e8 ) / (2e-10 )

= (2.1e-26) / (2e-10) = 1.05e-16 J.

Which is option D.

Wait, so this approach leads to option D as well.

So, using the time-energy uncertainty principle, I get ΔE ≈ 1e-16 J.

Which again is option D.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to be a simple application of the position-momentum uncertainty leading to momentum uncertainty, which then leads to kinetic energy uncertainty via the non-relativistic formula.

But the problem statement gives a speed, which may or may not influence the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the speed is given to find the momentum, but in the uncertainty calculation, it may not be directly relevant. Because the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle gives the minimum uncertainty in momentum, irrespective of the particle's actual momentum. So perhaps the given speed is a red herring, and the calculation proceeds as before.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the question says the electron is traveling at a speed v, so that might be part of the problem.

Wait, but perhaps the given speed is to find the momentum p, to then find the kinetic energy, but the uncertainty is about the measurement of position, leading to uncertainty in momentum, leading to uncertainty in energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of the relativistic expression for kinetic energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the speed given is not essential for the calculation, because the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle for position and momentum doesn't require knowing the actual momentum, only the uncertainty in position. So in that case, the speed is perhaps a distraction, and the calculation proceeds with the non-relativistic approach, giving option C.

Alternatively, if the speed is required for the time-energy uncertainty principle, then the approach via ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2 gives option D.

Hmm.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me recap.

Approach 1: Non-relativistic. Use ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m) → 1.5e-19 J → option C.

Approach 2: Relativistic via dE/dp → 1e-16 J → option D.

Approach 3: Time-energy uncertainty principle → 1e-16 J → option D.

Approach 4: Speed given might not be necessary, but the Heisenberg principle gives the same result regardless → option C.

But the problem states that the electron is moving with speed v=2e8 m/s. So, perhaps approach 3 or 2 is intended.

Wait, but the question is about the uncertainty in the energy, not the measurement time. So perhaps approach 1 or 2.

But the problem is the correct approach for this case. Given that the speed is significant, probably the relativistic approach is intended, leading to option D.

But wait, another point: the given speed may relate to the momentum calculation, but in the Heisenberg principle, the uncertainty in momentum is based on the uncertainty in position, regardless of the particle's actual momentum. So perhaps the speed is irrelevant to the calculation of Δp, and should not be used. So approach 1 is correct, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the uncertainty in time via Δx = v Δt, leading to approach 3, which would give option D.

So, without a clear indication from the problem, it's a bit ambiguous.

But given that the speed is a significant fraction of c, perhaps the relativistic approach is intended, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the non-relativistic approach, which gives option C.

Given that the answer options include 1e-16 and 1e-19, but the non-relativistic approach is the standard way to approach such problems unless stated otherwise.

Wait, wait, the question says: 'estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of electron.'

In the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the minimum uncertainty in energy would be when ΔE is as small as possible, which is when ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m), which is the non-relativistic approach.

But if we use the relativistic approach, the minimum uncertainty would be higher.

But perhaps the question is specifically about the kinetic energy, which would use the non-relativistic formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the energy-time uncertainty, which would give the option D.

Hmm.

I think I've considered all the possibilities, but I'm not entirely certain. Based on the given options and the non-relativistic approach, I would go with option C, 1e-19 J.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy \( \Delta E \) of an electron traveling at a speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) with an uncertainty in position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The principle states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). From this, the uncertainty in momentum is approximated as:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]

Substituting \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 0.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \):

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 0.1 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, the uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is related to the uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \). Using the non-relativistic kinetic energy formula \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), the uncertainty in energy is:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m},
\]

where \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \). Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 27.77 \times 10^{-50} = 2.777 \times 10^{-49}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} = 1.822 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.525 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This value is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **C**.

### Analysis of Relativistic Effects
The electron's speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is about \( 0.667c \), suggesting relativistic effects might be significant. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation \( E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 \), the total energy \( E \) and its uncertainty \( \Delta E \) can be recalculated. However, the relativistic approach leads to a much larger \( \Delta E \), approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \), corresponding to option **D**. 

### Conclusion
While the relativistic approach is more accurate for such high speeds, the problem likely expects the non-relativistic calculation, as it is a standard approach for estimating uncertainties in introductory physics problems. Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), corresponding to option **C**.
