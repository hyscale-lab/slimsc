Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The length is L, and I need to find the energies for the ground state, first excited, and second excited states.

Wait, wait, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for each energy level is E_n = (n² * π² * ℏ²) / (2mL²), right? And they've given E as pi² ℏ²/(2mL²), so E is actually the ground state energy when n=1. So each particle's energy would be E multiplied by n squared, where n is the quantum number.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Are they fermions or bosons? Oh, right, spin-1/2 particles are fermions. So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system.

So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. But wait, in a 1D infinite well, the spin doesn't contribute to the orbital part, right? Because the spatial part is determined by n, the principal quantum number. So for the spatial wavefunction, each must have a unique n, but because spin is 1/2, each can have two possible spin states (up and down).

Wait, but in a 1D well, the spin doesn't affect the spatial part, so each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So for n=1, you can have two particles (spin up and down), same for n=2, etc.

So now, we have four identical fermions. Each can occupy a state with a unique n or with the same n but different spin. So let's think about filling up the states according to the Pauli exclusion.

In the ground state, the lowest energy is achieved by filling the lowest available states. Let's see:

- For n=1, since it's a spin-1/2 particle, two particles can occupy n=1 (with opposite spins).
- Next, n=2 can hold two more particles.

Wait, but wait: four particles. So n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So the ground state configuration is that two are in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, wait, but wait. No, each particle is in a unique quantum state. So for each particle, their quantum numbers (n and spin) must be unique. So for n=1, you can have two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can also have two particles (spin up and down). So four particles in total. So the ground state would have two in n=1, two in n=2.

Now, the energy of the ground state is the sum of each particle's energy. Each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1²) = E, and each in n=2 contributes E*(2²) =4E. So with two in each, the total energy would be (2 * E) + (2 *4E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, no. Because each particle in n=1 is a separate state, but the energy is just based on n. So for the four particles, each in their own n level, but wait, no, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no, for four particles, each must have a unique combination of n and spin. So for n=1, two particles (spin up and down). For n=2, two more (spin up and down). So the total energy is (2 particles * E) + (2 particles *4E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But wait, the options don't have that as the ground state. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 30E,39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Hmm, so in option B, the ground state is 4E, which is lower than 10E. But according to our calculation, the ground state would be 10E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Are the four particles being treated as distinguishable? No, they are identical fermions, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the particles as distinguishable, but no, the question says identical spin-1/2 particles, so they are fermions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the ground state energy. Let me think again.

Each state is uniquely defined by n and spin. So for each n, two particles can be placed.

In the ground state, the four particles fill the lowest possible states. So:

n=1: two particles (spin up and down).

n=2: two particles (spin up and down).

So the energies are: two at E, two at 4E. So total energy is (2*1 + 2*4) E = (2 +8) E =10E.

So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D's ground state is 10E, which is option D's first number.

But let's think about the excited states. The question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, perhaps I've miscalculated. Let me think differently. Maybe the system can have multiple particles in the same n value because of spin, but each can only have two particles (spin up and down).

Wait, but four particles would have to fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles), so the energy is 10E as before.

But looking at the options, the ground state is 10E in option D, but in option C the ground state is 4E. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 4E is lower than 10E, but 4E is for n=2, which is higher than n=1.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the ground state is the lowest possible energy, which would be when all the particles are in the lowest possible n states.

Wait, but four particles in a 1D box with spin-1/2. So each n can have two particles. So n=1: 2, n=2:2. So the ground state is when all four are filled into n=1 and n=2, so the energies are 1²E and 2²E.

So total energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2*E + 2*4E = 10E.

So ground state is 10E. Now, but wait, the options don't have 10E as the ground state except for option D.

Wait, let's look at the options again. So the options give different energies for the ground state.

Option B: 4E, 10E, 50E.

So ground state 4E. But that would imply that the four particles are all in n=2. But that's impossible because with spin-1/2, each n can hold two. So to have four particles, they would be in n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), leading to 10E. So how can the ground state be 4E?

Wait, perhaps the particles are bosons, but the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions. So that can't be the case. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the particles are spinless, but the question says spin-1/2, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps each particle is in a separate state, but what's the lowest possible arrangement?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the ground state. Let me think: since each level can take two particles, the four particles would fill n=1 (2), n=2 (2), so the total energy is 10E.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the only option that starts with 10E is option D.

Wait, but the options are about the ground, first, and second excited states. Let me see what the options say:

Option D says 10E, 15E, 18E.

So perhaps the ground state is 10E, then the first excited state would have a higher energy.

But wait, how do the excited states come about? The ground state is the lowest possible configuration. The first excited state would be the next possible lowest energy.

So let's think about how to get the first excited state. The first excited state would involve moving one particle to a higher energy level, while keeping others as low as possible.

So in the ground state, the particles are in n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). Now, to get the first excited state, perhaps we move one of the n=2 particles to a higher n, but that would increase the total energy.

Wait, but what's the next available state after n=2? That's n=3, which has energy 9E. So moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 would increase the energy by 5E (from 4E to 9E: 9E-4E=5E). So the total energy would be (2*1 + 1*4 +1*9)= 2 +4 +9=15E.

Wait, but wait, we can't have more than two particles in a given n. So after moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, we now have n=3 with one particle. But can't have more than two, so that's allowed.

So the first excited state would then have energies: 2 particles in n=1 (2E), 1 in n=2 (4E), and 1 in n=3 (9E). So total is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but wait, perhaps it's the next possible arrangement. Maybe the first excited state is achieved by moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So the energy is 2*E + 1*4E +1*9E = 2 +4 +9=15E.

So the first excited state energy would be 15E.

Now, the second excited state would be the next possible arrangement. What's the next higher energy configuration?

Possibly, moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, no, because n=2 has two particles in the ground state. Wait, no, in the ground state, n=2 has two particles. So in the first excited state, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait, but that's only possible if you promote one of the n=2 particles. Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when you have two in n=1, two in n=3. Because in ground state, n=3 is empty.

But wait, can you have two particles in n=3? Yes, because each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So if you move two particles from n=2 to n=3, that would require moving two particles, which would increase the energy by 2*(9E -4E)=10E. So the total would be 2E (n=1) + 0E (n=2 now has 0 particles) + 2*9E= 2 +18=20E.

But wait, another possibility is that the first excited state is when you have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), and the second excited state would be when you have two in n=1, two in n=3 (2*9E=18E) plus the two in n=1 (2E), total 2 + 18 =20E. But wait, 20E isn't an option, so maybe I'm doing this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4.

Wait, let me think again. Another approach: the ground state is 10E. The first excited state is 15E. Then the second excited state would be higher than that.

Wait, another possibility is that the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. No, wait, in that case, n=3 can have two, but perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is moved up. But wait, no, because the lowest state is n=1, so you can't have a particle in a lower state than that. So the first excited state must involve moving a particle from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but let me think about the ordering.

The ground state is 10E.

The first excited state is 15E.

What about the second excited state? Let's think: perhaps the next configuration is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So each n=3 can hold two particles.

Wait, but then the energies would be 2*4E (n=2) and 2*9E (n=3). So 8E +18E =26E.

But none of the options have 26E. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when you have three particles in n=2 and one in n=3. But wait, n=2 can't hold more than two particles. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4.

Wait, let me think: the total energy is (2*E) + (1*4E) + (1*9E) =15E for the first excited.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is moved to a higher n, say n=4. So that would be (2*E) + (1*4E) + (1*9E) +1*16E. Wait, but that's five particles, but we have only four.

Wait, no. So perhaps in the second excited state, three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But that's impossible because n=2 can only hold two.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. But that's the same as the ground state, which is 10E. No, that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the way to think about this is to consider the possible configurations and their energies, then order them.

So the possible configurations for four fermions in a 1D box with spin-1/2 are:

1. All four particles can't be in n=1 because each n can hold only two. So, the first configuration is n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), which is 10E.

2. Next, the first excited state would have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1). So 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 2 +4 +9 =15E.

3. The second excited state could be when we have n=1 (2), n=3 (2). That's 2*1 + 2*9 =2+18=20E.

But none of the options list 20E, so perhaps this is not correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. So where does 18E come from?

Wait, another possibility: the second excited state is when you have n=2 (2) and n=3 (2). So 2*4 + 2*9=8 +18=26E.

No, that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two are in n=2 and two in n=3, but that would be higher than 15E.

Wait, but perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and another in n=3, but that's not possible because in ground state, n=2 is full.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

The ground state is 10E. The first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, making the configuration n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So energy 15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle moves up. So from n=2 to n=4, perhaps. So configuration would be n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:0? No, wait, that's still 15E. Alternatively, perhaps two particles move up to n=3 and n=2 is at one.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2. But that would require three particles in n=2, which is impossible because each n can only hold two.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the possible states. Let's consider all possible states.

Another approach: the possible total energies are the sum of the individual energies, each being n² E. So for four particles, each in their own n level, but considering spin.

The lowest possible is when the four are in n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), sum is 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 10E.

Next, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So the sum is 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) = 2+4+9=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=4, so sum is 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) +1*(16) but wait, that's four particles, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. Wait, but that would sum to 2*(4) + 2*(9) =8 +18=26E. Which is higher than 15E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=4, but then we'd have 2*(1) + 1*(4) +1*(9) +1*(16) = 2+4+9+16=31E. But that's even higher.

Wait, but the option D's second excited state is 18E, which is 18E. So how can that be achieved?

Wait, 18E would be when two particles are in n=3. Because 2 *9E=18E. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. So the sum is 2*1 + 0*4 +2*9=2 +0 +18=20E. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, another way: perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2, but that's not possible because that would require three particles in n=2.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in considering which configurations are possible.

Wait, let me think: the ground state is 10E.

The first excited state is 15E.

The second excited state could be when we have two particles in n=3 and two in n=2. So the sum is 2*4 + 2*9=8 +18=26E.

But that's not in any option.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm calculating the energies.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energies are assigned per particle, but the total energy is the sum. So for the ground state, each of the four particles contributes their individual energy.

Wait, no, each particle's energy is their own n² E. So the total is sum of each.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the spin multiplicity correctly. Let me think: since each n can hold two particles, the first four particles would fill n=1 (two), n=2 (two), so ground state is 10E.

Now, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the configuration n=1: two, n=2: one, n=3: one.

So the energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making n=1: two, n=2: one, n=3: two. Wait, but each n can hold two, so n=3 can have two. But wait, that would require moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is n=1: two, n=2: one (since one was moved to n=3?), no, wait, n=2 had two in the ground state. Wait, in the first excited state, we've moved one to n=3, so n=2 has one left.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy 10E.

First excited: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Energy 15E.

Second excited: n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So energy is 2*1 + 0*4 +2*9 = 2 +0 +18=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4. But that's 2*9 +1*16 =18 +16=34E. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would give 9+16=25, plus 2*1 +1*4=6, total 6+25=31E. Which is way higher than options.

Hmm, I'm not matching any options. So perhaps I should look at the options again.

Looking at option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

How can 18E be achieved? It would require the sum of the energies to be 18E.

Wait, 18E is 18 units of E. So perhaps the particles are arranged as 1,1,2,3. So n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). But that sums to 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E. Not 18E.

Wait, maybe another configuration. Let's think of 1,1,2,3 as 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So 15E.

Alternatively, perhaps the four particles are in n=1, n=2, n=3, and n=4. So each in a different n. So 1^2 +2^2 +3^2 +4^2=1+4+9+16=30. So 30E. Which is option A's ground state.

But that would be higher than the ground state we calculated earlier, which is 10E. So that can't be the ground state.

Wait, but wait, that would imply that all four particles are in different n's, each with n=1,2,3,4. But that would require each n holds one particle, but since each n can hold two (spin up and down), that's possible only if the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=2, etc.

Wait, but if we have four particles, the possible configurations must fill the lowest possible n's first, with each n holding two particles. So 10E is the ground state.

So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the particles are bosons, not fermions. Because if they are bosons, they can all be in the same state.

But the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering the spin, and each particle must have a unique n. But that would mean each particle must be in a different n, which would require four distinct n's. That would make the ground state have four particles in n=1,2,3,4.

So the ground state would be E*(1+4+9+16)=30E, which is option A's first option.

But that can't be, because if they are fermions, they can have two in each n.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the particles as distinguishable, but the question says identical, so that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that I'm considering each particle's spin. But in reality, when the potential is symmetric, the spin doesn't affect the spatial wavefunction, so each n can have two particles (spin up and down).

Wait, but the question says four particles, so that's two in n=1 (2 particles) and two in n=2 (2 particles), giving 10E as ground state.

But the options don't have that except for option D. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, which lists 10E,15E,18E.

But where does 18E come from? Because 18E would be 2*9E, which is two particles in n=3, but that would require that in the second excited state, particles are promoted to higher n's.

But wait, in the ground state, two particles are in n=1, two in n=2.

First excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy 15E.

Second excited state: two in n=1, two in n=3. So each in n=3 can have two particles (spin up and down). So the energy is 2*(1) + 2*(9) =2+18=20E.

But that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, making the configuration two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. So the energy would be 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(16)= 2+4+16=22E.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy levels are filled in a way that the first excited state is when one particle is in a higher n. But I'm not seeing how to get 18E.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. The ground state is 10E. The first excited state is 15E. The second excited state could be when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. But that would give 2*(9) +2*(16)= 18+32=50E. Which is option B's third option.

Hmm, but that would make the ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 50E. But that's not an option in the choices.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4. But that's three particles, so it's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again.

If four identical spin-1/2 particles are in the ground state, they fill up the lowest possible n's with two particles each. So n=1 and n=2, giving 10E.

First excited state: one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=3 has one, n=2 has one. So 15E.

Second excited state: another particle moves to n=3. So now, n=3 has two, n=2 has zero. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=3:2. So energy is 2*1 + 2*9=2+18=20E.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4. So 2*9 +1*16 =18+16=34E. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that's 9+16=25, plus 2*1=2, total 27E. Still not an option.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So the third energy is 18E. How is that possible?

18E would be 2*(9E) = 18E. So that would be when two particles are in n=3. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=3:2. So 2*1 + 2*9 =2+18=20E. That doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of 1² + 2² + 3² + 4² =1+4+9+16=30E. Which is option A's first option.

Wait, but that would require each particle in a different n, but that's not possible in the ground state for fermions because each n can take two.

So perhaps the correct approach is to list all possible total energies for four particles in the well and then order them.

The possible total energies are:

1. All four in n=1 (impossible because each n can take two only).

Wait, no, n=1 can take two, n=2 can take two. So that's 10E.

Another possibility is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That's 15E.

Another possibility: two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum is 20E.

Another: two in n=2, two in n=3. Sum is 26E.

Another: one in n=1, three in n=2. But n=2 can only hold two, so impossible.

Another: one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Sum would be 1 + (2*4) +9=1+8+9=18E.

Wait, that's 18E. So configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1.

So the energies would be 1*(1) +2*(4) +1*(9) =1+8+9=18E.

So in this case, the total energy is 18E.

So now, let's order the possible energies.

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E (two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3).

Second excited state: 18E (one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3).

Because 18E is higher than 15E.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think about the possible order.

Wait, the possible energy levels are:

- 10E (2,2)

- 15E (2,1,1)

- 18E (1,2,1)

- 20E (2,0,2)

So the order would be 10E <15E <18E <20E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Which matches option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So option D would be the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we start by recalling the energy levels for a particle in such a well. The energy of the $n$-th level is given by:

\[
E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2},
\]

where $E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ is the ground state energy for $n=1$. Thus, the energy of the $n$-th level can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.

Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which requires that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In a 1D infinite potential well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number $n$ and the spin. Each energy level $n$ can hold a maximum of two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down).

### Ground State
In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest available energy levels. The lowest two levels, $n=1$ and $n=2$, each hold two particles (one spin up and one spin down). The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State
The first excited state is obtained by promoting one particle from $n=2$ to $n=3$. The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in $n=1$,
- One particle in $n=2$,
- One particle in $n=3$.

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 1(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State
The second excited state is obtained by promoting another particle from $n=2$ to $n=3$. The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in $n=1$,
- Two particles in $n=3$.

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 2(3^2E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

However, this configuration does not match the options provided. Instead, the second excited state can also be achieved by having:
- One particle in $n=1$,
- Two particles in $n=2$,
- One particle in $n=3$.

The total energy for this configuration is:

\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
\]

### Conclusion
The ground state energy is $10E$, the first excited state energy is $15E$, and the second excited state energy is $18E$. This matches the options in **D**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The length is L, and I need to find the energies for the ground state, first excited, and second excited states.

Wait, wait, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for each energy level is E_n = (n² * π² * ℏ²) / (2mL²), right? And they've given E as pi² ℏ²/(2mL²), so E is actually the ground state energy when n=1. So each particle's energy would be E multiplied by n squared, where n is the quantum number.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Are they fermions or bosons? Oh, right, spin-1/2 particles are fermions. So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system.

So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. But wait, in a 1D infinite well, the spin doesn't contribute to the orbital part, right? Because the spatial part is determined by n, the principal quantum number. So for the spatial wavefunction, each must have a unique n, but because spin is 1/2, each can have two possible spin states (up and down).

Wait, but in a 1D well, the spin doesn't affect the spatial part, so each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So for n=1, you can have two particles (spin up and down), same for n=2, etc.

So now, we have four identical fermions. Each can occupy a state with a unique n or with the same n but different spin. So let's think about filling up the states according to the Pauli exclusion.

In the ground state, the lowest energy is achieved by filling the lowest available states. Let's see:

- For n=1, since it's a spin-1/2 particle, two particles can occupy n=1 (with opposite spins).
- Next, n=2 can hold two more particles.

Wait, but wait: four particles. So n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So the ground state configuration is that two are in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, wait, but wait. No, each particle is in a unique quantum state. So for each particle, their quantum numbers (n and spin) must be unique. So for n=1, you can have two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can also have two particles (spin up and down). So four particles in total. So the ground state would have two in n=1, two in n=2.

Now, the energy of the ground state is the sum of each particle's energy. Each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1²) = E, and each in n=2 contributes E*(2²) =4E. So with two in each, the total energy would be (2 * E) + (2 *4E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, no. Because each particle in n=1 is a separate state, but the energy is just based on n. So for the four particles, each in their own n level, but wait, no, no. Let me think again.

Wait, no, for four particles, each must have a unique combination of n and spin. So for n=1, two particles (spin up and down). For n=2, two more (spin up and down). So the total energy is (2 particles * E) + (2 particles *4E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But wait, the options don't have that as the ground state. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 30E,39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

Hmm, so in option B, the ground state is 4E, which is lower than 10E. But according to our calculation, the ground state would be 10E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Are the four particles being treated as distinguishable? No, they are identical fermions, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the particles as distinguishable, but no, the question says identical spin-1/2 particles, so they are fermions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the ground state energy. Let me think again.

Each state is uniquely defined by n and spin. So for each n, two particles can be placed.

In the ground state, the four particles fill the lowest possible states. So:

n=1: two particles (spin up and down).

n=2: two particles (spin up and down).

So the energies are: two at E, two at 4E. So total energy is (2*1 + 2*4) E = (2 +8) E =10E.

So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D's ground state is 10E, which is option D's first number.

But let's think about the excited states. The question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, perhaps I've miscalculated. Let me think differently. Maybe the system can have multiple particles in the same n value because of spin, but each can only have two particles (spin up and down).

Wait, but four particles would have to fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles), so the energy is 10E as before.

But looking at the options, the ground state is 10E in option D, but in option C the ground state is 4E. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 4E is lower than 10E, but 4E is for n=2, which is higher than n=1.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the ground state is the lowest possible energy, which would be when all the particles are in the lowest possible n states.

Wait, but four particles in a 1D box with spin-1/2. So each n can have two particles. So n=1: 2, n=2:2. So the ground state is when all four are filled into n=1 and n=2, so the energies are 1²E and 2²E.

So total energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2*E + 2*4E = 10E.

So ground state is 10E. Now, but wait, the options don't have 10E as the ground state except for option D.

Wait, let's look at the options again. So the options give different energies for the ground state.

Option B: 4E, 10E, 50E.

So ground state 4E. But that would imply that the four particles are all in n=2. But that's impossible because with spin-1/2, each n can hold two. So to have four particles, they would be in n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), leading to 10E. So how can the ground state be 4E?

Wait, perhaps the particles are bosons, but the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions. So that can't be the case. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the particles are spinless, but the question says spin-1/2, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps each particle is in a separate state, but what's the lowest possible arrangement?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the ground state. Let me think: since each level can take two particles, the four particles would fill n=1 (2), n=2 (2), so the total energy is 10E.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the only option that starts with 10E is option D.

Wait, but the options are about the ground, first, and second excited states. Let me see what the options say:

Option D says 10E, 15E, 18E.

So perhaps the ground state is 10E, then the first excited state would have a higher energy.

But wait, how do the excited states come about? The ground state is the lowest possible configuration. The first excited state would be the next possible lowest energy.

So let's think about how to get the first excited state. The first excited state would involve moving one particle to a higher energy level, while keeping others as low as possible.

So in the ground state, the particles are in n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). Now, to get the first excited state, perhaps we move one of the n=2 particles to a higher n, but that would increase the total energy.

Wait, but what's the next available state after n=2? That's n=3, which has energy 9E. So moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 would increase the energy by 5E (from 4E to 9E: 9E-4E=5E). So the total energy would be (2*1 + 1*4 +1*9)= 2 +4 +9=15E.

Wait, but wait, we can't have more than two particles in a given n. So after moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, we now have n=3 with one particle. But can't have more than two, so that's allowed.

So the first excited state would then have energies: 2 particles in n=1 (2E), 1 in n=2 (4E), and 1 in n=3 (9E). So total is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but wait, perhaps it's the next possible arrangement. Maybe the first excited state is achieved by moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So the energy is 2*E + 1*4E +1*9E = 2 +4 +9=15E.

So the first excited state energy would be 15E.

Now, the second excited state would be the next possible arrangement. What's the next higher energy configuration?

Possibly, moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, no, because n=2 has two particles in the ground state. Wait, no, in the ground state, n=2 has two particles. So in the first excited state, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

Wait, but that's only possible if you promote one of the n=2 particles. Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when you have two in n=1, two in n=3. Because in ground state, n=3 is empty.

But wait, can you have two particles in n=3? Yes, because each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So if you move two particles from n=2 to n=3, that would require moving two particles, which would increase the energy by 2*(9E -4E)=10E. So the total would be 2E (n=1) + 0E (n=2 now has 0 particles) + 2*9E= 2 +18=20E.

But wait, another possibility is that the first excited state is when you have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3 (15E), and the second excited state would be when you have two in n=1, two in n=3 (2*9E=18E) plus the two in n=1 (2E), total 2 + 18 =20E. But wait, 20E isn't an option, so maybe I'm doing this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4.

Wait, let me think again. Another approach: the ground state is 10E. The first excited state is 15E. Then the second excited state would be higher than that.

Wait, another possibility is that the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. No, wait, in that case, n=3 can have two, but perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=1 is moved up. But wait, no, because the lowest state is n=1, so you can't have a particle in a lower state than that. So the first excited state must involve moving a particle from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but let me think about the ordering.

The ground state is 10E.

The first excited state is 15E.

What about the second excited state? Let's think: perhaps the next configuration is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So each n=3 can hold two particles.

Wait, but then the energies would be 2*4E (n=2) and 2*9E (n=3). So 8E +18E =26E.

But none of the options have 26E. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when you have three particles in n=2 and one in n=3. But wait, n=2 can't hold more than two particles. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4.

Wait, let me think: the total energy is (2*E) + (1*4E) + (1*9E) =15E for the first excited.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is moved to a higher n, say n=4. So that would be (2*E) + (1*4E) + (1*9E) +1*16E. Wait, but that's five particles, but we have only four.

Wait, no. So perhaps in the second excited state, three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But that's impossible because n=2 can only hold two.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. But that's the same as the ground state, which is 10E. No, that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the way to think about this is to consider the possible configurations and their energies, then order them.

So the possible configurations for four fermions in a 1D box with spin-1/2 are:

1. All four particles can't be in n=1 because each n can hold only two. So, the first configuration is n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), which is 10E.

2. Next, the first excited state would have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), and n=3 (1). So 2*1 +1*4 +1*9 = 2 +4 +9 =15E.

3. The second excited state could be when we have n=1 (2), n=3 (2). That's 2*1 + 2*9 =2+18=20E.

But none of the options list 20E, so perhaps this is not correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. So where does 18E come from?

Wait, another possibility: the second excited state is when you have n=2 (2) and n=3 (2). So 2*4 + 2*9=8 +18=26E.

No, that's not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two are in n=2 and two in n=3, but that would be higher than 15E.

Wait, but perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and another in n=3, but that's not possible because in ground state, n=2 is full.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

The ground state is 10E. The first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, making the configuration n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. So energy 15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle moves up. So from n=2 to n=4, perhaps. So configuration would be n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1, n=4:0? No, wait, that's still 15E. Alternatively, perhaps two particles move up to n=3 and n=2 is at one.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2. But that would require three particles in n=2, which is impossible because each n can only hold two.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the possible states. Let's consider all possible states.

Another approach: the possible total energies are the sum of the individual energies, each being n² E. So for four particles, each in their own n level, but considering spin.

The lowest possible is when the four are in n=1 (2) and n=2 (2), sum is 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 10E.

Next, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3. So the sum is 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) = 2+4+9=15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle is promoted to n=4, so sum is 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) +1*(16) but wait, that's four particles, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. Wait, but that would sum to 2*(4) + 2*(9) =8 +18=26E. Which is higher than 15E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3, and another in n=4, but then we'd have 2*(1) + 1*(4) +1*(9) +1*(16) = 2+4+9+16=31E. But that's even higher.

Wait, but the option D's second excited state is 18E, which is 18E. So how can that be achieved?

Wait, 18E would be when two particles are in n=3. Because 2 *9E=18E. So the configuration would be 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3. So the sum is 2*1 + 0*4 +2*9=2 +0 +18=20E. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, another way: perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2, but that's not possible because that would require three particles in n=2.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in considering which configurations are possible.

Wait, let me think: the ground state is 10E.

The first excited state is 15E.

The second excited state could be when we have two particles in n=3 and two in n=2. So the sum is 2*4 + 2*9=8 +18=26E.

But that's not in any option.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm calculating the energies.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energies are assigned per particle, but the total energy is the sum. So for the ground state, each of the four particles contributes their individual energy.

Wait, no, each particle's energy is their own n² E. So the total is sum of each.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the spin multiplicity correctly. Let me think: since each n can hold two particles, the first four particles would fill n=1 (two), n=2 (two), so ground state is 10E.

Now, the first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the configuration n=1: two, n=2: one, n=3: one.

So the energy is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle is promoted to n=3, making n=1: two, n=2: one, n=3: two. Wait, but each n can hold two, so n=3 can have two. But wait, that would require moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, so the configuration is n=1: two, n=2: one (since one was moved to n=3?), no, wait, n=2 had two in the ground state. Wait, in the first excited state, we've moved one to n=3, so n=2 has one left.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Ground state: n=1 (2), n=2 (2). Total energy 10E.

First excited: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Energy 15E.

Second excited: n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). So energy is 2*1 + 0*4 +2*9 = 2 +0 +18=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4. But that's 2*9 +1*16 =18 +16=34E. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that would give 9+16=25, plus 2*1 +1*4=6, total 6+25=31E. Which is way higher than options.

Hmm, I'm not matching any options. So perhaps I should look at the options again.

Looking at option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

How can 18E be achieved? It would require the sum of the energies to be 18E.

Wait, 18E is 18 units of E. So perhaps the particles are arranged as 1,1,2,3. So n=1 (two), n=2 (one), n=3 (one). But that sums to 2*1 +1*4 +1*9=15E. Not 18E.

Wait, maybe another configuration. Let's think of 1,1,2,3 as 2 particles in n=1, 1 in n=2, and 1 in n=3. So 15E.

Alternatively, perhaps the four particles are in n=1, n=2, n=3, and n=4. So each in a different n. So 1^2 +2^2 +3^2 +4^2=1+4+9+16=30. So 30E. Which is option A's ground state.

But that would be higher than the ground state we calculated earlier, which is 10E. So that can't be the ground state.

Wait, but wait, that would imply that all four particles are in different n's, each with n=1,2,3,4. But that would require each n holds one particle, but since each n can hold two (spin up and down), that's possible only if the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=2, etc.

Wait, but if we have four particles, the possible configurations must fill the lowest possible n's first, with each n holding two particles. So 10E is the ground state.

So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the particles are bosons, not fermions. Because if they are bosons, they can all be in the same state.

But the question says spin-1/2, which are fermions, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering the spin, and each particle must have a unique n. But that would mean each particle must be in a different n, which would require four distinct n's. That would make the ground state have four particles in n=1,2,3,4.

So the ground state would be E*(1+4+9+16)=30E, which is option A's first option.

But that can't be, because if they are fermions, they can have two in each n.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating the particles as distinguishable, but the question says identical, so that's not the case.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is that I'm considering each particle's spin. But in reality, when the potential is symmetric, the spin doesn't affect the spatial wavefunction, so each n can have two particles (spin up and down).

Wait, but the question says four particles, so that's two in n=1 (2 particles) and two in n=2 (2 particles), giving 10E as ground state.

But the options don't have that except for option D. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, which lists 10E,15E,18E.

But where does 18E come from? Because 18E would be 2*9E, which is two particles in n=3, but that would require that in the second excited state, particles are promoted to higher n's.

But wait, in the ground state, two particles are in n=1, two in n=2.

First excited state: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Total energy 15E.

Second excited state: two in n=1, two in n=3. So each in n=3 can have two particles (spin up and down). So the energy is 2*(1) + 2*(9) =2+18=20E.

But that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, making the configuration two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. So the energy would be 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(16)= 2+4+16=22E.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy levels are filled in a way that the first excited state is when one particle is in a higher n. But I'm not seeing how to get 18E.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. The ground state is 10E. The first excited state is 15E. The second excited state could be when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=4. But that would give 2*(9) +2*(16)= 18+32=50E. Which is option B's third option.

Hmm, but that would make the ground state 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 50E. But that's not an option in the choices.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4. But that's three particles, so it's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me think again.

If four identical spin-1/2 particles are in the ground state, they fill up the lowest possible n's with two particles each. So n=1 and n=2, giving 10E.

First excited state: one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=3 has one, n=2 has one. So 15E.

Second excited state: another particle moves to n=3. So now, n=3 has two, n=2 has zero. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=3:2. So energy is 2*1 + 2*9=2+18=20E.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=4. So 2*9 +1*16 =18+16=34E. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4, but that's 9+16=25, plus 2*1=2, total 27E. Still not an option.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So the third energy is 18E. How is that possible?

18E would be 2*(9E) = 18E. So that would be when two particles are in n=3. So the configuration is n=1:2, n=3:2. So 2*1 + 2*9 =2+18=20E. That doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of 1² + 2² + 3² + 4² =1+4+9+16=30E. Which is option A's first option.

Wait, but that would require each particle in a different n, but that's not possible in the ground state for fermions because each n can take two.

So perhaps the correct approach is to list all possible total energies for four particles in the well and then order them.

The possible total energies are:

1. All four in n=1 (impossible because each n can take two only).

Wait, no, n=1 can take two, n=2 can take two. So that's 10E.

Another possibility is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. That's 15E.

Another possibility: two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum is 20E.

Another: two in n=2, two in n=3. Sum is 26E.

Another: one in n=1, three in n=2. But n=2 can only hold two, so impossible.

Another: one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3. Sum would be 1 + (2*4) +9=1+8+9=18E.

Wait, that's 18E. So configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1.

So the energies would be 1*(1) +2*(4) +1*(9) =1+8+9=18E.

So in this case, the total energy is 18E.

So now, let's order the possible energies.

Ground state: 10E.

First excited state: 15E (two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3).

Second excited state: 18E (one in n=1, two in n=2, one in n=3).

Because 18E is higher than 15E.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think about the possible order.

Wait, the possible energy levels are:

- 10E (2,2)

- 15E (2,1,1)

- 18E (1,2,1)

- 20E (2,0,2)

So the order would be 10E <15E <18E <20E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Which matches option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So option D would be the correct answer.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we start by recalling the energy levels for a particle in such a well. The energy of the $n$-th level is given by:

\[
E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2},
\]

where $E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ is the ground state energy for $n=1$. Thus, the energy of the $n$-th level can be expressed as $E_n = n^2 E$.

Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which requires that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. In a 1D infinite potential well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number $n$ and the spin. Each energy level $n$ can hold a maximum of two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down).

### Ground State
In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest available energy levels. The lowest two levels, $n=1$ and $n=2$, each hold two particles (one spin up and one spin down). The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State
The first excited state is obtained by promoting one particle from $n=2$ to $n=3$. The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in $n=1$,
- One particle in $n=2$,
- One particle in $n=3$.

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + 1E_2 + 1E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 1(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State
The second excited state is obtained by promoting another particle from $n=2$ to $n=3$. The configuration becomes:
- Two particles in $n=1$,
- Two particles in $n=3$.

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 2(3^2E) = 2E + 18E = 20E.
\]

However, this configuration does not match the options provided. Instead, the second excited state can also be achieved by having:
- One particle in $n=1$,
- Two particles in $n=2$,
- One particle in $n=3$.

The total energy for this configuration is:

\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 1E_1 + 2E_2 + 1E_3 = 1(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 1E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
\]

### Conclusion
The ground state energy is $10E$, the first excited state energy is $15E$, and the second excited state energy is $18E$. This matches the options in **D**.
