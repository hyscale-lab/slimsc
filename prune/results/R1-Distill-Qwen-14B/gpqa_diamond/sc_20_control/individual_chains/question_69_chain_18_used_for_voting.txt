Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the decay of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8×10^-16 seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer in the lab frame due to time dilation. So the lifetime observed in the lab (τ) is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle relative to the speed of light.

The first thing I think I should do is calculate gamma. Gamma is equal to gamma = E / (m c²). But wait, E here is the total energy of the particle, right? Oh, but wait, the energy given is 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV. So the total energy E is 27 GeV, and m c² would be the rest mass energy, which is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, and 3.41 *8=27.28, which is a bit over 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.915, maybe around 7.9.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 27-23.87 is 3.13. 3.13 divided by 3.41 is approximately 0.918. So gamma is about 7.918, say approximately 7.92.

So gamma is roughly 7.92. So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = gamma * τ₀. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8 *7.92 is about 63.36. So τ is approximately 63.36e-16 seconds, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Now, the next part is about the decay being observed. The question mentions that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. I remember that the number of particles that decay in a detector depends on the time they're moving and the length they travel. So the lab frame lifetime determines how far they go before decaying.

The length L is calculated by L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame (τ). But wait, v is the velocity of the particle. Another approach is using the relation L = γβcτ₀. Because, since β is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1-β²).

Wait, another formula: the mean path length (cτ) is the product of the speed of light and the lifetime. But wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is γτ₀, so the mean path is c * γτ₀. But I think I need to find the velocity first.

Alternatively, I can compute beta (β) from the energy. The total energy E is γ m c², so gamma is E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.915. Beta can be found using gamma and the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Let's compute beta.

Gamma squared is about (7.915)^2. Let me compute 7.915^2: 7^2 is 49, 0.915^2 is about 0.837, and cross term 2*7*0.915=12.81. So 49 + 12.81 + 0.837 ≈ 62.647. So gamma squared is about 62.65. Then, gamma squared = 1/(1-beta²), so 1-beta² = 1/(62.65) ≈ 0.01596. So beta squared is 1 - 0.01596 = 0.98404. So beta is sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.99198, very close to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute beta as v = (pc²)/E, but wait, maybe that's another approach. Hmm. Alternatively, since E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). Let's compute that. E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So E² is (27)^2 = 729 (GeV²), (m c²)^2 is (3.41)^2 ≈ 11.628 GeV². So p c = sqrt(729 -11.628) = sqrt(717.372) ≈ 26.785 GeV. So p = 26.785 GeV / c. Then, since p = gamma m v, but perhaps another approach would be better.

Wait, beta can be calculated as (p c^2)/(E c) ) = (p c)/E. Wait, let me think again. The formula for beta is (p c^2)/E, but wait, p is in units of GeV/c. So if p is 26.785 GeV/c, then p c is 26.785 GeV (since c is 1 in these units). E is 27 GeV. So beta = (p c)/E = 26.785 / 27 ≈ 0.99198, which matches the earlier calculation.

So beta is approximately 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992 c.

Now, the particles will travel a certain distance before decaying. The mean path length (average distance) L is v * τ. Since τ is gamma τ₀, and v = beta c, so L = beta c * gamma τ₀.

Wait, but let's compute it properly. Let me compute L:

L = v * τ = beta c * gamma tau_0.

We have beta ≈ 0.992, gamma ≈7.915, tau_0 =8e-16 s. Let's plug in the numbers.

L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 7.915 * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 0.992 *3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 7.915: 2.976e8 *7.915 ≈ let's compute 3e8 *8=2.4e9. Since 7.915 is a bit less, maybe 2.976e8 *7.915 ≈ approximately 2.358e9 m/s.

Wait, let me compute 2.976e8 *7.915. Let's break it down: 2.976e8 *7 = 2.0832e9, 2.976e8 *0.915 ≈ let's see, 0.9 *2.976e8=2.6784e8, 0.015*2.976e8=4.464e6. So 2.6784e8 +4.464e6 = 2.723e8. So total is approx 2.0832e9 + 2.723e8 = 2.3555e9 m/s.

Now multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.3555e9 m/s *8e-16 s = 2.3555e9 *8 *1e-16. 2.3555 *8 ≈18.844, so 18.844e-7 m. Which is 1.8844e-6 m, approximately 1.88e-6 meters.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. I think that the number of decays observed depends on the length over which the decay is detected. The number of decays is given by N = 1 - e^{-L/(c tau)}, where L is the length. But wait, actually, it's the probability that the decay occurs within a certain length. So the fraction of decays observed would be the integral from 0 to the resolution time dt of the decay probability.

Wait, no, more accurately, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays before a certain length L is P = 1 - e^{-L/(c tau)}. We want at least 30% of the decays to be observed, so P >= 0.3. So 1 - e^{-L/(c tau)} >= 0.3.

We can solve for L: e^{-L/(c tau)} <= 0.7 → -L/(c tau) <= ln(0.7) → L/(c tau) >= -ln(0.7) → L >= (c tau) * ln(1/0.7).

Compute ln(1/0.7) = ln(1.42857) ≈ 0.35667.

Wait, let me check: ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, so ln(1/0.7)=0.35667.

So L >= (c tau) * 0.35667.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The proper way is to set P = 1 - e^{-L/(c tau)} = 0.3. So e^{-L/(c tau)} = 0.7 → -L/(c tau) = ln(0.7) → L/(c tau) = -ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567.

So L = c tau * 0.3567.

Wait, but I thought earlier that L is the average distance, which is c tau. So perhaps in that case, the average is L = c gamma tau_0. But wait, no, the average distance is L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0 = c tau.

Because tau is gamma tau_0, so L_avg = beta c tau.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.

The average speed is v = beta c.

So the average distance is L_avg = v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

But beta gamma is (v/c) gamma.

Alternatively, beta gamma = gamma (v/c). And since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), beta gamma = sqrt( (gamma^2) beta² ) = sqrt( (gamma^2) (v^2/c^2) ) ) = gamma v/c.

Wait, perhaps another approach to find beta gamma. Since gamma^2 (1 - beta^2) = 1 → gamma^2 beta^2 = gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 ) = gamma^2 -1. So beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1).

Wait, but I have gamma as approximately 7.915, so beta gamma would be sqrt(7.915^2 -1) ≈ sqrt(62.65 -1) = sqrt(61.65) ≈ 7.85.

But wait, earlier I found that beta is about 0.992, so beta gamma is 0.992 *7.915 ≈ 7.85.

So L_avg = beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

But from tau = gamma tau_0, so beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but let's compute the minimum L needed so that 30% of decays are observed. So we have L >= c tau * 0.3567.

But wait, that's the length where the probability is 30%. So L is the minimum length the detector needs to cover to capture 30% of the decays.

But wait, in the problem, it's about the minimum resolution. I think the question is referring to the minimum time resolution, but wait, no, the question is about the resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, wait, perhaps the resolution refers to the spatial resolution of the Bubble Chamber. So the chamber needs to be able to detect the decay within a certain length L, so that 30% of the decays are within that length. So the minimum L is the one that captures 30% of the decays.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the proper lifetime is tau_0, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau_0. The decay length is c tau_0 gamma, but the actual decay occurs at a certain point. So the minimum resolution in time would relate to the proper lifetime and gamma. Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting confused between time and length.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the proper time. The particle's lifetime is tau_0 in its rest frame. But in the lab frame, it's moving, so it lives longer. The time it lives in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0. The distance it travels before decaying is L = v tau = beta c tau.

So the average distance is L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

But the question is about the minimum resolution. So I think the required L is the one where 30% of the decays have occurred. So the minimum L would be such that the probability is 30%.

So P = 1 - e^{- L/(L_avg)}. Because L_avg is the average decay length. So for P = 0.3, 0.3 = 1 - e^{- L/(L_avg)} → e^{- L/(L_avg)} = 0.7 → L/(L_avg) = ln(1/0.7) ≈ 0.3567 → L = 0.3567 * L_avg.

Wait, no, L_avg is the mean decay length. So the average is L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

So L = 0.3567 * L_avg.

Wait, no, because when you have a decay length L, the probability that it's less than L is P = 1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)}. So to get 30% probability, L needs to be 0.3567 * L_avg.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me compute P as 30%:

P = 1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)} = 0.3 → e^{-L/(L_avg)} = 0.7 → -L/(L_avg) = ln(0.7) → L = L_avg * (-ln(0.7)). Since ln(0.7) is negative, L = L_avg * (0.3567).

So L = 0.3567 * L_avg.

Wait, but L_avg is beta c gamma tau_0. So L = 0.3567 * beta c gamma tau_0.

But earlier, I calculated L_avg as beta c gamma tau_0, and got approximately 1.88e-6 meters. Wait, no, earlier I computed L_avg as beta c gamma tau_0, which is the average decay length. Let me compute that again.

Wait, beta is approximately 0.992, gamma is approx 7.915, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

Compute beta * c: 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma: 2.976e8 * 7.915 ≈ let's compute 3e8 * 8=2.4e9. Since 7.915 is close to 8, but slightly less, so 2.976e8 *7.915 ≈ 2.358e9 m/s.

Then multiply by tau_0: 2.358e9 m/s * 8e-16 s = (2.358 *8) e (9-16) = 18.864e-7 m = 1.8864e-6 m.

So L_avg is approximately 1.8864e-6 meters.

Then the required minimum L is 0.3567 * L_avg.

So 0.3567 * 1.8864e-6 m ≈ let's compute that.

1.8864e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈ 0.3567 * 1.8864 ≈ 0.6723e-6 m = 6.723e-7 m.

Wait, but that would be the length where 30% of decays have happened. So the resolution needs to be at least this length to capture 30% of the decays. So the minimum resolution required is approximately 6.72e-7 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are all around 2e-6 m, 2e-9 m, etc. Hmm, none of the options are around 6.7e-7 m. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m

Hmm, my calculation gave about 6.72e-7 m, which is 6.72 *1e-7 m, which is 672 nm. But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the time resolution needed, not the spatial resolution. Because the Bubble Chamber's resolution is about detecting the decay point, which depends on how well it can measure the position where the decay occurred. But the problem states that it's about the minimum resolution, which in this context probably refers to the spatial resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the calculation. Let me re-express everything.

Another approach: The time it takes for the particle to decay is a random variable with an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle decays within a time t is P = 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)}.

But the Bubble Chamber can only measure the decay if the particle's lifetime is less than some time resolution delta_t. So for that, the fraction of decays observed would be P = 1 - e^{-delta_t/(gamma tau_0)}.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum spatial resolution, not time. Oh wait, perhaps the chamber's spatial resolution is related to how accurately it can determine the decay position. So if the decay occurs over a longer length, the chamber's resolution (the smallest distance it can distinguish) must be less than or equal to the decay length to capture the decay.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts here. Let's think again.

The decay length is L = beta c gamma tau_0. The Bubble Chamber needs to have a spatial resolution (the smallest distance it can detect) that is less than or equal to this L in order to observe the decay. But the problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps it's the length where 30% of the decays have occurred, which would be L = 0.3567 * L_avg, as I calculated earlier.

Wait, but earlier I found that L_avg is about 1.88e-6 m, so 30% would be around 6.7e-7 m. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the minimum time resolution, not the length. Because the question says 'minimum resolution' without specifying, but perhaps it refers to time.

Wait, but the decay time in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. But if the detector's time resolution is delta_t, the fraction of decays observed would be P = 1 - e^{-delta_t/(gamma tau_0)}.

We want P >= 0.3 → delta_t >= (gamma tau_0) * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = (gamma tau_0) * ln(1/0.7) ≈ gamma tau_0 * 0.3567.

So gamma tau_0 = 7.915 *8e-16 s ≈6.332e-15 s.

delta_t = 0.3567 *6.332e-15 s ≈2.25e-15 s.

But the question is about resolution in length, I think. Because the options are in meters, not seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolution refers to the velocity. Wait, no, the units are meters, so it's spatial.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the minimum required length to capture 30% of decays, and then convert that to the required resolution.

Wait, let's re-examine the formula.

The required length L is L = c tau * (1 - e^{-x}) where x is the value that gives P=0.3. Wait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier.

Let me rederive it correctly.

The probability that the particle decays within a certain proper time is P = 1 - e^{-t/(tau_0)}.

In the lab frame, the time is longer. The decay occurs when the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is less than the time it takes to travel the length L. So the observed time is t = L/(v) = L/(beta c).

The probability of decay is P = 1 - e^{- t/(gamma tau_0)}.

Substituting t = L/(beta c), we have P = 1 - e^{- L/(beta c gamma tau_0)}.

We need P >= 0.3.

So 1 - e^{- L/(L_avg)} >= 0.3 → e^{- L/(L_avg)} <= 0.7 → L/(L_avg) >= ln(1/0.7) ≈0.3567 → L >=0.3567 * L_avg.

So L is approximately 0.3567 * L_avg.

Earlier, I found L_avg to be about 1.88e-6 m. So 0.3567 * 1.88e-6 m is about 6.72e-7 m.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L_avg.

Wait, let me re-calculate L_avg.

L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

Given:

beta ≈ 0.992.

c =3e8 m/s.

gamma ≈7.915.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So compute:

beta * c = 0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma: 2.976e8 * 7.915 = let's do it more accurately.

2.976 * 7.915 → let's compute 2.976 *7 =20.832, 2.976 *0.915 ≈ (2.976 *0.9=2.6784; 2.976 *0.015=0.04464 → total 2.72304). So total 20.832 +2.72304=23.55504e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau_0 (8e-16 s):

23.55504e8 m/s *8e-16 s = 23.55504 *8e-8 m = 188.44032e-8 m =1.8844032e-6 m.

So L_avg is 1.884e-6 m, which is 1.884 micrometers.

So the minimum L is 0.3567 * 1.884e-6 m.

Compute 0.3567 *1.884e-6:

0.3567 *1.884 ≈ let's compute 0.35 *1.884 =0.6594, 0.0067*1.884≈0.0126. Sum is roughly 0.672.

So 0.672e-6 m → 6.72e-7 m.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum time resolution, but the options are in meters, which suggests it's about spatial resolution.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps I'm supposed to compute the minimum velocity to get the 30% decay, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the proper time. Wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0, but the observed time is longer. The minimum time would be tau_0, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the velocity and then find the length, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. My calculation for L is about 672 nm, which is 0.672 micrometers. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma.

Gamma is E/(m c²). E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So gamma =27/3.41.

27 ÷3.41 → 3.41 ×7=23.87; 27-23.87=3.13. So 3.13 /3.41≈0.917. So gamma ≈7.917.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta gamma. Since beta gamma = sqrt(gamma² -1) → sqrt(7.917² -1) → let's compute 7.917^2: 7^2=49, 0.917^2≈0.840, 2*7*0.917=12.838. So 49+12.838+0.840=62.678. So sqrt(62.678 -1) = sqrt(61.678)=7.853.

So beta gamma ≈7.853.

So the average decay length L_avg = c tau_0 * beta gamma.

So L_avg =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s *7.853.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 = 2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.853: 2.4e-7 *7.853 ≈1.884e-6 m, same as before.

So same result as earlier.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the proper lifetime and no gamma, but that can't be right because the decay length depends on gamma.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the correct formula, but I'm missing a step.

Wait, another thought: The minimum resolution is the minimum length that the chamber can resolve. So perhaps the chamber can only resolve a minimum of, say, 30% of the decay length. So the minimum L is 30% of the average decay length.

So L_min = 0.3 * L_avg =0.3 *1.884e-6 m ≈5.65e-7 m. Still not matching any options.

Wait, but perhaps the 30% refers to the proper time. Wait, that would be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the 30% as the probability of decaying within a certain length, but perhaps the question is asking about the minimum time to observe the decay in a certain fraction of cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the minimum length is when the decay occurs exactly 30% of the time, which would involve calculating L such that the probability is 30%, which is what I did earlier.

Wait, but none of the options match. So perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at option A: 2.08e-6 m. So 2.08 micrometers.

Hmm, 2.08e-6 m is larger than the L I found (6.7e-7 m). So perhaps the correct approach is using a different formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity v, then the time tau, then the length.

Wait, v = beta c ≈0.992c ≈2.976e8 m/s.

The lifetime in the lab is tau = gamma tau_0 =7.915 *8e-16 s=6.332e-15 s.

So the length L =v tau =2.976e8 m/s *6.332e-15 s= 2.976e8 *6.332e-15.

Compute 2.976e8 *6.332e-15: 2.976 *6.332 ≈18.85 → 18.85e-7 m =1.885e-6 m.

Ah, so L =1.885e-6 m.

But this is the average decay length, L_avg.

But the question is about the minimum resolution to observe 30% of the decays. So perhaps the minimum required length is L_min = L_avg * (1 - e^{-1}), which is about 0.632 * L_avg. Because for 63.2% probability, 1 - e^{-1} ≈0.632. But the problem requires 30% of decays, which is a lower probability, requiring a shorter L than the average.

Wait, but earlier we found that to get 30% probability, L must be about 0.3567 * L_avg.

Which gives us L_min ≈0.3567 *1.885e-6 m ≈6.72e-7 m.

But that's about 0.67 micrometers, which is 670 nm. The options don't have this.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum possible length to observe any decay, which would be the average, but that's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the proper lifetime is given as tau_0 =8e-16 s, which is the mean lifetime in the rest frame. So the mean path in the lab frame is L = gamma beta c tau_0.

So L = gamma * beta * c tau_0.

Which is what I've been calculating.

So L = gamma beta c tau_0.

Wait, gamma beta is sqrt(gamma^2 beta^2) = sqrt(gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2)) )= sqrt(gamma^2 -1) = sqrt(7.915^2 -1)=sqrt(62.65-1)=sqrt(61.65)=7.853.

So L =7.853 * c * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So compute 7.853 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.853 *3=23.559 → 23.559e8 *8e-16 = (23.559 *8 )e-8 → 188.472e-8 m =1.88472e-6 m, same as before.

But again, the option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimum time resolution to observe 30% of the decays. Let's compute that.

The time resolution delta_t should be such that the number of decays observed is 30% of all decays.

The probability is P =1 - e^{-delta_t/(gamma tau_0)} =0.3.

So delta_t = gamma tau_0 * ln(1/(1-0.3))= gamma tau_0 * ln(1/0.7)≈gamma tau_0 *0.3567.

gamma tau_0 =7.915 *8e-16 =6.332e-15 s.

delta_t=0.3567 *6.332e-15 ≈2.25e-15 s.

But the question is about spatial resolution, not time.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the minimum length resolution that the Bubble Chamber can have. So if the chamber can only resolve lengths down to a certain point, then 30% of the decays would have occurred within that length.

Wait, so maybe the minimum resolution is the length L where 30% of the decays have happened. So L = (gamma beta c tau_0) * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → L= gamma beta c tau_0 *0.3567.

Which is 1.88e-6 m *0.3567 ≈6.72e-7 m.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, E =27 GeV, m c²=3.41 GeV. So gamma=E/(m c²)=27/3.41.

Let me compute 27 divided by 3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87, which is less than 27. 3.41*8=27.28, which is just a bit over 27. So 27/3.41≈7.915.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the velocity as a fraction of c but without considering gamma. No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the minimum speed, but that doesn't fit with the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the minimum time resolution. Let's see, if the chamber can only measure time up to delta_t, then the fraction of decays observed is P=1-e^{-delta_t/(gamma tau_0)}=0.3.

So delta_t= gamma tau_0 * ln(1/0.7)=6.332e-15 s *0.3567≈2.25e-15 s.

But the options are in meters, not seconds, so that's probably not the case.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute L=gamma c tau_0, without considering beta. That would be gamma c tau_0 =7.915 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.915 *3e8 =2.3745e9 m/s. Multiply by 8e-16 s →2.3745e9 *8e-16=1.8996e-6 m. Which is approximately 1.9e-6 m. Close to option A (2.08e-6 m).

But why would I ignore beta? Because the decay length is L = beta gamma c tau_0. Ignoring beta would give a longer length than the correct value.

Hmm, but in my earlier calculation, the correct L_avg is 1.88e-6 m. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma beta more accurately.

Earlier, we approximated beta as 0.992, but perhaps a more precise calculation would yield a different value.

Compute beta more accurately.

We have gamma =27/3.41 = approximately 7.915.

Then, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²) → gamma² =1/(1-beta²) →1-beta²=1/gamma² → beta²=1-1/gamma².

gamma squared is (27/3.41)^2 = (7.915)^2 ≈62.65.

So 1-beta²=1/62.65 → beta²=1-0.01596=0.98404.

So beta= sqrt(0.98404)=0.9920.

So beta is approximately 0.9920.

So beta gamma =0.9920 *7.915 ≈7.853.

So L_avg = c tau_0 * beta gamma = 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s *7.853.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.853: 2.4e-7 *7.853≈1.8847e-6 m.

Hmm, so still 1.88e-6 m.

So why is the option A 2.08e-6 m?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, compute gamma =27 /3.41 exactly.

3.41 ×7=23.87 → 27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41= let's compute it as 313/341 ≈0.917. So gamma=7.917.

So 7.917 *8e-16 =6.3336e-15 s.

L_avg = beta c *gamma tau_0.

Beta=0.9920 → beta c= 0.9920 *3e8 =2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma tau_0: 2.976e8 *6.3336e-15 = let's compute 2.976e8 *6.3336e-15.

2.976e8 is 2.976 *1e8.

6.3336e-15 is 6.3336 *1e-15.

Multiply 2.976 *6.3336 → let me compute that:

2 *6=12.

0.976 *6=5.856.

2 *0.3336=0.6672.

0.976 *0.3336≈0.326.

Total: 12 +5.856=17.856; 0.6672+0.326=0.9932 → total 17.856+0.9932=18.8492.

Multiply by 1e8 *1e-15=1e-7.

So L_avg=18.8492e-7 m =1.88492e-6 m.

Still around 1.885e-6 m.

So the only way option A is correct is if the calculation used a different gamma or beta.

Wait, perhaps someone else made a mistake, but for the purpose of this exercise, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum time needed to observe 30% of the decays.

Wait, but the question is about spatial resolution. So why isn't the calculation matching any of the options?

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is using the velocity in terms of beta, and not considering gamma. So L= beta c tau_0.

So L =0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.976e8 *8e-16 =2.3808e-7 m =2.38e-7 m.

Which is 0.238 micrometers. Still not matching options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the velocity v = (p c^2)/E, but that's another route.

Wait, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) → (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 =729 -11.628=717.372 → sqrt(717.372)= approx 26.785 GeV.

So p c =26.785 GeV → p=26.785 GeV/(c).

Then, v = (p c^2)/E → (26.785 GeV c )/ (27 GeV) )=26.785/27 c ≈0.992 c. Same as before.

So that approach doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using tau_0 instead of gamma tau_0, which would be incorrect, but let's compute it.

If L is calculated as c * tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m=240 nm.

That's 2.4e-7 m, which is 0.24 micrometers. Again, not matching options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using tau_0 as the lab frame lifetime, which is incorrect. If that were the case, L=0.992c *8e-16 s=2.976e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.38e-7 m=238 nm. Still doesn't match options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the options are in 1e-6 m, but their calculation used a different gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Let me compute what gamma would give L=2.08e-6 m.

L =gamma * beta c tau_0.

We have L=2.08e-6 m.

gamma * beta = L/(c tau_0).

c tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m.

So gamma*beta = (2.08e-6 m)/(2.4e-7 m) ≈8.6667.

So gamma * beta =8.6667.

But earlier, we have gamma=7.915 and beta=0.992 → gamma*beta=7.853.

Which is less than 8.6667.

So if gamma*beta=8.6667, then gamma=8.6667 / beta.

Wait, but beta= v/c= (p c^2)/E=26.785 GeV c /27 GeV=0.992.

So beta=0.992.

So gamma=8.6667 /0.992≈8.735.

But earlier, gamma is 7.915. So that would require a higher gamma, which would imply a higher energy.

So perhaps the problem has a different set of parameters, but as per the given numbers, I don't see why L would be 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma =27 /3.41 exactly.

3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *7.9=3.41*(7+0.9)=23.87 +3.069=26.939.

3.41 *7.91=26.939 +0.0341=26.9731.

3.41 *7.915=26.9731 + (0.005 *3.41)=26.9731 +0.01705=26.99015.

Which is very close to 27. So gamma=7.915.

So I think the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is looking for the minimum time resolution, which would then translate into a spatial resolution.

But time resolution would be delta_t, and the spatial resolution would be delta_x = v delta_t.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the mean decay length as beta c tau_0, without including gamma.

Mean decay length L = beta c tau_0.

Which would be 0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.38e-7 m=238 nm.

Which is 2.38e-7 m, but again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using tau_0 as the mean life in the lab frame, which is tau=gamma tau_0.

So L = beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is the same as before.

So I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 1.88e-6 m, but the options don't have that. The closest option is A)2.08e-6 m. Perhaps the problem expects that, considering possible rounding in intermediate steps.

Wait, perhaps when calculating gamma, the precise value is slightly higher, leading to a higher L.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma=27 /3.41.

Compute 3.41 ×7.915=?

3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *0.915= approx 3.41 *0.9=3.069, 3.41 *0.015=0.05115. So total 3.12015.

So 7.915 *3.41 =23.87 +3.12015=26.99015≈26.99015.

Which is just under 27, so gamma is 27/3.41= approximately 7.915.

But 3.41 ×7.915=26.99015, which is 0.00985 less than 27. So the exact value would be a bit higher than 7.915.

Wait, let me compute 3.41 *7.915=?

3 *7.915=23.745.

0.41 *7.915=3.24515.

Sum is 23.745 +3.24515=26.99015.

So 27 -26.99015=0.00985.

So 3.41 *7.915 +0.00985=27.

So 3.41 * (7.915 + 0.00985/3.41)=3.41 *7.915 +0.00985=27.

Compute 0.00985 /3.41 ≈0.002888.

So gamma ≈7.915 +0.002888≈7.9179.

So gamma≈7.9179.

So beta gamma= sqrt(gamma^2 -1)=sqrt( (7.9179)^2 -1 )= sqrt(62.691 -1)=sqrt(61.691)=7.854.

So L_avg=7.854 * c * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

Compute 7.854 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.854 *3=23.562.

23.562e8 *8e-16= (23.562 *8) e-8=188.496e-8=1.88496e-6 m.

Which is 1.88496e-6 m.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. Let me compute what gamma would give L=2.08e-6 m.

L= gamma beta c tau_0 → gamma beta = L/(c tau_0) =2.08e-6 / (3e8 *8e-16)=2.08e-6/(2.4e-7)=8.6667.

So gamma beta=8.6667.

But gamma beta= sqrt(gamma^2 -1 )=8.6667.

So gamma^2 -1= (8.6667)^2=75.111.

So gamma^2=76.111 → gamma= sqrt(76.111)=8.724.

Which would imply a gamma of 8.724.

So E/(m c²)=8.724 → E= m c² *8.724.

Given that m c²=3.41 GeV, E=3.41*8.724≈29.69 GeV.

But the problem states E=27 GeV. So this would require a higher energy, which is not the case here.

Therefore, I think my initial approach is correct, and the correct L is approximately 1.88e-6 m, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, considering possible rounding or a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula without gamma. Let me try that.

L =c tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m=240 nm.

Still not matching any option except option B, which is 2.08e-9 m, which is 2.08 nanometers. That's way too small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the time resolution delta_t, which would be delta_t=gamma tau_0 * ln(2), which is about 0.693 * gamma tau_0. But that doesn't directly give a length.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing up proper time and lab time.

Wait, perhaps the proper lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay length is longer.

But I think all that leads back to the same conclusion.

In conclusion, given the options, the closest to my calculation is not present, but perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^- \) with the following given parameters:

- Proper lifetime of \( X^0 \): \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \)
- Energy of \( X^0 \) in the Bubble Chamber: \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Mass of \( X^0 \): \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Key Steps in the Analysis:

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   The Lorentz factor is given by:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
   \]
   Substituting \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.915
   \]

2. **Determine the lab-frame lifetime (\( \tau \)):**
   The lifetime in the lab frame is dilated due to relativistic effects:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma \approx 7.915 \) and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \tau \approx 7.915 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.332 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Calculate the decay length (\( L_{\text{avg}} \)):**
   The average decay length in the lab frame is:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = \beta c \tau
   \]
   where \( \beta = v/c \). Using the relation \( \beta \gamma = \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1} \):
   \[
   \beta \gamma = \sqrt{(7.915)^2 - 1} \approx \sqrt{62.65 - 1} \approx 7.853
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{\beta \gamma}{\gamma} \approx \frac{7.853}{7.915} \approx 0.992
   \]
   Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.992 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 6.332 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 6.332 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 1.88 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]

4. **Determine the minimum resolution (\( L_{\text{min}} \)):**
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, the probability of decay within a length \( L \) is:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}}
   \]
   Setting \( P = 0.3 \), we solve:
   \[
   1 - e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}} = 0.3 \implies e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}} = 0.7 \implies L / L_{\text{avg}} = -\ln(0.7) \approx 0.3567
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   L_{\text{min}} = 0.3567 \times L_{\text{avg}} \approx 0.3567 \times 1.88 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
   \]

5. **Compare with the options:**
   The calculated \( L_{\text{min}} \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**, which may reflect rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the decay of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8×10^-16 seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer in the lab frame due to time dilation. So the lifetime observed in the lab (τ) is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle relative to the speed of light.

The first thing I think I should do is calculate gamma. Gamma is equal to gamma = E / (m c²). But wait, E here is the total energy of the particle, right? Oh, but wait, the energy given is 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV. So the total energy E is 27 GeV, and m c² would be the rest mass energy, which is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, and 3.41 *8=27.28, which is a bit over 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.915, maybe around 7.9.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 27-23.87 is 3.13. 3.13 divided by 3.41 is approximately 0.918. So gamma is about 7.918, say approximately 7.92.

So gamma is roughly 7.92. So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = gamma * τ₀. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8 *7.92 is about 63.36. So τ is approximately 63.36e-16 seconds, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Now, the next part is about the decay being observed. The question mentions that we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. I remember that the number of particles that decay in a detector depends on the time they're moving and the length they travel. So the lab frame lifetime determines how far they go before decaying.

The length L is calculated by L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame (τ). But wait, v is the velocity of the particle. Another approach is using the relation L = γβcτ₀. Because, since β is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1-β²).

Wait, another formula: the mean path length (cτ) is the product of the speed of light and the lifetime. But wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is γτ₀, so the mean path is c * γτ₀. But I think I need to find the velocity first.

Alternatively, I can compute beta (β) from the energy. The total energy E is γ m c², so gamma is E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.915. Beta can be found using gamma and the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Let's compute beta.

Gamma squared is about (7.915)^2. Let me compute 7.915^2: 7^2 is 49, 0.915^2 is about 0.837, and cross term 2*7*0.915=12.81. So 49 + 12.81 + 0.837 ≈ 62.647. So gamma squared is about 62.65. Then, gamma squared = 1/(1-beta²), so 1-beta² = 1/(62.65) ≈ 0.01596. So beta squared is 1 - 0.01596 = 0.98404. So beta is sqrt(0.98404) ≈ 0.99198, very close to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute beta as v = (pc²)/E, but wait, maybe that's another approach. Hmm. Alternatively, since E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). Let's compute that. E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So E² is (27)^2 = 729 (GeV²), (m c²)^2 is (3.41)^2 ≈ 11.628 GeV². So p c = sqrt(729 -11.628) = sqrt(717.372) ≈ 26.785 GeV. So p = 26.785 GeV / c. Then, since p = gamma m v, but perhaps another approach would be better.

Wait, beta can be calculated as (p c^2)/(E c) ) = (p c)/E. Wait, let me think again. The formula for beta is (p c^2)/E, but wait, p is in units of GeV/c. So if p is 26.785 GeV/c, then p c is 26.785 GeV (since c is 1 in these units). E is 27 GeV. So beta = (p c)/E = 26.785 / 27 ≈ 0.99198, which matches the earlier calculation.

So beta is approximately 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992 c.

Now, the particles will travel a certain distance before decaying. The mean path length (average distance) L is v * τ. Since τ is gamma τ₀, and v = beta c, so L = beta c * gamma τ₀.

Wait, but let's compute it properly. Let me compute L:

L = v * τ = beta c * gamma tau_0.

We have beta ≈ 0.992, gamma ≈7.915, tau_0 =8e-16 s. Let's plug in the numbers.

L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 7.915 * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 0.992 *3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 7.915: 2.976e8 *7.915 ≈ let's compute 3e8 *8=2.4e9. Since 7.915 is a bit less, maybe 2.976e8 *7.915 ≈ approximately 2.358e9 m/s.

Wait, let me compute 2.976e8 *7.915. Let's break it down: 2.976e8 *7 = 2.0832e9, 2.976e8 *0.915 ≈ let's see, 0.9 *2.976e8=2.6784e8, 0.015*2.976e8=4.464e6. So 2.6784e8 +4.464e6 = 2.723e8. So total is approx 2.0832e9 + 2.723e8 = 2.3555e9 m/s.

Now multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.3555e9 m/s *8e-16 s = 2.3555e9 *8 *1e-16. 2.3555 *8 ≈18.844, so 18.844e-7 m. Which is 1.8844e-6 m, approximately 1.88e-6 meters.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm. I think that the number of decays observed depends on the length over which the decay is detected. The number of decays is given by N = 1 - e^{-L/(c tau)}, where L is the length. But wait, actually, it's the probability that the decay occurs within a certain length. So the fraction of decays observed would be the integral from 0 to the resolution time dt of the decay probability.

Wait, no, more accurately, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays before a certain length L is P = 1 - e^{-L/(c tau)}. We want at least 30% of the decays to be observed, so P >= 0.3. So 1 - e^{-L/(c tau)} >= 0.3.

We can solve for L: e^{-L/(c tau)} <= 0.7 → -L/(c tau) <= ln(0.7) → L/(c tau) >= -ln(0.7) → L >= (c tau) * ln(1/0.7).

Compute ln(1/0.7) = ln(1.42857) ≈ 0.35667.

Wait, let me check: ln(0.7) is approximately -0.35667, so ln(1/0.7)=0.35667.

So L >= (c tau) * 0.35667.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The proper way is to set P = 1 - e^{-L/(c tau)} = 0.3. So e^{-L/(c tau)} = 0.7 → -L/(c tau) = ln(0.7) → L/(c tau) = -ln(0.7) ≈ 0.3567.

So L = c tau * 0.3567.

Wait, but I thought earlier that L is the average distance, which is c tau. So perhaps in that case, the average is L = c gamma tau_0. But wait, no, the average distance is L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0 = c tau.

Because tau is gamma tau_0, so L_avg = beta c tau.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0.

The average speed is v = beta c.

So the average distance is L_avg = v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

But beta gamma is (v/c) gamma.

Alternatively, beta gamma = gamma (v/c). And since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), beta gamma = sqrt( (gamma^2) beta² ) = sqrt( (gamma^2) (v^2/c^2) ) ) = gamma v/c.

Wait, perhaps another approach to find beta gamma. Since gamma^2 (1 - beta^2) = 1 → gamma^2 beta^2 = gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 ) = gamma^2 -1. So beta gamma = sqrt(gamma^2 -1).

Wait, but I have gamma as approximately 7.915, so beta gamma would be sqrt(7.915^2 -1) ≈ sqrt(62.65 -1) = sqrt(61.65) ≈ 7.85.

But wait, earlier I found that beta is about 0.992, so beta gamma is 0.992 *7.915 ≈ 7.85.

So L_avg = beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

But from tau = gamma tau_0, so beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but let's compute the minimum L needed so that 30% of decays are observed. So we have L >= c tau * 0.3567.

But wait, that's the length where the probability is 30%. So L is the minimum length the detector needs to cover to capture 30% of the decays.

But wait, in the problem, it's about the minimum resolution. I think the question is referring to the minimum time resolution, but wait, no, the question is about the resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, wait, perhaps the resolution refers to the spatial resolution of the Bubble Chamber. So the chamber needs to be able to detect the decay within a certain length L, so that 30% of the decays are within that length. So the minimum L is the one that captures 30% of the decays.

Wait, no. Alternatively, the proper lifetime is tau_0, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau_0. The decay length is c tau_0 gamma, but the actual decay occurs at a certain point. So the minimum resolution in time would relate to the proper lifetime and gamma. Hmm, but perhaps I'm getting confused between time and length.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the proper time. The particle's lifetime is tau_0 in its rest frame. But in the lab frame, it's moving, so it lives longer. The time it lives in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0. The distance it travels before decaying is L = v tau = beta c tau.

So the average distance is L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

But the question is about the minimum resolution. So I think the required L is the one where 30% of the decays have occurred. So the minimum L would be such that the probability is 30%.

So P = 1 - e^{- L/(L_avg)}. Because L_avg is the average decay length. So for P = 0.3, 0.3 = 1 - e^{- L/(L_avg)} → e^{- L/(L_avg)} = 0.7 → L/(L_avg) = ln(1/0.7) ≈ 0.3567 → L = 0.3567 * L_avg.

Wait, no, L_avg is the mean decay length. So the average is L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

So L = 0.3567 * L_avg.

Wait, no, because when you have a decay length L, the probability that it's less than L is P = 1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)}. So to get 30% probability, L needs to be 0.3567 * L_avg.

Wait, let me double-check. Let me compute P as 30%:

P = 1 - e^{-L/(L_avg)} = 0.3 → e^{-L/(L_avg)} = 0.7 → -L/(L_avg) = ln(0.7) → L = L_avg * (-ln(0.7)). Since ln(0.7) is negative, L = L_avg * (0.3567).

So L = 0.3567 * L_avg.

Wait, but L_avg is beta c gamma tau_0. So L = 0.3567 * beta c gamma tau_0.

But earlier, I calculated L_avg as beta c gamma tau_0, and got approximately 1.88e-6 meters. Wait, no, earlier I computed L_avg as beta c gamma tau_0, which is the average decay length. Let me compute that again.

Wait, beta is approximately 0.992, gamma is approx 7.915, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

Compute beta * c: 0.992 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma: 2.976e8 * 7.915 ≈ let's compute 3e8 * 8=2.4e9. Since 7.915 is close to 8, but slightly less, so 2.976e8 *7.915 ≈ 2.358e9 m/s.

Then multiply by tau_0: 2.358e9 m/s * 8e-16 s = (2.358 *8) e (9-16) = 18.864e-7 m = 1.8864e-6 m.

So L_avg is approximately 1.8864e-6 meters.

Then the required minimum L is 0.3567 * L_avg.

So 0.3567 * 1.8864e-6 m ≈ let's compute that.

1.8864e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈ 0.3567 * 1.8864 ≈ 0.6723e-6 m = 6.723e-7 m.

Wait, but that would be the length where 30% of decays have happened. So the resolution needs to be at least this length to capture 30% of the decays. So the minimum resolution required is approximately 6.72e-7 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are all around 2e-6 m, 2e-9 m, etc. Hmm, none of the options are around 6.7e-7 m. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m

Hmm, my calculation gave about 6.72e-7 m, which is 6.72 *1e-7 m, which is 672 nm. But none of the options are close to that. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the time resolution needed, not the spatial resolution. Because the Bubble Chamber's resolution is about detecting the decay point, which depends on how well it can measure the position where the decay occurred. But the problem states that it's about the minimum resolution, which in this context probably refers to the spatial resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the calculation. Let me re-express everything.

Another approach: The time it takes for the particle to decay is a random variable with an exponential distribution. The probability that the particle decays within a time t is P = 1 - e^{-t/(gamma tau_0)}.

But the Bubble Chamber can only measure the decay if the particle's lifetime is less than some time resolution delta_t. So for that, the fraction of decays observed would be P = 1 - e^{-delta_t/(gamma tau_0)}.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum spatial resolution, not time. Oh wait, perhaps the chamber's spatial resolution is related to how accurately it can determine the decay position. So if the decay occurs over a longer length, the chamber's resolution (the smallest distance it can distinguish) must be less than or equal to the decay length to capture the decay.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts here. Let's think again.

The decay length is L = beta c gamma tau_0. The Bubble Chamber needs to have a spatial resolution (the smallest distance it can detect) that is less than or equal to this L in order to observe the decay. But the problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps it's the length where 30% of the decays have occurred, which would be L = 0.3567 * L_avg, as I calculated earlier.

Wait, but earlier I found that L_avg is about 1.88e-6 m, so 30% would be around 6.7e-7 m. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the minimum time resolution, not the length. Because the question says 'minimum resolution' without specifying, but perhaps it refers to time.

Wait, but the decay time in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. But if the detector's time resolution is delta_t, the fraction of decays observed would be P = 1 - e^{-delta_t/(gamma tau_0)}.

We want P >= 0.3 → delta_t >= (gamma tau_0) * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = (gamma tau_0) * ln(1/0.7) ≈ gamma tau_0 * 0.3567.

So gamma tau_0 = 7.915 *8e-16 s ≈6.332e-15 s.

delta_t = 0.3567 *6.332e-15 s ≈2.25e-15 s.

But the question is about resolution in length, I think. Because the options are in meters, not seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps the resolution refers to the velocity. Wait, no, the units are meters, so it's spatial.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the minimum required length to capture 30% of decays, and then convert that to the required resolution.

Wait, let's re-examine the formula.

The required length L is L = c tau * (1 - e^{-x}) where x is the value that gives P=0.3. Wait, perhaps I got it wrong earlier.

Let me rederive it correctly.

The probability that the particle decays within a certain proper time is P = 1 - e^{-t/(tau_0)}.

In the lab frame, the time is longer. The decay occurs when the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is less than the time it takes to travel the length L. So the observed time is t = L/(v) = L/(beta c).

The probability of decay is P = 1 - e^{- t/(gamma tau_0)}.

Substituting t = L/(beta c), we have P = 1 - e^{- L/(beta c gamma tau_0)}.

We need P >= 0.3.

So 1 - e^{- L/(L_avg)} >= 0.3 → e^{- L/(L_avg)} <= 0.7 → L/(L_avg) >= ln(1/0.7) ≈0.3567 → L >=0.3567 * L_avg.

So L is approximately 0.3567 * L_avg.

Earlier, I found L_avg to be about 1.88e-6 m. So 0.3567 * 1.88e-6 m is about 6.72e-7 m.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L_avg.

Wait, let me re-calculate L_avg.

L_avg = beta c gamma tau_0.

Given:

beta ≈ 0.992.

c =3e8 m/s.

gamma ≈7.915.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So compute:

beta * c = 0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma: 2.976e8 * 7.915 = let's do it more accurately.

2.976 * 7.915 → let's compute 2.976 *7 =20.832, 2.976 *0.915 ≈ (2.976 *0.9=2.6784; 2.976 *0.015=0.04464 → total 2.72304). So total 20.832 +2.72304=23.55504e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau_0 (8e-16 s):

23.55504e8 m/s *8e-16 s = 23.55504 *8e-8 m = 188.44032e-8 m =1.8844032e-6 m.

So L_avg is 1.884e-6 m, which is 1.884 micrometers.

So the minimum L is 0.3567 * 1.884e-6 m.

Compute 0.3567 *1.884e-6:

0.3567 *1.884 ≈ let's compute 0.35 *1.884 =0.6594, 0.0067*1.884≈0.0126. Sum is roughly 0.672.

So 0.672e-6 m → 6.72e-7 m.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake, or perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum time resolution, but the options are in meters, which suggests it's about spatial resolution.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps I'm supposed to compute the minimum velocity to get the 30% decay, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the proper time. Wait, the proper lifetime is tau_0, but the observed time is longer. The minimum time would be tau_0, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the velocity and then find the length, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. My calculation for L is about 672 nm, which is 0.672 micrometers. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma.

Gamma is E/(m c²). E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So gamma =27/3.41.

27 ÷3.41 → 3.41 ×7=23.87; 27-23.87=3.13. So 3.13 /3.41≈0.917. So gamma ≈7.917.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta gamma. Since beta gamma = sqrt(gamma² -1) → sqrt(7.917² -1) → let's compute 7.917^2: 7^2=49, 0.917^2≈0.840, 2*7*0.917=12.838. So 49+12.838+0.840=62.678. So sqrt(62.678 -1) = sqrt(61.678)=7.853.

So beta gamma ≈7.853.

So the average decay length L_avg = c tau_0 * beta gamma.

So L_avg =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s *7.853.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 = 2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.853: 2.4e-7 *7.853 ≈1.884e-6 m, same as before.

So same result as earlier.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the proper lifetime and no gamma, but that can't be right because the decay length depends on gamma.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the correct formula, but I'm missing a step.

Wait, another thought: The minimum resolution is the minimum length that the chamber can resolve. So perhaps the chamber can only resolve a minimum of, say, 30% of the decay length. So the minimum L is 30% of the average decay length.

So L_min = 0.3 * L_avg =0.3 *1.884e-6 m ≈5.65e-7 m. Still not matching any options.

Wait, but perhaps the 30% refers to the proper time. Wait, that would be confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the 30% as the probability of decaying within a certain length, but perhaps the question is asking about the minimum time to observe the decay in a certain fraction of cases.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the minimum length is when the decay occurs exactly 30% of the time, which would involve calculating L such that the probability is 30%, which is what I did earlier.

Wait, but none of the options match. So perhaps I should check the options again.

Looking at option A: 2.08e-6 m. So 2.08 micrometers.

Hmm, 2.08e-6 m is larger than the L I found (6.7e-7 m). So perhaps the correct approach is using a different formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity v, then the time tau, then the length.

Wait, v = beta c ≈0.992c ≈2.976e8 m/s.

The lifetime in the lab is tau = gamma tau_0 =7.915 *8e-16 s=6.332e-15 s.

So the length L =v tau =2.976e8 m/s *6.332e-15 s= 2.976e8 *6.332e-15.

Compute 2.976e8 *6.332e-15: 2.976 *6.332 ≈18.85 → 18.85e-7 m =1.885e-6 m.

Ah, so L =1.885e-6 m.

But this is the average decay length, L_avg.

But the question is about the minimum resolution to observe 30% of the decays. So perhaps the minimum required length is L_min = L_avg * (1 - e^{-1}), which is about 0.632 * L_avg. Because for 63.2% probability, 1 - e^{-1} ≈0.632. But the problem requires 30% of decays, which is a lower probability, requiring a shorter L than the average.

Wait, but earlier we found that to get 30% probability, L must be about 0.3567 * L_avg.

Which gives us L_min ≈0.3567 *1.885e-6 m ≈6.72e-7 m.

But that's about 0.67 micrometers, which is 670 nm. The options don't have this.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum possible length to observe any decay, which would be the average, but that's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the proper lifetime is given as tau_0 =8e-16 s, which is the mean lifetime in the rest frame. So the mean path in the lab frame is L = gamma beta c tau_0.

So L = gamma * beta * c tau_0.

Which is what I've been calculating.

So L = gamma beta c tau_0.

Wait, gamma beta is sqrt(gamma^2 beta^2) = sqrt(gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2)) )= sqrt(gamma^2 -1) = sqrt(7.915^2 -1)=sqrt(62.65-1)=sqrt(61.65)=7.853.

So L =7.853 * c * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

So compute 7.853 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.853 *3=23.559 → 23.559e8 *8e-16 = (23.559 *8 )e-8 → 188.472e-8 m =1.88472e-6 m, same as before.

But again, the option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimum time resolution to observe 30% of the decays. Let's compute that.

The time resolution delta_t should be such that the number of decays observed is 30% of all decays.

The probability is P =1 - e^{-delta_t/(gamma tau_0)} =0.3.

So delta_t = gamma tau_0 * ln(1/(1-0.3))= gamma tau_0 * ln(1/0.7)≈gamma tau_0 *0.3567.

gamma tau_0 =7.915 *8e-16 =6.332e-15 s.

delta_t=0.3567 *6.332e-15 ≈2.25e-15 s.

But the question is about spatial resolution, not time.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the minimum length resolution that the Bubble Chamber can have. So if the chamber can only resolve lengths down to a certain point, then 30% of the decays would have occurred within that length.

Wait, so maybe the minimum resolution is the length L where 30% of the decays have happened. So L = (gamma beta c tau_0) * ln(1/(1-0.3)) → L= gamma beta c tau_0 *0.3567.

Which is 1.88e-6 m *0.3567 ≈6.72e-7 m.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, E =27 GeV, m c²=3.41 GeV. So gamma=E/(m c²)=27/3.41.

Let me compute 27 divided by 3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87, which is less than 27. 3.41*8=27.28, which is just a bit over 27. So 27/3.41≈7.915.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the velocity as a fraction of c but without considering gamma. No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the minimum speed, but that doesn't fit with the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the minimum time resolution. Let's see, if the chamber can only measure time up to delta_t, then the fraction of decays observed is P=1-e^{-delta_t/(gamma tau_0)}=0.3.

So delta_t= gamma tau_0 * ln(1/0.7)=6.332e-15 s *0.3567≈2.25e-15 s.

But the options are in meters, not seconds, so that's probably not the case.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute L=gamma c tau_0, without considering beta. That would be gamma c tau_0 =7.915 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.915 *3e8 =2.3745e9 m/s. Multiply by 8e-16 s →2.3745e9 *8e-16=1.8996e-6 m. Which is approximately 1.9e-6 m. Close to option A (2.08e-6 m).

But why would I ignore beta? Because the decay length is L = beta gamma c tau_0. Ignoring beta would give a longer length than the correct value.

Hmm, but in my earlier calculation, the correct L_avg is 1.88e-6 m. Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma beta more accurately.

Earlier, we approximated beta as 0.992, but perhaps a more precise calculation would yield a different value.

Compute beta more accurately.

We have gamma =27/3.41 = approximately 7.915.

Then, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta²) → gamma² =1/(1-beta²) →1-beta²=1/gamma² → beta²=1-1/gamma².

gamma squared is (27/3.41)^2 = (7.915)^2 ≈62.65.

So 1-beta²=1/62.65 → beta²=1-0.01596=0.98404.

So beta= sqrt(0.98404)=0.9920.

So beta is approximately 0.9920.

So beta gamma =0.9920 *7.915 ≈7.853.

So L_avg = c tau_0 * beta gamma = 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s *7.853.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 =2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.853: 2.4e-7 *7.853≈1.8847e-6 m.

Hmm, so still 1.88e-6 m.

So why is the option A 2.08e-6 m?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, compute gamma =27 /3.41 exactly.

3.41 ×7=23.87 → 27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41= let's compute it as 313/341 ≈0.917. So gamma=7.917.

So 7.917 *8e-16 =6.3336e-15 s.

L_avg = beta c *gamma tau_0.

Beta=0.9920 → beta c= 0.9920 *3e8 =2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by gamma tau_0: 2.976e8 *6.3336e-15 = let's compute 2.976e8 *6.3336e-15.

2.976e8 is 2.976 *1e8.

6.3336e-15 is 6.3336 *1e-15.

Multiply 2.976 *6.3336 → let me compute that:

2 *6=12.

0.976 *6=5.856.

2 *0.3336=0.6672.

0.976 *0.3336≈0.326.

Total: 12 +5.856=17.856; 0.6672+0.326=0.9932 → total 17.856+0.9932=18.8492.

Multiply by 1e8 *1e-15=1e-7.

So L_avg=18.8492e-7 m =1.88492e-6 m.

Still around 1.885e-6 m.

So the only way option A is correct is if the calculation used a different gamma or beta.

Wait, perhaps someone else made a mistake, but for the purpose of this exercise, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum time needed to observe 30% of the decays.

Wait, but the question is about spatial resolution. So why isn't the calculation matching any of the options?

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is using the velocity in terms of beta, and not considering gamma. So L= beta c tau_0.

So L =0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 8e-16 s: 2.976e8 *8e-16 =2.3808e-7 m =2.38e-7 m.

Which is 0.238 micrometers. Still not matching options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the velocity v = (p c^2)/E, but that's another route.

Wait, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) → (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 =729 -11.628=717.372 → sqrt(717.372)= approx 26.785 GeV.

So p c =26.785 GeV → p=26.785 GeV/(c).

Then, v = (p c^2)/E → (26.785 GeV c )/ (27 GeV) )=26.785/27 c ≈0.992 c. Same as before.

So that approach doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using tau_0 instead of gamma tau_0, which would be incorrect, but let's compute it.

If L is calculated as c * tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m=240 nm.

That's 2.4e-7 m, which is 0.24 micrometers. Again, not matching options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using tau_0 as the lab frame lifetime, which is incorrect. If that were the case, L=0.992c *8e-16 s=2.976e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.38e-7 m=238 nm. Still doesn't match options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the options are in 1e-6 m, but their calculation used a different gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Let me compute what gamma would give L=2.08e-6 m.

L =gamma * beta c tau_0.

We have L=2.08e-6 m.

gamma * beta = L/(c tau_0).

c tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m.

So gamma*beta = (2.08e-6 m)/(2.4e-7 m) ≈8.6667.

So gamma * beta =8.6667.

But earlier, we have gamma=7.915 and beta=0.992 → gamma*beta=7.853.

Which is less than 8.6667.

So if gamma*beta=8.6667, then gamma=8.6667 / beta.

Wait, but beta= v/c= (p c^2)/E=26.785 GeV c /27 GeV=0.992.

So beta=0.992.

So gamma=8.6667 /0.992≈8.735.

But earlier, gamma is 7.915. So that would require a higher gamma, which would imply a higher energy.

So perhaps the problem has a different set of parameters, but as per the given numbers, I don't see why L would be 2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma =27 /3.41 exactly.

3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *7.9=3.41*(7+0.9)=23.87 +3.069=26.939.

3.41 *7.91=26.939 +0.0341=26.9731.

3.41 *7.915=26.9731 + (0.005 *3.41)=26.9731 +0.01705=26.99015.

Which is very close to 27. So gamma=7.915.

So I think the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is looking for the minimum time resolution, which would then translate into a spatial resolution.

But time resolution would be delta_t, and the spatial resolution would be delta_x = v delta_t.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the mean decay length as beta c tau_0, without including gamma.

Mean decay length L = beta c tau_0.

Which would be 0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.38e-7 m=238 nm.

Which is 2.38e-7 m, but again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using tau_0 as the mean life in the lab frame, which is tau=gamma tau_0.

So L = beta c tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is the same as before.

So I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 1.88e-6 m, but the options don't have that. The closest option is A)2.08e-6 m. Perhaps the problem expects that, considering possible rounding in intermediate steps.

Wait, perhaps when calculating gamma, the precise value is slightly higher, leading to a higher L.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma=27 /3.41.

Compute 3.41 ×7.915=?

3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *0.915= approx 3.41 *0.9=3.069, 3.41 *0.015=0.05115. So total 3.12015.

So 7.915 *3.41 =23.87 +3.12015=26.99015≈26.99015.

Which is just under 27, so gamma is 27/3.41= approximately 7.915.

But 3.41 ×7.915=26.99015, which is 0.00985 less than 27. So the exact value would be a bit higher than 7.915.

Wait, let me compute 3.41 *7.915=?

3 *7.915=23.745.

0.41 *7.915=3.24515.

Sum is 23.745 +3.24515=26.99015.

So 27 -26.99015=0.00985.

So 3.41 *7.915 +0.00985=27.

So 3.41 * (7.915 + 0.00985/3.41)=3.41 *7.915 +0.00985=27.

Compute 0.00985 /3.41 ≈0.002888.

So gamma ≈7.915 +0.002888≈7.9179.

So gamma≈7.9179.

So beta gamma= sqrt(gamma^2 -1)=sqrt( (7.9179)^2 -1 )= sqrt(62.691 -1)=sqrt(61.691)=7.854.

So L_avg=7.854 * c * tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s, tau_0=8e-16 s.

Compute 7.854 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.854 *3=23.562.

23.562e8 *8e-16= (23.562 *8) e-8=188.496e-8=1.88496e-6 m.

Which is 1.88496e-6 m.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. Let me compute what gamma would give L=2.08e-6 m.

L= gamma beta c tau_0 → gamma beta = L/(c tau_0) =2.08e-6 / (3e8 *8e-16)=2.08e-6/(2.4e-7)=8.6667.

So gamma beta=8.6667.

But gamma beta= sqrt(gamma^2 -1 )=8.6667.

So gamma^2 -1= (8.6667)^2=75.111.

So gamma^2=76.111 → gamma= sqrt(76.111)=8.724.

Which would imply a gamma of 8.724.

So E/(m c²)=8.724 → E= m c² *8.724.

Given that m c²=3.41 GeV, E=3.41*8.724≈29.69 GeV.

But the problem states E=27 GeV. So this would require a higher energy, which is not the case here.

Therefore, I think my initial approach is correct, and the correct L is approximately 1.88e-6 m, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, considering possible rounding or a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula without gamma. Let me try that.

L =c tau_0 =3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m=240 nm.

Still not matching any option except option B, which is 2.08e-9 m, which is 2.08 nanometers. That's way too small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is looking for the time resolution delta_t, which would be delta_t=gamma tau_0 * ln(2), which is about 0.693 * gamma tau_0. But that doesn't directly give a length.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing up proper time and lab time.

Wait, perhaps the proper lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so the decay length is longer.

But I think all that leads back to the same conclusion.

In conclusion, given the options, the closest to my calculation is not present, but perhaps the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process \( X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^- \) with the following given parameters:

- Proper lifetime of \( X^0 \): \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \)
- Energy of \( X^0 \) in the Bubble Chamber: \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Mass of \( X^0 \): \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \)

### Key Steps in the Analysis:

1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   The Lorentz factor is given by:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
   \]
   Substituting \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.915
   \]

2. **Determine the lab-frame lifetime (\( \tau \)):**
   The lifetime in the lab frame is dilated due to relativistic effects:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma \approx 7.915 \) and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \tau \approx 7.915 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.332 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Calculate the decay length (\( L_{\text{avg}} \)):**
   The average decay length in the lab frame is:
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = \beta c \tau
   \]
   where \( \beta = v/c \). Using the relation \( \beta \gamma = \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 1} \):
   \[
   \beta \gamma = \sqrt{(7.915)^2 - 1} \approx \sqrt{62.65 - 1} \approx 7.853
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \beta = \frac{\beta \gamma}{\gamma} \approx \frac{7.853}{7.915} \approx 0.992
   \]
   Substituting \( \beta \approx 0.992 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau \approx 6.332 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   L_{\text{avg}} = 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 6.332 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \approx 1.88 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]

4. **Determine the minimum resolution (\( L_{\text{min}} \)):**
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, the probability of decay within a length \( L \) is:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}}
   \]
   Setting \( P = 0.3 \), we solve:
   \[
   1 - e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}} = 0.3 \implies e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}} = 0.7 \implies L / L_{\text{avg}} = -\ln(0.7) \approx 0.3567
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   L_{\text{min}} = 0.3567 \times L_{\text{avg}} \approx 0.3567 \times 1.88 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
   \]

5. **Compare with the options:**
   The calculated \( L_{\text{min}} \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**, which may reflect rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: A**
