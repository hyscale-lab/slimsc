Okay, so I need to figure out the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2 based on the given metric. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, what's a pseudosphere? I remember it's a surface in geometry that's related to hyperbolic space. Unlike a regular sphere, which has positive curvature, a pseudosphere has negative curvature. Wait, but sometimes the term can be confusing because in some contexts, a pseudosphere might refer to something else, but in the context of metrics, I think it's about hyperbolic geometry.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that looks a bit like a metric for a surface of revolution, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me write it down more clearly.

So, ds² equals 32 over (4 minus x squared minus y squared) multiplied by (dx squared plus dy squared). That suggests that this is a two-dimensional metric, so we're dealing with a surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, maybe?

I think the first step is to recognize what kind of geometry this metric represents. The denominator is 4 - x² - y², which reminds me of the equation of a circle because x² + y² = r². The 4 would be r squared if r is 2, since 2 squared is 4. So the denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)) which is 4 - r² where r is the radius in the x-y plane. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²) = (2)^2 - (x² + y²) which would suggest some sort of hyperbolic relation.

Wait, another thought: in the case of a sphere, the metric is often expressed in spherical coordinates. But this seems to be in Cartesian coordinates. Let me think about how to compute the area from this metric.

I remember that the area element in a two-dimensional metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy² is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. Wait, but for the given metric, it's diagonal because there's no cross term, so the off-diagonal terms (g_{xy}) are zero. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2))^2. Wait, no, wait: the metric tensor is diag(g_xx, g_yy), so the determinant is g_xx * g_yy. But in this case, since both terms are multiplied by 32/(4 - x² - y²), the determinant would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2. So the area element dA would be sqrt(det) dx dy, which would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The metric is ds² = (32/(4 - x² - y²))(dx² + dy²). So the components g_xx and g_yy are both equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²). Therefore, the determinant of the metric tensor is g_xx * g_yy = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The area element dA is sqrt(det) dx dy. So dA = (32/(4 - x^2 - y^2)) dx dy.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no, the determinant of the metric tensor when it's diagonal is (g_xx)(g_yy), so the square root of that would be (32/(4 - x² - y²)) multiplied by (32/(4 - x² - y²)) under the square root. Wait, no, wait. The determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y^2)) * (32/(4 - x² - y^2)) = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y^2)^2. The square root of that would be 32/(4 - x² - y^2). So the area element dA is (32/(4 - x² - y^2)) dx dy.

But wait, that's only if the metric is written as ds² = g_xx dx² + g_yy dy². So yes, that seems correct.

So the area would be the integral of dA over the region where the metric is defined, which is where the denominator is positive because otherwise you'd have a negative under the square root. So 4 - x² - y² must be positive, which implies that x² + y² < 4. So the domain of integration is the circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

Wait, but wait. If the metric is given as 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), then the area would be the integral over all x and y such that x² + y² <4. So the area is the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that's a bit of a complicated integral. Let me switch to polar coordinates since the region is a circle. So in polar coordinates, x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, so x² + y² = r². The Jacobian determinant dx dy becomes r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute that. The integral over θ is straightforward. The integral from 0 to 2π of dθ is 2π.

So Area = 32 * 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Wait, 32 times 2π would be 64π. Wait, no. Wait, the area element is (32/(4 - r²)) * r dr dθ. So the integral is 32 * ∫θ ∫r [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr dθ. So the 32 is a factor, and the θ integral is 2π. So the area becomes 32 * 2π * ∫ (from 0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Hmm, let's compute the integral ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ 1/u ] * (-1/2) du.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ from4 to 0 (1/u) du. The limits change from 4 to 0, so flipping them gives ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du times (1/2).

So the integral is (1/2) ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du. But wait, 1/u integrated is ln|u|, so this becomes (1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4.

Wait, but wait, when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So this integral becomes (1/2)(ln(4) - ln(0+)), which is (1/2)(ln4 - (-infty)), which is (1/2)(infty), which is infinity. So the integral diverges.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the area infinite. But that's one of the options, option D) +infty.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the substitution step: when r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 = 0. So the limits go from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2).

So the integral ∫ from r=0 to 2 [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr is equal to ∫ from u=4 to u=0 [ ( -1/(2) ) * (1/u) ) du ].

So that's (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du. Which is the same as (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du. But ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4 is divergent because as u approaches 0, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So the integral becomes (1/2)( ln4 - (-infty) ) → (1/2)(infty) → infty.

So the area is 32 * 2π * infty → infty.

Wait, but that suggests the area is infinite. So the answer would be option D) +infty.

But wait, is this correct? The given metric is that of a pseudosphere? Or perhaps I'm confusing terms. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given metric is that of a hyperbolic plane. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle of radius r is 2π (cosh(r) -1), which grows exponentially with r. But in this case, the radius r=2, but perhaps the metric is different.

Wait, but the metric given is ds² = 32/(4 -x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see if this resembles the metric for hyperbolic space. The standard Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space has a metric ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²)^2] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, but that's different from what's given here. Let me compare:

Given metric: 32/(4 -x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)
Poincaré disk: [4/(1 - (x² + y²))^2 ] (dx² + dy²)

Wait, that's not the same. Alternatively, perhaps it's a scaled version. Let me see: Let me factor out 4 from the denominator in the given metric.

32/(4 -x² - y^2) = 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) )

So it's 8 times 1/(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the given metric is ds² = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²). Which looks similar to the Poincaré disk model, but scaled.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model is usually written as ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. So in that case, the denominator is (1 - r²), so when r approaches 1, the metric blows up.

In our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y^2) = 4(1 - (x² + y^2)/4) = 4(1 - (r^2/4)), where r is the Euclidean radius. So substituting, 32/(4 - r^2) = 8/(1 - r²/(4)). So the metric is ds² = 8/(1 - (r²/4)) (dr² + r² dθ²). 

Comparing to the Poincaré disk model, which has 4/(1 - r²)² (dr² + r² dθ²). So our metric would be similar to a scaled version. Let me see: perhaps if I make a substitution like r' = r/(2), so r = 2 r'.

Then dr = 2 dr', and r² = 4 r'².

Then the metric becomes: 8/(1 - (4 r'²)/4 ) ( (2 dr')² + (4 r'²) (dθ')² )

Wait, let's compute that:

Denominator becomes 1 - r'².

The terms inside: (2 dr')² =4 dr'^2, and r'² dθ'^2 multiplied by 4 gives 4 r'^2 dθ'^2.

So the metric becomes 8/(1 - r'^2) [4 dr'^2 +4 r'^2 dθ'^2 ].

Factor out 4: 8/(1 - r'^2) *4 (dr'^2 + r'² dθ'^2) ) = 32/(1 - r'^2) (dr'^2 + r'² dθ'^2).

Hmm, that's the same as the standard Poincaré disk model with a scaling factor. The standard model is [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, but our transformed metric is 32/(1 - r'^2) (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ'^2). Which is different from the standard model. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different model or a different coordinate system.

Wait, but regardless, the area in hyperbolic space grows exponentially with the radius. But in our case, when we integrate the area element, we found it to be infinite. So the area of the pseudosphere would be infinite.

But wait, the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2". So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, pseudosphere in the context of hyperbolic geometry might refer to something else. Or maybe it's a finite area.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the area element. Let me go back.

The metric is ds² = (32/(4 -x² - y²)) (dx² + dy^2).

So the area element dA is sqrt( g_xx g_yy ) dx dy, which is (32/(4 -x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, no, that's correct because the determinant is (g_xx)(g_yy) which is (32/(4 -x² -y²))^2. Then the square root is 32/(4 -x² -y²).

So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 -x² -y^2)] dx dy.

But converting to polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², so the integral becomes:

∫(θ=0 to 2π) ∫(r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Which is 32 * 2π ∫(0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Wait, but substituting u=4 -r², du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ [1/(u)] * (-1/2) du.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

But when r is from 0 to 2, u goes from 4 to 0. So the integral becomes (-1/2) ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (1/u) du.

Which is (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is -infinity, so it becomes (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-1/2)(-infty - ln4) → (1/2) (infty + ln4) → infty.

So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. So the answer is option D) +infty.

Hmm, but the options include D as +infty. So that's the answer.

To determine the area of the pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \) based on the given metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

we first compute the area element \( dA \). For a metric of the form \( ds^2 = g_{xx} dx^2 + g_{yy} dy^2 \) (diagonal with no cross terms), the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{g_{xx} g_{yy}} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Here, \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), so:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The domain of integration is where the denominator is positive, i.e., \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to the circle \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \) in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos \theta \), \( y = r \sin \theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \( \theta \)-integral contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Thus:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du \) diverges because \( \ln u \) approaches \( -\infty \) as \( u \to 0 \). Therefore, the radial integral diverges, and the total area becomes infinite.

This result indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite, consistent with the properties of hyperbolic geometry, where the area of a surface grows without bound as the radius increases.

**Critical analysis of the options:**

- **A) 0**: This is incorrect because the area of a pseudosphere is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: This is incorrect because the area does not depend on \( x \) and \( y \) in this way.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: This is also incorrect for similar reasons as option B.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: This is correct, as shown by the divergence of the integral for the area element.
