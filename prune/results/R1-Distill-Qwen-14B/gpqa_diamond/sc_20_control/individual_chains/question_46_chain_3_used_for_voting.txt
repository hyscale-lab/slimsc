Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. And we need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis, or maybe cross metathesis.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3). Or wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent has 5 carbons. 1-ene is double bond at the first position. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pentene has five carbons. So numbering from the double bond, which is at position 1. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that's six carbons. Wait, no. Wait, pent is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be: CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Let me think. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Oh wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. Yes, because the double bond is from C1 to C2, and on C3 is a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but wait, that would be five carbons: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So in position 3, a methyl. So yes.

But wait, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, right? Or wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me count: 1 (CH2=), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)-), 4 (CH2-), 5 (CH3). So yes, that's correct.

Now, since the starting material is racemic, that means it's a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. Wait, but wait, does 3-methylpent-1-ene have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The double bond is between two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the structure after the double bond is CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the third carbon (C3) is CH with a methyl group attached. Let me look: C3 is connected to C2 (which is part of the double bond, so maybe a CH), C4 (CH2), and a methyl group. So the structure around C3 is CH(CH3)-, so connected to C2 (which is a CH2 from the double bond?), wait no. Let me think again.

The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the groups on C2 are H, CH(CH3), and CH2CH3. Wait, no. Let me write it out clearly:

C1: CH2=
C2: CH-
C3: CH(CH3)-
C4: CH2-
C5: CH3.

Wait, but if C3 is CH(CH3)-, then the groups attached to C3 are:

- One CH2 from C2 (since C2 is CH- connected to C1 and C3),

Wait no, C2 is CH connected to C1 (double bond), and connected to C3.

So C3 is connected to C2, which is CH, and to a methyl group (CH3), and to C4.

So the structure is more accurately:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH) and C4 (CH2), and the methyl group.

But wait, this would mean that C3 has four substituents:

- CH2=CH- (from C2),

Wait, no, perhaps better to draw it as:

C1: CH2-

C2: C=CH-

Wait, perhaps that's getting confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of the molecule's structure. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 (CH2=CH-), then C3 is CH(CH3), then C4 is CH2, and C5 is CH3.

Now, is there a chiral center in this molecule? Let's check each carbon:

C1: CH2-, part of the double bond, so two H's, a double bond, and a CH2.

C2: CH- connected to C1 (double bond), C3, and another H. So groups on C2 are H, CH(CH3)-, and maybe another group? Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So C2 is CH2=CH- connected to C3 (CH(CH3)). So C2 is CH2 connected to C1 (CH2=) and to C3 (CH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me try to write the structure again. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So:

C1: CH2-

C2: CH-

C3: CH(CH3)-

C4: CH2-

C5: CH3.

So C3 is attached to C2, C4, CH3, and another substituent? Wait, no. Wait, C3 would be CH(CH3) which has two CH2 groups from C2 and C4, and a CH3. Wait, but that can't be right because CH(CH3) would have four bonds. So perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So, C3 is connected to C2 (CH-), C4 (CH2-), and a methyl. So the groups on C3 are:

- One CH2=CH- (from C2),

- One CH2CH3 (from C4),

- One CH3.

Wait, that's three substituents. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the structure again. Wait, perhaps the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. No, that can't be because it's 3-methyl, meaning the methyl is on C3, not a longer chain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try another approach. The IUPAC name is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent means five carbons. The double bond is at position 1, so it's between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. That makes sense because C3 (third carbon) has a methyl group.

So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Now, the question is about treating this with Grubbs catalyst. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis breaks the double bonds and recombines them. So when Grubbs is applied, it can cause ring-closing metathesis if the molecule can form a ring, or it can cause cross metathesis if there are other partners. But in this case, the molecule is just reacting with itself.

Wait, but wait, since it's a mono-olefin, it can undergo either ring-closing (if the ends can meet) or just a simple metathesis that may not form a ring. But wait, the molecule is a straight chain. So if the ends cannot meet to form a ring (like for a five-membered ring), but maybe the structure allows for some internal metathesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis will break the double bond and form new ones, leading to different products.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how metathesis works. Grubbs catalyst facilitates the breaking of the olefin (double bond) into two metal-carbon bonds, and then recombines the ends. So for a simple alkene, it can undergo ring-closing if the ends can meet, or just form different products if possible.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is at the end. Let me imagine the structure:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So the molecule is a straight chain, five carbons long, with a methyl branch on C3.

When Grubbs is added, it will facilitate the metathesis reaction. So what can happen here?

One possibility is that the double bond could shift positions, but in metathesis, the ends exchange. So perhaps the molecule can exchange the ends, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, but the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Let me think about the possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis. Let's see if that's possible. The molecule is five carbons long, so if the ends can meet, it would form a five-membered ring. Wait, but the double bond is at the first position, so the end is CH2=CH-, and the other end is CH3. Hmm, maybe the molecule is too long to form a five-membered ring. Wait, perhaps not. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely that the metathesis would lead to a different alkene.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products of metathesis for this molecule.

In metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bond and swaps the ends. So for a symmetrical alkene, you might get the same molecule back. But in this case, the starting alkene is unsymmetrical.

Wait, let me think. The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. When Grubbs acts, the catalyst would break the double bond and form new ones between different carbons.

So maybe the possible alkenes that can form depend on where the metathesis occurs.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can happen between different pairs of carbons. Let me see.

In the starting molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The Grubbs catalyst could facilitate the breaking of this bond and the formation of new double bonds elsewhere.

Wait, but in a simple olefin metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond, and then the ends can recombine in different ways.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the metathesis could also lead to the formation of a ring, but I'm not sure if that's possible here.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic alkene. Let's see: the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

If the double bond is at the end (C1 and C2), perhaps the end groups are CH2 and CH3. Wait, no, more accurately, the ends are CH2= and CH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me count the carbons again. 3-methylpent-1-ene is:

1    2    3    4    5

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because the fifth carbon would be CH3, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So it's a five-carbon chain, with a methyl on C3.

Wait, but the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, which has five carbons in a straight chain, with a methyl branch on C3.

Now, when Grubbs catalyst is added, the molecule can undergo ring-closing metathesis. Let's see if the ends can form a ring. For that, the double bond would have to shift so that the two ends meet. But the current double bond is at the start. Maybe it's possible to form a new double bond elsewhere, allowing the ends to meet.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis will break the original double bond and form a new one elsewhere, possibly leading to different alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a shift in the double bond position via metathesis. So, for example, the double bond could move from between C1-C2 to between C2-C3, etc.

Wait, another approach: when Grubbs catalyst is used on an olefin, it can cause the olefin to undergo a metathesis reaction, which could involve either ring-closing (if possible) or cross metathesis (if there's another olefin present). But in this case, it's just the racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, so perhaps the reaction is an intramolecular metathesis.

Wait, but the molecule is a straight chain. To form a ring, the ends would need to meet, but in this case, the chain is five carbons long, and the double bond is at the first position. So, the end with the double bond is at C1, and the other end is C5, which is a CH3. For a ring to form, the ends would need to connect, but that might require a certain number of carbons.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can form a three-membered ring, but that's unlikely as it's strained. Alternatively, a five-membered ring would require four carbons between the two ends. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis breaks the double bond and forms new ones, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

The reaction of Grubbs catalyst with an olefin can produce a mixture of alkenes, especially if there are multiple possible sites for the metathesis.

In the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The possible metathesis products would involve breaking this double bond and forming new ones with other parts of the molecule.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can lead to several different alkenes based on where the new double bonds form.

Let me think about the possible products:

1. If the metathesis occurs in a way that the ends exchange, perhaps the double bond shifts.

Wait, perhaps the product could be 2-methylpent-1-ene, or another isomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could form a cyclopentene derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about all possible alkenes that can be formed by metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Grubbs catalyst can cause olefin metathesis, which can result in the formation of different alkenes, depending on where the catalyst facilitates the breaking and rejoining.

So, the initial alkene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Upon metathesis, the double bond can break, and the ends can swap, leading to different products.

Another possibility is that the catalyst allows the formation of a new double bond elsewhere, leading to different isomers.

Wait, but when metathesis occurs, the catalyst breaks the existing double bond into two metal-carbon complexes. Then, the two ends can recombine in different ways.

So for the molecule CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, the ends are CH2 and CH2CH3, perhaps. Or maybe not, because the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible sites where the double bond could form after metathesis.

Let me think about possible alkenes that can form. The original double bond is between C1 and C2. After metathesis, new double bonds could form elsewhere.

But wait, Grubbs isn't adding any new groups; it's just rearranging the existing bonds.

Wait, another approach: metathesis can lead to the formation of different alkenes by breaking and reforming the double bonds.

So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, possible products after metathesis could include:

- 3-methyl-1-pentene (same as starting material)

- 2-methyl-2-pentene

- 2-methyl-1-pentene

Wait, but wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a ring formation. For example, if the molecule can form a five-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative), that would be a possible product.

Wait, the starting molecule is five carbons long. So to form a five-membered ring, the double bond would need to connect the first and fifth carbons.

So, if the double bond shifts to between C1 and C5, that would form a five-membered ring.

But wait, the original double bond is between C1 and C2. How could it form a ring? The molecule is a straight chain.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst allows the molecule to undergo a ring-closing metathesis, leading to a cyclic product.

Wait, that makes sense. So, for instance, the molecule could form a cyclopentene derivative. Let me visualize that.

The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the ends (C1 and C5) form a double bond, then a five-membered ring would form.

Wait, but the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So if it forms a ring by connecting C1 and C5, the structure would be a cyclopentene with substituents.

But wait, C5 is CH3, so connecting C1 (CH2-) and C5 (CH3) would require some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst allows the ends to swap.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis would break the original double bond (C1-C2) and form a new double bond between C2 and C5, or another combination.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of a new double bond between C3 and C4, creating a different isomer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible products again.

Wait, the starting material is a racemic mixture, meaning it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the question is about excluding ethene, perhaps ethene is a byproduct and we're only considering the products from the metathesis of the starting molecule.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about how many different alkenes can form from the metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

One possible product is the starting material itself (if the catalyst doesn't cause any change), but since the product is racemic, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the metathesis can lead to two different products.

Wait, another possibility: when Grubbs catalyst is used, the olefin metathesis can lead to the formation of different alkenes depending on the positions where the catalyst breaks the bonds.

So, for the molecule CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, the possible products could be:

1. A new alkene where the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Which would be CH2CH2-CH2CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a shift in the double bond position.

Wait, perhaps the double bond can shift to between C2 and C3, forming 2-methylpent-2-ene or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis could form a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, but the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Breaking the C1-C2 double bond and reconnecting differently could form a new double bond elsewhere.

But I'm not exactly sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to consider that the number of possible products (excluding ethene) is D)2. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should think about the possible structures.

Another approach: the molecule, after metathesis, can form a cyclic product (like a cyclopentene) and a non-cyclic product.

So if the molecule forms a five-membered ring, that's one product. If it doesn't ring-close, perhaps the double bond shifts elsewhere, leading to another product.

But how many possible products would that be? If only two, then option D is 2.

Wait, but the starting material is racemic, so maybe there are enantiomers involved.

Wait, but when Grubbs is used, the catalyst is chiral? No, Grubbs catalyst is a chiral catalyst, but in this case, the starting material is a racemic mixture, so perhaps the reaction proceeds in a way that forms both enantiomers, but I'm not sure if that affects the count.

Wait, but the question is about how many possible products, excluding ethene. So ethene (ethene) would be a byproduct from the metathesis. So the products from the main molecule would be the alkenes formed.

Wait, another thought: metathesis can lead to the formation of both ring and non-ring products. So the possible products are a cyclic compound (like cyclopentene derivative) and another non-cyclic alkene.

But how many isomers would each of these products have?

Wait, if the molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis, it would form a cyclopentene, which is a five-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents would depend on where the ring forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing leads to two different ring products, depending on where the double bond is placed.

Wait, but wait, the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. If it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the double bond would form between C1 and C5, making a five-membered ring with substituents.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be on adjacent carbons. Let me imagine the ring: the double bond would be between C1 and C5, but in a ring, that's between adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, the ring would have the double bond between two adjacent carbons.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of this differently.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. The possible products from Grubb's metathesis would include:

1. A ring-closed product: a cyclopentene derivative.

2. An open-chain product with a different double bond position.

How many different alkenes can form?

In the open chain, possible double bonds could be at positions 1-2 (same as starting), 2-3, 3-4, 4-5.

But starting from 1-2, after metathesis, perhaps the double bond could shift to 2-3 or 3-4.

Wait, but the initial molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So after metathesis, the possible alkenes could be:

- 3-methyl-1-pentene (same as starting)

- 2-methyl-2-pentene

- 3-methyl-2-pentene

- 4-methyl-2-pentene

Wait, perhaps that's four possibilities, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can only form certain products.

Wait, but Grubbs's metathesis tends to favor the formation of more substituted alkenes because of the thermodynamic control.

So perhaps the major products would be more substituted.

But the question is about how many possible products, not the major ones.

Wait, but let me think again. The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

When Grubbs is added, the metathesis can break the C1-C2 double bond and recombine the ends in different ways.

So possible products include:

1. The same starting material (if no change occurs), but that's probably minor.

2. A product where the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis could lead to the formation of 2-methyl-2-pentene or 3-methyl-2-pentene.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing leads to a cyclopentene.

But I'm not exactly certain about the number of possible products.

Another point: since the starting material is racemic, it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. So when metathesis occurs, each enantiomer might produce the same products, or perhaps different products, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps each enantiomer would form the same products because the catalyst isn't chiral in a way that affects the product structure.

Alternatively, maybe the products would be the same regardless of the starting enantiomer.

So, perhaps the possible products are a ring product and a non-ring product, each with certain isomers.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible products.

After metathesis, possible products are:

1. The same starting material.

2. A product where the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3.

3. A product where the molecule forms a ring.

Wait, but how many rings can form? Only one possibility if the ring is five-membered.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring is six-membered, but that's unlikely because the chain isn't long enough.

Wait, maybe the ring is five-membered, which would require four carbons between the ends. So the starting molecule is five carbons, so the ring would be five-membered.

Wait, but the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is five carbons. So, if it forms a five-membered ring, the structure would be cyclopentene with substituents.

But how many substituents would that create? Let me think.

If the starting molecule forms a ring by connecting C1 and C5, then the structure would be cyclopentene with substituents on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure would be cyclopentene with a methyl group on one carbon and a ethyl group on another, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing leads to a substituted cyclopentene with a double bond.

But regardless of the substituents, each ring would be a unique product.

So, assuming that the ring-closing is possible, that's one product.

Then, the non-ring product would have a different double bond position.

So, besides the starting material, perhaps there are two other products: one ring and one non-ring.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the metathesis could lead to two different non-ring products.

For example, the double bond could form between C2 and C3, and between C3 and C4.

Each of these would be a different product.

So that would be two non-ring products plus the ring product, making three products. But that doesn't match the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-ring products are the same regardless of where the double bond forms.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to find a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material can undergo both ring-closing and cross metathesis with itself, leading to different products.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D) 2. Because the metathesis can either form a ring (one product) or a non-ring product (another product), making two possible products.

But I'm not completely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the racemic nature of the starting material doesn't affect the number of products. Since each enantiomer would produce the same products, perhaps the total number is two: the ring product and the non-ring product.

So, the possible products are two, making the answer D) 2.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another possibility I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to more than two products. For example, if the non-ring product can have different double bond positions, leading to more products.

Wait, but I'm starting to think that the correct answer is D) 2.

But wait, another thought: the Grubbs catalyst can cause the olefin to undergo both ring-closing and cross metathesis. But in the absence of another olefin, perhaps the only possibility is ring-closing or a shift in the double bond position.

But without knowing exactly, I'm going to go with the answer being D)2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst, a transition metal catalyst used for olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds, leading to the formation of new alkenes or cyclic products, depending on the structure of the starting material.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene**:  
   The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃, a five-carbon chain with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a methyl group on C3. It exists as a racemic mixture, meaning it is a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers.

2. **Grubbs Catalyst and Metathesis**:  
   Grubbs catalyst can induce two types of metathesis:
   - **Ring-Closing Metathesis (RCM)**: If the molecule can form a stable ring, it may undergo RCM. For a five-carbon chain, this would result in a five-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative).
   - **Double Bond Shifting**: The catalyst can also break the original double bond and reform it at a different position, leading to new alkenes.

3. **Possible Products**:
   - **Ring-Closing Product**: The molecule can form a five-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative) by connecting C1 and C5. This is a plausible product.
   - **Non-Ring Products**: The double bond can shift to different positions along the chain, such as between C2 and C3 or C3 and C4, forming new alkenes. However, Grubbs catalyst typically favors the formation of more substituted alkenes due to thermodynamic control.

4. **Exclusion of Ethene**:  
   Ethene (ethene) is a common byproduct of metathesis but is explicitly excluded from the count of possible products.

5. **Counting Distinct Products**:  
   - One product is the ring-closing product (cyclopentene derivative).  
   - The other product is a non-ring alkene with a shifted double bond.  
   No additional distinct products are likely due to the constraints of the reaction and the structure of the starting material.

### Conclusion:
The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst produces two distinct products: one ring-closing product and one non-ring product. Ethene is excluded from the count. Therefore, the number of possible products is **2**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. And we need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds, right? So Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis, or maybe cross metathesis.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3). Or wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent has 5 carbons. 1-ene is double bond at the first position. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pentene has five carbons. So numbering from the double bond, which is at position 1. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that's six carbons. Wait, no. Wait, pent is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be: CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Let me think. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Oh wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. Yes, because the double bond is from C1 to C2, and on C3 is a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but wait, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but wait, that would be five carbons: positions 1,2,3,4,5. So in position 3, a methyl. So yes.

But wait, the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, right? Or wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me count: 1 (CH2=), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)-), 4 (CH2-), 5 (CH3). So yes, that's correct.

Now, since the starting material is racemic, that means it's a 50:50 mixture of the two enantiomers. Wait, but wait, does 3-methylpent-1-ene have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The double bond is between two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the structure after the double bond is CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the third carbon (C3) is CH with a methyl group attached. Let me look: C3 is connected to C2 (which is part of the double bond, so maybe a CH), C4 (CH2), and a methyl group. So the structure around C3 is CH(CH3)-, so connected to C2 (which is a CH2 from the double bond?), wait no. Let me think again.

The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the groups on C2 are H, CH(CH3), and CH2CH3. Wait, no. Let me write it out clearly:

C1: CH2=
C2: CH-
C3: CH(CH3)-
C4: CH2-
C5: CH3.

Wait, but if C3 is CH(CH3)-, then the groups attached to C3 are:

- One CH2 from C2 (since C2 is CH- connected to C1 and C3),

Wait no, C2 is CH connected to C1 (double bond), and connected to C3.

So C3 is connected to C2, which is CH, and to a methyl group (CH3), and to C4.

So the structure is more accurately:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH) and C4 (CH2), and the methyl group.

But wait, this would mean that C3 has four substituents:

- CH2=CH- (from C2),

Wait, no, perhaps better to draw it as:

C1: CH2-

C2: C=CH-

Wait, perhaps that's getting confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of the molecule's structure. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 (CH2=CH-), then C3 is CH(CH3), then C4 is CH2, and C5 is CH3.

Now, is there a chiral center in this molecule? Let's check each carbon:

C1: CH2-, part of the double bond, so two H's, a double bond, and a CH2.

C2: CH- connected to C1 (double bond), C3, and another H. So groups on C2 are H, CH(CH3)-, and maybe another group? Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So C2 is CH2=CH- connected to C3 (CH(CH3)). So C2 is CH2 connected to C1 (CH2=) and to C3 (CH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me try to write the structure again. The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So:

C1: CH2-

C2: CH-

C3: CH(CH3)-

C4: CH2-

C5: CH3.

So C3 is attached to C2, C4, CH3, and another substituent? Wait, no. Wait, C3 would be CH(CH3) which has two CH2 groups from C2 and C4, and a CH3. Wait, but that can't be right because CH(CH3) would have four bonds. So perhaps the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So, C3 is connected to C2 (CH-), C4 (CH2-), and a methyl. So the groups on C3 are:

- One CH2=CH- (from C2),

- One CH2CH3 (from C4),

- One CH3.

Wait, that's three substituents. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the structure again. Wait, perhaps the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3. No, that can't be because it's 3-methyl, meaning the methyl is on C3, not a longer chain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me try another approach. The IUPAC name is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So pent means five carbons. The double bond is at position 1, so it's between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. That makes sense because C3 (third carbon) has a methyl group.

So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Now, the question is about treating this with Grubbs catalyst. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis breaks the double bonds and recombines them. So when Grubbs is applied, it can cause ring-closing metathesis if the molecule can form a ring, or it can cause cross metathesis if there are other partners. But in this case, the molecule is just reacting with itself.

Wait, but wait, since it's a mono-olefin, it can undergo either ring-closing (if the ends can meet) or just a simple metathesis that may not form a ring. But wait, the molecule is a straight chain. So if the ends cannot meet to form a ring (like for a five-membered ring), but maybe the structure allows for some internal metathesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis will break the double bond and form new ones, leading to different products.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on how metathesis works. Grubbs catalyst facilitates the breaking of the olefin (double bond) into two metal-carbon bonds, and then recombines the ends. So for a simple alkene, it can undergo ring-closing if the ends can meet, or just form different products if possible.

Wait, but in this case, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is at the end. Let me imagine the structure:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So the molecule is a straight chain, five carbons long, with a methyl branch on C3.

When Grubbs is added, it will facilitate the metathesis reaction. So what can happen here?

One possibility is that the double bond could shift positions, but in metathesis, the ends exchange. So perhaps the molecule can exchange the ends, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, but the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Let me think about the possible products.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis. Let's see if that's possible. The molecule is five carbons long, so if the ends can meet, it would form a five-membered ring. Wait, but the double bond is at the first position, so the end is CH2=CH-, and the other end is CH3. Hmm, maybe the molecule is too long to form a five-membered ring. Wait, perhaps not. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more likely that the metathesis would lead to a different alkene.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products of metathesis for this molecule.

In metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bond and swaps the ends. So for a symmetrical alkene, you might get the same molecule back. But in this case, the starting alkene is unsymmetrical.

Wait, let me think. The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. When Grubbs acts, the catalyst would break the double bond and form new ones between different carbons.

So maybe the possible alkenes that can form depend on where the metathesis occurs.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can happen between different pairs of carbons. Let me see.

In the starting molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The Grubbs catalyst could facilitate the breaking of this bond and the formation of new double bonds elsewhere.

Wait, but in a simple olefin metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond, and then the ends can recombine in different ways.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the metathesis could also lead to the formation of a ring, but I'm not sure if that's possible here.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic alkene. Let's see: the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

If the double bond is at the end (C1 and C2), perhaps the end groups are CH2 and CH3. Wait, no, more accurately, the ends are CH2= and CH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me count the carbons again. 3-methylpent-1-ene is:

1    2    3    4    5

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because the fifth carbon would be CH3, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So it's a five-carbon chain, with a methyl on C3.

Wait, but the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, which has five carbons in a straight chain, with a methyl branch on C3.

Now, when Grubbs catalyst is added, the molecule can undergo ring-closing metathesis. Let's see if the ends can form a ring. For that, the double bond would have to shift so that the two ends meet. But the current double bond is at the start. Maybe it's possible to form a new double bond elsewhere, allowing the ends to meet.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis will break the original double bond and form a new one elsewhere, possibly leading to different alkenes.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a shift in the double bond position via metathesis. So, for example, the double bond could move from between C1-C2 to between C2-C3, etc.

Wait, another approach: when Grubbs catalyst is used on an olefin, it can cause the olefin to undergo a metathesis reaction, which could involve either ring-closing (if possible) or cross metathesis (if there's another olefin present). But in this case, it's just the racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, so perhaps the reaction is an intramolecular metathesis.

Wait, but the molecule is a straight chain. To form a ring, the ends would need to meet, but in this case, the chain is five carbons long, and the double bond is at the first position. So, the end with the double bond is at C1, and the other end is C5, which is a CH3. For a ring to form, the ends would need to connect, but that might require a certain number of carbons.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can form a three-membered ring, but that's unlikely as it's strained. Alternatively, a five-membered ring would require four carbons between the two ends. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis breaks the double bond and forms new ones, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products.

The reaction of Grubbs catalyst with an olefin can produce a mixture of alkenes, especially if there are multiple possible sites for the metathesis.

In the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The possible metathesis products would involve breaking this double bond and forming new ones with other parts of the molecule.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can lead to several different alkenes based on where the new double bonds form.

Let me think about the possible products:

1. If the metathesis occurs in a way that the ends exchange, perhaps the double bond shifts.

Wait, perhaps the product could be 2-methylpent-1-ene, or another isomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could form a cyclopentene derivative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about all possible alkenes that can be formed by metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Grubbs catalyst can cause olefin metathesis, which can result in the formation of different alkenes, depending on where the catalyst facilitates the breaking and rejoining.

So, the initial alkene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Upon metathesis, the double bond can break, and the ends can swap, leading to different products.

Another possibility is that the catalyst allows the formation of a new double bond elsewhere, leading to different isomers.

Wait, but when metathesis occurs, the catalyst breaks the existing double bond into two metal-carbon complexes. Then, the two ends can recombine in different ways.

So for the molecule CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, the ends are CH2 and CH2CH3, perhaps. Or maybe not, because the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible sites where the double bond could form after metathesis.

Let me think about possible alkenes that can form. The original double bond is between C1 and C2. After metathesis, new double bonds could form elsewhere.

But wait, Grubbs isn't adding any new groups; it's just rearranging the existing bonds.

Wait, another approach: metathesis can lead to the formation of different alkenes by breaking and reforming the double bonds.

So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, possible products after metathesis could include:

- 3-methyl-1-pentene (same as starting material)

- 2-methyl-2-pentene

- 2-methyl-1-pentene

Wait, but wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a ring formation. For example, if the molecule can form a five-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative), that would be a possible product.

Wait, the starting molecule is five carbons long. So to form a five-membered ring, the double bond would need to connect the first and fifth carbons.

So, if the double bond shifts to between C1 and C5, that would form a five-membered ring.

But wait, the original double bond is between C1 and C2. How could it form a ring? The molecule is a straight chain.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst allows the molecule to undergo a ring-closing metathesis, leading to a cyclic product.

Wait, that makes sense. So, for instance, the molecule could form a cyclopentene derivative. Let me visualize that.

The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the ends (C1 and C5) form a double bond, then a five-membered ring would form.

Wait, but the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So if it forms a ring by connecting C1 and C5, the structure would be a cyclopentene with substituents.

But wait, C5 is CH3, so connecting C1 (CH2-) and C5 (CH3) would require some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst allows the ends to swap.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis would break the original double bond (C1-C2) and form a new double bond between C2 and C5, or another combination.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of a new double bond between C3 and C4, creating a different isomer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible products again.

Wait, the starting material is a racemic mixture, meaning it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the question is about excluding ethene, perhaps ethene is a byproduct and we're only considering the products from the metathesis of the starting molecule.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about how many different alkenes can form from the metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

One possible product is the starting material itself (if the catalyst doesn't cause any change), but since the product is racemic, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the metathesis can lead to two different products.

Wait, another possibility: when Grubbs catalyst is used, the olefin metathesis can lead to the formation of different alkenes depending on the positions where the catalyst breaks the bonds.

So, for the molecule CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, the possible products could be:

1. A new alkene where the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Which would be CH2CH2-CH2CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a shift in the double bond position.

Wait, perhaps the double bond can shift to between C2 and C3, forming 2-methylpent-2-ene or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis could form a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, but the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Breaking the C1-C2 double bond and reconnecting differently could form a new double bond elsewhere.

But I'm not exactly sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to consider that the number of possible products (excluding ethene) is D)2. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should think about the possible structures.

Another approach: the molecule, after metathesis, can form a cyclic product (like a cyclopentene) and a non-cyclic product.

So if the molecule forms a five-membered ring, that's one product. If it doesn't ring-close, perhaps the double bond shifts elsewhere, leading to another product.

But how many possible products would that be? If only two, then option D is 2.

Wait, but the starting material is racemic, so maybe there are enantiomers involved.

Wait, but when Grubbs is used, the catalyst is chiral? No, Grubbs catalyst is a chiral catalyst, but in this case, the starting material is a racemic mixture, so perhaps the reaction proceeds in a way that forms both enantiomers, but I'm not sure if that affects the count.

Wait, but the question is about how many possible products, excluding ethene. So ethene (ethene) would be a byproduct from the metathesis. So the products from the main molecule would be the alkenes formed.

Wait, another thought: metathesis can lead to the formation of both ring and non-ring products. So the possible products are a cyclic compound (like cyclopentene derivative) and another non-cyclic alkene.

But how many isomers would each of these products have?

Wait, if the molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis, it would form a cyclopentene, which is a five-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents would depend on where the ring forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing leads to two different ring products, depending on where the double bond is placed.

Wait, but wait, the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. If it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the double bond would form between C1 and C5, making a five-membered ring with substituents.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be on adjacent carbons. Let me imagine the ring: the double bond would be between C1 and C5, but in a ring, that's between adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, the ring would have the double bond between two adjacent carbons.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of this differently.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. The possible products from Grubb's metathesis would include:

1. A ring-closed product: a cyclopentene derivative.

2. An open-chain product with a different double bond position.

How many different alkenes can form?

In the open chain, possible double bonds could be at positions 1-2 (same as starting), 2-3, 3-4, 4-5.

But starting from 1-2, after metathesis, perhaps the double bond could shift to 2-3 or 3-4.

Wait, but the initial molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So after metathesis, the possible alkenes could be:

- 3-methyl-1-pentene (same as starting)

- 2-methyl-2-pentene

- 3-methyl-2-pentene

- 4-methyl-2-pentene

Wait, perhaps that's four possibilities, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis can only form certain products.

Wait, but Grubbs's metathesis tends to favor the formation of more substituted alkenes because of the thermodynamic control.

So perhaps the major products would be more substituted.

But the question is about how many possible products, not the major ones.

Wait, but let me think again. The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

When Grubbs is added, the metathesis can break the C1-C2 double bond and recombine the ends in different ways.

So possible products include:

1. The same starting material (if no change occurs), but that's probably minor.

2. A product where the double bond is between C2 and C3.

So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis could lead to the formation of 2-methyl-2-pentene or 3-methyl-2-pentene.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing leads to a cyclopentene.

But I'm not exactly certain about the number of possible products.

Another point: since the starting material is racemic, it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. So when metathesis occurs, each enantiomer might produce the same products, or perhaps different products, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps each enantiomer would form the same products because the catalyst isn't chiral in a way that affects the product structure.

Alternatively, maybe the products would be the same regardless of the starting enantiomer.

So, perhaps the possible products are a ring product and a non-ring product, each with certain isomers.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible products.

After metathesis, possible products are:

1. The same starting material.

2. A product where the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3.

3. A product where the molecule forms a ring.

Wait, but how many rings can form? Only one possibility if the ring is five-membered.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring is six-membered, but that's unlikely because the chain isn't long enough.

Wait, maybe the ring is five-membered, which would require four carbons between the ends. So the starting molecule is five carbons, so the ring would be five-membered.

Wait, but the starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is five carbons. So, if it forms a five-membered ring, the structure would be cyclopentene with substituents.

But how many substituents would that create? Let me think.

If the starting molecule forms a ring by connecting C1 and C5, then the structure would be cyclopentene with substituents on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure would be cyclopentene with a methyl group on one carbon and a ethyl group on another, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing leads to a substituted cyclopentene with a double bond.

But regardless of the substituents, each ring would be a unique product.

So, assuming that the ring-closing is possible, that's one product.

Then, the non-ring product would have a different double bond position.

So, besides the starting material, perhaps there are two other products: one ring and one non-ring.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the metathesis could lead to two different non-ring products.

For example, the double bond could form between C2 and C3, and between C3 and C4.

Each of these would be a different product.

So that would be two non-ring products plus the ring product, making three products. But that doesn't match the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-ring products are the same regardless of where the double bond forms.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to find a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material can undergo both ring-closing and cross metathesis with itself, leading to different products.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D) 2. Because the metathesis can either form a ring (one product) or a non-ring product (another product), making two possible products.

But I'm not completely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the racemic nature of the starting material doesn't affect the number of products. Since each enantiomer would produce the same products, perhaps the total number is two: the ring product and the non-ring product.

So, the possible products are two, making the answer D) 2.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another possibility I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to more than two products. For example, if the non-ring product can have different double bond positions, leading to more products.

Wait, but I'm starting to think that the correct answer is D) 2.

But wait, another thought: the Grubbs catalyst can cause the olefin to undergo both ring-closing and cross metathesis. But in the absence of another olefin, perhaps the only possibility is ring-closing or a shift in the double bond position.

But without knowing exactly, I'm going to go with the answer being D)2.


The question involves treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst, a transition metal catalyst used for olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds, leading to the formation of new alkenes or cyclic products, depending on the structure of the starting material.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene**:  
   The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃, a five-carbon chain with a double bond between C1 and C2 and a methyl group on C3. It exists as a racemic mixture, meaning it is a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers.

2. **Grubbs Catalyst and Metathesis**:  
   Grubbs catalyst can induce two types of metathesis:
   - **Ring-Closing Metathesis (RCM)**: If the molecule can form a stable ring, it may undergo RCM. For a five-carbon chain, this would result in a five-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative).
   - **Double Bond Shifting**: The catalyst can also break the original double bond and reform it at a different position, leading to new alkenes.

3. **Possible Products**:
   - **Ring-Closing Product**: The molecule can form a five-membered ring (cyclopentene derivative) by connecting C1 and C5. This is a plausible product.
   - **Non-Ring Products**: The double bond can shift to different positions along the chain, such as between C2 and C3 or C3 and C4, forming new alkenes. However, Grubbs catalyst typically favors the formation of more substituted alkenes due to thermodynamic control.

4. **Exclusion of Ethene**:  
   Ethene (ethene) is a common byproduct of metathesis but is explicitly excluded from the count of possible products.

5. **Counting Distinct Products**:  
   - One product is the ring-closing product (cyclopentene derivative).  
   - The other product is a non-ring alkene with a shifted double bond.  
   No additional distinct products are likely due to the constraints of the reaction and the structure of the starting material.

### Conclusion:
The reaction of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst produces two distinct products: one ring-closing product and one non-ring product. Ethene is excluded from the count. Therefore, the number of possible products is **2**.

Answer: D
