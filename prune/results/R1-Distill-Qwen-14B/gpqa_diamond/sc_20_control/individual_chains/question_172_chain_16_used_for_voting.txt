Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. Let's see what the question says.

So, two stars: star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, but the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So the usual formulas apply.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population ratio between two energy levels. The formula is (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). But wait, in this case, maybe we're comparing the same energy levels in two different stars, so g factors might be the same. Or perhaps the question is about the excitation relative to each other.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So maybe the population of a higher energy level compared to a lower one is twice as high in star_1 as in star_2. Or perhaps the excitation potential is higher.

Wait, no. Let me re-read. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the same ΔE applies, but the excitation (populations) differ.

In LTE, the ratio of populations in two energy levels (E1 and E2, E2 > E1) is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k T)).

In this case, let's say for star 1, n1 is the lower level, n2 is the upper. For star 2, maybe n1' is lower, n2' is upper. But I think the question is comparing the excitation of the same transition in both stars. So the same ΔE applies.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So for both stars, the energy difference is same, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

But the excitation (I think n_upper/n_lower) is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1, (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2 * (n_upper')/(n_lower').

Let me denote for star 1: ratio = (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) for star 2.

But from Boltzmann:

For star 1: (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star 2: (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio for star 1 is 2 times that of star 2. So:

(g * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = 2 * (g * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Simplify: exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Take natural log on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE)/(k T2)

Rearrange:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Wait, wait, let's compute it step by step.

Wait, equation after logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Bring terms together:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

But I can factor this as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me confirm:

1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes.

So substituting:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But the question is about the relation between T1 and T2. The equation is:

(ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, I think I can write it as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [k ln(2)] / ΔE

Wait, but the options don't involve ΔE. So perhaps the question expects us to relate T1 and T2 directly.

Wait, but the options are in terms of ln(2) equals some expression involving T1 and T2.

Wait, let me rearrange the equation.

Let me invert the equation:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2))/ΔE

But the options don't have ΔE, so perhaps the question is assuming that the ratio of 2 is due to the Boltzmann factor, and perhaps the only thing that matters is how the temperatures relate.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let's think of the ratio of excitation in the two stars.

Let me denote the excitation ratio as R: R = (n_upper)/(n_lower)

So for star_1: R1 = (g_U/g_L) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: R2 = (g_U/g_L) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Given that R1 = 2 R2.

So,

(g_U/g_L) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 (g_U/g_L) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Cancel (g_U/g_L) from both sides:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take ln of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Bring the ΔE/(k T2) to left:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2)

Which is the same as earlier.

But the question is about the equation involving T1 and T2. Let me write this as:

(ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes.

So,

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But the question is giving me options that don't include ΔE or k. So perhaps the question is looking for a relationship between T1 and T2, but the given options are in terms of ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but in our equation, it's [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2) ) multiplied by (ΔE/k) equals ln(2). So unless ΔE/k is 1, which I don't think is the case, because 1.38e-23 J is the value of ΔE.

Wait, but what's k, the Boltzmann constant? Let me recall: k ≈ 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, same as k. So ΔE = k. So the (ΔE)/(k) term is 1.

Ah, that makes sense. Because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly the value of k (Boltzmann constant is approximately 1.380649e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So substituting:

(ΔE/k) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (1) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, that's option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2)

So the correct option is D.

The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2 for a specific energy transition with a fixed energy difference of ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies. The goal is to determine the correct relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars, T₁ and T₂.

Using the Boltzmann factor, the ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_{\text{upper}}\) and \(g_{\text{lower}}\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since the excitation ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2:

\[
\frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Canceling \(\frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}}\) from both sides and taking the natural logarithm:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Using the identity \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The Boltzmann constant \(k\) is approximately \(1.38 \times 10^{-23}\ \text{J/K}\), and the energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23}\ \text{J}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1\), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D: 

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
