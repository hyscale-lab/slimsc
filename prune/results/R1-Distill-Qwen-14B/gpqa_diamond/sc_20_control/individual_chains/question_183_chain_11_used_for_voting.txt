Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw the structure to visualize it better. So, cyclohexene means there's a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (a carbonyl group attached to another carbon, which is part of the cyclohexene ring). At position 5, there's a vinyl group, which is a CH2CH2 group, actually, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

So the structure is a cyclohexene (so one double bond in the ring), then at position 2: formyl (which is CHO), and at position 5: vinyl (CH2CH2 but wait, the vinyl is attached as a substituent. So, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, right? Because the name is cyclohex-3-ene.

Wait, the numbering: the cyclohexene is numbered such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Then, the substituents are at 2 and 5. So, position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-).

So the compound looks like this: cyclohexene ring, with a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, on C2, a formyl group (CHO), and on C5, a vinyl group (CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached as a substituent. So the substituent would be CH2-CH2, but with a double bond, so the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to C5.

Now, the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is used in the presence of HI for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, that's a different reaction. Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but I don't think that's applicable here. Wait, another thought: When alkenes or alkynes are treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a dehydrohalogenation or maybe a dihydrogenation? Or wait, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation? Or maybe it's the addition of HI across a double bond.

Wait, more accurately, when alkenes react with HI, they undergo addition. But wait, red phosphorus is often used in the HI-mediated cleavage of alkenes. Oh, right! The hydroiodination of alkenes can happen via the addition of HI, but when red phosphorus is present, it's a way to break double bonds. Wait, red phosphorus reacts with iodine to form phosphorus triiodide (PI3?), which is a good iodinating agent. Or maybe it's more about the addition of HI to the double bonds in the molecule.

Wait, the starting molecule has two double bonds. One is the cyclohexene ring (so a double bond within the ring), and the other is the vinyl group (the substituent at C5, which is a CH2=CH- group). So, two double bonds in the molecule: one in the ring and one in the vinyl group.

Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think this is similar to the reaction where alkenes react with HI in the presence of a catalyst, but red phosphorus might facilitate the addition.

Wait, another point: the reaction of alkenes with HI can lead to the formation of diiodides if done under certain conditions. But if we have excess HI, perhaps it's adding across the double bonds.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Red phosphorus is often used in the dehydration of alcohols to alkenes, but in this case, the starting material has alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-iodination of the double bonds.

Wait, another thought: when an alkene reacts with HI, it can undergo addition, but if the alkene is part of a ring, like in cyclohexene, the addition would complicate the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the double bonds.

Wait, another possibility: if the starting molecule has conjugated double bonds, such as in the ring and the vinyl group, perhaps the reaction leads to their saturation. Because red phosphorus and HI might be used to hydrogenate the double bonds. Wait, no, that's more for catalytic hydrogenation. Alternatively, in some cases, HI can add across double bonds, but in this case, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation? No, that's with other reagents. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihalogenation. So, when a double bond is treated with HI, especially with a catalyst or in some conditions, it might add HI across the double bond, leading to a diiodide. But wait, adding HI to a double bond would result in vicinal diiodide. But in this molecule, there are two double bonds: one in the ring and one in the vinyl group.

Wait, no. The vinyl group itself is a double bond. So, the molecule has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and another in the vinyl substituent.

So, if the reaction adds HI across both double bonds, each double bond would become a single bond with two iodine atoms added. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each alkene would add HI, but with excess HI, perhaps it's more of a dihalogenation.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible products. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a cleavage of the double bonds, leading to the formation of carbonyl groups. Wait, but that's more like ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. But red phosphorus and HI? I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an elimination, but I'm not seeing how that would apply here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is adding HI to the double bonds, but since the vinyl group is itself a double bond, maybe that's where the majority of the reaction happens. But the starting molecule has two double bonds, so both would react.

Wait, but let me think of each double bond. The cyclohexene ring's double bond is part of the ring structure. If HI adds to this, the ring would open, but that might complicate the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the vinyl substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but that would require different reagents. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydration, but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction of each double bond with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, another thought: red phosphorus in HI is used for the addition of iodine across double bonds. So the reaction could be adding HI to each alkene, leading to the formation of vicinal diiodides.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, adding HI across the double bonds. But how does red phosphorus fit into this? Oh, wait, I think red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. Maybe it's used to reduce the double bonds. Wait, but if HI is present, perhaps it's a different kind of addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement or some other reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for elimination. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a diiodination. So each double bond would react with HI, adding iodine across each.

But let's think about the product. The starting molecule has two double bonds. After reaction with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps both double bonds are saturated, each adding two iodine atoms or something. Or maybe each double bond is converted into a single bond with addition of HI.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach this from a different angle. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product. So perhaps I can figure out how many rings and double bonds the product has, and calculate the index.

So the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so one ring and one double bond, but wait, the ring is a six-membered ring, which counts as one ring, and the cyclohexene has one double bond in the ring. Then, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds another double bond. So the starting material has two double bonds and one ring.

Wait, but in the cyclohexene ring, the double bond is part of the ring. So the degree of unsaturation for the starting material would be calculated as:

Each ring or double bond is a degree of unsaturation. So, for the starting molecule:

Number of rings = 1 (from the cyclohexene)
Number of double bonds: 1 (cyclohexene) + 1 (vinyl) = 2
So total degrees of unsaturation = 1 + 2 = 3.

Wait, but wait, the starting material isn’t just the cyclohexene. Let me recount:

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the cyclohexene has a double bond (so one degree). The vinyl group is a substituent, which is CH2=CH–, so that's another double bond (another degree). So in the starting material, the degrees of unsaturation are 1 (ring) + 1 (cyclohexene double bond) + 1 (vinyl double bond) = 3. Wait, no, the ring is a six-membered ring, which is one degree (since a ring is a degree of unsaturation). The cyclohexene has a double bond, that's a second degree. The vinyl substituent has a double bond, third degree. So the starting material has a degree of unsaturation of 3.

But wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is:

Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2

Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here. So for the starting molecule, let's calculate.

But perhaps that's overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction. The product's DoU is what we're after.

So the reaction is between the starting compound and red phosphorus and excess HI. What's the outcome? If HI is adding across the double bonds, then the product would have those double bonds saturated, which would reduce the DoU.

Wait, if HI adds to each double bond, each double bond would be converted into a single bond, but add two I atoms each.

Wait, but in the ring, adding HI across the double bond would open the ring. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dihydrogenation, but that's typically with H2 and a catalyst.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but I don't think so because the reagents don't suggest that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the double bonds. For example, using HI and red phosphorus, the double bonds could be cleaved, leading to carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, if the reaction adds HI across each double bond, then each double bond (two in the starting material) would become single bonds after addition of HI. So each alkene would become a diiodide.

So, after reaction with HI, each double bond would be saturated, adding two iodine atoms per double bond.

Wait, but the product would have two additional iodines, and the structure would be more saturated. So the rings would remain, but the double bonds would be gone.

Wait, but wait. The starting material has a cyclohexene ring, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, the cyclohexene is a conjugated system, but adding HI across that would break the ring, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrogen iodide addition to each double bond, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the cleavage of the double bonds using red phosphorus and HI. I remember that in some cases, phosphorus can be used to cleave double bonds, especially in alkenes, to form dihalides. But I'm a bit rusty on this.

Wait, I think that when an alkene reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction where the double bond is converted into a diiodide. So each double bond would add two iodide groups.

Wait, but in this case, the starting molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring (one double bond) and the vinyl group (another double bond). So both would react, each adding two iodide groups.

But how does that affect the structure? Let's imagine: the cyclohexene would have two iodides added across the double bond, opening the ring and creating a diiodide. Similarly, the vinyl group would have HI added across its double bond, converting it into a single bond with two iodide groups.

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction adds HI across each double bond, converting each into a single bond with two iodides attached.

So, after the reaction, the cyclohexene ring's double bond would become a single bond with two iodines attached, and the vinyl group's double bond would also become a single bond with two iodines. So, the product would have no double bonds left, and the ring would be opened, perhaps.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me try to imagine the structures.

The starting molecule: cyclohexene ring with substituents. Let's say, for the cyclohexene, the double bond is between C3 and C4. The substituents are at C2 and C5. The formyl group is at C2, and the vinyl group is at C5, which is CH2-CH2 with a double bond in the substituent.

After adding HI across each double bond, the cyclohexene becomes a diiodide, but the ring might open. Hmm, but if the ring opens, that would create a chain. So, the cyclohexene would become a chain with two iodines added where the double bond was.

Wait, but perhaps the cyclohexene ring's double bond is in the ring, so adding HI across that would lead to a ring-opening to form a diiodide. For example, cyclohexene (C6H10) would add HI to become C6H11I2? I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihalogenation, adding two iodine atoms across each double bond.

So, the starting material has two double bonds. Each would react with HI, adding two iodines, thus converting each double bond into a single bond with two iodines.

Wait, but then the product would have four iodine atoms (two from each double bond), but I'm not certain about the structure.

But more importantly, for the index of hydrogen deficiency, each double bond is one degree, each ring is another. So if both double bonds are saturated (converted to single bonds), and the ring is still present, the product would have one ring remaining. So the DoU would be 1.

Wait, but if the ring opens, then there's no ring. So if the cyclohexene's double bond is opened, the ring is gone. So, the product would have zero rings and no double bonds, so DoU is zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Starting DoU: 3 (1 ring, 2 double bonds).

After reaction, if both double bonds are saturated and the ring is opened, then the product has no rings and no double bonds. So DoU is zero.

But if the ring remains, but the double bonds are gone, then DoU would be 1 (the ring).

So which is it? Does the reaction open the ring or leave it intact?

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think that in such conditions, the double bonds would undergo addition, but the ring might remain.

Wait, but in the case of cyclohexene, if you add HI, say through hydrohalogenation, you would get a diiodide. But the ring would still be intact, right? Because adding HI across the double bond would just replace the double bond with two single bonds and two iodines.

Wait, cyclohexene has a six-membered ring with a double bond. If HI adds across the double bond, it would become a cyclohexane diiodide, but the ring remains. So the product would have a cyclohexane ring with two iodines attached to adjacent carbons.

Similarly, the vinyl group, which is a substituent with a double bond, would add HI across it, turning the double bond into a single bond with two iodines. So the vinyl group would become a -CH2-I-CH2-I- group? Or perhaps a -CH2-CH2- group with two iodines added.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would add HI across the double bond, becoming CH2-I-CH2-I. No, wait, adding HI to CH2=CH- would give CH2-I-CH2-I? No, that doesn't seem right. Adding HI to an alkene generally gives a vicinal dihalide. So CH2=CH2 would become CH2I-CH2I, but in this case, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So adding HI would make CH2I-CH2I- attached to the ring.

Wait, but that would add two iodines to the vinyl substituent.

So, the product after reaction would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (since the cyclohexene's double bond was saturated) with two iodines attached to adjacent carbons.

- The substituent at C5 would be a CH2-I-CH2-I group.

Additionally, the formyl group (CHO) at C2 remains unchanged, I think. Unless some reaction occurs there, but I don't think HI and red phosphorus would affect a carbonyl group. They're more about alkenes and alkynes.

So, the product would have a cyclohexane ring (no double bond in the ring) and the substituent at C5 would have a single bond with two iodines, so the double bond is gone.

Thus, the product has:

- One ring (cyclohexane: 6-membered ring, which is a degree of unsaturation).

- No double bonds left (both the ring's and the vinyl's double bonds are saturated).

So the degree of unsaturation would be 1 (only the ring remains).

Wait, but what about the iodines? They don't affect the degree of unsaturation. Only rings and double bonds (and triple bonds, which count as two) contribute.

So the product's structure would have one ring and no double bonds, so DoU is 1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the original DoU again. The starting material's DoU is 3: one ring, two double bonds. If two of those (two double bonds) are saturated, and the ring remains, then the product's DoU is 1.

So the answer would be option A) 1.

But wait, another thought: if both double bonds are saturated, the product has no double bonds and the ring remains. So DoU is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring is also opened. If the cyclohexene's double bond is opened, the ring would break, turning into a chain. In that case, the product would have no rings and no double bonds, so DoU is zero.

Which is it? Does the reaction with HI and red phosphorus open the ring or leave it intact?

In the case of cyclohexene, adding HI would typically add across the double bond, converting it into a vicinal diiodide. The ring would remain. So the product would have a cyclohexane diiodide, not an open chain.

So the ring remains, and the two double bonds (ring and vinyl) are saturated.

So, product's DoU is 1.

Thus, the answer should be option A) 1.

The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The degree of unsaturation is calculated based on the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:
   - The molecule is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4.
   - At position 2, there is a formyl group (CHO).
   - At position 5, there is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-).
   - The molecule has **one ring (cyclohexene)** and **two double bonds (one in the ring and one in the vinyl group)**.
   - Therefore, the degree of unsaturation of the starting material is **3**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI are known to react with alkenes, adding HI across the double bonds to form vicinal diiodides.
   - The reaction converts the double bonds into single bonds, saturating the molecule.
   - The cyclohexene ring remains intact, as the reaction does not break the ring structure.

3. **Structure of the Product**:
   - After the reaction, the double bond in the cyclohexene ring is converted into a single bond with two iodine atoms added.
   - The double bond in the vinyl group is also saturated, converting it into a single bond with two iodine atoms.
   - The product retains the cyclohexane ring (no double bonds in the ring) and has no remaining double bonds in the vinyl group.
   - The degree of unsaturation of the product is determined by the number of rings and double bonds:
     - **One ring (cyclohexane)** remains.
     - **No double bonds** are present in the product.
   - Therefore, the degree of unsaturation of the product is **1**.

### Conclusion:
The index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation) of the product is **1**.
