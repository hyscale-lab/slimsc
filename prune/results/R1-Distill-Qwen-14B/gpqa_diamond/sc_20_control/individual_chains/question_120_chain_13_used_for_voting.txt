Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller. Like, plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So higher distance means smaller plx.

Now, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed. But wait, what's the distribution here? Uniform in terms of volume or on the celestial sphere? I think in astronomy, when we say uniform distribution, we often mean uniform in space, so same number per unit volume. So the number density is constant.

So if stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density n is constant. Now, I need to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like a bin in plx). Let's model this.

Let me think about a small change in parallax, dplx. How does this correspond to a change in distance? Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So dplx = - (1/d^2) dd. Or maybe it's easier to express in terms of d. Let me see:

Distance d = 1/plx. So if plx increases by a small amount dplx, what's the corresponding change in d? Hmm, d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Since d decreases as plx increases, but perhaps I'm getting the signs mixed up. Maybe I should express everything in terms of volume.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a shell is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But I'm supposed to find the number per unit plx. So I need to express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, let's substitute. So d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because plx increases as d decreases. So d decreases as plx increases. So if d decreases by dd, plx increases by dplx, right? So d is 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

But I'm interested in the number of stars per unit plx. So for a small change dplx, how many stars are there? Let's express the number of stars in terms of plx.

The number in the shell is n * 4π d² dd. Substitute d = 1/plx and dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the number becomes n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx). Wait, but the negative sign just indicates direction, so we can take the absolute value since we're talking about counts. So the number of stars per unit plx is n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) )? Wait, no—hold on. Let me reorganize this.

Wait, the number of stars in a shell with plx between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of that shell. So the volume element is 4π d² dd. But since plx = 1/d, that dd is equal to (1/plx²) dplx. Because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Because the absolute value of dd is (1/plx^2) dplx.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx. Wait, that would be 4π n / plx^4 dplx. So the number per unit plx is 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is asking for the number of stars per unit range of plx. So as plx increases, the number per unit plx decreases as 1/plx^4. So the number density in plx space (per unit plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, let me double-check. The number of stars per unit volume is n. But when we look at a specific range of plx (distance), the number depends on how much volume is at that plx. Since the volume element (per unit plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4, then the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, another way to think about it: The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is 4π d² * n * dd, where dd is the thickness. But since d = 1/plx, let's substitute. So 4π (1/plx)^2 * n * (1/(plx)^2) dplx. Because dd = (1/plx^2) dplx. So that gives 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx (dplx) is (4π n) (1/plx^4). So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density \( n \) (stars per unit volume) is constant.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The volume element in terms of parallax becomes:

\[
4\pi d^2 dd = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Taking the absolute value (since we are counting stars), the number of stars in a shell is:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto 4\pi n \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This matches option A.
