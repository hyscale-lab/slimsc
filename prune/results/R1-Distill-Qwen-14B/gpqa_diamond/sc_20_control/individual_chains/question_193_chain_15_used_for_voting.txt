Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1 / plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh yeah, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if the distance is d parsecs, then plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, we need to find the relationship between N and d. Because currently, N is given in terms of plx. So let's substitute plx in terms of d.

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, plx is 1/d. Let me write plx as (1/d). So 1/(plx) would be d. So plx^5 is (1/d)^5 which is 1/(d^5). So 1/(plx^5) is d^5. Therefore, N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify that. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. So when distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance? That seems a bit high, but okay.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So, the question is about the number of stars in a region as a function of distance. So, if N is proportional to d^5, then for each increment in d, N increases by d^5. But wait, that's the trend. So for a unit change in r (I think 'r' is the distance here, maybe another variable?), the number of stars would increase as r^5.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait. The number of stars in a region isn't just a function of distance, but also depends on the volume, since stars are spread out in three dimensions. Normally, the number of stars you can observe within a certain distance depends on the volume. Volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, in that case, the number of stars would be proportional to r³. But wait, this question says it's varying as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So in this specific region, the variation is different from the usual case. So the usual reasoning about volume doesn't directly apply here.

Wait, why is that? Maybe because in this region, the star density (number per unit volume) isn't constant. Normally, if the density is constant, N would be proportional to r^3. But if the density varies with distance, then N would scale differently. The question gives a specific relation between N and parallax, so I have to follow that.

So let's get back. N ∝ (d)^5. So for a given distance r, the number of stars increases as r^5. But the question asks how the number changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, perhaps it's about the rate of change. Like, how much does N change as you move from r to r+dr? That would be dN/dr.

So if N = k d^5, where k is a constant of proportionality, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the change in N per unit change in r is proportional to r^4. Therefore, the number of stars increases as r^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but the options include r^3, r^2, r^5, r^4. So the correct option would be C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = C * (1/plx)^5, where C is a constant. Since parallax plx is 1/d, this becomes N = C (d)^5. Now, the number of stars as a function of d is d^5.

But wait, if I'm looking for the number of stars in a thin spherical shell between d and d+dr, that would be the surface area of the shell (4πd² dr) multiplied by the number density (stars per volume) at that distance. But in this case, the number of stars isn't just a function of volume, because the number density might not be uniform. Wait, but the question says that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So perhaps the total number within a distance d is proportional to d^5. So integrating along the line of sight, but that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the solid angle and is simply assuming that N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which directly translates to N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars in a region of the sky (which is probably a unit area or fixed solid angle) varies as d^5. So when you move to a distance r, you have N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. But that's when considering a fixed area. So for a given area, the number of stars you observe at distance r would be proportional to r^5. So the number per unit distance would be the derivative, which is 5r^4. So the change in N per unit change in r is ~r^4.

But the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit change in r, the change in N is proportional to r^4. So the correct option is C) ~ r^4.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is related to distance (\( d \)) by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), so \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars increases with the fourth power of distance per unit range of distance.

The correct answer is:
