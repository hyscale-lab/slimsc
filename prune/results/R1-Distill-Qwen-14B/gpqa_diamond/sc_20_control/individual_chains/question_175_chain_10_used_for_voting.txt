Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I need to figure out the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle and the form of the function f. Let's think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says it's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. So, it's symmetric around the z-axis. Since it's oscillating, it must emit radiation. The wavelength is lambda, and in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta (the angle from the z-axis).

The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated when theta is 30 degrees, and what form f takes. The options are A, B, C, D.

I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern has a specific dependence on the angle. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle theta. For a dipole, the radiation is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation, so that's when theta is 90 degrees. Wait, but the maximum here is given as A, so perhaps the function f is the power per unit solid angle.

The formula for the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is something like (p² omega⁴ sin²(theta)) / (something like c^3 or c^5), but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta), right? Because the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the dipole's axis. So the function f(theta) would have a sin^2(theta) dependence.

So, the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. The maximum power would occur at theta where sin(theta) is maximum, which is at theta=90 degrees, but here we're considering a spheroid oscillation, maybe more like a quadrupole? Or perhaps it's a dipole in a spheroidal shape.

Wait, no, the problem says it's an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid. So the symmetry is along the z-axis. So maybe it's a dipole-like oscillation but with a specific angular distribution.

Wait, let me think about the radiation from a dipole. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sin^2(theta)). The maximum occurs at theta=90°, where sin(theta) is 1. So the maximum value of f(theta) is some constant times 1. But the question says the maximum power is A. So if f(theta) is proportional to sin^2(theta), then the maximum is when sin(theta)=1, giving f_max = some proportionality constant.

But the question is about the fraction of the maximum power radiated at theta=30 degrees. So at theta=30°, sin(theta)=0.5. So sin^2(theta)=0.25. That would suggest that the power at 30° is 25% of the maximum. Wait, because f(theta) is proportional to sin^2(theta), so the fraction would be (sin^2(30°)) / (sin^2(90°)) ) = (0.25)/(1) = 0.25, which is 1/4.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question says that the power per unit solid angle is f, and A is the maximum. So if f(theta) = (some constant) * sin^2(theta), then the maximum value is A, which occurs when sin^2(theta)=1. So, at theta=30°, the value is (sin^2(30°)) * A = (0.25) * A. So the fraction is 1/4. So the first part of the answer is 1/4.

But wait, the options have different possibilities. Let's check the options. Option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4, option B is 1/4 and lambda^-3, etc.

Now, the other part of the question is the possible form of f as a function of lambda. So what's the dependence of the radiated power per unit solid angle on the wavelength?

I remember that the power radiated by an oscillating charge depends on the frequency. The radiation power from a dipole is given by P ~ (d^2 p/dt^2)^2, where p is the dipole moment. For oscillations at frequency f, the time derivative would involve f^2. Also, the radiation resistance or the impedance of the medium depends on frequency.

Wait, the power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( ( (e^2) (omega^4) ) / (6 pi epsilon_0 c^3) ) * sin^2(theta) ), perhaps? Or maybe more accurately, the power per unit solid angle would have factors involving omega^4. Since omega is 2 pi over the period, and the wavelength lambda is c/(f) = c/(omega/(2pi)) ) = 2 pi c / omega. So omega = 2 pi c / lambda. So omega^4 is (2 pi c)^4 / lambda^4. So the power per unit solid angle would be proportional to omega^4, which is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Wait, so f(theta) is proportional to sin^2(theta) * 1/lambda^4. So the function f would have a lambda^-4 dependence. So the form of f is lambda^(-4).

Putting it together, the fraction of the maximum power at theta=30 is 1/4, and the form is lambda^-4. So looking at the options, option C is 1/4 and lambda^-4. So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radiation pattern of an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid with symmetry along the z-axis. The power radiated per unit solid angle, \( f(\theta) \), depends on the angle \( \theta \) and the wavelength \( \lambda \). The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of \( f \).

### Step 1: Angular Dependence of Power
For an oscillating dipole, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2(\theta) \). The maximum power occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \), so \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25 \). This means the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 0.25 \) or \( 1/4 \).

### Step 2: Wavelength Dependence of Power
The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. Since \( \omega = 2\pi c / \lambda \), we find \( \omega^4 \propto 1/\lambda^4 \). Therefore, the power per unit solid angle, \( f(\theta) \), has a dependence on \( \lambda \) as \( \lambda^{-4} \).

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the above analysis:
- The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).
- The form of \( f \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).

These match the values in **Option C**.
