Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I remember that equilibrium temperature is influenced by a few factors, like the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh, right, because planets farther away are colder, right?

The problem says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, which I think is when a planet's transit (like when it passes in front of the star) happens at varying times because of gravitational interactions with other planets. But maybe that's not super relevant here since the question is about equilibrium temperature.

All these planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, their orbital periods are in proportion. Let me denote their periods as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5. So P1 is the shortest period, then P2 is 2*P1, P3 is 2.5*P1, P4 is 3.5*P1, and P5 is 5*P1.

The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, which I think means they reflect the same fraction of light, so that won't affect the calculation. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the distance, and the albedo. Since albedo is the same for both, I can ignore it in the ratio.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L / (16πσ d²)) ]^1/4, where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star. But since we're taking a ratio of two planets around the same star, L and σ will cancel out. So the temperature ratio depends on the inverse square root of the square of their distances, since d is in the denominator.

Wait, the formula can be simplified. Let me think again. The equilibrium temperature (T) is proportional to (L/(d²))^(1/4). So T ∝ (1/d²)^(1/4) = 1/d^(1/2). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Alternatively, T ∝ 1/sqrt(d).

But wait, the planets' periods are given, not their distances. So I need to relate the period to the distance. I remember Kepler's third law, which says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance here, since orbits are circular). So P² ∝ d³, or d ∝ P^(2/3).

So if P is the period, then d = k * P^(2/3), where k is some constant that depends on the star's mass and other factors, but since it's the same for all planets, it'll cancel out in the ratio.

So, for two planets, let's say Planet A with period PA and Planet B with PB, their distances are in the ratio (PA^(2/3)) / (PB^(2/3)) = (PA/PB)^(2/3).

So dA/dB = (PA/PB)^(2/3).

Now, equilibrium temperature Ta and Tb are proportional to 1/sqrt(dA) and 1/sqrt(dB), respectively. So the ratio Ta/Tb = sqrt(dB/dA) = sqrt( (dA/dB)^(-1) ) = (dA/dB)^(-1/2) = ( (PA/PB)^(2/3) )^(-1/2) ) = (PA/PB)^( - (2/3)*(1/2) ) ) = (PA/PB)^(-1/3) = (PB/PA)^(1/3).

So the temperature ratio is (PB/PA)^(1/3).

Wait, let me recheck that. Let me go through the steps again.

We have T ∝ 1/sqrt(d), and d ∝ P^(2/3). So T ∝ 1/(sqrt( P^(2/3) )) ) = 1/( P^(1/3) ) = P^(-1/3).

So T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So the equilibrium temperature of each planet is inversely proportional to the cube root of their orbital period.

Wait, that's a key point. So T ∝ P^(-1/3). Therefore, for two planets, Planet 4 and Planet 2, we can find the ratio T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, wait. Because if T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then T = k / P^(1/3), where k is a constant. So T4 = k / P4^(1/3), T2 = k / P2^(1/3). So the ratio T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

But wait, let's make sure about the proportionality. Let me think again.

From Kepler's third law, P^2 is proportional to d^3. So d = (P^2 * (other terms))^(1/3). So d ∝ P^(2/3).

So T is proportional to (L/(d^2))^(1/4). So T ∝ 1/(d)^(1/2) = 1/(P^(2/3 * 1/2)) ) = 1/(P^(1/3)).

So T ∝ P^(-1/3). So T4 is proportional to P4^(-1/3) and T2 is proportional to P2^(-1/3).

So the ratio T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, no. Because T4 is P4^(-1/3), which is 1/(P4^(1/3)), and T2 is 1/(P2^(1/3)), so the ratio T4/T2 is (1/(P4^(1/3))) / (1/(P2^(1/3))) ) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

So yes, that's correct.

So, given the periods P2 and P4.

From the ratios given, the periods are in ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So let's assign Planet_1 period as P1, so Planet_2 has P2 = 2*P1, Planet_3 P3=2.5*P1, Planet_4 P4=3.5*P1, Planet_5 P5=5*P1.

So for Planet_2, P2=2 P1.

Planet_4, P4=3.5 P1.

So the ratio T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(1/3).

Wait, let me compute that.

2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 4 divided by 7. So 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

What's the cube root of 0.5714?

I know that 0.7^3 is 0.343, 0.8^3 is 0.512, 0.85^3 is about 0.614 (since 85^3 is 614,125; 0.85^3 is 0.614125), 0.82^3 is approximately 0.551, 0.83^3 is about 0.571.

Wait, let me calculate 0.83^3. 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then 0.6889 * 0.83.

0.6889 * 0.8 = 0.55112, 0.6889 * 0.03 = 0.020667. So total approx 0.571787. Which is roughly 0.5718, which is approximately 4/7 (0.5714). Oh, so 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571787, which is very close to 0.571428.

So the cube root of (4/7) is approximately 0.83.

Wait, that can't be right because 0.83^3 is about 0.5717, which is just a little over 4/7 (0.571428). So the cube root of (2/3.5) is cube root of (4/7) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, wait, but wait, the ratio is (P2/P4) = 2/3.5 = 4/7.

So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio of their temperatures is approximately 0.83.

But wait the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4 / T2 ≈ 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83, option D is ~0.75.

So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait—is my reasoning correct? Let me double-check.

Another way: Let's compute the cube of 0.83. 0.83^3 is approximately 0.5717, as before. So if (T4/T2) = (4/7)^(1/3) = approx 0.83, then the ratio is 0.83.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is the other way around, and I should have T2/T4 = (P4/P2)^(1/3). Wait, no, no, because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if P4 is larger than P2, T4 should be smaller than T2. So T4/T2 is less than 1, which it is (0.83).

So yeah, the ratio is approx 0.83, which is option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star, \( d \), and \( d \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) via Kepler's third law. Specifically, \( d \propto P^{2/3} \). Substituting this into the temperature formula, we find \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \).

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets as \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \), we assign Planet_1's period as \( P_1 \). Thus, Planet_2 has \( P_2 = 2P_1 \), and Planet_4 has \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \), we find:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{2}{3.5} \), we get \( \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714 \). Taking the cube root of \( 0.5714 \), we find:

\[
\left(0.5714\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \), which corresponds to option C.

So T ∝ P^(-1/3). So T4 is proportional to P4^(-1/3) and T2 is proportional to P2^(-1/3).

So the ratio T4/T2 = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, no. Because T4 is P4^(-1/3), which is 1/(P4^(1/3)), and T2 is 1/(P2^(1/3)), so the ratio T4/T2 is (1/(P4^(1/3))) / (1/(P2^(1/3))) ) = (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

So yes, that's correct.

So, given the periods P2 and P4.

Wait, wait, but wait, the ratio is (P2/P4) = 2/3.5 = 4/7.

So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So the ratio of their temperatures is approximately 0.83.

But wait the question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So T4 / T2 ≈ 0.83.
