Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and their angular momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 because p orbitals are l=1. Right, p orbitals are denoted by l=1, which fits with what I remember.

The problem gives a coupled angular momentum state as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l1 and l2 are 1 each, which makes sense because each is in a p orbital. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. Wait, but how does that happen? Because when you couple two angular momenta, you can add them to get possible total l values. So for two l=1 particles, the total l can be 0, 1, or 2. So l=2 is possible here.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each of these is the z-component of each electron's orbital angular momentum. The possible eigenvalues for L1z are -ħ, 0, +ħ because l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1, but since the eigenvalues are in units of ħ, L1z can be m1 * ħ, where m1 is -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore spin angular momentum, so we're only considering the orbital part here. So each electron's orbital angular momentum has possible m values of -1, 0, +1. So when measuring L1z and L2z, each can be -ħ, 0, or ħ.

But the question asks for the joint probability that both measurements give -ħ. So both L1z and L2z are -ħ. So we're looking for the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

The state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, but how does this state relate to the individual m's of each electron? Because the state is a coupled state of the two electrons' angular momenta.

I remember that the coupled state with total l and m is a combination of the product states of the individual m's. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> states. So to find the probability, I need to expand this coupled state in terms of the product states |m1, m2> and see what the amplitude is for m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So l=2 and m=-1. Let me think about how to get the individual m's.

The expansion of |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2> would involve all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M = -1.

So possible combinations are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum to -1

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum to -1

m1=1, m2=-2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So that's not possible.

So only two possible product states contribute: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

But wait, what about the coefficients in the expansion? Because the coupled state is a linear combination, each term has a coefficient.

The expansion can be found using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The formula for the state |l1, l2, L, M> is the sum over m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = M, of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient multiplied by |m1, m2>.

So for |1,1,2,-1>, the state is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 states to get L=2 and M=-1.

I need to find the coefficients for these two terms. Let me think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1.

The total angular momentum addition for l=1 and l=2=1: I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 are given by specific values.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry or a formula I can use.

Wait, the general formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 is a bit involved, but for specific cases, like adding two p orbitals (l=1 each), there are known coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps for L=2, the coefficients can be determined.

Let me think about the possible terms. For L=2 and M=-1, the possible product states are |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So those are m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

The coefficients for these terms would be the same because of symmetry. Let's see. For l1=1 and l2=1, adding to get L=2.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 are such that when M is maximum, like 2, the coefficient is 1 for m1=1, m2=1. As M decreases, the coefficients change.

Wait, perhaps the coefficients for L=2 and M=-1 are sqrt( something ) over something.

I think the coefficients for L=2 and M=-1 would be such that the state is ( |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) divided by sqrt(2), considering symmetry.

Wait, let me think: For two l=1 states, when you form L=2, the state for M=-1 would be:

( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, but perhaps the coefficient is sqrt(1/2) for each term.

Wait, the general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients when adding l1 and l2 to get L and M is known, but I don't remember it exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I can find normalization.

The total number of terms contributing to M=-1 is two: (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state |L=2, M=-1> is a combination of these two.

The sum of the squares of the coefficients should equal 1, because it's a normalized state.

Assume the coefficient for each term is the same, say 'a', so the state would be a(|-1,0> + |0,-1>).

Then, the normalization condition is 2a² = 1 → a = 1/sqrt(2).

So the state is (1/sqrt(2)) ( |-1,0> + |0,-1> ).

In this case, the coefficients for both terms are (1/sqrt(2)) each.

So the probability amplitude for each term is 1/sqrt(2).

So when the state is |1,1,2,-1>, it's this combination.

Now, the question is about the probability that both L1z and L2z give -ħ. So that would correspond to the term where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. But in our expansion, there's no term where m1 and m2 are both -1. Because the terms are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So what's the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1>? It's zero because in the expansion, only the two terms I mentioned are present.

Therefore, the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is zero because there's no component in the state where both m1 and m2 are -1.

Wait, but just to make sure. Let me think again.

The coupled state is |1,1,2,-1> = ( |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) / sqrt(2).

So in this state, the individual m1 and m2 values can't both be -1. The only possibilities are m1=-1, m2=0 or m1=0, m2=-1. So in no case do both m1 and m2 equal -1.

So the probability is zero. Therefore, the correct answer would be D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$, and the total angular momentum quantum numbers are $l=2$ and $m=-1$. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for both electrons.

The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ correspond to the individual $m_1$ and $m_2$ quantum numbers, which can take values $-1, 0, +1$ for $l=1$. The joint measurement of $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. To find the probability of this outcome, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ must be expanded in terms of the product states $|m_1, m_2>$.

The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$ such that $m_1 + m_2 = M = -1$. The possible combinations are:
- $m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0$
- $m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1$

Thus, the state can be written as:
\[
|1,1,2,-1> = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |-1,0> + |0,-1> \right),
\]
where the normalization factor ensures $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}^2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}^2 = 1$.

There is no term in the expansion corresponding to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. Therefore, the coefficient for $|-1,-1>$ is zero, and the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.

The expansion of |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2> would involve all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M = -1.

So possible combinations are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum to -1

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum to -1

m1=1, m2=-2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, +1. So that's not possible.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 states to get L=2 and M=-1.

I need to find the coefficients for these two terms. Let me think about the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1.

The total angular momentum addition for l=1 and l=2=1: I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 are given by specific values.

So those are m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

The coefficients for these terms would be the same because of symmetry. Let's see. For l1=1 and l2=1, adding to get L=2.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 are such that when M is maximum, like 2, the coefficient is 1 for m1=1, m2=1. As M decreases, the coefficients change.

Wait, let me think: For two l=1 states, when you form L=2, the state for M=-1 would be:

( | -1, 0 > + | 0, -1 > ) multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, but perhaps the coefficient is sqrt(1/2) for each term.

Wait, the general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients when adding l1 and l2 to get L and M is known, but I don't remember it exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I can find normalization.

The total number of terms contributing to M=-1 is two: (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state |L=2, M=-1> is a combination of these two.

The sum of the squares of the coefficients should equal 1, because it's a normalized state.

Assume the coefficient for each term is the same, say 'a', so the state would be a(|-1,0> + |0,-1>).

Then, the normalization condition is 2a² = 1 → a = 1/sqrt(2).

So the state is (1/sqrt(2)) ( |-1,0> + |0,-1> ).

In this case, the coefficients for both terms are (1/sqrt(2)) each.

So the probability amplitude for each term is 1/sqrt(2).

So when the state is |1,1,2,-1>, it's this combination.

Now, the question is about the probability that both L1z and L2z give -ħ. So that would correspond to the term where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. But in our expansion, there's no term where m1 and m2 are both -1. Because the terms are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Therefore, the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is zero because there's no component in the state where both m1 and m2 are -1.

Wait, but just to make sure. Let me think again.

The coupled state is |1,1,2,-1> = ( |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) / sqrt(2).

So in this state, the individual m1 and m2 values can't both be -1. The only possibilities are m1=-1, m2=0 or m1=0, m2=-1. So in no case do both m1 and m2 equal -1.

So the probability is zero. Therefore, the correct answer would be D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$, and the total angular momentum quantum numbers are $l=2$ and $m=-1$. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for both electrons.

The eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ correspond to the individual $m_1$ and $m_2$ quantum numbers, which can take values $-1, 0, +1$ for $l=1$. The joint measurement of $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. To find the probability of this outcome, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ must be expanded in terms of the product states $|m_1, m_2>$.

The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$ such that $m_1 + m_2 = M = -1$. The possible combinations are:
- $m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0$
- $m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1$

Thus, the state can be written as:
