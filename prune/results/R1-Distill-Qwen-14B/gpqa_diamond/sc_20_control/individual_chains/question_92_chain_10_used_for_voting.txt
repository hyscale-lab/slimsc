Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a particular organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me try to parse the structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds maybe? Because I see C=C in there twice. So, it's probably an alkene with multiple substituents.

The question provides some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula, if I recall correctly, is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. I think it's the enthalpy of formation of the molecule equals the sum of the bond energies of the bonds broken minus the sum of the bond energies of the bonds formed. No, wait, actually, I think it's the reverse. Because when bonds are broken, energy is absorbed, and when bonds are formed, energy is released. So the enthalpy of formation would be the energy required to break all the bonds in the elements (like the C-C bonds in graphite or whatever) minus the energy released when the compound's bonds form.

But wait, the given data includes bond energies, not enthalpies of formation. Oh right, because the problem gives bond energies, I should use those. So the standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products.

Wait, but wait, in the calculation of enthalpy of formation, we usually consider the formation from elements in their standard states. So the reactants are the elements (like H2 and C) and the products are the molecule in question.

But wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, atomization is the energy required to break a C-C bond in solid carbon (like graphite) into gaseous atoms. So that's part of the process.

So the overall plan is: calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction where the molecule is formed from its constituent elements, considering all the bonds broken and formed.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine how many atoms of each element are in the molecule.
2. Calculate the total bond energies for breaking the bonds in the elements (starting materials) and for forming the bonds in the product molecule.
3. Use the enthalpy of atomization for carbon and the bond energies to compute the total enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but the molecule is made up of carbon and hydrogen. So for each carbon atom, it starts as part of the solid (graphite), and we have to break the C-C bonds to get individual carbon atoms. Similarly, hydrogen atoms start in H2 molecules; we need to break H-H bonds to get H atoms.

So the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of all bond energies needed to break the bonds in the elements minus the sum of bond energies released when the molecule's bonds form.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (number of C atoms)* (enthalpy of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms/2)* (H-H bond energy) ] - [ sum of all bond energies in the molecule ]

Wait, but the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So each mole of C requires 1000 kJ to break into atoms. So for each C atom, it's 1000 kJ/mol of C to break into atoms. So if the molecule has, say, 10 C atoms, that's 10 * 1000 kJ? Wait, no, because one mole of C has 6.02e23 atoms, but the enthalpy of atomization is given per mole. So for each mole of C atoms, it's 1000 kJ. So for 'n' moles of C, it's n * 1000 kJ.

Similarly, for hydrogen, each H2 molecule has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. Since each molecule has two H atoms, to get H atoms, you need to break H-H bonds. So for each mole of H2, you get 2 moles of H atoms, and you spend 100 kJ. So for each mole of H atoms, it's 50 kJ? Or wait, no, because each H2 molecule is 100 kJ to break, giving 2 H atoms. So per H atom, it's 50 kJ. Or wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of per mole of H2. Let me think.

If we have 'm' moles of H2, the bond energy is m * 100 kJ, since each H2 requires 100 kJ to break into 2 H atoms. So for each mole of H, it's 50 kJ. But perhaps it's easier to calculate the total H atoms in the molecule and then multiply by (bond energy H-H / 2), because each H atom comes from breaking a H-H bond, which costs 100 kJ per mole, and each bond provides two H atoms. So the bond energy per H atom is 50 kJ.

Wait, but wait, let me get this right. The bond energy is the energy required to break a bond. For H2, bond energy is 100 kJ per mole. So to break one mole of H2 into 2 moles of H atoms, you need 100 kJ. Therefore, each mole of H atoms requires 50 kJ of energy. So, for the molecule, if there are N H atoms, the total H-H bond energy needed is (N/2) * 100 kJ, because each H2 contributes 2 H atoms. So the number of H2 molecules is (N_H)/2, and each contributes 100 kJ. So total is (N_H / 2) * 100.

Similarly, for C, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ per mole of C. So for each mole of C atoms, you need 1000 kJ. So if the molecule has N_C C atoms, that's N_C * 1000 kJ.

Now, the bonds formed in the molecule are C-C, C=C, and C-H. For each type of bond, we need to know how many times they appear in the molecule, multiply by their bond energies, and sum.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants (elements) into atoms. This is the sum of (N_C * 1000) + (N_H * 50).

Wait, wait. No. Because N_C is the number of moles of C atoms in the molecule, so for each mole of C atoms, you need 1000 kJ. Similarly, each mole of H atoms requires 50 kJ (since each H comes from breaking an H-H bond, which is 100 kJ per mole of H2, and each H2 gives 2 H's, so 50 kJ per H).

Wait, but for the molecule, the number of H atoms is known. So for the molecule, the number of H atoms is H. So the H contribution is (H/2) * 100 kJ. Because each H2 has a bond that requires 100 kJ, and each H2 gives two H atoms. So (H/2) moles of H2 are needed, each contributing 100 kJ, so total H bond energy is (H/2)*100 = 50 H kJ.

Similarly, for C, the number of C atoms in the molecule is C. Each C comes from the enthalpy of atomization, which is 1000 kJ per mole of C. So for C atoms, the total bond energy is C * 1000 kJ.

So the total energy to break the reactants into atoms is (C * 1000) + (H * 50) kJ.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the enthalpy of formation of the molecule. The formula is:

ΔHf = [sum (bonds broken in reactants)] - [sum (bonds formed in products)]

But in this case, the reactants are the elements in their standard states (C as graphite, H2 gas). So the bonds broken are the C-C in graphite and H-H in H2. The bonds formed are the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the approach is:

The enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) to get the atoms, minus the energy released when the bonds in the product form.

So:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds)

Wait, no: when bonds are broken, energy is absorbed; when bonds are formed, energy is released. So the process is:

1. Break the reactant bonds (endothermic): + energy.
2. Form the product bonds (exothermic): - energy.

So the overall ΔHf is the sum of the reactant bonds broken minus the sum of the product bonds formed.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (moles of C atoms) * (enthalpy of atomization of C) + (moles of H atoms/2) * (H-H bond energy) ] - [ (number of C-C bonds) * (C-C bond energy) + (number of C=C bonds) * (C=C bond energy) + (number of C-H bonds) * (C-H bond energy) ]

But wait, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break C-C bonds in solid carbon to get C atoms. So for each mole of C atoms, you have to spend 1000 kJ.

But in a molecule, how many C atoms are there? Let's count.

Looking at the molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons:

Each (CH3) group has 1 C attached to three H's. 

Breaking it down:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH:
   - The central C is double-bonded to CH, so it's connected to two CH3 groups and a CH. So that's 1 (central C) + 2 CH3 (each has 1 C) + 1 C in CH. Wait, no, the CH is part of the double bond. Wait, perhaps it's better to count each group.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so maybe it's easier to count the number of C and H atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count each part.

Wait, the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C's:

Each (CH3) is one C attached to three H.

So:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: The structure is (CH3)2-C double bond CH.

   So, the first C is the central one (with two CH3 groups attached). Then the double bond is to a CH group. So that's 1 (central C) + 2 (from the two CH3) + 1 (CH) = 4 C so far.

2. Then comes -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

   The -CH2- is another C. Then -CH(CH3)-: another C, with a CH3 group. Then another CH2.

   So CH2 (1 C) + CH(CH3) (1 C) + CH2 (1 C): 3 more C's. Now total 4+3=7.

3. Then comes -CH=C(CH3)2.

   So the CH is another C (8th), and the C= is a central C (9th), which is connected to two CH3 groups. So that adds 3 C's? Wait, no: the CH is one C, then the central C with two CH3 groups: so 1 (CH) + 1 (central C) + 2 (from CH3 groups) = 4 C's? Wait, no. Wait, the group is CH=C(CH3)2. So the structure is CH-C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me count each C:

Each CH3 has 1 C.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH: the structure is:

- Two CH3 groups attached to a central C (C1).
- The central C is double-bonded to a CH group (C2).
So, (CH3)2C=CH has 3 C's: C1 (with two CH3), C2 (double bond to C1), and the CH group's C is the same as C2? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH2? No, in this case, it's (CH3)2C=CH-... So the double bond is between C1 and C2, where C2 is connected to a CH group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each segment and count all the C's:

The molecule is: 

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each segment:

1. (CH3)2-C= 
   - C is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to CH.
   So, 3 C's so far (C1: central, C2: from CH3, C3: another CH3).

Wait, no: the central C is 1, each CH3 is a C, so two CH3's contribute 2 C's. So that's 3 C's in the first part.

2. =CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-:
   - The CH is another C (4th).
   - CH2 (5th).
   - CH(CH3) is another C (6th).
   - CH2 (7th).

Wait, so after the first part, we have 3 C's. Then the next parts add 4 C's (CH, CH2, CH(CH3), CH2) = 4. So 7 C's so far.

3. CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:
   - CH2 (8th).
   - CH= (9th).
   - C in =C(CH3)2 is the same as the previous CH=, so that's 9th C.
   Wait, no. The structure is CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
   So, after the CH2, we have CH connected to another C via a double bond.

So the CH2 is another C (8th), and the CH is another C (9th), which is double-bonded to the 10th C, which has two CH3 groups attached.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should count each C:

Each (CH3) is a C.

Looking at the entire structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

(CH3)2C= : 3 C's (central C and two CH3)
=CH- : 1 C
-CH2- : 1 C
-CH(CH3) : 1 C
-CH2- : 1 C
-CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C (the CH) and 1 C (the C in =C), which has two CH3's.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe another approach: each C in the structure is a separate unless it's part of a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 10 C atoms.

Wait, let me count each group:

- (CH3)2C=CH: that's 3 C's (the central C, and two CH3 groups).
- Then CH2: 1 C.
- Then CH(CH3): 1 C.
- Then CH2: 1 C.
- Then CH=C(CH3)2: which has 1 C (the CH) and 1 C (the C in =C, which has two CH3 groups. So that's 2 more C's.

Total: 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 8? Hmm, maybe I'm missing some.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Let me think: the structure is symmetric around the central double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of C and H atoms.

Wait, the formula of the molecule can be determined.

Looking at each group:

Each (CH3) group contributes 1 C and 3 H.

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me write down the entire structure as a chain:

Starts with (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each part:

Each (CH3) is 1 C and 3 H.

- (CH3)2C=CH: 

   - Two (CH3)s: 2 C, 6 H.
   - C attached to the two CH3s: 1 C.
   - =CH: 1 C, 1 H.
   So this part contributes: 3 C, 7 H.

Wait, but the =CH- is part of a double bond, so that part is CH2? Or CH?

Wait, perhaps I should think of each part's formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to draw the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the C and H:

Each (CH3) group is -CH3.

So, let's go step by step.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

1. (CH3)2-C= : This is (CH3)2C-.

   So, 2 CH3 groups (2 C, 6 H), and the central C (1 C), but the central C is also connected to a CH group via a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count all the carbons:

Let me list all the carbons:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

   So:

   - The first part: (CH3)2C= (3 C: 2 from CH3, 1 from C)
   - Then, =CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

   Let's count each C:

   1. (CH3)2C: 3 C so far.
   2. =CH: another C (4)
   3. CH2: another C (5)
   4. CH(CH3): another C (6)
   5. CH2: another C (7)
   6. CH=C: another C (8), and the C in C(CH3)2 (9). Wait, the C in C(CH3)2 is the same as the CH=C's C.

So wait, the CH=C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups attached to the C in the double bond.

So, the molecule has 9 C atoms.

Wait, but let me recount.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so maybe the total number of C atoms is 10? Because I see two (CH3)2 groups on each end.

Wait, perhaps:

Looking at the structure, the molecule has two (CH3)2 groups on either end of a central chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a diene with substituents.

Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C (two CH3, one C in the middle)
- Then CH2: 1 C
- Then CH(CH3): 1 C
- Then CH2: 1 C
- Then CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C (the CH, and the central C in the double bond which is connected to two CH3 groups)

Wait, but the CH=C(CH3)2 is another two C's? So adding all up:

3 (from first part) + 1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +2 (CH=C(CH3)2) = 8 C's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let's try to count each C as per the formula.

Each (CH3) is a C.

So:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C's (two from CH3, one from the central C)
- CH2: 1 C
- CH(CH3): 1 C
- CH2: 1 C
- CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C's (the CH and the C with two CH3's).

So 3 +1 +1 +1 +2 = 8 C's.

But wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me count each C in each part:

1. (CH3)2C= : 3 C's (the central C, two from CH3)
2. =CH- : 1 C
3. -CH2- : 1 C
4. -CH(CH3)- : 1 C
5. -CH2- : 1 C
6. -CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C (CH) plus 1 C (the central C with two CH3 groups) = 2 C's.

So 3 +1 +1+1+1+2 =9 C's.

Wait, no:

Wait, 3 (from 1) +1 (2) =4, plus 3 (3+4+5)=7, plus 2 (6)=9.

So 9 C atoms in total.

Now, how many H atoms?

Each C in the structure:

1. (CH3)2C=CH:

   - (CH3)2C: each CH3 has 3 H. So two CH3's: 6 H. The central C is connected to two CH3's and a double bond. The double bond is to a CH group.

   So in (CH3)2C=CH:

   - CH3: 3 H each ×2 =6 H.
   - The central C: not bonded to any H (since it's double-bonded to CH and attached to two CH3's). So no H on that C.
   - The CH group: 1 H.
   So total H for this part: 6 + 1 =7 H.

2. -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-:

   - CH2: 2 H each ×3? Wait, no. Each CH2 group has 2 H.

   Wait, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

   So:

   - CH2: 2 H.
   - CH(CH3): 1 H (since it's connected to CH3, which has 3 H, but the CH has one H).
   Wait, no: the CH(CH3) group has 1 H attached to the C (since it's CH-), and three H's from the CH3.

   So:

   CH2: 2 H.
   CH(CH3): 1 H (on the C) + 3 H (from CH3).
   CH2: 2 H.

   So H's here: 2 + (1 +3) +2 = 8 H.

3. -CH=C(CH3)2:

   - CH: 1 H.
   - C double bond C: each CH3 has 3 H.

   So CH has 1 H, and each of the two CH3's has 3 H. So 1 + 3*2=7 H.

Now, summing all H:

7 (from first part) +8 (from second part) +7 (from last part) =22 H.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount the H's:

Each (CH3) group contributes 3 H.

Number of (CH3) groups in the molecule:

Looking at the entire structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So (CH3) groups are:

- Two in the first part.
- One in the CH(CH3).
- Two in the last part.

So that's 2 +1 +2 =5 (CH3) groups.

Each contributes 3 H, so 5×3=15 H.

Now, the other H's are in the CH2 and CH groups.

Looking for CH2 groups:

- There are three CH2 groups: the first is after the =CH-, the second is between CH(CH3) and CH2, the third is after the CH2 before the final CH=C.

So three CH2 groups, each contributes 2 H: 3×2=6 H.

Now, the CH groups:

- The =CH- group: 1 H.
- The CH=C group: 1 H.

So 2 H's.

So total H's: 15 (from CH3) +6 (from CH2) +2 (from CH) =23 H?

Wait, I'm getting conflicting numbers. Earlier, when I broke it down into parts, I had 22 H, but now, using this approach, I get 23. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct number of H atoms is 24.

Wait, perhaps this approach is better: the formula of the molecule.

Each (CH3) group is CH3.

The entire molecule can be thought of as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

- The first part: (CH3)2C=CH → formula is C3H5.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH: the central C has two CH3 groups and a CH group attached via double bond.

So formula would be:

Each CH3 contributes CH3, so two contribute 2C and 6H.

The central C is connected to these two CH3 and a CH (double bond).

So the formula for (CH3)2C=CH is C3H5.

Then, the next parts are:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: formula is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Each CH2 is CH2, so two CH2's contribute 2×(CH2) = C2H4.

The CH(CH3) is CH(CH3), which is CH2HCH3 (but more accurately, the formula is C2H5).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the entire formula.

Wait, the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me compute the formula step by step.

Each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: C3H5.

2. -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: This is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

   CH2 has 2 H, CH(CH3) has 4 H (since it's CH(CH3) → CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H, but wait, the CH group is CH-; so it's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

   So:

   CH2: C:1, H:2.

   CH(CH3): C:1, H:1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) =4 H.

   CH2: C:1, H:2.

   So this part is C3H8.

3. -CH=C(CH3)2: CH-C(CH3)2.

   CH has 1 H, C(CH3)2 has 6 H (each CH3 has 3 H, so 3×2=6).

   So this part is C3H7.

Wait, but wait, the structure is CH-C(CH3)2, which is CH2-C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, it's CH=C(CH3)2. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2?

Wait, perhaps the formula is C4H9?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost here. Maybe an alternative approach: the entire molecule is a diene with multiple substituents. Let me instead think of the molecular formula.

Each (CH3) group is CH3.

So, the molecule is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each element:

C:

- Each (CH3) is 1 C. There are two in the first group, one in the CH(CH3), and two in the last group. So that's 2 +1 +2 =5 C's from the substituents.

The rest are in the main chain.

The main chain is:

C=C-C-C-C-C=C.

Wait, no, the main chain is:

The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the main chain has:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 4 C's (two CH3, one C, one CH)
- Then CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: 3 C's
- Then CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C's.

Wait, perhaps the main chain is longer. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula can be determined by considering all the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C10H16.

Wait, because the structure seems to have 10 C's. Let me think: 2 (from the first (CH3)2) +1 (central C) +1 (CH) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH) +1 (C in CH=C) +2 (from the two CH3 in the end) = 10 C's.

Similarly, H's: each CH3 contributes 3 H, and each CH2 contributes 2 H, each CH contributes 1 H.

Number of CH3 groups: 2 (first group) +1 (CH(CH3)) + 2 (last group) =5 CH3 groups → 5×3=15 H.

Number of CH2 groups: in the main chain, perhaps there are four CH2 groups. Let me see:

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH2 groups are:

- between =CH and next CH2: 1 CH2.

- between CH(CH3) and CH2: another CH2.

- between CH2 and CH=C: another CH2.

So that's three CH2 groups → 3×2=6 H.

Number of CH groups: the =CH, the CH in CH=C, and any others.

In the structure, the =CH is one CH, the CH in CH=C is another, and perhaps others.

Wait:

- The (CH3)2C=CH has a CH group →1 H.

- The CH=C(CH3)2 has a CH group →1 H.

So 2 H from CH groups.

Total H's: 15 (from CH3) +6 (from CH2) +2 (from CH) =23 H.

Wait, but the formula would be C10H23? That doesn't seem right because C10H22 is common for some alkanes, but this molecule has double bonds, so maybe fewer H's.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let me count each type of bond in the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the number of each type of bond and use the bond energies to calculate.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I can proceed with the calculation as follows.

Assuming the molecule has:

- Carbon atoms: C
- Hydrogen atoms: H

The total enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔHf = [C × 1000 + (H/2) × 100 ] - [ (number of C-C bonds ×200) + (number of C=C bonds ×300) + (number of C-H bonds ×400) ]

Wait, no, because the bond energies given are per bond.

Wait, let me think again.

The formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

The reactants are the elements: C (solid) and H2 (gas).

Breaking the bonds in C (solid) to get C atoms: each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol.

Breaking H2 into H atoms: each H2 requires 100 kJ/mol, and each H2 gives 2 H atoms, so per H atom, 50 kJ.

The products are the molecule, where the bonds formed are C-C, C=C, and C-H.

So, the sums would be:

Reactants bonds broken:

- C-C bonds in solid carbon: each C atom comes from breaking C-C bonds. For n C atoms, number of C-C bonds broken is (n/ (Avogadro's number)) × (number of C-C bonds per mole of C). Wait, perhaps it's simpler to think of it as per mole of C atoms.

Wait, perhaps for each mole of C atoms, you need to break (1/12) mole of C-C bonds in solid carbon. Because in graphite, each C is bonded to three others. So the mole of C-C bonds broken per mole of C atoms is (1/12) × number of bonds per C.

Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for C. So that's the energy needed to break all bonds in a mole of solid carbon to make a mole of gaseous C atoms. So for each mole of C atoms, it's 1000 kJ.

Similarly, for each mole of H2, it's 100 kJ to break into 2 moles of H atoms.

So, the total energy for the reactants is:

E_reactants = (number_of_C_moles × 1000) + (number_of_H_moles × 50)

Because each H atom requires 50 kJ (since each H2 is 100 kJ for 2 H atoms).

The products are the molecule's bonds:

E_products = (number_of_C-C_bonds × 200) + (number_of_C=C_bonds ×300) + (number_of_C-H_bonds ×400)

So ΔHf = E_reactants - E_products

But wait, wait: the correct formula would be:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

But in the reactants, the bonds being broken are C-C (in solid C) and H-H (in H2). The products are the bonds formed in the molecule.

So, the bond energies of the reactants (the bonds being broken) are:

E_reactants_bonds = (number_of_C-C_bonds × 1000 [not sure, wait]) + (number_of_H-H_bonds × 100)

Wait, no. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break bonds in solid C to get C atoms. So for each mole of C atoms, it's 1000 kJ. Similarly, each mole of H atoms comes from breaking H-H bonds, which requires 100 kJ per mole of H2 (so per mole of H atoms, 50 kJ).

So, the energy to break the reactants into atoms is:

E_reactants = (number_of_C × 1000) + (number_of_H × 50)

The energy to form the molecule's bonds is:

E_products = (number_of_C-C_bonds × 200) + (number_of_C=C_bonds ×300) + (number_of_C-H_bonds ×400)

So, ΔHf = E_reactants - E_products

Wait, but the formula is actually:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bond energies of bonds formed in products)

So, yes, that's correct.

So, I need to find:

number_of_C, number_of_H,

number_of_C-C_bonds,

number_of_C=C_bonds,

number_of_C-H_bonds.

Wait, but without the exact structure, perhaps I can assume the molecule is symmetric. Let me count the number of each type of bond.

Looking at the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the molecule has two double bonds (C=C). Let's count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

Number of C=C bonds: 2.

Number of C-C bonds: Let's see, each single bond between C's.

In the structure, each part:

1. (CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each part:

- (CH3)2-C: single bond between the C and each CH3.

Wait, each (CH3) is attached to the central C via a single bond. So, each (CH3) contributes a C-C bond? No, because the central C is connected via single bonds to the CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each single bond between carbons.

Let me think:

Each part of the structure:

Between the (CH3)2C and the double bond: two single bonds to the CH3 groups, and a double bond to the CH group.

Then, the CH is connected via a single bond to CH2.

So, between each C in the chain, there's a single bond except where there's a double bond.

So the number of C-C single bonds is as follows:

In the first part: (CH3)2C=CH.

   - The central C is connected to two CH3 groups (two C-C single bonds) and a double bond to CH.

So, in the first part, two C-C single bonds.

Then, the =CH-CH2-:

   - The CH is connected to CH2 via a single bond: another C-C single bond.

Then, the CH2-CH(CH3):

   - Another C-C single bond.

Then, CH(CH3)-CH2:

   - Another C-C single bond.

Then, CH2-CH=C:

   - Another C-C single bond.

And the CH=C has a double bond.

So, let me count the number of C-C single bonds:

1. Between the central C and each CH3: 2 bonds.

2. Between CH and CH2: 1.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3): 1.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2: 1.

5. Between CH2 and CH: 1.

6. Between CH and C in CH=C: 1 (but this is a double bond, so it's counted as 0 single bonds? Or perhaps it's a single bond in this context. Wait, no, the double bond is a different count.

Wait, perhaps each double bond is a single bond in this context. No, wait: the number of C-C bonds is the count of single and double bonds. So, each double bond is one C=C bond, and the single bonds are C-C bonds.

So, for each double bond, it's one, and each single bond is another.

So, in the first part, (CH3)2C=CH:

   - Two single C-C bonds (to the CH3 groups), and one double C=C bond to the CH group.

Then, the chain continues:

Each single bond between the CH and CH2: that's a single C-C bond.

Then, CH2 to CH(CH3): single C-C.

CH(CH3) to CH2: single C-C.

CH2 to CH: single C-C.

CH to C in the next double bond: single C-C.

Wait, but the next double bond is between CH and C, making a C=C. So that's another double bond.

So, number of C-C single bonds:

In the first part: 2.

Then, CH-CH2: 1.

CH2-CH(CH3): 1.

CH(CH3)-CH2:1.

CH2-CH:1.

CH-CH=C:1 (but the bond is double, so this is a C=C bond, not a single C-C).

So, adding up: 2 (from first part) + 4 (from the chain) =6 C-C single bonds.

Plus the two C=C bonds, which are two in number.

So total C-C bonds (single) =6, C=C bonds=2.

Now, how about C-H bonds?

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds.

Number of CH3 groups: 2 in first part, 1 in CH(CH3), 2 in the last part. So total 5 CH3 groups →5×3=15 C-H bonds.

Each CH group has 1 C-H bond.

Number of CH groups:

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH: CH group →1.

- CH=C(CH3)2: CH group →1.

- The other CH groups: Are there any others?

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH groups are:

- =CH- :1.

- CH=C:1.

So that's 2 more C-H bonds.

Additionally, any CH2 groups contribute two C-H bonds each.

Number of CH2 groups: in the chain, how many?

Looking:

- CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, in the structure, after the =CH, there's a CH2, then another CH2, then the CH(CH3), then another CH2, and then CH.

Wait, perhaps in the chain, there are three CH2 groups.

Each CH2 group has two C-H bonds →3×2=6 C-H bonds.

So total C-H bonds:

15 (from CH3) +6 (from CH2) +2 (from CH) =23.

Wait, but earlier I thought 23 H's. Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

So, putting it all together:

Number of C atoms: Let's see, in the molecule, each CH3 is 1 C, each CH is 1 C, each C in the chain is 1 C.

Wait, perhaps the total C is 10? Let me recount:

Each (CH3) group: 2 in first part, 1 in CH(CH3), 2 in last part →5 C's.

Then, the chain:

Each C in the chain (excluding substituents) → how many?

The chain has:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

1. (CH3)2C= :3 C's (two CH3 and one central C)
2. =CH-CH2- : two C's (CH and CH2)
3. CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- : three C's (CH2, CH(CH3), CH2)
4. CH=C(CH3)2: two C's (CH and C in C(CH3)2)

Wait, that's 3 +2 +3 +2 =10 C's. Oh, so 10 C atoms in total.

So, number_of_C =10.

Number_of_H: 23.

Now, number of C-C bonds (single):6.

Number of C=C bonds:2.

Number of C-H bonds:23.

So, now, computing the enthalpy of formation:

E_reactants = (number_of_C × 1000) + (number_of_H ×50) 

= (10 ×1000) + (23 ×50)

= 10,000 + 1,150 = 11,150 kJ.

E_products = (number_of_C-C ×200) + (number_of_C=C ×300) + (number_of_C-H ×400)

= (6 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (23 ×400)

= 1,200 + 600 + 9,200 = 11,000 kJ.

So, ΔHf = E_reactants - E_products = 11,150 - 11,000 = 150 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. The options are A) 11200, B) 67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-C, C=C, or C-H bonds.

Wait, let me recount the bonds.

Number of C-C single bonds:

Looking again at the structure, let's count each single C-C bond.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Between the central C (of (CH3)2C) and each CH3: two single bonds.

Then, the central C is double-bonded to CH → that's a C=C bond, so no single bond there.

Then, the CH is connected to CH2 via a single bond →1.

The CH2 is connected to CH(CH3) →1.

CH(CH3) is connected to CH2 →1.

CH2 is connected to CH →1.

CH is connected to C in the next double bond → but that's a double bond (C=C), so not a single bond.

So, that's 2 (from (CH3)2C) +4 (from the chain) =6 single C-C bonds.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:

Each CH3 →3 each. There are five CH3 groups →5×3=15.

Each CH2 →2 each. How many CH2 groups?

Looking:

- After =CH: one CH2 →2 H.

- Between CH(CH3) and CH2 → another CH2.

- Between CH2 and CH=C → another CH2.

So three CH2 groups →3×2=6.

Each CH →1 H. There are two CH groups (from =CH and CH=C) →2.

So C-H bonds:15 +6 +2 =23.

Wait, but another approach: each C in the structure contributes 4 bonds.

So for 10 C atoms, total bonds would be (10 ×4)/2 =20 bonds. But considering double bonds, let's see:

Number of bonds:

Each single bond is one, each double bond is one (since double bond counts as two single bonds? No, wait, bond count is per bond type.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total number of bonds and see if it matches.

Total bonds = (number_of_C-C) + (number_of_C=C) + (number_of_C-H).

Which is 6 (C-C) +2 (C=C) +23 (C-H) =31 bonds.

But each C has 4 bonds:

10 C ×4 =40 bonds.

But each bond is shared between two atoms, so total bonds would be 40/2 =20.

Hmm, 31 ≠20 → something's wrong.

Ah, I see the mistake.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in counting C-C and C-H bonds.

Let me approach it differently.

Each C in the molecule is connected to a certain number of other atoms. Let's compute the total number of bonds.

For each C:

- In (CH3)2C=CH:

   - The central C is connected to two CH3 (single bonds) and a double bond to CH. So, it has three bonds.

Wait, but each C must have four bonds. Oh wait, the central C is connected to two CH3 groups (single bonds), a double bond to CH, and perhaps another single bond?

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The first part is (CH3)2C=CH.

So the central C is connected to two CH3 groups (two single bonds), and a double bond to CH. So, that's three bonds. But a carbon must have four bonds, so perhaps the central C is also connected to another group. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C=CH2, but in this case, the molecule is longer.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe another approach: since the options don't include 150, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me check the numbers again.

E_reactants = (10 ×1000) + (23 ×50) =10,000 + 1,150 =11,150 kJ.

E_products = (6 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (23 ×400) =1,200 +600 +9,200=11,000.

ΔHf=11,150-11,000=150.

None of the options match. So I must have made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Alternative approach: perhaps I counted the number of C-C bonds incorrectly.

Let me recount the number of C-C single bonds.

The molecule has the following single C-C bonds:

1. Each (CH3)2C has two single bonds to CH3.

2. The CH is connected to CH2 (1 bond).

3. CH2-CH(CH3) (1 bond).

4. CH(CH3)-CH2 (1 bond).

5. CH2-CH (1 bond).

6. The CH is connected to the C in the next double bond via a single bond? No, the next bond is a double bond, so that's a C=C, not a single C-C.

So, 2 +4 =6 single C-C bonds.

So that's correct.

Number of C=C bonds:2.

Number of C-H bonds:23.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is more complex, with more double bonds. Or perhaps the C-C bonds are more than I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the H count.

Wait, another approach: molecular formula.

If the molecule has 10 C's and 23 H's, then the formula is C10H23.

But that's not a common formula for an alkene. Normally, the general formula for an alkene is CnH2n.

Here, n=10 → H=20. But this molecule has 23 H's, which suggests perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative or something else, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps my H count is wrong.

Let me recount the H's.

Each CH3 contributes 3 H.

Number of CH3 groups:5 →5×3=15.

Each CH2 contributes 2 H. Number of CH2 groups:3 →3×2=6.

Each CH contributes 1 H. Number of CH groups:2 →2×1=2.

Total H:15+6+2=23.

So formula is C10H23.

Wait, but that's not a typical alkene. Maybe the actual structure has more substituents or different bonding.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has more double bonds. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the structure as given has two double bonds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C's.

Wait, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each C:

1. (CH3)2C: 3 C's (two CH3 and one central C).

2. =CH: 1 C.

3. CH2:1 C.

4. CH(CH3):1 C.

5. CH2:1 C.

6. CH:1 C.

7. C in =C:1 C.

8. CH3 groups attached to the last C: 2 C's (but each CH3 is a substituent on the central C, so they are part of the same C count.

Wait, perhaps I'm double-counting. Let me list each C:

1. (CH3)2C: C1.

2. The CH3 groups on C1: C2 and C3.

3. =CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

   C4 (from =CH), C5 (CH2), C6 (CH(CH3)), C7 (CH2), C8 (CH), C9 (C in =C), and the two CH3 groups on C9: which are part of C9.

So total C's: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9 →9 C's. Wait, but earlier I thought it's 10. Hmm, perhaps I was mistaken.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C's.

- CH2:1 C.

- CH(CH3):1 C.

- CH2:1 C.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C's (CH and C(CH3)2).

So total C's:3 +1 +1 +1 +2=8.

Wait, but that can't be right because the molecule's formula would be C8H15, which doesn't match the earlier count.

I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps it's better to proceed with the calculation as I did earlier, even if the answer doesn't match.

But since none of the options match 150, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D) 1900 kJ/g

Wait, my calculation gave 150 kJ/mol, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ per mole of C atoms. So for 10 C atoms, it's 10 ×1000 =10,000 kJ.

But perhaps I should not multiply by 10, but by 1 mole of C atoms.

Wait, but the molecule has 10 C atoms, so 10 moles of C atoms per mole of molecule.

So E_reactants for C is 10 ×1000 =10,000 kJ.

Similarly, for H: 23 H atoms per molecule →23/2 moles of H2 →23/2 ×100 kJ =1,150 kJ.

So E_reactants=11,150 kJ.

E_products: for each bond broken in reactants and formed in products.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating E_products.

Wait, the bonds formed in the products are:

Each C-C bond:200 kJ.

Each C=C bond:300 kJ.

Each C-H bond:400 kJ.

So E_products= (number_of_C-C ×200) + (number_of_C=C ×300) + (number_of_C-H ×400)

We have:

number_of_C-C=6 →6×200=1,200.

number_of_C=C=2 →2×300=600.

number_of_C-H=23 →23×400=9,200.

Total E_products=1,200+600+9,200=11,000.

So ΔHf=11,150-11,000=150 kJ/mol.

But the options don't include 150. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of atomization per mole of the molecule, not per mole of C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-H bonds.

Wait, perhaps each CH3 has three C-H bonds, but perhaps each CH2 has two, and each CH has one.

Let me recount the H's differently.

The molecule is C10H16? Or C10H20?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the molecular formula.

The molecular formula can be determined by the structure.

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is a -CH3 group.

So, let's count the number of each type of group.

CH3:

- Two in first part.

- One in CH(CH3).

- Two in last part.

Total:5 CH3 →5×3=15 H.

CH2:

- One between =CH and CH2.

- One between CH(CH3) and CH2.

- One between CH2 and CH=C.

Total:3 CH2 →3×2=6 H.

CH groups:

- =CH.

- CH=C.

Each contributes 1 H →2 H.

So total H:15+6+2=23 H.

So formula is C10H23.

But that's not matching any normal alkene. So, perhaps the structure has more double bonds, which I'm not seeing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counting.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation is different.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ per mole of C atoms, which is 10 C atoms →10,000 kJ.

Hydrogen:23 H atoms →(23/2) ×100 kJ →1,150 kJ.

So E_reactants=11,150 kJ.

E_products:

Each C-C bond:200 → number of C-C bonds: Let's recount.

In the structure, each single bond between C's is a C-C bond.

Looking at the entire molecule:

The chain is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the C-C bonds are:

1. (CH3)2C connects to CH via double bond. So no single bond here.

2. CH connects to CH2 →1 C-C.

3. CH2 connects to CH(CH3) →1.

4. CH(CH3) connects to CH2 →1.

5. CH2 connects to CH →1.

6. CH connects to C in the next double bond → that's a C-C? No, it's a C=C bond.

So, single C-C bonds:5.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:23.

So E_products=5×200 +2×300 +23×400=1,000 +600 +9,200=10,800.

Then ΔHf=11,150 –10,800=350 kJ/mol.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 7.

Wait, perhaps the correct count is:

Each single bond in the chain is a C-C.

In the chain, from the =CH onward:

=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

So between each C, there's a single bond.

So, from =CH to CH2:1.

CH2 to CH(CH3):1.

CH(CH3) to CH2:1.

CH2 to CH:1.

CH to C:1 (but that's part of a double bond, so no single bond).

So that's four single bonds.

In the first part, (CH3)2C=CH: two single bonds to CH3.

So 2 +4 =6 single C-C bonds.

Thus, the previous calculation holds.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure how that arises.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-H bonds.

Wait, perhaps each CH3 has three C-H bonds, but the molecule has only 16 H's, so 16 H.

Wait, that would change the calculation.

If number_of_H=16 → E_reactants H contribution:16 ×50=800.

E_reactants=10,000 +800=10,800.

E_products: same as before, 10,800.

ΔHf=0. Which is also not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of H's is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct H count is 14.

If H=14 → E_reactants H=14 ×50=700.

E_reactants=10,700.

E_products=10,800.

ΔHf= -100 → which is exothermic, but not matching options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has more C=C bonds, but I think I counted them correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is given per mole of C atoms, and I'm correct, but perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ/g.

Wait, looking at the options, option C and D are per gram, so perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound."

So, the answer I got was 150 kJ/mol. But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the number of C-C bonds as 7.

Wait, perhaps I missed some C-C bonds.

Let me recount the C-C bonds:

Each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: two single bonds to CH3.

2. CH connected to CH2 →1.

3. CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

4. CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

5. CH2 connected to CH →1.

6. CH connected to C in the next double bond → that's a single bond, but it's part of a double bond, so it's not a C-C single bond. So, no.

So, 2 (from the first part) +4 (from the chain) =6 single C-C bonds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds are counted as two single bonds each, so the C-C single bonds plus the double bonds would contribute more.

Wait, but no: C=C bonds are a separate category. Each C=C is a single bond (double bond, but counted as one in the bond count).

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

But I'm not sure how to reach that number.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute based on the molecular formula.

Wait, if the formula is C10H16, which is a common formula for alkenes.

Then, number_of_C=10.

number_of_H=16.

Number of C-C bonds: Let's see, formula C10H16.

The degree of unsaturation can be calculated.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 – H – X + N)/2.

Here, X and N are 0.

DoU = (2×10 +2 –16 )/2 →(22-16)/2=6/2=3.

So, three degrees of unsaturation. Which could be two double bonds and one ring, or three double bonds, etc.

But in our structure, there are two double bonds, so perhaps one ring exists.

But I'm not sure.

In any case, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the calculation.

But I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on my earlier calculation is 150 kJ/mol, but it's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the H count.

Wait, perhaps the H count is 16 instead of 23.

If H=16:

E_reactants=10,000 + (16 ×50)=10,000 +800=10,800.

E_products=6×200 +2×300 +16×400=1,200+600+6,400=8,200.

ΔHf=10,800 –8,200=2,600 kJ/mol.

Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the enthalpy of atomization is per mole of C, not per atom.

Wait, no, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol of C.

So for each mole of C atoms in the molecule, it's 1000 kJ.

So, if the molecule has 10 C atoms, that's 10 moles of C atoms →10,000 kJ.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have multiplied the C-C bonds by 1000? No, because the bond energy for C-C is 200 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem gives bond energies as per mole, not per bond.

In that case, the calculation is different.

Wait, the bond energies given are per mole:

Bond energy of C-C=200 kJ/mol.

So, each mole of C-C bonds contributes 200 kJ.

So, the number of C-C bonds is 6, so 6 ×200=1,200 kJ.

Similarly, for C=C: 2 ×300=600.

C-H:23 ×400=9,200.

E_products=1,200 +600 +9,200=11,000.

E_reactants=10 ×1000 +23 ×50=11,150.

ΔHf=11,150 –11,000=150 kJ/mol.

So, the answer isn't among the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question provided the bond energies in kJ per bond, not per mole.

In that case, the approach would be different.

Wait, but the question says "Bond energy of H-H=100 kJ/mol."

Oh, so the bond energies are given per mole.

So previous calculation holds.

Hmm.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is C5H8, but that doesn't match the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the average bond energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I can't figure out why.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. But I'm not confident.

To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following steps were considered:

1. **Determine the molecular formula**:  
   The molecule contains 10 carbon atoms and 23 hydrogen atoms, giving the formula **C₁₀H₂₃**.

2. **Calculate the total energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (elements)**:  
   - Carbon atoms: Each mole of carbon atoms requires **1000 kJ/mol** (enthalpy of atomization). For 10 moles of carbon atoms, the energy is:  
     \[
     10 \times 1000 = 10,000 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Hydrogen atoms: Each mole of hydrogen atoms requires **50 kJ/mol** (since breaking an H-H bond costs 100 kJ/mol, and each H₂ molecule produces 2 H atoms). For 23 moles of hydrogen atoms, the energy is:  
     \[
     23 \times 50 = 1,150 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Total energy for reactants:  
     \[
     10,000 + 1,150 = 11,150 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

3. **Calculate the total energy released when forming the bonds in the product**:  
   - **C-C bonds**: There are 6 single C-C bonds, each with a bond energy of **200 kJ/mol**:  
     \[
     6 \times 200 = 1,200 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - **C=C bonds**: There are 2 double C=C bonds, each with a bond energy of **300 kJ/mol**:  
     \[
     2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - **C-H bonds**: There are 23 C-H bonds, each with a bond energy of **400 kJ/mol**:  
     \[
     23 \times 400 = 9,200 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Total energy for products:  
     \[
     1,200 + 600 + 9,200 = 11,000 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

4. **Calculate the enthalpy of formation**:  
   The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to break the reactants and the energy released when forming the products:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 11,150 - 11,000 = 150 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

5. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated value of **150 kJ/mol** does not match any of the provided options. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the bond counting or a misinterpretation of the molecular structure. However, based on the given options, the closest plausible answer is **B) 67.4 kJ/mol**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a particular organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me try to parse the structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds maybe? Because I see C=C in there twice. So, it's probably an alkene with multiple substituents.

The question provides some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula, if I recall correctly, is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. I think it's the enthalpy of formation of the molecule equals the sum of the bond energies of the bonds broken minus the sum of the bond energies of the bonds formed. No, wait, actually, I think it's the reverse. Because when bonds are broken, energy is absorbed, and when bonds are formed, energy is released. So the enthalpy of formation would be the energy required to break all the bonds in the elements (like the C-C bonds in graphite or whatever) minus the energy released when the compound's bonds form.

But wait, the given data includes bond energies, not enthalpies of formation. Oh right, because the problem gives bond energies, I should use those. So the standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products.

Wait, but wait, in the calculation of enthalpy of formation, we usually consider the formation from elements in their standard states. So the reactants are the elements (like H2 and C) and the products are the molecule in question.

But wait, the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, atomization is the energy required to break a C-C bond in solid carbon (like graphite) into gaseous atoms. So that's part of the process.

So the overall plan is: calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction where the molecule is formed from its constituent elements, considering all the bonds broken and formed.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine how many atoms of each element are in the molecule.
2. Calculate the total bond energies for breaking the bonds in the elements (starting materials) and for forming the bonds in the product molecule.
3. Use the enthalpy of atomization for carbon and the bond energies to compute the total enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but the molecule is made up of carbon and hydrogen. So for each carbon atom, it starts as part of the solid (graphite), and we have to break the C-C bonds to get individual carbon atoms. Similarly, hydrogen atoms start in H2 molecules; we need to break H-H bonds to get H atoms.

So the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of all bond energies needed to break the bonds in the elements minus the sum of bond energies released when the molecule's bonds form.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (number of C atoms)* (enthalpy of atomization of C) + (number of H atoms/2)* (H-H bond energy) ] - [ sum of all bond energies in the molecule ]

Wait, but the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So each mole of C requires 1000 kJ to break into atoms. So for each C atom, it's 1000 kJ/mol of C to break into atoms. So if the molecule has, say, 10 C atoms, that's 10 * 1000 kJ? Wait, no, because one mole of C has 6.02e23 atoms, but the enthalpy of atomization is given per mole. So for each mole of C atoms, it's 1000 kJ. So for 'n' moles of C, it's n * 1000 kJ.

Similarly, for hydrogen, each H2 molecule has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. Since each molecule has two H atoms, to get H atoms, you need to break H-H bonds. So for each mole of H2, you get 2 moles of H atoms, and you spend 100 kJ. So for each mole of H atoms, it's 50 kJ? Or wait, no, because each H2 molecule is 100 kJ to break, giving 2 H atoms. So per H atom, it's 50 kJ. Or wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of per mole of H2. Let me think.

If we have 'm' moles of H2, the bond energy is m * 100 kJ, since each H2 requires 100 kJ to break into 2 H atoms. So for each mole of H, it's 50 kJ. But perhaps it's easier to calculate the total H atoms in the molecule and then multiply by (bond energy H-H / 2), because each H atom comes from breaking a H-H bond, which costs 100 kJ per mole, and each bond provides two H atoms. So the bond energy per H atom is 50 kJ.

Wait, but wait, let me get this right. The bond energy is the energy required to break a bond. For H2, bond energy is 100 kJ per mole. So to break one mole of H2 into 2 moles of H atoms, you need 100 kJ. Therefore, each mole of H atoms requires 50 kJ of energy. So, for the molecule, if there are N H atoms, the total H-H bond energy needed is (N/2) * 100 kJ, because each H2 contributes 2 H atoms. So the number of H2 molecules is (N_H)/2, and each contributes 100 kJ. So total is (N_H / 2) * 100.

Similarly, for C, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ per mole of C. So for each mole of C atoms, you need 1000 kJ. So if the molecule has N_C C atoms, that's N_C * 1000 kJ.

Now, the bonds formed in the molecule are C-C, C=C, and C-H. For each type of bond, we need to know how many times they appear in the molecule, multiply by their bond energies, and sum.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants (elements) into atoms. This is the sum of (N_C * 1000) + (N_H * 50).

Wait, wait. No. Because N_C is the number of moles of C atoms in the molecule, so for each mole of C atoms, you need 1000 kJ. Similarly, each mole of H atoms requires 50 kJ (since each H comes from breaking an H-H bond, which is 100 kJ per mole of H2, and each H2 gives 2 H's, so 50 kJ per H).

Wait, but for the molecule, the number of H atoms is known. So for the molecule, the number of H atoms is H. So the H contribution is (H/2) * 100 kJ. Because each H2 has a bond that requires 100 kJ, and each H2 gives two H atoms. So (H/2) moles of H2 are needed, each contributing 100 kJ, so total H bond energy is (H/2)*100 = 50 H kJ.

Similarly, for C, the number of C atoms in the molecule is C. Each C comes from the enthalpy of atomization, which is 1000 kJ per mole of C. So for C atoms, the total bond energy is C * 1000 kJ.

So the total energy to break the reactants into atoms is (C * 1000) + (H * 50) kJ.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the enthalpy of formation of the molecule. The formula is:

ΔHf = [sum (bonds broken in reactants)] - [sum (bonds formed in products)]

But in this case, the reactants are the elements in their standard states (C as graphite, H2 gas). So the bonds broken are the C-C in graphite and H-H in H2. The bonds formed are the bonds in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the approach is:

The enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) to get the atoms, minus the energy released when the bonds in the product form.

So:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds)

Wait, no: when bonds are broken, energy is absorbed; when bonds are formed, energy is released. So the process is:

1. Break the reactant bonds (endothermic): + energy.
2. Form the product bonds (exothermic): - energy.

So the overall ΔHf is the sum of the reactant bonds broken minus the sum of the product bonds formed.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf = [ (moles of C atoms) * (enthalpy of atomization of C) + (moles of H atoms/2) * (H-H bond energy) ] - [ (number of C-C bonds) * (C-C bond energy) + (number of C=C bonds) * (C=C bond energy) + (number of C-H bonds) * (C-H bond energy) ]

But wait, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break C-C bonds in solid carbon to get C atoms. So for each mole of C atoms, you have to spend 1000 kJ.

But in a molecule, how many C atoms are there? Let's count.

Looking at the molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the carbons:

Each (CH3) group has 1 C attached to three H's. 

Breaking it down:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH:
   - The central C is double-bonded to CH, so it's connected to two CH3 groups and a CH. So that's 1 (central C) + 2 CH3 (each has 1 C) + 1 C in CH. Wait, no, the CH is part of the double bond. Wait, perhaps it's better to count each group.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so maybe it's easier to count the number of C and H atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count each part.

Wait, the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C's:

Each (CH3) is one C attached to three H.

So:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: The structure is (CH3)2-C double bond CH.

   So, the first C is the central one (with two CH3 groups attached). Then the double bond is to a CH group. So that's 1 (central C) + 2 (from the two CH3) + 1 (CH) = 4 C so far.

2. Then comes -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

   The -CH2- is another C. Then -CH(CH3)-: another C, with a CH3 group. Then another CH2.

   So CH2 (1 C) + CH(CH3) (1 C) + CH2 (1 C): 3 more C's. Now total 4+3=7.

3. Then comes -CH=C(CH3)2.

   So the CH is another C (8th), and the C= is a central C (9th), which is connected to two CH3 groups. So that adds 3 C's? Wait, no: the CH is one C, then the central C with two CH3 groups: so 1 (CH) + 1 (central C) + 2 (from CH3 groups) = 4 C's? Wait, no. Wait, the group is CH=C(CH3)2. So the structure is CH-C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me count each C:

Each CH3 has 1 C.

First part: (CH3)2C=CH: the structure is:

- Two CH3 groups attached to a central C (C1).
- The central C is double-bonded to a CH group (C2).
So, (CH3)2C=CH has 3 C's: C1 (with two CH3), C2 (double bond to C1), and the CH group's C is the same as C2? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH2? No, in this case, it's (CH3)2C=CH-... So the double bond is between C1 and C2, where C2 is connected to a CH group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of each segment and count all the C's:

The molecule is: 

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each segment:

1. (CH3)2-C= 
   - C is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to CH.
   So, 3 C's so far (C1: central, C2: from CH3, C3: another CH3).

Wait, no: the central C is 1, each CH3 is a C, so two CH3's contribute 2 C's. So that's 3 C's in the first part.

2. =CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-:
   - The CH is another C (4th).
   - CH2 (5th).
   - CH(CH3) is another C (6th).
   - CH2 (7th).

Wait, so after the first part, we have 3 C's. Then the next parts add 4 C's (CH, CH2, CH(CH3), CH2) = 4. So 7 C's so far.

3. CH2-CH=C(CH3)2:
   - CH2 (8th).
   - CH= (9th).
   - C in =C(CH3)2 is the same as the previous CH=, so that's 9th C.
   Wait, no. The structure is CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.
   So, after the CH2, we have CH connected to another C via a double bond.

So the CH2 is another C (8th), and the CH is another C (9th), which is double-bonded to the 10th C, which has two CH3 groups attached.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should count each C:

Each (CH3) is a C.

Looking at the entire structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

(CH3)2C= : 3 C's (central C and two CH3)
=CH- : 1 C
-CH2- : 1 C
-CH(CH3) : 1 C
-CH2- : 1 C
-CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C (the CH) and 1 C (the C in =C), which has two CH3's.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe another approach: each C in the structure is a separate unless it's part of a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 10 C atoms.

Wait, let me count each group:

- (CH3)2C=CH: that's 3 C's (the central C, and two CH3 groups).
- Then CH2: 1 C.
- Then CH(CH3): 1 C.
- Then CH2: 1 C.
- Then CH=C(CH3)2: which has 1 C (the CH) and 1 C (the C in =C, which has two CH3 groups. So that's 2 more C's.

Total: 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 8? Hmm, maybe I'm missing some.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Let me think: the structure is symmetric around the central double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of C and H atoms.

Wait, the formula of the molecule can be determined.

Looking at each group:

Each (CH3) group contributes 1 C and 3 H.

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me write down the entire structure as a chain:

Starts with (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each part:

Each (CH3) is 1 C and 3 H.

- (CH3)2C=CH: 

   - Two (CH3)s: 2 C, 6 H.
   - C attached to the two CH3s: 1 C.
   - =CH: 1 C, 1 H.
   So this part contributes: 3 C, 7 H.

Wait, but the =CH- is part of a double bond, so that part is CH2? Or CH?

Wait, perhaps I should think of each part's formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to draw the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the C and H:

Each (CH3) group is -CH3.

So, let's go step by step.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

1. (CH3)2-C= : This is (CH3)2C-.

   So, 2 CH3 groups (2 C, 6 H), and the central C (1 C), but the central C is also connected to a CH group via a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count all the carbons:

Let me list all the carbons:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

   So:

   - The first part: (CH3)2C= (3 C: 2 from CH3, 1 from C)
   - Then, =CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

   Let's count each C:

   1. (CH3)2C: 3 C so far.
   2. =CH: another C (4)
   3. CH2: another C (5)
   4. CH(CH3): another C (6)
   5. CH2: another C (7)
   6. CH=C: another C (8), and the C in C(CH3)2 (9). Wait, the C in C(CH3)2 is the same as the CH=C's C.

So wait, the CH=C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups attached to the C in the double bond.

So, the molecule has 9 C atoms.

Wait, but let me recount.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so maybe the total number of C atoms is 10? Because I see two (CH3)2 groups on each end.

Wait, perhaps:

Looking at the structure, the molecule has two (CH3)2 groups on either end of a central chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a diene with substituents.

Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C (two CH3, one C in the middle)
- Then CH2: 1 C
- Then CH(CH3): 1 C
- Then CH2: 1 C
- Then CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C (the CH, and the central C in the double bond which is connected to two CH3 groups)

Wait, but the CH=C(CH3)2 is another two C's? So adding all up:

3 (from first part) + 1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +2 (CH=C(CH3)2) = 8 C's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let's try to count each C as per the formula.

Each (CH3) is a C.

So:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C's (two from CH3, one from the central C)
- CH2: 1 C
- CH(CH3): 1 C
- CH2: 1 C
- CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C's (the CH and the C with two CH3's).

So 3 +1 +1 +1 +2 = 8 C's.

But wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me count each C in each part:

1. (CH3)2C= : 3 C's (the central C, two from CH3)
2. =CH- : 1 C
3. -CH2- : 1 C
4. -CH(CH3)- : 1 C
5. -CH2- : 1 C
6. -CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C (CH) plus 1 C (the central C with two CH3 groups) = 2 C's.

So 3 +1 +1+1+1+2 =9 C's.

Wait, no:

Wait, 3 (from 1) +1 (2) =4, plus 3 (3+4+5)=7, plus 2 (6)=9.

So 9 C atoms in total.

Now, how many H atoms?

Each C in the structure:

1. (CH3)2C=CH:

   - (CH3)2C: each CH3 has 3 H. So two CH3's: 6 H. The central C is connected to two CH3's and a double bond. The double bond is to a CH group.

   So in (CH3)2C=CH:

   - CH3: 3 H each ×2 =6 H.
   - The central C: not bonded to any H (since it's double-bonded to CH and attached to two CH3's). So no H on that C.
   - The CH group: 1 H.
   So total H for this part: 6 + 1 =7 H.

2. -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-:

   - CH2: 2 H each ×3? Wait, no. Each CH2 group has 2 H.

   Wait, the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

   So:

   - CH2: 2 H.
   - CH(CH3): 1 H (since it's connected to CH3, which has 3 H, but the CH has one H).
   Wait, no: the CH(CH3) group has 1 H attached to the C (since it's CH-), and three H's from the CH3.

   So:

   CH2: 2 H.
   CH(CH3): 1 H (on the C) + 3 H (from CH3).
   CH2: 2 H.

   So H's here: 2 + (1 +3) +2 = 8 H.

3. -CH=C(CH3)2:

   - CH: 1 H.
   - C double bond C: each CH3 has 3 H.

   So CH has 1 H, and each of the two CH3's has 3 H. So 1 + 3*2=7 H.

Now, summing all H:

7 (from first part) +8 (from second part) +7 (from last part) =22 H.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount the H's:

Each (CH3) group contributes 3 H.

Number of (CH3) groups in the molecule:

Looking at the entire structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So (CH3) groups are:

- Two in the first part.
- One in the CH(CH3).
- Two in the last part.

So that's 2 +1 +2 =5 (CH3) groups.

Each contributes 3 H, so 5×3=15 H.

Now, the other H's are in the CH2 and CH groups.

Looking for CH2 groups:

- There are three CH2 groups: the first is after the =CH-, the second is between CH(CH3) and CH2, the third is after the CH2 before the final CH=C.

So three CH2 groups, each contributes 2 H: 3×2=6 H.

Now, the CH groups:

- The =CH- group: 1 H.
- The CH=C group: 1 H.

So 2 H's.

So total H's: 15 (from CH3) +6 (from CH2) +2 (from CH) =23 H?

Wait, I'm getting conflicting numbers. Earlier, when I broke it down into parts, I had 22 H, but now, using this approach, I get 23. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the correct number of H atoms is 24.

Wait, perhaps this approach is better: the formula of the molecule.

Each (CH3) group is CH3.

The entire molecule can be thought of as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each group:

- The first part: (CH3)2C=CH → formula is C3H5.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH: the central C has two CH3 groups and a CH group attached via double bond.

So formula would be:

Each CH3 contributes CH3, so two contribute 2C and 6H.

The central C is connected to these two CH3 and a CH (double bond).

So the formula for (CH3)2C=CH is C3H5.

Then, the next parts are:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: formula is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Each CH2 is CH2, so two CH2's contribute 2×(CH2) = C2H4.

The CH(CH3) is CH(CH3), which is CH2HCH3 (but more accurately, the formula is C2H5).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the entire formula.

Wait, the entire molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me compute the formula step by step.

Each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: C3H5.

2. -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: This is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

   CH2 has 2 H, CH(CH3) has 4 H (since it's CH(CH3) → CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H, but wait, the CH group is CH-; so it's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

   So:

   CH2: C:1, H:2.

   CH(CH3): C:1, H:1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) =4 H.

   CH2: C:1, H:2.

   So this part is C3H8.

3. -CH=C(CH3)2: CH-C(CH3)2.

   CH has 1 H, C(CH3)2 has 6 H (each CH3 has 3 H, so 3×2=6).

   So this part is C3H7.

Wait, but wait, the structure is CH-C(CH3)2, which is CH2-C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, it's CH=C(CH3)2. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2?

Wait, perhaps the formula is C4H9?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost here. Maybe an alternative approach: the entire molecule is a diene with multiple substituents. Let me instead think of the molecular formula.

Each (CH3) group is CH3.

So, the molecule is:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each element:

C:

- Each (CH3) is 1 C. There are two in the first group, one in the CH(CH3), and two in the last group. So that's 2 +1 +2 =5 C's from the substituents.

The rest are in the main chain.

The main chain is:

C=C-C-C-C-C=C.

Wait, no, the main chain is:

The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the main chain has:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 4 C's (two CH3, one C, one CH)
- Then CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: 3 C's
- Then CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C's.

Wait, perhaps the main chain is longer. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula can be determined by considering all the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C10H16.

Wait, because the structure seems to have 10 C's. Let me think: 2 (from the first (CH3)2) +1 (central C) +1 (CH) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH) +1 (C in CH=C) +2 (from the two CH3 in the end) = 10 C's.

Similarly, H's: each CH3 contributes 3 H, and each CH2 contributes 2 H, each CH contributes 1 H.

Number of CH3 groups: 2 (first group) +1 (CH(CH3)) + 2 (last group) =5 CH3 groups → 5×3=15 H.

Number of CH2 groups: in the main chain, perhaps there are four CH2 groups. Let me see:

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH2 groups are:

- between =CH and next CH2: 1 CH2.

- between CH(CH3) and CH2: another CH2.

- between CH2 and CH=C: another CH2.

So that's three CH2 groups → 3×2=6 H.

Number of CH groups: the =CH, the CH in CH=C, and any others.

In the structure, the =CH is one CH, the CH in CH=C is another, and perhaps others.

Wait:

- The (CH3)2C=CH has a CH group →1 H.

- The CH=C(CH3)2 has a CH group →1 H.

So 2 H from CH groups.

Total H's: 15 (from CH3) +6 (from CH2) +2 (from CH) =23 H.

Wait, but the formula would be C10H23? That doesn't seem right because C10H22 is common for some alkanes, but this molecule has double bonds, so maybe fewer H's.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let me count each type of bond in the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the number of each type of bond and use the bond energies to calculate.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps I can proceed with the calculation as follows.

Assuming the molecule has:

- Carbon atoms: C
- Hydrogen atoms: H

The total enthalpy of formation would be:

ΔHf = [C × 1000 + (H/2) × 100 ] - [ (number of C-C bonds ×200) + (number of C=C bonds ×300) + (number of C-H bonds ×400) ]

Wait, no, because the bond energies given are per bond.

Wait, let me think again.

The formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

The reactants are the elements: C (solid) and H2 (gas).

Breaking the bonds in C (solid) to get C atoms: each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol.

Breaking H2 into H atoms: each H2 requires 100 kJ/mol, and each H2 gives 2 H atoms, so per H atom, 50 kJ.

The products are the molecule, where the bonds formed are C-C, C=C, and C-H.

So, the sums would be:

Reactants bonds broken:

- C-C bonds in solid carbon: each C atom comes from breaking C-C bonds. For n C atoms, number of C-C bonds broken is (n/ (Avogadro's number)) × (number of C-C bonds per mole of C). Wait, perhaps it's simpler to think of it as per mole of C atoms.

Wait, perhaps for each mole of C atoms, you need to break (1/12) mole of C-C bonds in solid carbon. Because in graphite, each C is bonded to three others. So the mole of C-C bonds broken per mole of C atoms is (1/12) × number of bonds per C.

Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for C. So that's the energy needed to break all bonds in a mole of solid carbon to make a mole of gaseous C atoms. So for each mole of C atoms, it's 1000 kJ.

Similarly, for each mole of H2, it's 100 kJ to break into 2 moles of H atoms.

So, the total energy for the reactants is:

E_reactants = (number_of_C_moles × 1000) + (number_of_H_moles × 50)

Because each H atom requires 50 kJ (since each H2 is 100 kJ for 2 H atoms).

The products are the molecule's bonds:

E_products = (number_of_C-C_bonds × 200) + (number_of_C=C_bonds ×300) + (number_of_C-H_bonds ×400)

So ΔHf = E_reactants - E_products

But wait, wait: the correct formula would be:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

But in the reactants, the bonds being broken are C-C (in solid C) and H-H (in H2). The products are the bonds formed in the molecule.

So, the bond energies of the reactants (the bonds being broken) are:

E_reactants_bonds = (number_of_C-C_bonds × 1000 [not sure, wait]) + (number_of_H-H_bonds × 100)

Wait, no. The enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break bonds in solid C to get C atoms. So for each mole of C atoms, it's 1000 kJ. Similarly, each mole of H atoms comes from breaking H-H bonds, which requires 100 kJ per mole of H2 (so per mole of H atoms, 50 kJ).

So, the energy to break the reactants into atoms is:

E_reactants = (number_of_C × 1000) + (number_of_H × 50)

The energy to form the molecule's bonds is:

E_products = (number_of_C-C_bonds × 200) + (number_of_C=C_bonds ×300) + (number_of_C-H_bonds ×400)

So, ΔHf = E_reactants - E_products

Wait, but the formula is actually:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bond energies of bonds formed in products)

So, yes, that's correct.

So, I need to find:

number_of_C, number_of_H,

number_of_C-C_bonds,

number_of_C=C_bonds,

number_of_C-H_bonds.

Wait, but without the exact structure, perhaps I can assume the molecule is symmetric. Let me count the number of each type of bond.

Looking at the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the molecule has two double bonds (C=C). Let's count the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

Number of C=C bonds: 2.

Number of C-C bonds: Let's see, each single bond between C's.

In the structure, each part:

1. (CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each part:

- (CH3)2-C: single bond between the C and each CH3.

Wait, each (CH3) is attached to the central C via a single bond. So, each (CH3) contributes a C-C bond? No, because the central C is connected via single bonds to the CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each single bond between carbons.

Let me think:

Each part of the structure:

Between the (CH3)2C and the double bond: two single bonds to the CH3 groups, and a double bond to the CH group.

Then, the CH is connected via a single bond to CH2.

So, between each C in the chain, there's a single bond except where there's a double bond.

So the number of C-C single bonds is as follows:

In the first part: (CH3)2C=CH.

   - The central C is connected to two CH3 groups (two C-C single bonds) and a double bond to CH.

So, in the first part, two C-C single bonds.

Then, the =CH-CH2-:

   - The CH is connected to CH2 via a single bond: another C-C single bond.

Then, the CH2-CH(CH3):

   - Another C-C single bond.

Then, CH(CH3)-CH2:

   - Another C-C single bond.

Then, CH2-CH=C:

   - Another C-C single bond.

And the CH=C has a double bond.

So, let me count the number of C-C single bonds:

1. Between the central C and each CH3: 2 bonds.

2. Between CH and CH2: 1.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3): 1.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2: 1.

5. Between CH2 and CH: 1.

6. Between CH and C in CH=C: 1 (but this is a double bond, so it's counted as 0 single bonds? Or perhaps it's a single bond in this context. Wait, no, the double bond is a different count.

Wait, perhaps each double bond is a single bond in this context. No, wait: the number of C-C bonds is the count of single and double bonds. So, each double bond is one C=C bond, and the single bonds are C-C bonds.

So, for each double bond, it's one, and each single bond is another.

So, in the first part, (CH3)2C=CH:

   - Two single C-C bonds (to the CH3 groups), and one double C=C bond to the CH group.

Then, the chain continues:

Each single bond between the CH and CH2: that's a single C-C bond.

Then, CH2 to CH(CH3): single C-C.

CH(CH3) to CH2: single C-C.

CH2 to CH: single C-C.

CH to C in the next double bond: single C-C.

Wait, but the next double bond is between CH and C, making a C=C. So that's another double bond.

So, number of C-C single bonds:

In the first part: 2.

Then, CH-CH2: 1.

CH2-CH(CH3): 1.

CH(CH3)-CH2:1.

CH2-CH:1.

CH-CH=C:1 (but the bond is double, so this is a C=C bond, not a single C-C).

So, adding up: 2 (from first part) + 4 (from the chain) =6 C-C single bonds.

Plus the two C=C bonds, which are two in number.

So total C-C bonds (single) =6, C=C bonds=2.

Now, how about C-H bonds?

Each CH3 group has 3 C-H bonds.

Number of CH3 groups: 2 in first part, 1 in CH(CH3), 2 in the last part. So total 5 CH3 groups →5×3=15 C-H bonds.

Each CH group has 1 C-H bond.

Number of CH groups:

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH: CH group →1.

- CH=C(CH3)2: CH group →1.

- The other CH groups: Are there any others?

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH groups are:

- =CH- :1.

- CH=C:1.

So that's 2 more C-H bonds.

Additionally, any CH2 groups contribute two C-H bonds each.

Number of CH2 groups: in the chain, how many?

Looking:

- CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, in the structure, after the =CH, there's a CH2, then another CH2, then the CH(CH3), then another CH2, and then CH.

Wait, perhaps in the chain, there are three CH2 groups.

Each CH2 group has two C-H bonds →3×2=6 C-H bonds.

So total C-H bonds:

15 (from CH3) +6 (from CH2) +2 (from CH) =23.

Wait, but earlier I thought 23 H's. Hmm, perhaps that's correct.

So, putting it all together:

Number of C atoms: Let's see, in the molecule, each CH3 is 1 C, each CH is 1 C, each C in the chain is 1 C.

Wait, perhaps the total C is 10? Let me recount:

Each (CH3) group: 2 in first part, 1 in CH(CH3), 2 in last part →5 C's.

Then, the chain:

Each C in the chain (excluding substituents) → how many?

The chain has:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

1. (CH3)2C= :3 C's (two CH3 and one central C)
2. =CH-CH2- : two C's (CH and CH2)
3. CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- : three C's (CH2, CH(CH3), CH2)
4. CH=C(CH3)2: two C's (CH and C in C(CH3)2)

Wait, that's 3 +2 +3 +2 =10 C's. Oh, so 10 C atoms in total.

So, number_of_C =10.

Number_of_H: 23.

Now, number of C-C bonds (single):6.

Number of C=C bonds:2.

Number of C-H bonds:23.

So, now, computing the enthalpy of formation:

E_reactants = (number_of_C × 1000) + (number_of_H ×50) 

= (10 ×1000) + (23 ×50)

= 10,000 + 1,150 = 11,150 kJ.

E_products = (number_of_C-C ×200) + (number_of_C=C ×300) + (number_of_C-H ×400)

= (6 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (23 ×400)

= 1,200 + 600 + 9,200 = 11,000 kJ.

So, ΔHf = E_reactants - E_products = 11,150 - 11,000 = 150 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options. The options are A) 11200, B) 67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-C, C=C, or C-H bonds.

Wait, let me recount the bonds.

Number of C-C single bonds:

Looking again at the structure, let's count each single C-C bond.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Between the central C (of (CH3)2C) and each CH3: two single bonds.

Then, the central C is double-bonded to CH → that's a C=C bond, so no single bond there.

Then, the CH is connected to CH2 via a single bond →1.

The CH2 is connected to CH(CH3) →1.

CH(CH3) is connected to CH2 →1.

CH2 is connected to CH →1.

CH is connected to C in the next double bond → but that's a double bond (C=C), so not a single bond.

So, that's 2 (from (CH3)2C) +4 (from the chain) =6 single C-C bonds.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:

Each CH3 →3 each. There are five CH3 groups →5×3=15.

Each CH2 →2 each. How many CH2 groups?

Looking:

- After =CH: one CH2 →2 H.

- Between CH(CH3) and CH2 → another CH2.

- Between CH2 and CH=C → another CH2.

So three CH2 groups →3×2=6.

Each CH →1 H. There are two CH groups (from =CH and CH=C) →2.

So C-H bonds:15 +6 +2 =23.

Wait, but another approach: each C in the structure contributes 4 bonds.

So for 10 C atoms, total bonds would be (10 ×4)/2 =20 bonds. But considering double bonds, let's see:

Number of bonds:

Each single bond is one, each double bond is one (since double bond counts as two single bonds? No, wait, bond count is per bond type.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total number of bonds and see if it matches.

Total bonds = (number_of_C-C) + (number_of_C=C) + (number_of_C-H).

Which is 6 (C-C) +2 (C=C) +23 (C-H) =31 bonds.

But each C has 4 bonds:

10 C ×4 =40 bonds.

But each bond is shared between two atoms, so total bonds would be 40/2 =20.

Hmm, 31 ≠20 → something's wrong.

Ah, I see the mistake.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in counting C-C and C-H bonds.

Let me approach it differently.

Each C in the molecule is connected to a certain number of other atoms. Let's compute the total number of bonds.

For each C:

- In (CH3)2C=CH:

   - The central C is connected to two CH3 (single bonds) and a double bond to CH. So, it has three bonds.

Wait, but each C must have four bonds. Oh wait, the central C is connected to two CH3 groups (single bonds), a double bond to CH, and perhaps another single bond?

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The first part is (CH3)2C=CH.

So the central C is connected to two CH3 groups (two single bonds), and a double bond to CH. So, that's three bonds. But a carbon must have four bonds, so perhaps the central C is also connected to another group. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)2C=CH2, but in this case, the molecule is longer.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe another approach: since the options don't include 150, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me check the numbers again.

E_reactants = (10 ×1000) + (23 ×50) =10,000 + 1,150 =11,150 kJ.

E_products = (6 ×200) + (2 ×300) + (23 ×400) =1,200 +600 +9,200=11,000.

ΔHf=11,150-11,000=150.

None of the options match. So I must have made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Alternative approach: perhaps I counted the number of C-C bonds incorrectly.

Let me recount the number of C-C single bonds.

The molecule has the following single C-C bonds:

1. Each (CH3)2C has two single bonds to CH3.

2. The CH is connected to CH2 (1 bond).

3. CH2-CH(CH3) (1 bond).

4. CH(CH3)-CH2 (1 bond).

5. CH2-CH (1 bond).

6. The CH is connected to the C in the next double bond via a single bond? No, the next bond is a double bond, so that's a C=C, not a single C-C.

So, 2 +4 =6 single C-C bonds.

So that's correct.

Number of C=C bonds:2.

Number of C-H bonds:23.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is more complex, with more double bonds. Or perhaps the C-C bonds are more than I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the H count.

Wait, another approach: molecular formula.

If the molecule has 10 C's and 23 H's, then the formula is C10H23.

But that's not a common formula for an alkene. Normally, the general formula for an alkene is CnH2n.

Here, n=10 → H=20. But this molecule has 23 H's, which suggests perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative or something else, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps my H count is wrong.

Let me recount the H's.

Each CH3 contributes 3 H.

Number of CH3 groups:5 →5×3=15.

Each CH2 contributes 2 H. Number of CH2 groups:3 →3×2=6.

Each CH contributes 1 H. Number of CH groups:2 →2×1=2.

Total H:15+6+2=23.

So formula is C10H23.

Wait, but that's not a typical alkene. Maybe the actual structure has more substituents or different bonding.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has more double bonds. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the structure as given has two double bonds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C's.

Wait, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each C:

1. (CH3)2C: 3 C's (two CH3 and one central C).

2. =CH: 1 C.

3. CH2:1 C.

4. CH(CH3):1 C.

5. CH2:1 C.

6. CH:1 C.

7. C in =C:1 C.

8. CH3 groups attached to the last C: 2 C's (but each CH3 is a substituent on the central C, so they are part of the same C count.

Wait, perhaps I'm double-counting. Let me list each C:

1. (CH3)2C: C1.

2. The CH3 groups on C1: C2 and C3.

3. =CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

   C4 (from =CH), C5 (CH2), C6 (CH(CH3)), C7 (CH2), C8 (CH), C9 (C in =C), and the two CH3 groups on C9: which are part of C9.

So total C's: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9 →9 C's. Wait, but earlier I thought it's 10. Hmm, perhaps I was mistaken.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C's.

- CH2:1 C.

- CH(CH3):1 C.

- CH2:1 C.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 2 C's (CH and C(CH3)2).

So total C's:3 +1 +1 +1 +2=8.

Wait, but that can't be right because the molecule's formula would be C8H15, which doesn't match the earlier count.

I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps it's better to proceed with the calculation as I did earlier, even if the answer doesn't match.

But since none of the options match 150, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D) 1900 kJ/g

Wait, my calculation gave 150 kJ/mol, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ per mole of C atoms. So for 10 C atoms, it's 10 ×1000 =10,000 kJ.

But perhaps I should not multiply by 10, but by 1 mole of C atoms.

Wait, but the molecule has 10 C atoms, so 10 moles of C atoms per mole of molecule.

So E_reactants for C is 10 ×1000 =10,000 kJ.

Similarly, for H: 23 H atoms per molecule →23/2 moles of H2 →23/2 ×100 kJ =1,150 kJ.

So E_reactants=11,150 kJ.

E_products: for each bond broken in reactants and formed in products.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating E_products.

Wait, the bonds formed in the products are:

Each C-C bond:200 kJ.

Each C=C bond:300 kJ.

Each C-H bond:400 kJ.

So E_products= (number_of_C-C ×200) + (number_of_C=C ×300) + (number_of_C-H ×400)

We have:

number_of_C-C=6 →6×200=1,200.

number_of_C=C=2 →2×300=600.

number_of_C-H=23 →23×400=9,200.

Total E_products=1,200+600+9,200=11,000.

So ΔHf=11,150-11,000=150 kJ/mol.

But the options don't include 150. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of atomization per mole of the molecule, not per mole of C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-H bonds.

Wait, perhaps each CH3 has three C-H bonds, but perhaps each CH2 has two, and each CH has one.

Let me recount the H's differently.

The molecule is C10H16? Or C10H20?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the molecular formula.

The molecular formula can be determined by the structure.

Each (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is a -CH3 group.

So, let's count the number of each type of group.

CH3:

- Two in first part.

- One in CH(CH3).

- Two in last part.

Total:5 CH3 →5×3=15 H.

CH2:

- One between =CH and CH2.

- One between CH(CH3) and CH2.

- One between CH2 and CH=C.

Total:3 CH2 →3×2=6 H.

CH groups:

- =CH.

- CH=C.

Each contributes 1 H →2 H.

So total H:15+6+2=23 H.

So formula is C10H23.

But that's not matching any normal alkene. So, perhaps the structure has more double bonds, which I'm not seeing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counting.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation is different.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ per mole of C atoms, which is 10 C atoms →10,000 kJ.

Hydrogen:23 H atoms →(23/2) ×100 kJ →1,150 kJ.

So E_reactants=11,150 kJ.

E_products:

Each C-C bond:200 → number of C-C bonds: Let's recount.

In the structure, each single bond between C's is a C-C bond.

Looking at the entire molecule:

The chain is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the C-C bonds are:

1. (CH3)2C connects to CH via double bond. So no single bond here.

2. CH connects to CH2 →1 C-C.

3. CH2 connects to CH(CH3) →1.

4. CH(CH3) connects to CH2 →1.

5. CH2 connects to CH →1.

6. CH connects to C in the next double bond → that's a C-C? No, it's a C=C bond.

So, single C-C bonds:5.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:23.

So E_products=5×200 +2×300 +23×400=1,000 +600 +9,200=10,800.

Then ΔHf=11,150 –10,800=350 kJ/mol.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of C-C bonds is 7.

Wait, perhaps the correct count is:

Each single bond in the chain is a C-C.

In the chain, from the =CH onward:

=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C.

So between each C, there's a single bond.

So, from =CH to CH2:1.

CH2 to CH(CH3):1.

CH(CH3) to CH2:1.

CH2 to CH:1.

CH to C:1 (but that's part of a double bond, so no single bond).

So that's four single bonds.

In the first part, (CH3)2C=CH: two single bonds to CH3.

So 2 +4 =6 single C-C bonds.

Thus, the previous calculation holds.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since none of the options match, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol, but I'm not sure how that arises.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-H bonds.

Wait, perhaps each CH3 has three C-H bonds, but the molecule has only 16 H's, so 16 H.

Wait, that would change the calculation.

If number_of_H=16 → E_reactants H contribution:16 ×50=800.

E_reactants=10,000 +800=10,800.

E_products: same as before, 10,800.

ΔHf=0. Which is also not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of H's is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct H count is 14.

If H=14 → E_reactants H=14 ×50=700.

E_reactants=10,700.

E_products=10,800.

ΔHf= -100 → which is exothermic, but not matching options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has more C=C bonds, but I think I counted them correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is given per mole of C atoms, and I'm correct, but perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ/g.

Wait, looking at the options, option C and D are per gram, so perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, the question says "calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound."

So, the answer I got was 150 kJ/mol. But the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the number of C-C bonds as 7.

Wait, perhaps I missed some C-C bonds.

Let me recount the C-C bonds:

Each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: two single bonds to CH3.

2. CH connected to CH2 →1.

3. CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

4. CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

5. CH2 connected to CH →1.

6. CH connected to C in the next double bond → that's a single bond, but it's part of a double bond, so it's not a C-C single bond. So, no.

So, 2 (from the first part) +4 (from the chain) =6 single C-C bonds.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds are counted as two single bonds each, so the C-C single bonds plus the double bonds would contribute more.

Wait, but no: C=C bonds are a separate category. Each C=C is a single bond (double bond, but counted as one in the bond count).

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

But I'm not sure how to reach that number.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute based on the molecular formula.

Wait, if the formula is C10H16, which is a common formula for alkenes.

Then, number_of_C=10.

number_of_H=16.

Number of C-C bonds: Let's see, formula C10H16.

The degree of unsaturation can be calculated.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 – H – X + N)/2.

Here, X and N are 0.

DoU = (2×10 +2 –16 )/2 →(22-16)/2=6/2=3.

So, three degrees of unsaturation. Which could be two double bonds and one ring, or three double bonds, etc.

But in our structure, there are two double bonds, so perhaps one ring exists.

But I'm not sure.

In any case, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the calculation.

But I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on my earlier calculation is 150 kJ/mol, but it's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the H count.

Wait, perhaps the H count is 16 instead of 23.

If H=16:

E_reactants=10,000 + (16 ×50)=10,000 +800=10,800.

E_products=6×200 +2×300 +16×400=1,200+600+6,400=8,200.

ΔHf=10,800 –8,200=2,600 kJ/mol.

Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the enthalpy of atomization is per mole of C, not per atom.

Wait, no, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol of C.

So for each mole of C atoms in the molecule, it's 1000 kJ.

So, if the molecule has 10 C atoms, that's 10 moles of C atoms →10,000 kJ.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have multiplied the C-C bonds by 1000? No, because the bond energy for C-C is 200 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem gives bond energies as per mole, not per bond.

In that case, the calculation is different.

Wait, the bond energies given are per mole:

Bond energy of C-C=200 kJ/mol.

So, each mole of C-C bonds contributes 200 kJ.

So, the number of C-C bonds is 6, so 6 ×200=1,200 kJ.

Similarly, for C=C: 2 ×300=600.

C-H:23 ×400=9,200.

E_products=1,200 +600 +9,200=11,000.

E_reactants=10 ×1000 +23 ×50=11,150.

ΔHf=11,150 –11,000=150 kJ/mol.

So, the answer isn't among the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question provided the bond energies in kJ per bond, not per mole.

In that case, the approach would be different.

Wait, but the question says "Bond energy of H-H=100 kJ/mol."

Oh, so the bond energies are given per mole.

So previous calculation holds.

Hmm.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is C5H8, but that doesn't match the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the average bond energies.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I can't figure out why.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. But I'm not confident.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following steps were considered:

1. **Determine the molecular formula**:  
   The molecule contains 10 carbon atoms and 23 hydrogen atoms, giving the formula **C₁₀H₂₃**.

2. **Calculate the total energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (elements)**:  
   - Carbon atoms: Each mole of carbon atoms requires **1000 kJ/mol** (enthalpy of atomization). For 10 moles of carbon atoms, the energy is:  
     \[
     10 \times 1000 = 10,000 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Hydrogen atoms: Each mole of hydrogen atoms requires **50 kJ/mol** (since breaking an H-H bond costs 100 kJ/mol, and each H₂ molecule produces 2 H atoms). For 23 moles of hydrogen atoms, the energy is:  
     \[
     23 \times 50 = 1,150 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Total energy for reactants:  
     \[
     10,000 + 1,150 = 11,150 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

3. **Calculate the total energy released when forming the bonds in the product**:  
   - **C-C bonds**: There are 6 single C-C bonds, each with a bond energy of **200 kJ/mol**:  
     \[
     6 \times 200 = 1,200 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - **C=C bonds**: There are 2 double C=C bonds, each with a bond energy of **300 kJ/mol**:  
     \[
     2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - **C-H bonds**: There are 23 C-H bonds, each with a bond energy of **400 kJ/mol**:  
     \[
     23 \times 400 = 9,200 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Total energy for products:  
     \[
     1,200 + 600 + 9,200 = 11,000 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

4. **Calculate the enthalpy of formation**:  
   The enthalpy of formation is the difference between the energy required to break the reactants and the energy released when forming the products:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f = 11,150 - 11,000 = 150 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
   \]

5. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated value of **150 kJ/mol** does not match any of the provided options. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the bond counting or a misinterpretation of the molecular structure. However, based on the given options, the closest plausible answer is **B) 67.4 kJ/mol**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.

ANSWER: B
