Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure how that plays into the problem yet. Maybe it's just extra info.

The key data given are the elemental abundances using the EW method under LTE. The values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Wait, let me write that down to keep track.

Star 1:
- [Si/Fe] = 0.3
- [Fe/H] = 0

Star 2:
- [Mg/Si] = 0.3
- [Mg/H] = 0

Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given. For Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. And for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. So, I can find the solar abundances of Fe and Mg in terms of their number densities relative to H.

I think the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So, Si_1 / Si_2.

Let me recall what these abundance notations mean. The [X/Y] notation is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun, right? Or wait, no, actually, [X/Y] is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic difference relative to the Sun.

Wait, no, correction: I think [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio, relative to the solar ratio.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of the number density of element X to Y, subtracted by the same ratio in the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Which can also be written as log(n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun) ) = log( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) )

Alternatively, [X/Y] = log( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) ) = log( (n_X * n_Y_sun) / (n_Y * n_X_sun) )

But maybe it's easier to handle each element relative to H, using the given solar values, and then find the ratios for each star.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So 0 = log(n_Fe1/n_H1) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun). Which implies that log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun), meaning n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

So, the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun). Wait, but I don't know n_H for each star. Hmm, but maybe since we're dealing with ratios, the H cancels out in the end.

Wait, but perhaps the assumption is that the total number of H is the same in each star's photosphere? Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps for each star, the [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X,n_H)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun).

Which implies that n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. So, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

But without knowing n_H1, maybe I can express everything in terms of solar units.

Let me denote the solar values as follows:

n_Fe_sun = 10^{ (7.5 - 12) } * n_H_sun.

Wait, wait, the given for the Sun is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5.

So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. So nMg/nH=10^-5.

So, for the Sun:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5)

nMg_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-5)

So, nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

nMg_sun = 10^(-5) * nH_sun.

Now, Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe1 / nH1) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) =0 → nFe1 / nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But without knowing nH1, perhaps I can express it in terms of nH_sun, but I'm not sure yet.

But I also have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) =0.3.

So, log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) + 0.3.

But I know nFe_sun and nSi_sun from the Sun's data. Wait, but wait, do I have the solar nSi? No, the problem gives only Fe and Mg in the Sun. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I can find the solar [Si/Fe] from the given data?

Wait, but the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 7-12? Wait, no. Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5.

And 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5.

But what about silicon? I don't have the Sun's [Si/H] given. Hmm. So perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Maybe I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Si/H] and [Fe/H].

Wait, [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H]. Since [Fe/H] is 0 in Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]1 =0.3 → [Si/H]1 =0.3.

So, log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) )=0.3.

But I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I can compute it using other solar abundances.

Wait, maybe I can use the information about Mg and Fe in the Sun. Let me think: Mg is another element, and perhaps there's a relation involving Mg and Si.

Wait, in Star 2, [Mg/Si]2=0.3, and [Mg/H]=0.

So for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0, which implies that nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

And [Mg/Si]2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )=0.3.

So, log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) +0.3.

Hmm, but without knowing nSi_sun, perhaps I can find it from the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )= log( (nMg/nSi) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )= log( (nMg * nSi_sun) / (nSi *nMg_sun) ) )=0, because [Mg/Si]_sun would be zero if the Sun is the reference.

Wait, no, [Mg/Si]_sun =0, because it's the logarithm of 1.

So, in the Sun, log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )= log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

Wait, but without knowing nSi_sun, perhaps I can relate it through other information.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun as the ratio from the given data.

Because in the Sun, nMg_sun /nH_sun =10^(-5).

But I don't have nSi_sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume that in the Sun, the [Mg/Si] ratio is known, but I don't have that value.

Alternatively, perhaps in the Sun, the ratio is [Mg/Si]_sun = log( (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) ) - log( (nMg_sun/nH_sun) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) )) = log( (nMg/nH) / (nMg_sun/nH_sun) ) - log( (nSi/nH) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) )) → no, that might not be helpful.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's take it step by step.

The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2, so Si_1 / Si_2.

To find that, I need to find nSi1 and nSi2, then take their ratio.

How?

For Star_1:

We have:

[Fe/H]1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]1=0.3 → log( nSi1/nFe1 ) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) + 0.3.

Wait, let's think in terms of ratios.

We can write [Si/Fe] = log( (nSi/nFe) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So, (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = 2 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi1 in terms of nFe1, and then relate nFe1 to nH1.

From [Fe/H]1=0, nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

So, nFe1 = (10^(-4.5) ) * (nH1 / nH_sun ), because nFe_sun =10^(-4.5) *nH_sun.

So, nFe1 = (10^(-4.5)) * (nH1 / nH_sun) * nH_sun ) =10^(-4.5) *nH1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

nFe_sun =10^(-4.5) *nH_sun.

So, nFe1= (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1 = (10^(-4.5) nH_sun / nH_sun ) *nH1 =10^(-4.5) *nH1.

So, nFe1 =1e-4.5 *nH1.

So, nFe1 = (nH1 *1e-4.5).

And from [Si/Fe]1 =0.3.

nSi1 / nFe1 = 2 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

Wait, but nSi_sun /nFe_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) / (nFe_sun/nH_sun ) ) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) / (1e-4.5) )

But I don't have nSi_sun/nH_sun. So, perhaps I can express nSi1 in terms of nH1.

Alternatively, maybe I can express [Si/H]1 as 0.3.

Because [Si/Fe]1 = [Si/H]1 - [Fe/H]1.

Since [Fe/H]1 is 0, [Si/Fe]1 = [Si/H]1 =0.3.

So, [Si/H]1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun )=0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

So, nSi1= nH1 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun)*10^0.3.

But again, without knowing nSi_sun, I can't compute this directly.

Wait, maybe I can relate nSi_sun to the solar data.

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has:

nFe_sun =1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

But what about nSi_sun? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0, which is correct as [Mg/Si]_sun is zero by definition. But that doesn't help directly.

Wait, perhaps the solar [Mg/Si] is given indirectly. Wait, for the Sun, [Mg/H] is given as log(nMg/nH)= -5.

But wait, [Mg/Si] in the Sun is log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )= log( (nMg/nSi) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ).

Which is [Mg/Si]_sun = log( (nMg *nSi_sun) / (nSi *nMg_sun) ) )

But in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is zero because the Sun is the reference. So (nMg/nSi)_sun = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can express [Mg/Si] for the Sun as log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0 → nMg/nSi =nMg_sun/nSi_sun.

But then, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]2=0.3 → log( (nMg2/nSi2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Hmm.

But again, without knowing nSi_sun, I might not get anywhere. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi1)/(nSi2) = ?

Let me see what I can find for nSi1 and nSi2.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]1=0 → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

And [Si/Fe]1 =0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^{0.3} * (nFe_sun/nSi_sun).

Wait, no, because [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3 → (nSi/nFe) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) *10^0.3.

So, nSi1 =nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

But nFe1 is (nFe_sun/nH_sun ) *nH1.

So, substituting:

nSi1 = [ (nFe_sun/nH_sun ) *nH1 ] * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Simplify: the nFe_sun cancels out.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) *nH1 *10^0.3.

Which can be written as nSi1 = nH1 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

But nSi_sun/nH_sun is the solar [Si/H], which I don't have. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write nSi1 in terms of nH1 and the solar ratios.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi1 in terms of nH1. Let me think about that.

Another approach: Let's consider each star's composition relative to the Sun.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]1=0 → [Fe/H]1= log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) )=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So, nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

Substituting:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH1 ) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

The nFe_sun terms cancel:

nSi1 = (nH1 * nSi_sun )/(nH_sun) ) *10^0.3.

Which is nSi1 = (nH1 /nH_sun ) * nSi_sun *10^0.3.

Hmm, but I don't know nH1 or nSi_sun.

Wait, but perhaps I can express the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 without knowing the absolute values.

Let me now think about Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

And [Mg/Si]2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3 → nMg2/nSi2= (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So, nSi2 =nMg2 / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ].

But nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2.

So, substituting:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2 ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ].

Simplify:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun *nH2 )/(nH_sun) ) ] / [ (nMg_sun *10^0.3 )/(nSi_sun) ) ].

The nMg_sun terms cancel:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun ) / (10^0.3 )

So, nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun ) * nSi_sun *10^(-0.3).

Now, the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 would be:

(nSi1)/(nSi2) = [ (nH1 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3) ) ]

Simplify: nH_sun terms cancel, nSi_sun cancels.

= [ nH1 *10^0.3 ] / [nH2 *10^(-0.3) ]

= (nH1/nH2) * 10^(0.3 +0.3 ) 

= (nH1/nH2) *10^0.6.

Hmm, but what is nH1/nH2? I don't know the H densities of the stars. But perhaps the stars have the same H? Or perhaps there's another way to find the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the stars are main-sequence stars, and their H content is related to their masses. But that's probably beyond the scope here, and I don't think the question gives any info about the stars' evolutionary state or surface gravity.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1, but that's an assumption. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says "photospheric composition", so perhaps each star's H is the same as the Sun's? No, that can't be right because their [Fe/H] are different.

Wait, no, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, but [Fe/H]_2 is not given. Wait, no, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means Fe abundance is same as solar for Star_1, but [Fe/H]_2 is not given.

Wait, but in the problem, for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0. So for Star_2, nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But I don't know anything about [Fe/H]_2, but perhaps it's not needed.

Wait, perhaps I can express nH1 and nH2 in terms of some other parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH1/nH2 is not needed because it cancels out somehow. Let me see.

Wait, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1/nH2) *10^0.6.

But without knowing (nH1/nH2), I can't proceed. Hmm. So maybe I'm missing a trick here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only about the ratios of the elements relative to each other, and the H cancels out because it's the same in both stars. But that's only if nH1 =nH2, which I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require knowing the absolute number of H atoms, so perhaps I can set nH1 =nH2 = same value, but that's an assumption. Or perhaps the ratio is not needed because the H cancels in the final ratio of Si.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the fact that the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, and Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, but Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given. Maybe that's a dead end.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the ratios as given, and express each nSi in terms of the Sun's nH.

Wait, for Star_1:

nSi1 = (nH1 /nH_sun ) * nSi_sun *10^0.3.

For Star_2:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3).

So, the ratio is (nH1/nH2) *10^(0.6).

But again, without knowing nH1/nH2, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the H density is the same in both stars, nH1 =nH2. That would make the ratio (nSi1/nSi2) =10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, so approximately 4. But looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But why would the H density be the same in both stars? That seems like an assumption, but maybe that's what's intended.

Wait, but I thought that the H density would vary with the star's properties, like gravity and mass. But perhaps for this problem, it's assumed that the H is the same, which would make the ratio just 10^0.6.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star, but that's not what's being asked. The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms between the two stars.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in not considering that [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] =0.3, and [Fe/H]=0.

So, [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H] =0.3 +0=0.3.

So, log(nSi1/nH1) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) +0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0, and [Mg/Si]=0.3.

So, [Mg/Si]=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

But again, without knowing nSi_sun, perhaps I can relate the two.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio nSi1/nSi2 by considering their [Si/H] and [Mg/Si].

Alternatively, perhaps we can express both nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of the Sun's [Si/H] and then find their ratio.

But I'm stuck because I don't have the Sun's [Si/H].

Wait, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Si/H] using the given data.

Wait, but I don't have any data on Si in the Sun. Hmm. So perhaps I'm supposed to find the ratio without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the [Mg/Si] for Star_2 is 0.3, and [Mg/H] is 0. So, from those, perhaps we can find [Si/H] for Star_2.

Because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] → 0.3 =0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, for Star_2, [Si/H] = -0.3 → log(nSi2/nH2) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -0.3.

But I still don't know nSi_sun.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the solar [Mg/Si] ratio.

In the Sun, [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0 → nMg/nSi =nMg_sun/nSi_sun.

Which implies that (nMg/nMg_sun )= (nSi/nSi_sun ).

So, for Star_2, [Mg/Si] =0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

But Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2.

So, substituting into the [Mg/Si] equation:

nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2 / nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

Rearranging:

nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2 ) * (nSi_sun/nMg_sun ) ) /10^0.3.

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun/(10^0.3 ).

So, nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun ) *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3).

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 and [Fe/H]=0.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi1/nH1 =nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^0.3 → nSi1= nH1 *nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^0.3.

Now, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

(nH1 *nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^0.3) / (nH2/nH_sun *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3) )).

Simplify:

= (nH1 /nH2 ) *10^(0.3 +0.3 )

= (nH1 /nH2 ) *10^0.6.

Again, I'm stuck on (nH1/nH2). Without knowing the ratio of H in each star, I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the H number density is the same in both stars, meaning nH1 =nH2. Then, the ratio would be 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But why would nH1 =nH2? Unless the stars are identical in some way, but they have different masses and different [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. So that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows us to ignore the H ratio because it cancels out when considering the ratio of silicon in the photospheres, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the H ratio as 1, so the answer is approximately 4, which would be option A.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio nSi1/nSi2 in terms of the given [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] data.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 *10^0.3 * (nFe_sun /nSi_sun ).

Wait, no, the ratio [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun )=0.3 → (nSi/nFe) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3 → nSi =nFe * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg/nSi)= (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 → nSi= nMg/( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 ).

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg= nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH.

So, for Star_2, nSi2= [nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 ].

Simplify:

= [nMg_sun *nH /nH_sun ] / (nMg_sun *10^0.3 /nSi_sun )

= (nH *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

Now, for Star_1:

nFe1= [nFe_sun /nH_sun ] *nH.

And nSi1= nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

= [nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH ] * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

= nH * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

So, nSi1= nH * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

nSi2= nH * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3 ).

So, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = [10^0.3 ] / [10^(-0.3 ) ] =10^(0.6) ≈3.98.

Ah! So the H terms cancel out because both stars have the same nH? Wait, but wait, the nH in Star_1 and Star_2 could be different. How did that happen?

Wait, because in the expression for nSi1 and nSi2, I have nH in Star_1 and nH in Star_2. But in the ratio, it's (nH1 * ...) / (nH2 * ...). So, unless nH1 =nH2, the H terms wouldn't cancel. So why are they the same?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming nH is the same in both stars. Because in the way I derived nSi1 and nSi2, I used nH1 and nH2, which might not be the same.

Wait, but let me look again. Oh wait, in the expression for nSi1, I used nH1, and for nSi2, I used nH2. So the ratio would be [nH1 * ... ] / [nH2 * ... ].

Unless the stars have the same nH, which isn't given.

But wait, in the problem statement, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. So it's nSi1 /nSi2, regardless of their H content.

Hmm. So, perhaps I missed something earlier. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of the given solar values and the star's abundances, assuming that the ratio of H is the same as the Sun's. But that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H ratio cancels out, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, earlier, I derived that nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1/nH2 ) *10^0.6.

But without knowing (nH1/nH2), I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem requires an assumption that (nH1/nH2 )=1, making the ratio 10^0.6 ≈3.98 → option A.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the relation of the stars' [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] to find nH.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, nFe1= nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH1.

But for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2= nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2.

But without any other data, perhaps I can't find the ratio of H.

Wait, perhaps considering that both stars have the same number of H atoms, but that's an assumption.

Wait, let me try that. Suppose that nH1 =nH2 =nH.

Then, the ratio would be 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not sure if this is valid. The problem doesn't state that the stars have the same H density.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to find the ratio without considering H.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of the ratios of Fe and Mg.

Wait, for Star_1:

nFe1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH1.

nSi1= (nFe1) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

= (nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH1 ) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

= nH1 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2.

nSi2= (nMg2 ) / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 ) ].

= (nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2 ) * (nSi_sun/nMg_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

= nH2 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

So, nSi1 =nH1 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

nSi2 =nH2 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

So, the ratio is:

nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1/nH2 ) * (10^0.3 / 10^(-0.3 )) )

= (nH1/nH2 ) *10^(0.6).

Without knowing (nH1/nH2), I can't find this ratio. So perhaps the problem is missing some information, or perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the H densities are the same.

If I make that assumption, then nH1/nH2 =1 → ratio=10^0.6 ≈3.98 → option A.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of H in the stars can be found using the fact that the stars' surface gravities are different, but I don't think that's intended here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star, but the question is about the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, maybe the ratio is 10^0.6, which is about 3.98, which is option A.

I think that's the intended answer, so I'll go with option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe] = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H] = 0 dex

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si] = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H] = 0 dex

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \)
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \)

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Fe/H] = 0 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}}) \), so \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
- [Si/Fe] = 0.3 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si, sun}}/n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) + 0.3 \), so \( n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}} = (n_{\text{Si, sun}}/n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{H,1}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/H] = 0 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}}) \), so \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
- [Mg/Si] = 0.3 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}}) + 0.3 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}} = (n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{H,2}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{0.3}}{n_{\text{H,2}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{-0.3}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Assumption:
If we assume that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars (\( n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{H,2}} \)), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure how that plays into the problem yet. Maybe it's just extra info.

The key data given are the elemental abundances using the EW method under LTE. The values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Wait, let me write that down to keep track.

Star 1:
- [Si/Fe] = 0.3
- [Fe/H] = 0

Star 2:
- [Mg/Si] = 0.3
- [Mg/H] = 0

Oh, and the Sun's photospheric composition is given. For Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. And for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. So, I can find the solar abundances of Fe and Mg in terms of their number densities relative to H.

I think the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So, Si_1 / Si_2.

Let me recall what these abundance notations mean. The [X/Y] notation is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun, right? Or wait, no, actually, [X/Y] is log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic difference relative to the Sun.

Wait, no, correction: I think [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio, relative to the solar ratio.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of the number density of element X to Y, subtracted by the same ratio in the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Which can also be written as log(n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun) ) = log( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) )

Alternatively, [X/Y] = log( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) ) = log( (n_X * n_Y_sun) / (n_Y * n_X_sun) )

But maybe it's easier to handle each element relative to H, using the given solar values, and then find the ratios for each star.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So 0 = log(n_Fe1/n_H1) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun). Which implies that log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun), meaning n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

So, the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So n_Fe1 = n_Fe_sun * (n_H1 / n_H_sun). Wait, but I don't know n_H for each star. Hmm, but maybe since we're dealing with ratios, the H cancels out in the end.

Wait, but perhaps the assumption is that the total number of H is the same in each star's photosphere? Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps for each star, the [X/H] is log(n_X/n_H) - log(n_X,n_H)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun).

Which implies that n_Fe1 / n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun. So, n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1.

But without knowing n_H1, maybe I can express everything in terms of solar units.

Let me denote the solar values as follows:

n_Fe_sun = 10^{ (7.5 - 12) } * n_H_sun.

Wait, wait, the given for the Sun is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5.

So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. So nMg/nH=10^-5.

So, for the Sun:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5)

nMg_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-5)

So, nFe_sun = 10^(-4.5) * nH_sun.

nMg_sun = 10^(-5) * nH_sun.

Now, Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe1 / nH1) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) =0 → nFe1 / nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

So, nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But without knowing nH1, perhaps I can express it in terms of nH_sun, but I'm not sure yet.

But I also have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) =0.3.

So, log(nSi1/nFe1) = log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) + 0.3.

But I know nFe_sun and nSi_sun from the Sun's data. Wait, but wait, do I have the solar nSi? No, the problem gives only Fe and Mg in the Sun. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I can find the solar [Si/Fe] from the given data?

Wait, but the Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 7-12? Wait, no. Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5.

And 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5.

But what about silicon? I don't have the Sun's [Si/H] given. Hmm. So perhaps I need to make an assumption here. Maybe I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Si/H] and [Fe/H].

Wait, [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H]. Since [Fe/H] is 0 in Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]1 =0.3 → [Si/H]1 =0.3.

So, log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) )=0.3.

But I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I can compute it using other solar abundances.

Wait, maybe I can use the information about Mg and Fe in the Sun. Let me think: Mg is another element, and perhaps there's a relation involving Mg and Si.

Wait, in Star 2, [Mg/Si]2=0.3, and [Mg/H]=0.

So for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0, which implies that nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

And [Mg/Si]2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )=0.3.

So, log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) +0.3.

Hmm, but without knowing nSi_sun, perhaps I can find it from the Sun's [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )= log( (nMg/nSi) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )= log( (nMg * nSi_sun) / (nSi *nMg_sun) ) )=0, because [Mg/Si]_sun would be zero if the Sun is the reference.

Wait, no, [Mg/Si]_sun =0, because it's the logarithm of 1.

So, in the Sun, log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) = log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) )= log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

Wait, but without knowing nSi_sun, perhaps I can relate it through other information.

Wait, perhaps I can find [Mg/Si]_sun as the ratio from the given data.

Because in the Sun, nMg_sun /nH_sun =10^(-5).

But I don't have nSi_sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume that in the Sun, the [Mg/Si] ratio is known, but I don't have that value.

Alternatively, perhaps in the Sun, the ratio is [Mg/Si]_sun = log( (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) ) - log( (nMg_sun/nH_sun) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) )) = log( (nMg/nH) / (nMg_sun/nH_sun) ) - log( (nSi/nH) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) )) → no, that might not be helpful.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's take it step by step.

The problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2, so Si_1 / Si_2.

To find that, I need to find nSi1 and nSi2, then take their ratio.

How?

For Star_1:

We have:

[Fe/H]1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

[Si/Fe]1=0.3 → log( nSi1/nFe1 ) = log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) + 0.3.

Wait, let's think in terms of ratios.

We can write [Si/Fe] = log( (nSi/nFe) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So, (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = 2 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But I don't know nSi_sun. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi1 in terms of nFe1, and then relate nFe1 to nH1.

From [Fe/H]1=0, nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

So, nFe1 = (10^(-4.5) ) * (nH1 / nH_sun ), because nFe_sun =10^(-4.5) *nH_sun.

So, nFe1 = (10^(-4.5)) * (nH1 / nH_sun) * nH_sun ) =10^(-4.5) *nH1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

nFe_sun =10^(-4.5) *nH_sun.

So, nFe1= (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH1 = (10^(-4.5) nH_sun / nH_sun ) *nH1 =10^(-4.5) *nH1.

So, nFe1 =1e-4.5 *nH1.

So, nFe1 = (nH1 *1e-4.5).

And from [Si/Fe]1 =0.3.

nSi1 / nFe1 = 2 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

Wait, but nSi_sun /nFe_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) / (nFe_sun/nH_sun ) ) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) / (1e-4.5) )

But I don't have nSi_sun/nH_sun. So, perhaps I can express nSi1 in terms of nH1.

Alternatively, maybe I can express [Si/H]1 as 0.3.

Because [Si/Fe]1 = [Si/H]1 - [Fe/H]1.

Since [Fe/H]1 is 0, [Si/Fe]1 = [Si/H]1 =0.3.

So, [Si/H]1 =0.3 → log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun )=0.3 → nSi1/nH1 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

So, nSi1= nH1 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun)*10^0.3.

But again, without knowing nSi_sun, I can't compute this directly.

Wait, maybe I can relate nSi_sun to the solar data.

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has:

nFe_sun =1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

But what about nSi_sun? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is [Mg/Si]_sun = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0, which is correct as [Mg/Si]_sun is zero by definition. But that doesn't help directly.

Wait, perhaps the solar [Mg/Si] is given indirectly. Wait, for the Sun, [Mg/H] is given as log(nMg/nH)= -5.

But wait, [Mg/Si] in the Sun is log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )= log( (nMg/nSi) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ).

Which is [Mg/Si]_sun = log( (nMg *nSi_sun) / (nSi *nMg_sun) ) )

But in the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is zero because the Sun is the reference. So (nMg/nSi)_sun = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ).

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can express [Mg/Si] for the Sun as log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0 → nMg/nSi =nMg_sun/nSi_sun.

But then, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]2=0.3 → log( (nMg2/nSi2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3 → (nMg2/nSi2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Hmm.

But again, without knowing nSi_sun, I might not get anywhere. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, the problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, (nSi1)/(nSi2) = ?

Let me see what I can find for nSi1 and nSi2.

For Star_1:

We have [Fe/H]1=0 → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

And [Si/Fe]1 =0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 * 10^{0.3} * (nFe_sun/nSi_sun).

Wait, no, because [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3 → (nSi/nFe) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) *10^0.3.

So, nSi1 =nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

But nFe1 is (nFe_sun/nH_sun ) *nH1.

So, substituting:

nSi1 = [ (nFe_sun/nH_sun ) *nH1 ] * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Simplify: the nFe_sun cancels out.

nSi1 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) *nH1 *10^0.3.

Which can be written as nSi1 = nH1 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

But nSi_sun/nH_sun is the solar [Si/H], which I don't have. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write nSi1 in terms of nH1 and the solar ratios.

Wait, perhaps I can express nSi1 in terms of nH1. Let me think about that.

Another approach: Let's consider each star's composition relative to the Sun.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]1=0 → [Fe/H]1= log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) )=0 → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )=0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

So, nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH1.

Substituting:

nSi1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH1 ) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

The nFe_sun terms cancel:

nSi1 = (nH1 * nSi_sun )/(nH_sun) ) *10^0.3.

Which is nSi1 = (nH1 /nH_sun ) * nSi_sun *10^0.3.

Hmm, but I don't know nH1 or nSi_sun.

Wait, but perhaps I can express the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 without knowing the absolute values.

Let me now think about Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

And [Mg/Si]2=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3 → nMg2/nSi2= (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

So, nSi2 =nMg2 / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ].

But nMg2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2.

So, substituting:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun/nH_sun ) *nH2 ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ].

Simplify:

nSi2 = [ (nMg_sun *nH2 )/(nH_sun) ) ] / [ (nMg_sun *10^0.3 )/(nSi_sun) ) ].

The nMg_sun terms cancel:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun ) / (10^0.3 )

So, nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun ) * nSi_sun *10^(-0.3).

Now, the ratio of nSi1 to nSi2 would be:

(nSi1)/(nSi2) = [ (nH1 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3) ) ]

Simplify: nH_sun terms cancel, nSi_sun cancels.

= [ nH1 *10^0.3 ] / [nH2 *10^(-0.3) ]

= (nH1/nH2) * 10^(0.3 +0.3 ) 

= (nH1/nH2) *10^0.6.

Hmm, but what is nH1/nH2? I don't know the H densities of the stars. But perhaps the stars have the same H? Or perhaps there's another way to find the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the stars are main-sequence stars, and their H content is related to their masses. But that's probably beyond the scope here, and I don't think the question gives any info about the stars' evolutionary state or surface gravity.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH1/nH2 is 1, but that's an assumption. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says "photospheric composition", so perhaps each star's H is the same as the Sun's? No, that can't be right because their [Fe/H] are different.

Wait, no, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, but [Fe/H]_2 is not given. Wait, no, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means Fe abundance is same as solar for Star_1, but [Fe/H]_2 is not given.

Wait, but in the problem, for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0. So for Star_2, nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But I don't know anything about [Fe/H]_2, but perhaps it's not needed.

Wait, perhaps I can express nH1 and nH2 in terms of some other parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH1/nH2 is not needed because it cancels out somehow. Let me see.

Wait, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1/nH2) *10^0.6.

But without knowing (nH1/nH2), I can't proceed. Hmm. So maybe I'm missing a trick here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only about the ratios of the elements relative to each other, and the H cancels out because it's the same in both stars. But that's only if nH1 =nH2, which I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't require knowing the absolute number of H atoms, so perhaps I can set nH1 =nH2 = same value, but that's an assumption. Or perhaps the ratio is not needed because the H cancels in the final ratio of Si.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the fact that the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0, and Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, but Star_2's [Fe/H] is not given. Maybe that's a dead end.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the ratios as given, and express each nSi in terms of the Sun's nH.

Wait, for Star_1:

nSi1 = (nH1 /nH_sun ) * nSi_sun *10^0.3.

For Star_2:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3).

So, the ratio is (nH1/nH2) *10^(0.6).

But again, without knowing nH1/nH2, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the H density is the same in both stars, nH1 =nH2. That would make the ratio (nSi1/nSi2) =10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, so approximately 4. But looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But why would the H density be the same in both stars? That seems like an assumption, but maybe that's what's intended.

Wait, but I thought that the H density would vary with the star's properties, like gravity and mass. But perhaps for this problem, it's assumed that the H is the same, which would make the ratio just 10^0.6.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star, but that's not what's being asked. The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms between the two stars.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in not considering that [X/H] is log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun).

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] =0.3, and [Fe/H]=0.

So, [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H] =0.3 +0=0.3.

So, log(nSi1/nH1) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) +0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0, and [Mg/Si]=0.3.

So, [Mg/Si]=0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) +0.3.

But again, without knowing nSi_sun, perhaps I can relate the two.

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio nSi1/nSi2 by considering their [Si/H] and [Mg/Si].

Alternatively, perhaps we can express both nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of the Sun's [Si/H] and then find their ratio.

But I'm stuck because I don't have the Sun's [Si/H].

Wait, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Si/H] using the given data.

Wait, but I don't have any data on Si in the Sun. Hmm. So perhaps I'm supposed to find the ratio without knowing the Sun's [Si/H], which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering that the [Mg/Si] for Star_2 is 0.3, and [Mg/H] is 0. So, from those, perhaps we can find [Si/H] for Star_2.

Because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] → 0.3 =0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, for Star_2, [Si/H] = -0.3 → log(nSi2/nH2) = log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) -0.3.

But I still don't know nSi_sun.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the solar [Mg/Si] ratio.

In the Sun, [Mg/Si] = log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0 → nMg/nSi =nMg_sun/nSi_sun.

Which implies that (nMg/nMg_sun )= (nSi/nSi_sun ).

So, for Star_2, [Mg/Si] =0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

But Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2.

So, substituting into the [Mg/Si] equation:

nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2 / nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3.

Rearranging:

nSi2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2 ) * (nSi_sun/nMg_sun ) ) /10^0.3.

Simplify:

nSi2 = (nH2 /nH_sun ) *nSi_sun/(10^0.3 ).

So, nSi2 = (nH2/nH_sun ) *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3).

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 and [Fe/H]=0.

So, [Si/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi1/nH1 =nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^0.3 → nSi1= nH1 *nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^0.3.

Now, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 is:

(nH1 *nSi_sun/nH_sun *10^0.3) / (nH2/nH_sun *nSi_sun *10^(-0.3) )).

Simplify:

= (nH1 /nH2 ) *10^(0.3 +0.3 )

= (nH1 /nH2 ) *10^0.6.

Again, I'm stuck on (nH1/nH2). Without knowing the ratio of H in each star, I can't compute this.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the H number density is the same in both stars, meaning nH1 =nH2. Then, the ratio would be 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But why would nH1 =nH2? Unless the stars are identical in some way, but they have different masses and different [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. So that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows us to ignore the H ratio because it cancels out when considering the ratio of silicon in the photospheres, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the H ratio as 1, so the answer is approximately 4, which would be option A.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio nSi1/nSi2 in terms of the given [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] data.

Wait, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi1 = nFe1 *10^0.3 * (nFe_sun /nSi_sun ).

Wait, no, the ratio [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun )=0.3 → (nSi/nFe) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3 → nSi =nFe * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg/nSi)= (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 → nSi= nMg/( (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 ).

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg= nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH.

So, for Star_2, nSi2= [nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH ] / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 ].

Simplify:

= [nMg_sun *nH /nH_sun ] / (nMg_sun *10^0.3 /nSi_sun )

= (nH *nSi_sun )/(nH_sun *10^0.3 )

Now, for Star_1:

nFe1= [nFe_sun /nH_sun ] *nH.

And nSi1= nFe1 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

= [nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH ] * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

= nH * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

So, nSi1= nH * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

nSi2= nH * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3 ).

So, the ratio nSi1/nSi2 = [10^0.3 ] / [10^(-0.3 ) ] =10^(0.6) ≈3.98.

Ah! So the H terms cancel out because both stars have the same nH? Wait, but wait, the nH in Star_1 and Star_2 could be different. How did that happen?

Wait, because in the expression for nSi1 and nSi2, I have nH in Star_1 and nH in Star_2. But in the ratio, it's (nH1 * ...) / (nH2 * ...). So, unless nH1 =nH2, the H terms wouldn't cancel. So why are they the same?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming nH is the same in both stars. Because in the way I derived nSi1 and nSi2, I used nH1 and nH2, which might not be the same.

Wait, but let me look again. Oh wait, in the expression for nSi1, I used nH1, and for nSi2, I used nH2. So the ratio would be [nH1 * ... ] / [nH2 * ... ].

Unless the stars have the same nH, which isn't given.

But wait, in the problem statement, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of the two stars. So it's nSi1 /nSi2, regardless of their H content.

Hmm. So, perhaps I missed something earlier. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of the given solar values and the star's abundances, assuming that the ratio of H is the same as the Sun's. But that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H ratio cancels out, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, earlier, I derived that nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1/nH2 ) *10^0.6.

But without knowing (nH1/nH2), I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem requires an assumption that (nH1/nH2 )=1, making the ratio 10^0.6 ≈3.98 → option A.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the relation of the stars' [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] to find nH.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, nFe1= nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH1.

But for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → nMg2= nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2.

But without any other data, perhaps I can't find the ratio of H.

Wait, perhaps considering that both stars have the same number of H atoms, but that's an assumption.

Wait, let me try that. Suppose that nH1 =nH2 =nH.

Then, the ratio would be 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But I'm not sure if this is valid. The problem doesn't state that the stars have the same H density.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another way to find the ratio without considering H.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of the ratios of Fe and Mg.

Wait, for Star_1:

nFe1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH1.

nSi1= (nFe1) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

= (nFe_sun/nH_sun *nH1 ) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun ) *10^0.3.

= nH1 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2.

nSi2= (nMg2 ) / [ (nMg_sun/nSi_sun ) *10^0.3 ) ].

= (nMg_sun/nH_sun *nH2 ) * (nSi_sun/nMg_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

= nH2 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

So, nSi1 =nH1 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

nSi2 =nH2 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3).

So, the ratio is:

nSi1/nSi2 = (nH1/nH2 ) * (10^0.3 / 10^(-0.3 )) )

= (nH1/nH2 ) *10^(0.6).

Without knowing (nH1/nH2), I can't find this ratio. So perhaps the problem is missing some information, or perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the H densities are the same.

If I make that assumption, then nH1/nH2 =1 → ratio=10^0.6 ≈3.98 → option A.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of H in the stars can be found using the fact that the stars' surface gravities are different, but I don't think that's intended here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen in each star, but the question is about the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, maybe the ratio is 10^0.6, which is about 3.98, which is option A.

I think that's the intended answer, so I'll go with option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and solar photospheric composition.

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe] = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H] = 0 dex

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si] = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H] = 0 dex

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \)
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \)

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- [Fe/H] = 0 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}}) \), so \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
- [Si/Fe] = 0.3 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Si, sun}}/n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) + 0.3 \), so \( n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}} = (n_{\text{Si, sun}}/n_{\text{Fe, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{H,1}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{0.3}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- [Mg/H] = 0 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}}) \), so \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \).
- [Mg/Si] = 0.3 implies \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}}) = \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}}) + 0.3 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}} = (n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}}) \cdot 10^{0.3} \).
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,2}} = n_{\text{H,2}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{0.3}}{n_{\text{H,2}} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{H, sun}}}\right) \cdot 10^{-0.3}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Assumption:
If we assume that the hydrogen density is the same in both stars (\( n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{H,2}} \)), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
