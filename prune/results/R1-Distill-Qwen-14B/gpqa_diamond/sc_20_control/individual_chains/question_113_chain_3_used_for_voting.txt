Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. The options given are four different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the data provided.

First, let's break down the information given:

1. **FTIR Spectrum**: 
   - A very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is at 3000, which is more like the range for O-H in something like an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But I've also heard that a very broad peak could suggest a strong hydrogen bond, maybe in something like a ketone, but no, ketones don't have O-H. Oh, wait, maybe it's an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a conjugated carbonyl... Hmm. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group (C=O) like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation or an amide? But the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not an amide. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Alternatively, could it be a carbonyl in a ring structure, like a cyclic ketone?

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - There are several peaks, including some for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, right? Like in an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests there's an alkene group somewhere. Alternatively, if the compound is aromatic, like benzene with substituents, but the problem says vinyl, which is more like the sp² hybridized carbons in a double bond, not necessarily part of an aromatic ring. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, 45 could correspond to several things. I remember that the m/z 45 is a common fragment, maybe from a CH3CO group (like an ethyl group losing something, but wait, ethyl would be 29 for CH2CH3). Alternatively, maybe it's a CO (28) with something else? Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of methyl acetate? No, that's 60. Wait, wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O, which is 45 (15 + 2*12 + 6 = 45?), wait, (CH3)2O is 2*(12+3) + 16 = 24 +16=40? No, wait, methyl groups are 15 each (12+3). So (CH3)2O is 15*2 + 16= 46. Oh, wait, no, that's 46. So not that. Alternatively, maybe CH3CO is 43 (12+1+12+16+1=43?), but that can't be. Wait, maybe a fragment with a ketone. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

So the possible formulas all have 6 carbons. Let's think about degrees of unsaturation to get an idea.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N, it's (2C + 2 - H)/2.

Let me compute for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O

DoU = (14 -10)/2= 2. So either two double bonds, a ring and a double bond, or two rings.

Option C: C6H10O2

DoU = (14 -10)/2 = 2. So two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O

DoU = (14-12)/2=1. One DoU.

So the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So each option's structure must include a double bond or a ring.

Let me think about the FTIR again. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which is a carbonyl. So the compound has a carbonyl group. The 1650 cm⁻¹ could be another carbonyl, but it's lower than 1700, so maybe it's conjugated. Alternatively, maybe it's a C=C stretching. Wait, but if there's a conjugated system, like a carbonyl adjacent to a double bond (like an enone), then the carbonyl's peak might be shifted. So maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: 1700 is a ketone, and 1650 could be a conjugated double bond. Or, maybe one is a ketone and the other is an aromatic ring. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 1650 is a C=C stretch or a C-O stretch? Wait, O-H is at 3000, but that's a broad peak. So the other two peaks: 1700 and 1650. Could it be a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps a ketone next to a double bond?

So, the compound likely has a carbonyl group (so a ketone, ester, aldehyde, etc.) and a double bond or ring. Also, the presence of O in the formula. Let's think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options, each has O but varying numbers of H. So if the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, that's a double bond. So the compound must have at least one double bond.

Let's think about the IR. The broad peak at 3000 is likely O-H. So if it's an alcohol, that would make sense. So if it's an alcohol, then the formula must have an -OH group. Wait, but the options: A and C have two O's, which would allow for an -OH and another functional group, like a carbonyl. So maybe it's an ester plus an -OH? Or a ketone and an -OH?

Wait, another possibility: If the compound is a β-keto alcohol, which would have both a ketone and an alcohol group. That would fit the O count and the IR peaks.

So for example, a structure like cyclohexenone with an alcohol group.

But let's think about the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2COH, which is 12*3 + 1*6 + 16*2? Wait, no, wait: 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's see the possible fragments:

Wait, 45 could be a fragment from an ester group. Let me think: The fragment at 45 could be a CH3CO- group. Because the molecular weight of CH3CO is 43, but wait, that's 12*2 +1*4 +16= 24+4+16=44. Hmm, close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a ketone fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2O, which is 46, but that's not 45. Wait, maybe CH2CH2O? No, that would be 44. Alternatively, maybe CH2CO, which is 42. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule breaks off a fragment that's leaving, like if the molecule has an ester group, the ester could break into an acylium ion or something. Alternatively, maybe the base peak is from a ketone group. Wait, another thought: 45 could be a (CH3)CO+ group, which would be 43, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2COO- but that would be higher.

Wait, perhaps the 45 is a (CH2)2O fragment? No, that would be 44 (12*2 + 2 + 16=24+2+16=42? No, wait, (CH2)2O is 12*2 + 4 +16=24+4+16=44. Hmm, almost but not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group with something else. Wait, CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) would have a molecular ion at 44 (12+2*1 +16 +12 +1=44?), but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CO2H (acetic acid) fragment, but that's 60.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible structures based on the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is 1. So one ring or one double bond. If it's an ester, for example, which has a carbonyl group. Esters have the general formula R-O-CO-R. So an ester would have the O and the carbonyl. And if it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, that would account for the ring. Alternatively, a simple ester with a double bond. Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond.

Wait, but if the formula is C6H12O2, the degrees of unsaturation is 1. So that could be either a ring or a double bond. But if the compound has both a carbonyl (like an ester) and a double bond (as suggested by the NMR), that would require two degrees of unsaturation (the carbonyl is a double bond, and the other is another double bond or a ring). So with DoU 1, that's not possible. So maybe it's a ring plus a carbonyl group. For example, a cyclic ketone, with an ester group?

Wait, but that's two O's. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester group with a ring. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester with a double bond. So for example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that would have more than 6 carbons. Let's compute: 2 (from CH2=CH-) + 2 (COO) + 2 (CH2CH3) = 6. Yes, that'd be 6 carbons. So the formula would be C6H10O2 (since double bond reduces H by 2). Wait, but option A is C6H12O2. If the structure is an ester with a double bond, the H count would decrease by 2, making it less than 12. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester (lactone) which has a ring. So a five-membered ring lactone, for example. That would have a ring (one DoU) and a carbonyl (another DoU), but the total DoU would be 2, which matches option C or B. Hmm, not option A.

So perhaps the structure isn't an ester. Let's think about another functional group.

Another possibility is a ketone and an alcohol group. So a β-keto alcohol. For example, something like (CH2)4CO(OH)CH3? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe a cyclohexanone derivative with an OH group.

Wait, but let's think about the IR. The broad peak could be an -OH group, and the strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 might be two carbonyl groups. But two carbonyls would require two O's, like in a ketone and an ester, or a diketone. Wait, but the FTIR showed two strong peaks. Could it be an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone where the carbonyl is conjugated with a double bond, leading to a shift in the peak? So maybe the 1700 is a ketone and the 1650 is a conjugated C=C, but I'm not sure if that's a strong peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl and an aromatic ring, but there's no mention of aromatic peaks in the IR, so maybe not.

Another angle: the mass spectrum. The fragment at 45 could be a methyl group attached to something else. Let's think about the molecular formula again.

If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), that's 6 carbons, 10 H, 2 O. Degrees of unsaturation is 2, so either two double bonds, one double bond and one ring, or two rings.

If the structure has a double bond and a carbonyl group, that would account for the two DoU. So perhaps an ester with a double bond.

Wait, another thought: The presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond. So, for an ester with a double bond, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOO-R. Let's count the carbons: CH2=CHCOO is four carbons, R would be an ethyl group (two more), but that would make six in total.

Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That's 6 carbons. But then the formula would be C6H10O2. Because each double bond reduces H by 2, and the ester has O2. So yes, option C.

But then, what about the IR and NMR? The ester would have a carbonyl at ~1700 cm⁻¹, which matches the IR. The vinyl hydrogens would show up in the NMR around 5-6 ppm as a triplet or quartet, depending on substituents.

But wait, the FTIR also shows a broad peak at 3000, which would suggest an -OH group, but option C has two O's. So if the structure is an ester with a double bond, where is the -OH? Hmm, this is a problem. Because if the formula is C6H10O2, that's two O's, so it could be an ester (O in COO) plus another O. Wait, but an ester only has two O's. So if the structure is an ester, it can't have an -OH. So perhaps the broad peak isn't from an -OH. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is from a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from an alcohol, but then the formula would have three O's if it's an ester and an -OH, which none of the options have. So perhaps the broad peak is from something else.

Wait, another possibility: The compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak at 3000 is from an amine, but the options don't include N, so that's not it. So, back to the drawing board.

Let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at m/z 45. 45 is 9 + 36 (like maybe a ketone group losing something). Wait, another thought: The molecular formula could have a fragment that's (CH2)2CO. Let's see: (CH2)2CO would be 12*3 + 2*2 +16 = 36 +4 +16=56. No, that's not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to an oxygen. For instance, OCH3 would be 31. Not 45. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2, which would have a molecular weight of (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol.

If the molecular ion is at 114, then a fragment at 45 would mean losing 69 (114-45=69). But I'm not sure what that corresponds to.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from a smaller part of the molecule. If the compound is a diester, but that seems less likely.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a propyl group. Propyl is 43, but that's not 45. Alternatively, butyryl (CH2CH2CO-) is 57. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene group, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula with a carbonyl and a double bond.

Let me consider each option's possible structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation 1. So one ring or one double bond.

If it's a ring plus a carbonyl, like a cyclic ketone. Wait, but that's a ring (DoU 1) and a ketone (another DoU). So that would require two DoU, but option A has only one. So that's not possible.

Hmm. So perhaps it's a ring without a double bond but with a carbonyl. Wait, a cyclic ketone would have a ring (DoU 1) and a ketone (DoU 1). So that's two DoU, but option A only has one. Therefore, option A can't have both a ring and a ketone. So the only possibility is a single DoU which is either a ring or a double bond.

So if it's a ring (like cyclohexane) with an ester group, but that would require more O's, perhaps? Alternatively, if it's a substituted cyclohexane with a carbonyl group, but that would require more DoU.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester with a ring. No, that would require more DoU.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the other options.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So possible structures: a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings.

If it's an alcohol with a double bond and a ring, that would account for two DoU. For example, cyclohexene with an alcohol substituent. The IR would show O-H (broad) and a C=C peak, but in the IR data, the peaks are at 1700 and 1650. So that doesn't match, because a C=C would be around 1650, but the 1700 would then require a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a structure with both a carbonyl and a double bond. But with two DoU, that's possible. But C6H10O would have a molecular weight of 6*12 +10 +16=72+10+16=98. The mass spec fragment at 45 would be roughly half of that. I'm not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU 2. So perhaps a double bond and a carbonyl group. For example, an ester with a double bond.

But earlier I thought the ester would have a carbonyl and an O, but the presence of an -OH would require another O. Hmm, but maybe it's an ester without an -OH. Wait, if the structure is an ester with a double bond, the FTIR would show a carbonyl at 1700 and perhaps a C=C at 1650. But the FTIR here has two strong peaks, 1700 and 1650. So that could fit. Also, the broad peak at 3000 would then not be from an -OH, which is confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's an α,β-unsaturated ester, which would have a conjugated system, leading to a carbonyl peak at lower wavenumbers.

Wait, another thought: the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ could be an O-H from an ester's adjacent group, but more likely, it's an alcohol. But then the formula would have three O's, which none of the options do. So maybe the broad peak is from an -OH in an alcohol group, but that would require the formula to have an additional O. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the broad peak at 3000 is from an amide N-H, but the options don't have N. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe it's from a conjugated carbonyl, but that doesn't fit with the broad peak.

Hmm, perhaps the broad peak isn't an O-H but something else. Maybe a C-H stretch in a conjugated system? For example, aromatic C-H would be around 3000, but they're usually not that broad. Or maybe allylic C-H, but those are usually less broad. Alternatively, maybe it's an O-H but in a different structure, like a ketone with an enol form, but that's rare.

Wait, perhaps the broad peak is from a carbonyl group being hydrogen-bonded, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from an -OH group, but the formula doesn't account for it. That doesn't make sense, so perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, the options have varying numbers of O's. Let me see:

If the formula has two O's (options A and C), then it could be an ester (O2) or a ketone plus something else. But without an -OH, the broad peak would have to be something else.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is from an ether's O-H? No, ethers don't have O-H. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe the O-H is part of another functional group. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde. But aldehydes have a C=O at around 1700 and an O-H? No, aldehydes don't have O-H. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids would have a very broad O-H peak around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹, which is the case here. But the formula would need an extra O for the -COOH group, which would make it O2. So if the formula is C6H12O2 (option A), then maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But then the other peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ would be from the C=O of the acid, which is usually around 1700, so that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the acid is deprotonated, and the C=O is at a lower wavenumber. Also, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so maybe it's a substituted acrylic acid. For example, CH2=CHCOOH. But that's only 3 carbons. Adding more to make six.

Wait, let's see: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that's six carbons. But that would be an ester, not a carboxylic acid. But then, the O count would be two (since ester is O2). So the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C). But then, the FTIR would have a broad peak for the -COOH, but wait, in the ester, the O-H would be absent. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So the structure has a double bond. The IR has a carbonyl group. So the structure has both a double bond and a carbonyl. So it's either an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound or a conjugated system.

So for an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, the carbonyl peak would be around 1700, but the conjugated double bond might cause a shift to lower wavenumbers, possibly around 1650. Alternatively, the 1650 could be the C=C stretch. But in that case, the peaks would be at around 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (C=C). That matches the IR data.

In such a structure, the presence of an ester group would explain the two O's, and the double bond would account for the vinyl H in the NMR.

So the formula would have two O's and a double bond. So options A (C6H12O2, DoU 1) and C (C6H10O2, DoU 2).

Wait, if the structure is an ester with a double bond, the formula would be C6H10O2, because each double bond reduces two H. So option C.

But then, the FTIR's broad peak at 3000 would require another O. Wait, no, because an ester doesn't have an O-H. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, unless the broad peak isn't from an O-H. Another possibility: The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000, which could be from an N-H stretch, but the options don't have nitrogen. Alternatively, maybe it's from a C-H stretch in an sp³ hybridized carbon, but that's usually less intense and not that broad.

Wait, perhaps it's a C-H stretch in an aromatic ring, but that's usually less broad and around 3000. Alternatively, it's a C≡C-H stretch, but the question says vinyl, which is sp², so that's not it.

Wait, maybe the peak is from an alcohol. So if the formula is C6H10O2, which has two O's, perhaps it's an ester and an alcohol. But that would require three O's. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another angle: the mass spec. The fragment at 45. Maybe it's a ketone group. The molecular formula for a ketone group is (R)CO. The molecular weight of (CH3)CO is 58 (assuming R is CH2CH3?), no, wait: (CH3)2CO is 58? Wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is 58. But 58 isn't 45. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The fragment could be from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule has an ester group, like R-O-CO-O-R', but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from an ethyl group. The molecular weight of ethyl is 29, but that's not 45. Alternatively, a propyl group is 43, but still not 45. Hmm.

Wait, I'm not making progress on the mass spec part. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU 1. So either a ring or a double bond. If it's a ring with a carbonyl, that would require two DoU, which isn't allowed here. So perhaps a double bond and an -OH group. But that would require two DoU as well (double bond and ring or another DoU). So maybe it's a cyclohexene with an -OH substituent. But in that case, the IR would have O-H (broad) and C=C (peaking around 1650). But option D's formula is C6H12O. So the molecular formula is C6H12O, which has a molecular weight of (6*12) +12 +16 = 72+12+16=100.

So if the molecular ion is at 100, and a fragment is at 45, perhaps it's losing a 55 mass fragment. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl. But an ether doesn't have O-H, so the broad peak wouldn't fit.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal, which has an -OH group and a ring. That would account for the O and the broad peak. But then the carbonyl would be part of the ring, which would have a different IR signature.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone (with a ring and a carbonyl) and an -OH group. But that would require two O's, which again, the options don't have for D.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me try to summarize:

The key points are:

- FTIR: Broad peak ~3000 (probably O-H), and strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 (likely carbonyl and possibly C=C).

- ¹H NMR: Vinyl H present, so double bond.

- Mass: fragment at 45.

From this, the structure must have:

- At least one O-H group (based on IR).

- A carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹).

- A double bond (vinyl H, and possibly the 1650 cm⁻¹ is C=C).

So the formula must include an -OH, a carbonyl, and a double bond.

Looking at the options:

Which options have both O and a double bond?

Option B: C6H10O. DoU 2. So could have a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU 2. So double bond and carbonyl.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU 1. So either a ring or a double bond plus carbonyl.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU 1. So either a ring or a double bond.

Wait, but we need both a double bond and a carbonyl group, which would require two DoU. So options with DoU 2 are B and C.

So options B and C are possible.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU 2. So double bond and ring.

But the presence of an -OH (from the broad IR peak) in this formula would require O count of 1, which is possible. So the structure would be a cyclic compound with an -OH and a double bond, plus a carbonyl. Wait, no, because O is only one. So how can it have a carbonyl? Unless it's a ketone, which would require an O. Hmm, no, a ketone is O, but in this case O is only one. So if the structure is a cyclic ketone with an -OH and a double bond, that would require two O's, but option B has only one O. So that can't be. So perhaps option B isn't correct.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU 2. So possible structures: a double bond and a carbonyl group. Plus, an -OH group.

Wait, but the O count is two. So if the structure has both a carbonyl (one O) and an -OH (another O), that would fit. So the structure could be a diol with a carbonyl? Or an ester with a double bond and an -OH. But that would require three O's, right?

Wait, no. Let's think: if the structure is an ester (which has two O's: O in COO), but also an -OH group, that would require three O's, which isn't the case here. So perhaps it's not an ester. Alternatively, the structure could be a ketone with an -OH and a double bond, which would require two O's. That could fit.

For example, consider a structure like CH2=CHCO(OH)R. Wait, but that would have three O's. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a β-keto alcohol. So it's a ketone and an alcohol on the same carbon chain. That would require two O's (one for the ketone, one for the OH). That fits option C (C6H10O2). So the structure would have both a carbonyl (from the ketone) and an -OH group, along with a double bond elsewhere.

In that case, the IR would show O-H (broad) and the ketone's carbonyl at 1700. The 1650 peak could be from a conjugated double bond or another carbonyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a C=C stretch.

The NMR would show vinyl H, so the double bond is present.

The mass spectrum fragment at 45 could be from a part of the molecule. Since the formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight is 114. So a fragment of 45 would mean another fragment of 69. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3CO (43) plus something else. But I'm not certain.

Another thought: the molecular formula could be something like cyclopentenone with an -OH group. For example, 3-cyclopenten-1-one with a hydroxyl group. That would have a ketone, a double bond (from the cyclopentene), and an -OH. But the formula for 3-cyclopenten-1-ol would be C5H8O, but we're dealing with C6H10O2 here. So perhaps there's an additional methyl group somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a vinyl ketone with an -OH group, like (CH2=CH)CO(OH)R. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Considering all this, I think the correct formula is C6H10O2, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the unknown compound, the provided spectroscopic data and the given options were analyzed systematically:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Spectrum**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
   - Strong peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system or a C=C stretch.

2. **¹H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (sp² carbons) suggest the presence of a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a possible fragment involving a methyl group or related structure.

4. **Chemical Formula Options**:
   - **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This could correspond to a single ring or a single double bond.
   - **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2. This could correspond to a combination of a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.
   - **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2. This could correspond to a double bond and a carbonyl group.
   - **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1. This could correspond to a single ring or a single double bond.

### Critical Evaluation:
- The FTIR data indicates the presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond or conjugated system. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ strongly suggests an O-H group, likely from an alcohol.
- The ¹H NMR data confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, indicating a double bond.
- The mass spectrometry data (fragment at m/z = 45) is consistent with a methyl group or related fragment.

### Elimination of Options:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: This formula has only one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond (or conjugated system). Thus, it is eliminated.
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which could account for a double bond and a ring. However, it has only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to explain the presence of both a carbonyl group and an O-H group. Thus, it is eliminated.
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: This formula also has only one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to account for both the carbonyl group and the double bond. Thus, it is eliminated.
- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which can account for a double bond and a carbonyl group. Additionally, it has two oxygen atoms, which can explain the presence of both a carbonyl group (C=O) and an O-H group. This matches all the given data.

### Conclusion:
The chemical formula that best fits the spectroscopic data and satisfies all the observations is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.
