Alright, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, the scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly like what we expect. But there's an exception: two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. Those peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So each must be about half, maybe? And it's ruled out that spin-spin coupling is causing this because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that explanation.

Then there's the LC-MS analysis. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, matching the expected molecule. So why is this happening? Let's think about the options.

The options are:
A) Contaminated with a precursor
B) Mixture of enantiomers
C) Double coupling during amide formation
D) Mixture of diastereoisomers

Hmm. Let's break down each part. The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. If they're integrating to 1H together, maybe it's something like a diastereomer mixture where each diastereomer has a different environment for that proton, causing two separate signals. But wait, enantiomers would have the same NMR spectrum because they're mirror images—so the NMR wouldn't show two peaks, it would look like one. So B can probably be ruled out because the NMR would not distinguish enantiomers in that way.

What about option A, a precursor? If the compound isn't purified, perhaps some precursor is present. But the NMR of the crude shows the expected molecule—so a precursor would have a different structure, probably a different molecular formula. The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, so same molecular weight. The precursor would have a lower mass, I think. So maybe A isn't the right answer because the two peaks in LC-MS have same mass as expected, not lower.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide formation. I'm not too familiar with that term, but maybe it refers to some kind of dimer or something. Wait, if it's a double coupling, could it be an issue during the synthesis, like an amide bond forming where two bonds form instead of one? Like a dimer? But then the molecular weight would be double, right? But the LC-MS shows same mass, so same molecular formula. So maybe C is not it because the mass wouldn't match.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. If the two diastereomers have the same number of protons but in different environments, then each would have their own peak. And if the sample is a 50:50 mix, each peak would integrate to roughly the same area, adding up to 1H. That fits the NMR description.

Also, the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. Wait, diastereomers have the same molecular formula, same molecular weight. So their mass spectra would be the same. So if the sample is a mixture of diastereoisomers, the LC-MS would separate them as two peaks but same mass, which aligns with what's observed.

Wait, but in the question, the LC-MS was done at elevated temperature. Oh, maybe that affects something like isomerism. If the diastereomers have different retention times, they'd elute at different times, which is why there are two peaks in LC-MS. But since their masses are same, the MS can't tell them apart.

So putting it all together, the NMR shows two separate peaks for the same proton, suggesting different environments (so not enantiomers), and the LC-MS shows two same-mass peaks, which would mean same molecular formula. Diastereomers fit both observations.

So the most likely explanation is option D, a mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

- **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor):** A precursor would have a different molecular formula and molecular weight, leading to a distinct mass in LC-MS. Since the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule, this option is unlikely.

- **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers):** Enantiomers are mirror images and would have identical NMR spectra because they are not distinguishable under standard NMR conditions. This rules out enantiomers as the cause of the two peaks in the NMR spectrum.

- **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide formation):** This term likely refers to an issue during synthesis, such as dimer formation. However, a dimer would have a different molecular weight, which contradicts the LC-MS data showing two peaks with the same mass as the expected molecule. Thus, this option is not consistent with the observations.

- **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and can produce distinct NMR signals due to differing environments for equivalent protons. The two peaks in the NMR spectrum, with integrals adding up to 1H, align with this explanation. Additionally, diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula and mass, which explains the two peaks in the LC-MS with the same mass. This option fits both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
