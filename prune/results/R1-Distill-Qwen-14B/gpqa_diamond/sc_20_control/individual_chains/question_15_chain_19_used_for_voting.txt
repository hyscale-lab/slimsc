Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, the question gives me specific details about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. 

Let me go through the given information again. Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has three times shorter a period than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, then Planet_1's is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies calculations.

The host stars are important too. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh right, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they ended up with the same radius as Planet_1's host. So their radii are equal, but masses differ.

I need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, right? Or more specifically, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by some other factors. Wait, I think the transit probability formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (something else). Oh wait, no, the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough for us to see the transit) is actually given by (R_s / a) * something, but wait, another approach: the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a / R_star)), but I'm getting a bit confused. 

Wait, I think the key factor is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The probability of transit is proportional to (R_star / a)^2. Wait, no, maybe the probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit. So it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on. But actually, the probability of alignment is about the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. So transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a) * something, maybe?

Alternatively, I remember that the geometric probability of a transit is given by (R_s + R_p)^2 / (a^2), but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately (R_s^2)/(a^2) multiplied by (something else). Wait, no, I think the formula is (R_s / a)^2. Because if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on, the probability is higher. The formula for the geometric probability is (R_* / a)², where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_*/a)^2 * (1/(1 - (R_*/a)^2 )^(1/2)) )? Or maybe it's more like P = (R_*/a)^2. Hmm, I might be mixing up some terms.

Alternatively, the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a)^2. So, the probability is higher when the star's radius is larger relative to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, let me think again. The probability is the area of the star (since the planet has to pass in front of it) divided by the area of the planet's orbit (the area where the planet could be in our line of sight). So, the area of the star is π R_*², and the area of the orbit is π a². So the probability is (R_*² / a²) = (R_* / a)^2.

But wait, that's not exactly right because the orbit is a circle, and the probability depends on the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it crosses our line of sight. Another approach: the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So, the probability is (2R_*)/(2a) ) = R_* / a. Wait, but that would be a linear probability. Hmm, maybe I should look up the correct formula.

Oh wait, I think the correct transit probability (the geometric probability) is given by (R_* + R_p)^2 / (a^2), but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, we can approximate it as (R_*^2) / (a^2) multiplied by (1/(1 - (R_*^2)/(a^2)) ) or something else. No, wait: I think the actual formula is P = (R_* / a)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_* / a)^2))^(1/2) )? Or perhaps it's just (R_* / a)^2. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the formula as P = (R_*^2) / (a^2) * (1/(1 - (R_*^2)/(a^2))^(1/2)) ) Or maybe it's (R_* / a)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the planet's orbital distance being a, and the star's radius R_*, then the transit probability is approximately (R_* / a)^2. Because the planet's orbit is much larger than the star, so the area where the planet can transit is roughly the area of the star relative to the planet's orbit.

So, if I can find (R_* / a) for each planet, square it, and compare, that should give the transit probability ratio.

But wait, the question gives the orbital periods. So for each planet, we can find 'a' using Kepler's third law. Since both have circular orbits, Kepler's law is applicable.

Kepler's third law states that (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_* + M_p)) / (4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So a^3 = [G M_* P^2]/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M_* P^2)^(1/3).

But wait, the problem states that the planets have the same mass, but the host stars have different masses. So for each planet, a is proportional to (M_* P^2)^(1/3).

Given that, for Planet_1, M_* is 2 M_2 (since M1 = 2 M2?), wait no, the question says the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1_* = 2 M2_*.

And the orbital period of Planet_1 is P1 = P2 /3.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 is proportional to (M1_* * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2_* * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2_* P2² /9 )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2_* P2²)^(1/3).

a2 is proportional to (M2_* * P2^2 )^(1/3).

So a1 = a2 * ( (2/9)^(1/3) ). Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 9 is 3^2, so 2/9 is 2/(3^2). 2/9 is about 0.222. 0.222^(1/3) is approximately 0.606. Hmm, because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Wait, but let's be precise. Let me compute 2/9 = 0.2222. The cube root is approximately 0.606. So a1 = a2 * 0.606.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, a is proportional to (M_* P^2 )^(1/3). So for Planet_1, a1 = [ (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ]^(1/3) = [ 2 M2 P2² / 9 ]^(1/3 ) = [ (2/9) * (M2 P2²) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) * [ M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3 ).

And a2 is [ M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3 ). So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

So the ratio a2/a1 is (1) / (2/9)^(1/3 ) ) = (9/2)^(1/3 ).

But wait, let me compute (2/9)^(1/3 ) numerically. 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root: 0.6 approximately, as before.

So a1 is about 0.6 * a2, so a2 is larger than a1. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is.

Now, the transit probability is (R_*/a)^2. But both stars have the same radius, R_*, as given in the problem. So for each planet, transit probability P is ( R_* / a )^2.

So for Planet_1: P1 = ( R_* / a1 )^2.

For Planet_2: P2 = ( R_* / a2 )^2.

But since a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 ), substituting:

P1 = ( R_* / ( a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ) )^2 = ( R_* / a2 )^2 * (1 / (2/9)^(2/3) ) ) = P2 * (9/2)^(2/3).

Wait, wait. Let me compute this again.

Since a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2, then ( R_* / a1 ) = ( R_* / a2 ) * (1/(2/9)^(1/3) ) ) = ( R_* / a2 ) * (9/2)^(1/3).

So (R_* / a1 ) = (R_* / a2 ) * (9/2)^(1/3 ).

Then (R_* / a1 )^2 = (R_* / a2 )^2 * (9/2)^(2/3).

So P1 = P2 * (9/2)^(2/3).

Now, 9/2 is 4.5. So (4.5)^(2/3) is equal to (4.5^(1/3))^2.

What's 4.5^(1/3)? Well, 1.65^3 is approximately 4.489, so cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65.

So (4.5)^(2/3) ≈ (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.7225.

So P1 ≈ P2 * 2.7225.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 2.7 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. Option C says 1.65 times, which is around the cube root of 4.5, but that would be if the ratio were to the first power, perhaps.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the exponents in my calculations. Let me check again.

Wait, (9/2) is 4.5. So (9/2)^(2/3) is (4.5)^(2/3) = (4.5^(1/3))^2. As I thought, which is about (1.65)^2 = 2.7225. So P1 is 2.72 times P2.

So P1/P2 = 2.72. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by a factor of ~2.7.

So the correct option is D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, but is that correct? Because a is inversely proportional to the transit probability. So if a is smaller (Planet_1 is closer), transit probability is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the probabilities.

Wait, let me re-express the transit probability. The transit probability is (R_*/a)^2. So the ratio of probabilities is ( (R_* /a1)^2 ) / ( (R_* /a2)^2 ) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

Because (R_* cancels out, and we get (a2/a1)^2.

Earlier, we found a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

So a2/a1 = 1/(2/9)^(1/3) ) = (9/2)^(1/3).

Thus, (a2/a1)^2 = (9/2)^(2/3) = (4.5)^(2/3) ≈ 2.72.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by approximately 2.72 times.

Thus, the researchers would choose Planet_1 because it's more likely to transit.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_*\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The semi-major axis \(a\) can be derived from Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* P^2
\]

Given that both planets have the same mass, the semi-major axis depends on the mass of the host star (\(M_*\)) and the orbital period (\(P\)).

### Key Information:
1. **Mass of Host Stars**: The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2 (\(M_{*1} = 2M_{*2}\)).
2. **Orbital Periods**: Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2 (\(P_1 = P_2 / 3\)).
3. **Star Radii**: Both stars have the same radius (\(R_{*1} = R_{*2}\)).

### Step 1: Compute the semi-major axis ratio
From Kepler's law, \(a \propto (M_* P^2)^{1/3}\). Substituting the given values:
\[
a_1 \propto (2M_{*2} \cdot (P_2 / 3)^2)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \cdot (M_{*2} P_2^2)^{1/3}
\]
\[
a_2 \propto (M_{*2} P_2^2)^{1/3}
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Numerically, \((2/9)^{1/3} \approx 0.606\), so:
\[
a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Compute the transit probability ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \((R_* / a)^2\). Since \(R_{*1} = R_{*2}\), the ratio of transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{R_*}{a_1}\right)^2 / \left(\frac{R_*}{a_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(a_1 / a_2 = (2/9)^{1/3}\):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{1}{(2/9)^{1/3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Numerically, \((9/2)^{2/3} \approx (4.5)^{2/3} \approx 2.72\). Therefore:
\[
P_1 \approx 2.72 \cdot P_2
\]

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

Because the planet's orbit is much larger than the star, so the area where the planet can transit is roughly the area of the star relative to the planet's orbit.

So, if I can find (R_* / a) for each planet, square it, and compare, that should give the transit probability ratio.

But wait, the question gives the orbital periods. So for each planet, we can find 'a' using Kepler's third law. Since both have circular orbits, Kepler's law is applicable.

Kepler's third law states that (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_* + M_p)) / (4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So a^3 = [G M_* P^2]/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M_* P^2)^(1/3).

But wait, the problem states that the planets have the same mass, but the host stars have different masses. So for each planet, a is proportional to (M_* P^2)^(1/3).

Given that, for Planet_1, M_* is 2 M_2 (since M1 = 2 M2?), wait no, the question says the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1_* = 2 M2_*.

And the orbital period of Planet_1 is P1 = P2 /3.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 is proportional to (M1_* * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2_* * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2_* P2² /9 )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2_* P2²)^(1/3).

a2 is proportional to (M2_* * P2^2 )^(1/3).

So a1 = a2 * ( (2/9)^(1/3) ). Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 9 is 3^2, so 2/9 is 2/(3^2). 2/9 is about 0.222. 0.222^(1/3) is approximately 0.606. Hmm, because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Wait, but let's be precise. Let me compute 2/9 = 0.2222. The cube root is approximately 0.606. So a1 = a2 * 0.606.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, a is proportional to (M_* P^2 )^(1/3). So for Planet_1, a1 = [ (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ]^(1/3) = [ 2 M2 P2² / 9 ]^(1/3 ) = [ (2/9) * (M2 P2²) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) * [ M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3 ).

And a2 is [ M2 P2^2 ]^(1/3 ). So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

So the ratio a2/a1 is (1) / (2/9)^(1/3 ) ) = (9/2)^(1/3 ).

But wait, let me compute (2/9)^(1/3 ) numerically. 2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root: 0.6 approximately, as before.

So a1 is about 0.6 * a2, so a2 is larger than a1. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is.

Now, the transit probability is (R_*/a)^2. But both stars have the same radius, R_*, as given in the problem. So for each planet, transit probability P is ( R_* / a )^2.

So for Planet_1: P1 = ( R_* / a1 )^2.

For Planet_2: P2 = ( R_* / a2 )^2.

But since a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 ), substituting:

P1 = ( R_* / ( a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ) )^2 = ( R_* / a2 )^2 * (1 / (2/9)^(2/3) ) ) = P2 * (9/2)^(2/3).

Wait, wait. Let me compute this again.

Since a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2, then ( R_* / a1 ) = ( R_* / a2 ) * (1/(2/9)^(1/3) ) ) = ( R_* / a2 ) * (9/2)^(1/3).

So (R_* / a1 ) = (R_* / a2 ) * (9/2)^(1/3 ).

Then (R_* / a1 )^2 = (R_* / a2 )^2 * (9/2)^(2/3).

So P1 = P2 * (9/2)^(2/3).

Now, 9/2 is 4.5. So (4.5)^(2/3) is equal to (4.5^(1/3))^2.

What's 4.5^(1/3)? Well, 1.65^3 is approximately 4.489, so cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65.

So (4.5)^(2/3) ≈ (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.7225.

So P1 ≈ P2 * 2.7225.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 2.7 times higher than that of Planet_2. Therefore, Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. Option C says 1.65 times, which is around the cube root of 4.5, but that would be if the ratio were to the first power, perhaps.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the exponents in my calculations. Let me check again.

Wait, (9/2) is 4.5. So (9/2)^(2/3) is (4.5)^(2/3) = (4.5^(1/3))^2. As I thought, which is about (1.65)^2 = 2.7225. So P1 is 2.72 times P2.

So P1/P2 = 2.72. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by a factor of ~2.7.

So the correct option is D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, but is that correct? Because a is inversely proportional to the transit probability. So if a is smaller (Planet_1 is closer), transit probability is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the probabilities.

Wait, let me re-express the transit probability. The transit probability is (R_*/a)^2. So the ratio of probabilities is ( (R_* /a1)^2 ) / ( (R_* /a2)^2 ) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

Because (R_* cancels out, and we get (a2/a1)^2.

Earlier, we found a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

So a2/a1 = 1/(2/9)^(1/3) ) = (9/2)^(1/3).

Thus, (a2/a1)^2 = (9/2)^(2/3) = (4.5)^(2/3) ≈ 2.72.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by approximately 2.72 times.

Thus, the researchers would choose Planet_1 because it's more likely to transit.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_*\) is the radius of the host star, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The semi-major axis \(a\) can be derived from Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* P^2
\]

Given that both planets have the same mass, the semi-major axis depends on the mass of the host star (\(M_*\)) and the orbital period (\(P\)).

### Key Information:
1. **Mass of Host Stars**: The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2 (\(M_{*1} = 2M_{*2}\)).
2. **Orbital Periods**: Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2 (\(P_1 = P_2 / 3\)).
3. **Star Radii**: Both stars have the same radius (\(R_{*1} = R_{*2}\)).

### Step 1: Compute the semi-major axis ratio
From Kepler's law, \(a \propto (M_* P^2)^{1/3}\). Substituting the given values:
\[
a_1 \propto (2M_{*2} \cdot (P_2 / 3)^2)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \cdot (M_{*2} P_2^2)^{1/3}
\]
\[
a_2 \propto (M_{*2} P_2^2)^{1/3}
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Numerically, \((2/9)^{1/3} \approx 0.606\), so:
\[
a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2
\]

### Step 2: Compute the transit probability ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \((R_* / a)^2\). Since \(R_{*1} = R_{*2}\), the ratio of transit probabilities is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{R_*}{a_1}\right)^2 / \left(\frac{R_*}{a_2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(a_1 / a_2 = (2/9)^{1/3}\):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{1}{(2/9)^{1/3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Numerically, \((9/2)^{2/3} \approx (4.5)^{2/3} \approx 2.72\). Therefore:
\[
P_1 \approx 2.72 \cdot P_2
\]

### Conclusion:
Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.
