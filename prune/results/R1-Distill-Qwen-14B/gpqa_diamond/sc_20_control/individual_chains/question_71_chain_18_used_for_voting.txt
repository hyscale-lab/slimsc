Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read through it again.

The question is about five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. They’re in orbital resonance with orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All have the same albedo. I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. Since their albedos are the same, the ratio of temperatures should depend only on their distances.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - a) / (4d^2) )^(1/4) )^(1/4) → Maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Oh wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_eff * ( (R_star/(2d)) )^(1/2) * sqrt( (1 - a) /1 ), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature. But wait, in terms of the inverse square law, the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. The planet's equilibrium temperature is related to the distance as T ∝ ( (1 - a) / (d^2) )^(1/4). Since a is the same for all, (1 - a) is a constant, so temperature ratio depends on d^(-1/2).

So the key is to find the ratio of their distances. Because the planets are in resonance and their periods are in a ratio, I can use Kepler's third law which states that (T1/T2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3, assuming same star mass. So the period ratio is given. Let me write down the period ratios.

Wait, the periods are in ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period 1 unit, Planet_2 is 2, Planet_3 is 2.5, Planet_4 is 3.5, Planet_5 is 5.

Wait, but Kepler's law says (a1/a2)^3 = (T1/T2)^2. So the cube of the ratio of semi-major axes is the square of the ratio of the periods.

So for Planet_2 and Planet_4: T2 is 2, T4 is 3.5.

So (a2/a4)^3 = (T2/T4)^2 → (a2/a4) = ( (2/3.5) )^(2/3) )

Wait, actually, wait. Let me think. (a2/a4)^3 = (T2 / T4)^2 → a2/a4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3) → a4 = a2 * (T4 / T2)^(2/3 )

Wait, no. Let me correct. Let's say T is the period. So according to Kepler's law, (a1/a2)^3 = (T1/T2)^2.

So for Planet_2 and Planet_4, a2/a4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3)

Wait, no, wait. Let me get it right. Let me take the cube of (a2/a4) equals square of (T2/T4).

So a2/a4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3) → a4 = a2 * (T4 / T2)^(2/3) → No, wait, let's compute:

If a2/a4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3), then a4 = a2 * (T4 / T2)^(2/3) ?

Wait, no, if a2/a4 = (T2/T4)^(2/3), then a4 = a2 * (T4/T2)^(2/3).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the semi-major axis ratio.

So for Planet_2 and Planet_4, the period ratio T2:T4 is 2:3.5 → 4:7 when multiplied by 2 and 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7. So T2/T4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7.

So (a2/a4)^3 = (4/7)^2 → (a2/a4) = (4/7)^(2/3) → a4 = a2 * (7/4)^(2/3).

Wait, no. Let's compute (a2/a4) = (T2/T4)^(2/3) → so a2 = a4 * (T2/T4)^(2/3) → Therefore, a4 = a2 * (T4/T2)^(2/3) → yes.

So T4 is 3.5, T2 is 2. So T4/T2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75 = 7/4.

So a4 = a2 * (7/4)^(2/3).

What is (7/4)^(2/3) approx? Let me compute.

7/4 is about 1.75. Let me compute 1.75^(2/3). Let me think in terms of exponents.

The cube root of 1.75 squared. Let me compute cube root of 1.75 first. Since 1.75 is about 1.75.

Cube root of 1.75: approximately, since 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is very close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2. So 1.2 squared is about 1.44. So (7/4)^(2/3) is approximately 1.44.

But wait, let's compute more accurately.

Alternatively, take natural logs. ln(1.75) is about 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.373. Exponentiate: e^0.373 ≈ 1.453. So about 1.45.

So a4 ≈ a2 * 1.45.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.45.

But we need the equilibrium temperature ratio. Since equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance (as T ∝ d^(-0.5) ), the ratio T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) → because T is proportional to (1/d)^0.5.

Wait, wait, let's get that right. T ∝ d^(-1/2). So T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^0.5.

Wait, no, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). So T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2), T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4). So T4/T2 = [1/sqrt(a4)]/[1/sqrt(a2)] = sqrt(a2/a4).

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (a2) / (a2 * (7/4)^(2/3)) )) → sqrt(1/(7/4)^(2/3)) ).

Simplify that: 1/(7/4)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

So sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3).

What's (4/7)^(1/3) approximately?

Well, 4/7 is about 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83, because 0.83^3 is around 0.5717 (since 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889; 0.6889 *0.83 ≈ 0.5717). So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

Alternatively, 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571, so yes.

So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83. So the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is about 0.83 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait: the question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2. So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the calculations.

Let me recompute (7/4)^(2/3):

(7/4) is 1.75. So 1.75^(2/3). Let me compute it accurately.

1.75^ (1/3) is approximately 1.2, as before. Then squared: (1.2)^2 = 1.44.

So a4 = a2 * 1.44, so a4/a2=1.44.

Then, T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(1/1.44) = sqrt(0.6944) ≈ 0.8333. Which is about 0.83, so option C.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: since equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period.

Wait, because Kepler's law says a^3 = T^2, so a = T^(2/3). Then, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a) → 1/(T^(2/3 * 1/2)) ) = T^(-1/3).

So T_eq proportional to T^(-1/3).

Wait wait, that's a different approach. Let me think. Because T_eq is proportional to (1 / a^(1/2)) ). And since a is proportional to T^(2/3) (from Kepler's law), then a^(1/2) is proportional to T^(1/3). So 1/a^(1/2) is proportional to T^(-1/3).

So T_eq ∝ T^(-1/3).

Therefore, the ratio of temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (T2 / T4)^(1/3).

Because T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T2 / T4)^(1/3).

Wait, that's a different conclusion. Hmm, which is correct.

Wait, if T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), and a is proportional to T^(2/3). So 1/sqrt(a) is proportional to T^(-1/3). So T_eq is proportional to T^(-1/3).

Therefore, T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T2 / T4)^(1/3).

Because T_eq is inversely proportional to T^(1/3). So if T4 is larger than T2, then T_eq4 is smaller.

So given T4 is 3.5, T2 is 2. So T2 / T4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83, as before.

So that's the same answer. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

So the correct answer is option C.

Another way: compute the ratio using the formula for equilibrium temperature.

The formula is T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (16πσ) )^(1/4) * (L / (16πd^2σ))^(1/4) → wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the ratio.

T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^0.25 * (L / d^2 )^0.25

Since (1-A) is the same for all, L is same for all (assuming same star), so T_eq ∝ d^(-0.5).

So the ratio is d2^(-0.5) / d4^(-0.5) ) → which is (d4 / d2 )^0.5.

Wait, no. Wait, T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(d). So T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(d2 / d4).

So how to find d2 and d4.

Using Kepler's law, d^3 ∝ T^2 → d ∝ T^(2/3).

So d2 = k * T2^(2/3), d4 = k * T4^(2/3).

So d4 / d2 = (T4 / T2 )^(2/3).

So T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( d2 / d4 ) = sqrt( (T2 / T4 )^(2/3) ) = (T2 / T4 )^(1/3).

Which again is (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83, so the same result.

So the answer is C) ~0.83.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature depends on the planet's distance from the star. The equilibrium temperature formula is proportional to \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \), where \( d \) is the orbital distance. Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto T^2 \), the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( T^{2/3} \). Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,4}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} \propto \left(\frac{T_2}{T_4}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given the orbital periods in the ratio \( T_2 : T_4 = 2 : 3.5 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7}.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is approximately 0.83 times that of Planet_2. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) ~0.83.**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read through it again.

The question is about five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. They’re in orbital resonance with orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All have the same albedo. I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Hmm. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. Since their albedos are the same, the ratio of temperatures should depend only on their distances.

Wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - a) / (4d^2) )^(1/4) )^(1/4) → Maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Oh wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_eff * ( (R_star/(2d)) )^(1/2) * sqrt( (1 - a) /1 ), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature. But wait, in terms of the inverse square law, the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. The planet's equilibrium temperature is related to the distance as T ∝ ( (1 - a) / (d^2) )^(1/4). Since a is the same for all, (1 - a) is a constant, so temperature ratio depends on d^(-1/2).

So the key is to find the ratio of their distances. Because the planets are in resonance and their periods are in a ratio, I can use Kepler's third law which states that (T1/T2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3, assuming same star mass. So the period ratio is given. Let me write down the period ratios.

Wait, the periods are in ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period 1 unit, Planet_2 is 2, Planet_3 is 2.5, Planet_4 is 3.5, Planet_5 is 5.

Wait, but Kepler's law says (a1/a2)^3 = (T1/T2)^2. So the cube of the ratio of semi-major axes is the square of the ratio of the periods.

So for Planet_2 and Planet_4: T2 is 2, T4 is 3.5.

So (a2/a4)^3 = (T2/T4)^2 → (a2/a4) = ( (2/3.5) )^(2/3) )

Wait, actually, wait. Let me think. (a2/a4)^3 = (T2 / T4)^2 → a2/a4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3) → a4 = a2 * (T4 / T2)^(2/3 )

Wait, no. Let me correct. Let's say T is the period. So according to Kepler's law, (a1/a2)^3 = (T1/T2)^2.

So for Planet_2 and Planet_4, a2/a4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3)

Wait, no, wait. Let me get it right. Let me take the cube of (a2/a4) equals square of (T2/T4).

So a2/a4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3) → a4 = a2 * (T4 / T2)^(2/3) → No, wait, let's compute:

If a2/a4 = (T2 / T4)^(2/3), then a4 = a2 * (T4 / T2)^(2/3) ?

Wait, no, if a2/a4 = (T2/T4)^(2/3), then a4 = a2 * (T4/T2)^(2/3).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the semi-major axis ratio.

So for Planet_2 and Planet_4, the period ratio T2:T4 is 2:3.5 → 4:7 when multiplied by 2 and 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7. So T2/T4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7.

So (a2/a4)^3 = (4/7)^2 → (a2/a4) = (4/7)^(2/3) → a4 = a2 * (7/4)^(2/3).

Wait, no. Let's compute (a2/a4) = (T2/T4)^(2/3) → so a2 = a4 * (T2/T4)^(2/3) → Therefore, a4 = a2 * (T4/T2)^(2/3) → yes.

So T4 is 3.5, T2 is 2. So T4/T2 is 3.5/2 = 1.75 = 7/4.

So a4 = a2 * (7/4)^(2/3).

What is (7/4)^(2/3) approx? Let me compute.

7/4 is about 1.75. Let me compute 1.75^(2/3). Let me think in terms of exponents.

The cube root of 1.75 squared. Let me compute cube root of 1.75 first. Since 1.75 is about 1.75.

Cube root of 1.75: approximately, since 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is very close to 1.75. So cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2. So 1.2 squared is about 1.44. So (7/4)^(2/3) is approximately 1.44.

But wait, let's compute more accurately.

Alternatively, take natural logs. ln(1.75) is about 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.373. Exponentiate: e^0.373 ≈ 1.453. So about 1.45.

So a4 ≈ a2 * 1.45.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.45.

But we need the equilibrium temperature ratio. Since equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance (as T ∝ d^(-0.5) ), the ratio T4 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ) → because T is proportional to (1/d)^0.5.

Wait, wait, let's get that right. T ∝ d^(-1/2). So T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^0.5.

Wait, no, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). So T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a2), T4 is proportional to 1/sqrt(a4). So T4/T2 = [1/sqrt(a4)]/[1/sqrt(a2)] = sqrt(a2/a4).

So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (a2) / (a2 * (7/4)^(2/3)) )) → sqrt(1/(7/4)^(2/3)) ).

Simplify that: 1/(7/4)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3).

So sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3).

So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3).

What's (4/7)^(1/3) approximately?

Well, 4/7 is about 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83, because 0.83^3 is around 0.5717 (since 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889; 0.6889 *0.83 ≈ 0.5717). So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83.

Alternatively, 0.83^3 ≈ 0.571, so yes.

So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83. So the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is about 0.83 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait: the question asks for the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2. So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the calculations.

Let me recompute (7/4)^(2/3):

(7/4) is 1.75. So 1.75^(2/3). Let me compute it accurately.

1.75^ (1/3) is approximately 1.2, as before. Then squared: (1.2)^2 = 1.44.

So a4 = a2 * 1.44, so a4/a2=1.44.

Then, T4/T2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(1/1.44) = sqrt(0.6944) ≈ 0.8333. Which is about 0.83, so option C.

But wait, let me think again. Another approach: since equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period.

Wait, because Kepler's law says a^3 = T^2, so a = T^(2/3). Then, T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a) → 1/(T^(2/3 * 1/2)) ) = T^(-1/3).

So T_eq proportional to T^(-1/3).

Wait wait, that's a different approach. Let me think. Because T_eq is proportional to (1 / a^(1/2)) ). And since a is proportional to T^(2/3) (from Kepler's law), then a^(1/2) is proportional to T^(1/3). So 1/a^(1/2) is proportional to T^(-1/3).

So T_eq ∝ T^(-1/3).

Therefore, the ratio of temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (T2 / T4)^(1/3).

Because T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T2 / T4)^(1/3).

Wait, that's a different conclusion. Hmm, which is correct.

Wait, if T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), and a is proportional to T^(2/3). So 1/sqrt(a) is proportional to T^(-1/3). So T_eq is proportional to T^(-1/3).

Therefore, T_eq4 / T_eq2 = (T2 / T4)^(1/3).

Because T_eq is inversely proportional to T^(1/3). So if T4 is larger than T2, then T_eq4 is smaller.

So given T4 is 3.5, T2 is 2. So T2 / T4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83, as before.

So that's the same answer. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

So the correct answer is option C.

Another way: compute the ratio using the formula for equilibrium temperature.

The formula is T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (16πσ) )^(1/4) * (L / (16πd^2σ))^(1/4) → wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the ratio.

T_eq ∝ (1 - A)^0.25 * (L / d^2 )^0.25

Since (1-A) is the same for all, L is same for all (assuming same star), so T_eq ∝ d^(-0.5).

So the ratio is d2^(-0.5) / d4^(-0.5) ) → which is (d4 / d2 )^0.5.

Wait, no. Wait, T_eq ∝ 1 / sqrt(d). So T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt(d2 / d4).

So how to find d2 and d4.

Using Kepler's law, d^3 ∝ T^2 → d ∝ T^(2/3).

So d2 = k * T2^(2/3), d4 = k * T4^(2/3).

So d4 / d2 = (T4 / T2 )^(2/3).

So T_eq4 / T_eq2 = sqrt( d2 / d4 ) = sqrt( (T2 / T4 )^(2/3) ) = (T2 / T4 )^(1/3).

Which again is (2 / 3.5)^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83, so the same result.

So the answer is C) ~0.83.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature depends on the planet's distance from the star. The equilibrium temperature formula is proportional to \( T_{\text{eq}} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \), where \( d \) is the orbital distance. Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto T^2 \), the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( T^{2/3} \). Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq,4}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} \propto \left(\frac{T_2}{T_4}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given the orbital periods in the ratio \( T_2 : T_4 = 2 : 3.5 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7}.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is approximately 0.83 times that of Planet_2. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) ~0.83.**

Answer: C
