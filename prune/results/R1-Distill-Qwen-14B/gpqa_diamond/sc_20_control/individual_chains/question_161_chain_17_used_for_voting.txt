Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm. Let me start by recalling what I know about mean free path. The mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a particle travels between collisions. In this case, the gas molecules in the sample compartment of the electron microscope.

So Mike created a ultra-high vacuum, but some gas particles are still present. He measured the mean free path as λ1. Then, when the electron beam was turned on, he noticed the mean free path changed to λ2. The question is about what happens to λ2 compared to λ1.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, electrons are moving through the sample compartment. I remember that electrons can interact with gas molecules. So maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas molecules.

In a vacuum, without any external factors, the MFP λ1 would depend on the pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment. But when the electron beam is active, the electrons could be scattering the gas molecules more. Scattering would increase the collision rate between the gas molecules and the electrons, right?

But wait, how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules? Let me think. The mean free path is inversely proportional to the collision rate. So if the collision rate increases, the mean free path decreases. Because the molecules are colliding more often, so they don't travel as far on average before a collision.

But wait, the gas molecules' collisions are probably with the electrons. Because the electron beam is introducing a source of collisions for the gas molecules. So the gas molecules are now colliding with the electrons more frequently when the beam is on.

So normally, without the electron beam, the gas molecules collide with each other and the walls. When the beam is on, they also collide with electrons. So the total collision rate increases, which would decrease the mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1, because the gas molecules are colliding more often, so their mean free path is shorter.

Wait, but wait a minute. The mean free path in vacuum is calculated based on the pressure, temperature, and the specific conditions. But when the electron beam is active, the electrons are moving fast and are a source of particles that the gas molecules can collide with.

So in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules have another set of particles (electrons) to collide with. That would increase the overall number of collisions, so the MFP should decrease. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. So that would be the correct conclusion.

Wait, but wait another thought. What if the electron beam somehow causes ionization or other effects that change the gas? But the question says the temperature remained the same, but doesn’t mention anything about chemical changes in the gas. So probably, the gas remains the same, and the only change is the presence of more particles (electrons) for collisions.

So yeah, the mean free path should decrease. So answer C.

The mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules in a vacuum is the average distance they travel between collisions. In this scenario, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, with a mean free path of λ1 under these conditions. When the electron beam was activated, the MFP changed to λ2. 

The electron beam introduces a new source of collisions for the gas molecules, as the electrons moving through the compartment collide with the gas molecules. This increases the total collision rate of the gas molecules, which inversely affects the MFP. A higher collision rate reduces the average distance a gas molecule travels before colliding, meaning the MFP decreases. Therefore, λ2 is less than λ1.

Given the options, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
