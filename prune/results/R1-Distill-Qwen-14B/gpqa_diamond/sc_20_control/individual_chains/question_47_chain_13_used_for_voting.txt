Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on IR and 1H NMR data. There are four options given: A, B, C, D. Each option is a different organic compound, probably something with a benzene ring and some substituents.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n + 2 - m - x - y)/2. So n=9, m=11, O=2, N=1.

DoU = (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That can be three rings, but more likely a benzene ring (which has 3 DoU by itself: 3 double bonds or one ring plus two double bonds). So probably a benzene ring with some substituents.

Now, the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are in the region of N-H stretches. The medium to strong intensity suggests either amide or amine. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So likely an amide (which has both N-H and C=O) or maybe an ester or a ketone, but the presence of N-H makes me think amide or maybe a primary amine with a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl. The triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons, so maybe an ethoxy group or an ethyl ester.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): a broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests exchange with something, maybe NH (if it's an amine or amide) or perhaps an OCH2 group where the protons are split into a singlet. Wait, but why broad? NH would have a broad peak. So maybe it's NH adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, which is deshielded, but why the broadness? Or maybe it's a methylene group (CH2) next to something else, like an ester oxygen.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): a quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests splitting into four, which occurs when a proton is next to two equivalent protons. So perhaps a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like an ethyl group. So maybe -OCH2CH2- or something similar. Wait, an ethyl ester would have the CH2 groups next to the oxygen. For example, in an ethyl ester, the structure is O-C-O-CH2CH3. Then the CH2 next to the ester oxygen would be split into a quartet. Oh wait, the quartet would be the OCH2 group in an ester. So the ethyl ester would have a triplet at around 1.2 (CH2CH3), and a quartet at around 4.1–4.3 (OCH2). But here the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than typical for OCH2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps an amide group where the CH2 is adjacent to an amide.

Then, the aromatic region:

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because two doublets, each integrating for two protons, with each as a doublet. So perhaps a para-substituted ring with two substituents, each having two protons. Wait, no. Wait, benzene has six protons. If it's para-substituted, the substituent would have two protons on each adjacent carbon. Wait, no, maybe a di-substituted ring, where each substituent is in the para position relative to each other.

Wait, no. Let me think. Let's imagine a benzene ring with two substituents. If the substituents are in para positions, then the adjacent carbons to each substituent would have two protons each. For example, if the substituents are on carbons 1 and 3, then the peaks would be as doublets.

Wait, actually, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other. So the protons on the ring would be split into two doublets. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be a doublet, and positions 3 and 5 would be another doublet. But wait, that's if the substituent is at position 4. Alternatively, if two substituents are attached in such a way that each causes the adjacent protons to be deshielded and split.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic region is showing a di-substituted benzene with substituents that are para to each other. Let's think: If the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like an ester or an amide, then the ring protons would be deshielded. Here, the peaks are at 7.0 and 8.0, which is typical for aromatic protons. The 8.0 ppm is upfield for aromatic, but amide groups or electron-withdrawing groups would cause downfield shifts.

So, the aromatic protons are in two doublets, each with two protons. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents, but wait, that would require four substituents, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. For a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is at opposite positions. So for example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 3, but that's meta. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and another substituent is elsewhere. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that causes the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons. Like a para-substituted group. For example, if the group is in para position, the ring protons would split into two sets of doublets. Let me think: if the group is at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So their chemical shifts would be different, leading to two doublets. That fits with the NMR data: two doublets, each with two protons.

So the benzene ring has a substituent at position 4 (para to itself?), or perhaps another substituent. Wait, no. Wait, if the substituent is at position 4, and the molecule is para-substituted, then the ring has two substituents in the 4 position? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a single group at position 4, making the ring para-substituted with that group. Then the adjacent protons would be in two doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an amino group or an ester group. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So the substituents would be at 3 and 1 (if the amide is at position 1?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: structure is formamide where the amide is attached to a phenyl group which has an ethoxy at position 4. So the benzene ring has a formamide group at position 1 and an ethoxy at position 4. So that's two substituents, para to each other.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: the structure is phenyl propionate where the amino group is at position 4. So the propionate ester is at position 4, and amino is also at position 4? Wait, that can't be. Or is it 4-aminophenyl propionate, meaning the amino is at position 4, and the propionate ester is attached to the benzene ring. So the substituents are amino and ester at position 4. Then the benzene would have two substituents at position 4? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the propionate is attached to the amino group. Wait, perhaps it's a benzylamine with a propionate ester. Let me think: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the propionate ester attached to the amino group at position 4. So the structure is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-O-NH-C6H4-4. Hmm, but that might not fit the NMR.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is benzoate ester where the amino group is at position 4. So the ester is at position 1, and the amino group is at position 4. So the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions: the ester and the amino group.

Wait, but let me think again about each option's structure:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene. So in this case, benzamide would have the CONH2 group at position 3, and an ethoxy group at position 3? No, wait, the name is 3-ethoxybenzamide, so the ethoxy is at position 3, and the amide is attached where? Wait, the amide is on the benzene as a substituent. So benzamide would be benzene with a CONH2 group. So 3-ethoxybenzamide is benzene with CONH2 at position 1 and OCH2CH3 at position 3. So the substituents are meta to each other.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: formamide is HCONR2. Here, phenyl group is attached to the N of the formamide. So structure is HCO-NH-Ph, where Ph is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the benzene ring has an ethoxy group at position 4 and the formamide group is attached to the NH. So the substituents are at position 4 (ethoxy) and the NHCO is attached at position 1, making the substituents para to each other.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: propionate ester is CH2CH2COO-. But wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, I'm a bit confused. 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the propionate ester attached to the 4-amino phenyl group. So the structure would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the NH2 group on the benzene at position 4. So the benzene has an amino group at position 4 and the ester group also attached there? No, that can't be because that would imply two groups on the same carbon. Alternatively, perhaps it's the amino group and the ester group are attached to adjacent carbons. Not sure, but this might not fit the NMR data.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: benzoate ester is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, and the amino group is at position 4. So the substituents are on the benzene at positions 1 and 4, making them para to each other.

Now, looking back at the NMR data:

The aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each a doublet with 2H. This suggests that the benzene has two substituents which are para to each other, with each substituent causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

So, in the structure, the substituents are in para positions, causing the aromatic protons on the ring to be in two doublets.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: substituents are at positions 1 (CONH2) and 3 (OCH2CH3), which are meta. So the aromatic protons would give a different pattern, perhaps two doublets but not as clear as a para substitution.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: substituents are at positions 1 (formamide) and 4 (ethoxy), which are para. So that would fit the aromatic NMR.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: substituents are at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (amino), which are para. So that would also fit the aromatic NMR.

So options B and D have substituents in para positions, leading to the two doublets in the aromatic region.

Now, let's look at the other parts of the NMR.

The 4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H) and 1.20 ppm triplet (t, 3H) suggest an ethyl group. The triplet is likely the CH2CH3 group, and the quartet is the adjacent CH2, which is connected to an electronegative atom. So OCH2CH3 or NCH2CH3. But in this case, the quartet at 4.5 ppm is probably OCH2, as in an ester or ethoxy group.

Option B has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) as a substituent on the benzene. So the ethoxy would give the triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3) and a quartet at around 4.1-4.3 for the OCH2. But the NMR shows quartet at 4.5, which is upfield a bit. Hmm.

Option D has an ethyl ester: OCH2CH3 attached to the carbonyl. So the ester group would have the OCH2CH3, giving the triplet and quartet. So in D, the substituent at position 1 is an ester group (O-CO-OCH2CH3?), wait no, ethyl benzoate is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene. So the ethyl group is in the ester, so the OCH2CH3 would be split into a quartet at around 4.3 ppm and a triplet at 1.3. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, a bit higher than expected. Maybe the integration is different? Or perhaps the substituent is a different group.

Now, looking at the 4.0 ppm peak, which is a broad singlet (bs) integrating for 2H. Broad suggests exchange, like NH protons. So in option D, the substituent is 4-amino, which would be an NH2 group attached to the benzene. But in the NMR, it's a broad singlet of 2H. Wait, an NH2 would typically be a broad peak, but integrating for 2H. So if the substituent is NH2, then the 4.0 ppm peak would be the NH2 protons.

But wait, in option B, the substituent is a formamide group (HCONH-Ph). The NH would be part of the formamide. Formamide has an NH group, which is typically around 5-8 ppm as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, maybe that's not matching.

Alternatively, in option D, the substituent is an amino group (NH2), which would have a broad peak. But amino groups are usually more downfield, like around 5-6 ppm for NH2 in amines. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's not NH2.

Wait another thought: the 4.0 ppm peak is 2H, broad. What other groups have 2H and a broad peak? Maybe an OCH2NH group, but not sure.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene, and NH2 also at position 4. So the NH2 would be on the benzene ring. The propionate ester would have a CH2CH2COO- group. The CH2CH2 would appear as a triplet or something else. But the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2, which would fit an ethyl group, not propyl.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The substituent is an amino group (NH2) at position 4. So the amino would have a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. That would fit the NH2 group.

But wait, the amino group is attached to the benzene. How would that appear in the NMR? The NH2 protons are typically broad and around 5-6 ppm. So seeing 4.0 ppm might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the NH is part of another group.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm is not an NH2. Let's reevaluate.

Looking at the NMR data again:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): maybe something else. Could it be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group? Or maybe a CH2 adjacent to an amide group.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 group, as in an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

So in option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the ethoxy group would explain the triplet and quartet. The formamide group would have an NH, but where would that appear?

Formamide protons (NH) typically appear around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. But in this NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So perhaps that's not matching.

In option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, with NH2 at position 4. The NH2 would have a broad peak, but if it's in the ring, it's possible to have a singlet? Unlikely since it's two protons. Wait, but in aromatic amines, the NH2 is usually exchange broadened and can appear as a singlet if the two protons are equivalent and not split by anything else.

But again, the chemical shift is more downfield. So 4.0 ppm seems a bit upfield for an NH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not an NH group but another type of CH2. Let me think about other possibilities.

Looking at the IR data: strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is the carbonyl. So it's either an amide, ester, or ketone.

Option B is a formamide, so the carbonyl is in the formamide group. The IR would show an amide I band around 1650-1680 cm-1, but the given IR is at 1720, which is higher, more like an ester or ketone. Wait, formamide's carbonyl is around 1680-1650 cm^-1. So the IR at 1720 suggests maybe an ester.

So perhaps option D is more likely. Because ethyl benzoate's carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1, which matches the IR data.

So in option D, the ester group would have the carbonyl at 1720, which fits. The ethyl ester would give the triplet and quartet in NMR. The amino group would be at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. But wait, amino groups usually are around 5-6 ppm. So that's a conflict.

Wait, but maybe the amino group is not the one giving the 4.0 ppm peak. Let me think: in option D, what else is present?

The structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: benzene ring with COOEt (ethyl ester) at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. So the substituents are at para positions.

The ethyl ester group would give the triplet (1.2 ppm, 3H) and quartet (4.5 ppm, 2H). The amino group (NH2) would be on the ring. If the NH2 is deprotonated, but in the NMR, it's in D2O? Or maybe it's exchange broadened. Alternatively, the NH2 is not showing up because it's in the aromatic region?

Wait, in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. If the substituent is an amino group, it would have 2H as NH2. But the chemical shift might be around 5 ppm, not 4. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzene with ester at position 1 and amino at position 4. So the ester is O-CO-OCH2CH3. The amino group is NH2 attached to the benzene. The amino group's protons would typically show up as a broad peak. If the solution is in D2O, the NH2 would be exchanged and not appear. But if not, it would show up as a broad peak.

But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. So maybe that's the NH2 group. But as I said, the shift seems a bit upfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is another group. Like an OCH2 group adjacent to something else.

Wait, another thought: the 4.0 ppm is not an NH2 but a CH2 group adjacent to an amide or something else. Wait, but in option D, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt.

Wait another angle: looking at the molecular formula.

The formula is C9H11NO2.

Let's calculate the molecular weight: 12*9 + 1*11 +14 +16*2 = 108 +11 +14 +32= 165 g/mol.

Looking at each option:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: benzamide is C7H7NO2. Then adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make it C9H10NO3. Wait, that can't be. Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2 (C6H5CONH2). Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would make it C9H11NO3. Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. So option A is C9H11NO3, which doesn't match. So A is not correct.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: formamide is HCONHR. Here, R is 4-ethoxyphenyl (C8H9O2). So the formula would be C9H11NO3. Again, doesn't match the given formula (C9H11NO2). So B is not correct.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: propionate is CH2CH2COO-. The benzene ring with NH2 and propionate. So structure is C6H4(NH2)(OOCCH2CH2CH3). Molecular formula: C6H5NH2 is C7H7N. Propionate is C3H6O2. So total would be C10H13NO2. But given formula is C9H11NO2. So C's formula is C10H13NO2, which doesn't match. So C is incorrect.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 at position 4. Benzoate is C7H5O2. Adding ethyl (C2H5) and NH2 (adds N and H). So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Which matches.

So D is correct.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about the NMR. Let me recheck D's NMR.

In D, the substituent is NH2 on the benzene and OCOOCH2CH3.

The ethyl ester: OCH2CH3 would give triplet at 1.2 (3H) and quartet at ~4.3 (2H).

In the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, perhaps a bit upfield. Or maybe it's the other group.

The 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. If it's the NH2, which is on the benzene ring, but typically NH2 protons are more downfield, like 5-6 ppm. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm isn't the NH2. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not present due to exchange, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is something else.

Wait, what about an OCH2 group elsewhere? Or maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an amide.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2 from the ester. But the quartet is at 4.5, which would be the OCH2.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is the CH2 from another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the CH2 adjacent to the amide group.

Wait, going back to option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3.

The formamide group has an NH that could be a broad peak. But the NH would be part of the amide, possibly split into a singlet. But the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which doesn't match. Also, the IR in option B would have a carbonyl around 1680, but the IR here is 1720, so more like ester.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the CH2 from the aminoethyl group, but that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, let's think of the NMR again. The 4.5 quartet is 2H, which would be the OCH2 of the ester. The 1.2 triplet is the CH2CH3 of the ester.

So in option D, the structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene. So the ester gives those peaks. The 4.0 ppm is probably the NH2 group. But as I thought earlier, the NH2 is typically more downfield. But perhaps in this case, the NH2 is in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not deprotonated and appears as a broad peak around 4.0.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize.

The correct structure is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720, which fits the ester.

The NMR has:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 of ester.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2 protons.

Wait, but earlier I thought NH2 is typically around 5 ppm. But perhaps in this case, the NH2 is in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, I'm so confused. Let me think about the possible structures.

Option D: benzene with OCOOCH2CH3 (ester) at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. So the OCH2CH3 in ester gives the quartet and triplet.

The NH2 is attached to the ring. The NH2 protons would be broad. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Wait, a singlet suggests that the two protons are equivalent and not split by any neighboring protons. So the NH2 would fit as a singlet if it's not split by anything else. Since it's on the ring, the NH2 is in a symmetric environment, so it's a singlet. But the shift seems a bit off. But maybe it's possible.

So the 4.0 ppm is the NH2, which is a singlet. The quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 of the ester.

The aromatic protons are in two doublets, confirming para substitution.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the given IR and 1H NMR data along with the molecular formula and the provided options.

### Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation
The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**, and the degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:

\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 9 + 2 - 11 - 2 - 1)}{2} = 3
\]

This indicates the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees of unsaturation) and additional functional groups.

### IR Data
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: Medium to strong intensity bands, characteristic of N-H stretches, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong band, indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely an ester or amide.

---

### 1H NMR Data
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, characteristic of a CH2CH3 group, likely from an ethyl group.
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, integrating for 2H, suggesting exchangeable protons, possibly from an NH2 group.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, integrating for 2H, characteristic of a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, likely part of an ethyl ester.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, each integrating for 2H, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

---

### Analysis of Options
#### **A) 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- Structure: Benzamide (CONH2) with an ethoxy group at position 3.
- The substituents (CONH2 and OCH2CH3) are meta to each other, which would result in aromatic protons that do not match the observed NMR pattern (two doublets for para substitution).
- Additionally, the molecular formula of this compound would be **C9H11NO3**, which does not match the given formula **C9H11NO2**.
- **Eliminated.**

#### **B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- Structure: Formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.
- The substituents (ethoxy and formamide) are para to each other, which could explain the aromatic NMR pattern. However, the carbonyl stretch in formamide typically appears around 1650-1680 cm⁻¹, not at 1720 cm⁻¹ as observed in the IR data.
- The molecular formula of this compound would be **C10H13NO3**, which does not match the given formula **C9H11NO2**.
- **Eliminated.**

#### **C) 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- Structure: A propionate ester (CH2CH2COO-) attached to a benzene ring with an amino group (NH2) at position 4.
- The substituents (NH2 and propionate) would not result in the observed NMR pattern, as the ethyl group (triplet and quartet) is absent, and the molecular formula would be **C10H13NO2**, which does not match the given formula **C9H11NO2**.
- **Eliminated.**

#### **D) Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- Structure: An ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3) attached to a benzene ring with an amino group (NH2) at position 4.
- The substituents (COOCH2CH3 and NH2) are para to each other, consistent with the aromatic NMR pattern (two doublets). The ethyl ester explains the triplet at 1.20 ppm and the quartet at 4.5 ppm. The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the NH2 group.
- The carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the ester functional group.
- The molecular formula **C9H11NO2** matches the given formula.
- **Correct.**

### Conclusion
The compound is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is to identify the compound C9H11NO2 based on IR and 1H NMR data. There are four options given: A, B, C, D. Each option is a different organic compound, probably something with a benzene ring and some substituents.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2n + 2 - m - x - y)/2. So n=9, m=11, O=2, N=1.

DoU = (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That can be three rings, but more likely a benzene ring (which has 3 DoU by itself: 3 double bonds or one ring plus two double bonds). So probably a benzene ring with some substituents.

Now, the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are in the region of N-H stretches. The medium to strong intensity suggests either amide or amine. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So likely an amide (which has both N-H and C=O) or maybe an ester or a ketone, but the presence of N-H makes me think amide or maybe a primary amine with a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl. The triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons, so maybe an ethoxy group or an ethyl ester.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): a broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests exchange with something, maybe NH (if it's an amine or amide) or perhaps an OCH2 group where the protons are split into a singlet. Wait, but why broad? NH would have a broad peak. So maybe it's NH adjacent to something else. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, which is deshielded, but why the broadness? Or maybe it's a methylene group (CH2) next to something else, like an ester oxygen.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): a quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests splitting into four, which occurs when a proton is next to two equivalent protons. So perhaps a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like an ethyl group. So maybe -OCH2CH2- or something similar. Wait, an ethyl ester would have the CH2 groups next to the oxygen. For example, in an ethyl ester, the structure is O-C-O-CH2CH3. Then the CH2 next to the ester oxygen would be split into a quartet. Oh wait, the quartet would be the OCH2 group in an ester. So the ethyl ester would have a triplet at around 1.2 (CH2CH3), and a quartet at around 4.1–4.3 (OCH2). But here the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than typical for OCH2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps an amide group where the CH2 is adjacent to an amide.

Then, the aromatic region:

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because two doublets, each integrating for two protons, with each as a doublet. So perhaps a para-substituted ring with two substituents, each having two protons. Wait, no. Wait, benzene has six protons. If it's para-substituted, the substituent would have two protons on each adjacent carbon. Wait, no, maybe a di-substituted ring, where each substituent is in the para position relative to each other.

Wait, no. Let me think. Let's imagine a benzene ring with two substituents. If the substituents are in para positions, then the adjacent carbons to each substituent would have two protons each. For example, if the substituents are on carbons 1 and 3, then the peaks would be as doublets.

Wait, actually, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other. So the protons on the ring would be split into two doublets. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, then the protons in positions 2 and 6 would be a doublet, and positions 3 and 5 would be another doublet. But wait, that's if the substituent is at position 4. Alternatively, if two substituents are attached in such a way that each causes the adjacent protons to be deshielded and split.

Wait, perhaps the aromatic region is showing a di-substituted benzene with substituents that are para to each other. Let's think: If the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like an ester or an amide, then the ring protons would be deshielded. Here, the peaks are at 7.0 and 8.0, which is typical for aromatic protons. The 8.0 ppm is upfield for aromatic, but amide groups or electron-withdrawing groups would cause downfield shifts.

So, the aromatic protons are in two doublets, each with two protons. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents, but wait, that would require four substituents, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. For a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is at opposite positions. So for example, if substituent A is at position 1 and substituent B is at position 3, but that's meta. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is at position 4, and another substituent is elsewhere. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that causes the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons. Like a para-substituted group. For example, if the group is in para position, the ring protons would split into two sets of doublets. Let me think: if the group is at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So their chemical shifts would be different, leading to two doublets. That fits with the NMR data: two doublets, each with two protons.

So the benzene ring has a substituent at position 4 (para to itself?), or perhaps another substituent. Wait, no. Wait, if the substituent is at position 4, and the molecule is para-substituted, then the ring has two substituents in the 4 position? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a single group at position 4, making the ring para-substituted with that group. Then the adjacent protons would be in two doublets.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an amino group or an ester group. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. So the substituents would be at 3 and 1 (if the amide is at position 1?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: structure is formamide where the amide is attached to a phenyl group which has an ethoxy at position 4. So the benzene ring has a formamide group at position 1 and an ethoxy at position 4. So that's two substituents, para to each other.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: the structure is phenyl propionate where the amino group is at position 4. So the propionate ester is at position 4, and amino is also at position 4? Wait, that can't be. Or is it 4-aminophenyl propionate, meaning the amino is at position 4, and the propionate ester is attached to the benzene ring. So the substituents are amino and ester at position 4. Then the benzene would have two substituents at position 4? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the propionate is attached to the amino group. Wait, perhaps it's a benzylamine with a propionate ester. Let me think: 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the propionate ester attached to the amino group at position 4. So the structure is O-CO-CH2CH2CH2-O-NH-C6H4-4. Hmm, but that might not fit the NMR.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: the structure is benzoate ester where the amino group is at position 4. So the ester is at position 1, and the amino group is at position 4. So the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions: the ester and the amino group.

Wait, but let me think again about each option's structure:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene. So in this case, benzamide would have the CONH2 group at position 3, and an ethoxy group at position 3? No, wait, the name is 3-ethoxybenzamide, so the ethoxy is at position 3, and the amide is attached where? Wait, the amide is on the benzene as a substituent. So benzamide would be benzene with a CONH2 group. So 3-ethoxybenzamide is benzene with CONH2 at position 1 and OCH2CH3 at position 3. So the substituents are meta to each other.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: formamide is HCONR2. Here, phenyl group is attached to the N of the formamide. So structure is HCO-NH-Ph, where Ph is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the benzene ring has an ethoxy group at position 4 and the formamide group is attached to the NH. So the substituents are at position 4 (ethoxy) and the NHCO is attached at position 1, making the substituents para to each other.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: propionate ester is CH2CH2COO-. But wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, I'm a bit confused. 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the propionate ester attached to the 4-amino phenyl group. So the structure would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the NH2 group on the benzene at position 4. So the benzene has an amino group at position 4 and the ester group also attached there? No, that can't be because that would imply two groups on the same carbon. Alternatively, perhaps it's the amino group and the ester group are attached to adjacent carbons. Not sure, but this might not fit the NMR data.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: benzoate ester is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, and the amino group is at position 4. So the substituents are on the benzene at positions 1 and 4, making them para to each other.

Now, looking back at the NMR data:

The aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each a doublet with 2H. This suggests that the benzene has two substituents which are para to each other, with each substituent causing the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

So, in the structure, the substituents are in para positions, causing the aromatic protons on the ring to be in two doublets.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: substituents are at positions 1 (CONH2) and 3 (OCH2CH3), which are meta. So the aromatic protons would give a different pattern, perhaps two doublets but not as clear as a para substitution.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: substituents are at positions 1 (formamide) and 4 (ethoxy), which are para. So that would fit the aromatic NMR.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: substituents are at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (amino), which are para. So that would also fit the aromatic NMR.

So options B and D have substituents in para positions, leading to the two doublets in the aromatic region.

Now, let's look at the other parts of the NMR.

The 4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H) and 1.20 ppm triplet (t, 3H) suggest an ethyl group. The triplet is likely the CH2CH3 group, and the quartet is the adjacent CH2, which is connected to an electronegative atom. So OCH2CH3 or NCH2CH3. But in this case, the quartet at 4.5 ppm is probably OCH2, as in an ester or ethoxy group.

Option B has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) as a substituent on the benzene. So the ethoxy would give the triplet at 1.2 (CH2CH3) and a quartet at around 4.1-4.3 for the OCH2. But the NMR shows quartet at 4.5, which is upfield a bit. Hmm.

Option D has an ethyl ester: OCH2CH3 attached to the carbonyl. So the ester group would have the OCH2CH3, giving the triplet and quartet. So in D, the substituent at position 1 is an ester group (O-CO-OCH2CH3?), wait no, ethyl benzoate is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene. So the ethyl group is in the ester, so the OCH2CH3 would be split into a quartet at around 4.3 ppm and a triplet at 1.3. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, a bit higher than expected. Maybe the integration is different? Or perhaps the substituent is a different group.

Now, looking at the 4.0 ppm peak, which is a broad singlet (bs) integrating for 2H. Broad suggests exchange, like NH protons. So in option D, the substituent is 4-amino, which would be an NH2 group attached to the benzene. But in the NMR, it's a broad singlet of 2H. Wait, an NH2 would typically be a broad peak, but integrating for 2H. So if the substituent is NH2, then the 4.0 ppm peak would be the NH2 protons.

But wait, in option B, the substituent is a formamide group (HCONH-Ph). The NH would be part of the formamide. Formamide has an NH group, which is typically around 5-8 ppm as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Hmm, maybe that's not matching.

Alternatively, in option D, the substituent is an amino group (NH2), which would have a broad peak. But amino groups are usually more downfield, like around 5-6 ppm for NH2 in amines. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's not NH2.

Wait another thought: the 4.0 ppm peak is 2H, broad. What other groups have 2H and a broad peak? Maybe an OCH2NH group, but not sure.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The structure would be O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene, and NH2 also at position 4. So the NH2 would be on the benzene ring. The propionate ester would have a CH2CH2COO- group. The CH2CH2 would appear as a triplet or something else. But the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2, which would fit an ethyl group, not propyl.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The substituent is an amino group (NH2) at position 4. So the amino would have a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. That would fit the NH2 group.

But wait, the amino group is attached to the benzene. How would that appear in the NMR? The NH2 protons are typically broad and around 5-6 ppm. So seeing 4.0 ppm might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the NH is part of another group.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm is not an NH2. Let's reevaluate.

Looking at the NMR data again:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): maybe something else. Could it be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group? Or maybe a CH2 adjacent to an amide group.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 group, as in an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

So in option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3. So the ethoxy group would explain the triplet and quartet. The formamide group would have an NH, but where would that appear?

Formamide protons (NH) typically appear around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. But in this NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. So perhaps that's not matching.

In option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, with NH2 at position 4. The NH2 would have a broad peak, but if it's in the ring, it's possible to have a singlet? Unlikely since it's two protons. Wait, but in aromatic amines, the NH2 is usually exchange broadened and can appear as a singlet if the two protons are equivalent and not split by anything else.

But again, the chemical shift is more downfield. So 4.0 ppm seems a bit upfield for an NH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not an NH group but another type of CH2. Let me think about other possibilities.

Looking at the IR data: strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is the carbonyl. So it's either an amide, ester, or ketone.

Option B is a formamide, so the carbonyl is in the formamide group. The IR would show an amide I band around 1650-1680 cm-1, but the given IR is at 1720, which is higher, more like an ester or ketone. Wait, formamide's carbonyl is around 1680-1650 cm^-1. So the IR at 1720 suggests maybe an ester.

So perhaps option D is more likely. Because ethyl benzoate's carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1, which matches the IR data.

So in option D, the ester group would have the carbonyl at 1720, which fits. The ethyl ester would give the triplet and quartet in NMR. The amino group would be at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet. But wait, amino groups usually are around 5-6 ppm. So that's a conflict.

Wait, but maybe the amino group is not the one giving the 4.0 ppm peak. Let me think: in option D, what else is present?

The structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: benzene ring with COOEt (ethyl ester) at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. So the substituents are at para positions.

The ethyl ester group would give the triplet (1.2 ppm, 3H) and quartet (4.5 ppm, 2H). The amino group (NH2) would be on the ring. If the NH2 is deprotonated, but in the NMR, it's in D2O? Or maybe it's exchange broadened. Alternatively, the NH2 is not showing up because it's in the aromatic region?

Wait, in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. If the substituent is an amino group, it would have 2H as NH2. But the chemical shift might be around 5 ppm, not 4. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzene with ester at position 1 and amino at position 4. So the ester is O-CO-OCH2CH3. The amino group is NH2 attached to the benzene. The amino group's protons would typically show up as a broad peak. If the solution is in D2O, the NH2 would be exchanged and not appear. But if not, it would show up as a broad peak.

But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. So maybe that's the NH2 group. But as I said, the shift seems a bit upfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is another group. Like an OCH2 group adjacent to something else.

Wait, another thought: the 4.0 ppm is not an NH2 but a CH2 group adjacent to an amide or something else. Wait, but in option D, the substituents are NH2 and COOEt.

Wait another angle: looking at the molecular formula.

The formula is C9H11NO2.

Let's calculate the molecular weight: 12*9 + 1*11 +14 +16*2 = 108 +11 +14 +32= 165 g/mol.

Looking at each option:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: benzamide is C7H7NO2. Then adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make it C9H10NO3. Wait, that can't be. Wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2 (C6H5CONH2). Adding an ethoxy (OCH2CH3) would make it C9H11NO3. Wait, but the formula given is C9H11NO2. So option A is C9H11NO3, which doesn't match. So A is not correct.

B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: formamide is HCONHR. Here, R is 4-ethoxyphenyl (C8H9O2). So the formula would be C9H11NO3. Again, doesn't match the given formula (C9H11NO2). So B is not correct.

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: propionate is CH2CH2COO-. The benzene ring with NH2 and propionate. So structure is C6H4(NH2)(OOCCH2CH2CH3). Molecular formula: C6H5NH2 is C7H7N. Propionate is C3H6O2. So total would be C10H13NO2. But given formula is C9H11NO2. So C's formula is C10H13NO2, which doesn't match. So C is incorrect.

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 at position 4. Benzoate is C7H5O2. Adding ethyl (C2H5) and NH2 (adds N and H). So the formula would be C9H11NO2. Which matches.

So D is correct.

Wait, but earlier I was confused about the NMR. Let me recheck D's NMR.

In D, the substituent is NH2 on the benzene and OCOOCH2CH3.

The ethyl ester: OCH2CH3 would give triplet at 1.2 (3H) and quartet at ~4.3 (2H).

In the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5, perhaps a bit upfield. Or maybe it's the other group.

The 4.0 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. If it's the NH2, which is on the benzene ring, but typically NH2 protons are more downfield, like 5-6 ppm. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm isn't the NH2. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not present due to exchange, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is something else.

Wait, what about an OCH2 group elsewhere? Or maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an amide.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2 from the ester. But the quartet is at 4.5, which would be the OCH2.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is the CH2 from another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the CH2 adjacent to the amide group.

Wait, going back to option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is HCONH-Ph-OCH2CH3.

The formamide group has an NH that could be a broad peak. But the NH would be part of the amide, possibly split into a singlet. But the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which doesn't match. Also, the IR in option B would have a carbonyl around 1680, but the IR here is 1720, so more like ester.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the CH2 from the aminoethyl group, but that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, let's think of the NMR again. The 4.5 quartet is 2H, which would be the OCH2 of the ester. The 1.2 triplet is the CH2CH3 of the ester.

So in option D, the structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3 attached to benzene. So the ester gives those peaks. The 4.0 ppm is probably the NH2 group. But as I thought earlier, the NH2 is typically more downfield. But perhaps in this case, the NH2 is in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not deprotonated and appears as a broad peak around 4.0.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize.

The correct structure is option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720, which fits the ester.

The NMR has:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): ethyl.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): OCH2 of ester.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): NH2 protons.

Wait, but earlier I thought NH2 is typically around 5 ppm. But perhaps in this case, the NH2 is in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe it's a different group.

Wait, I'm so confused. Let me think about the possible structures.

Option D: benzene with OCOOCH2CH3 (ester) at position 1 and NH2 at position 4. So the OCH2CH3 in ester gives the quartet and triplet.

The NH2 is attached to the ring. The NH2 protons would be broad. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Wait, a singlet suggests that the two protons are equivalent and not split by any neighboring protons. So the NH2 would fit as a singlet if it's not split by anything else. Since it's on the ring, the NH2 is in a symmetric environment, so it's a singlet. But the shift seems a bit off. But maybe it's possible.

So the 4.0 ppm is the NH2, which is a singlet. The quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 of the ester.

The aromatic protons are in two doublets, confirming para substitution.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.


To identify the compound C9H11NO2, we analyze the given IR and 1H NMR data along with the molecular formula and the provided options.

### Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation
The molecular formula is **C9H11NO2**, and the degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:

\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 9 + 2 - 11 - 2 - 1)}{2} = 3
\]

This indicates the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees of unsaturation) and additional functional groups.
