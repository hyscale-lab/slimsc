Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done some knock-out experiments and are testing the resistance levels. The results are given, and we have to figure out the interactions between the genes G1, G2, and G3.

First, let's parse the information. We have three single mutants: g1, g2, g3. The resistance levels are 75%, 0%, and 50% respectively. Then, the double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, g2g3 is 0%, and g1g2 is 0%.

The question says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are regulatory proteins that control the expression of other genes. If a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes it regulates won't be expressed, which would affect the phenotype.

In the mutants, if a gene is a transcription factor, its knockout would lead to a more severe phenotype because it's not activating other genes. So, a gene being a transcription factor would have a big effect on the resistance, probably a higher susceptibility (lower resistance) because without the transcription factor, the downstream genes aren't activated to fight the disease.

Looking at the data:

- g1 has 75% resistance. So, it's less resistant than the wild type (100%) but not completely susceptible. So, maybe G1 is not the main transcription factor, or perhaps it's one of the downstream genes.

- g2 has 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So, G2's product is probably crucial. The plant can't resist the pathogen at all when G2 is knocked out. This suggests that G2 might be acting upstream, perhaps as a transcription factor. Because without it, the downstream resistance genes aren't activated.

- g3 has 50% resistance. So, it's still half as resistant. Not as severe as g2, but worse than g1.

So, considering that, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor because its knockout leads to complete susceptibility. But I'm not sure yet. Let's see the double mutants.

The double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% resistance. Both G1 and G2 are knocked out. Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking out G2 would already give 0% resistance. So, adding g1 doesn't change the result, which makes sense because if the pathway is already non-functional due to G2 knockout, adding another mutation won't make it worse.

- g1g3: 10% resistance. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is lower than either single mutant. G1 alone was 75%, G3 alone was 50%, and together it's 10%. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be involved in the same pathway, perhaps acting redundantly or in a linear pathway. Let me think about what that would mean.

- g2g3: 0% resistance. Hmm, but g2 alone is already 0%, so adding g3 doesn't change it. So, it's the same as g2. So, again, G2 is the main factor here.

Wait, what about epistasis? Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of gene B's mutations depends on the presence of gene A.

Alternatively, if gene B is epistatic to gene A, then the effect of A is dependent on B.

In the results, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% resistance. Neither single mutant has 10% on their own. So, the double mutant is worse than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in parallel pathways contributing to resistance, perhaps. Alternatively, G3 could be downstream of G1, but that doesn't quite fit because in the double mutant, the resistance is lower than G3 alone.

Wait, if G3 is downstream of G1, then knocking out both would be the same as knocking out G1 (if G3 is downstream and doesn't contribute anything when G1 is already knocked out). But in this case, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 could be acting in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, without G1, the other pathway (maybe via G3) can take over. But if both are knocked out, that pathway is gone, leading to worse resistance.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So, maybe each contributes a portion. If they are additive, then the double mutant would be 75 +50? No, that's not how it's working. The double mutant is 10% which is lower than either. Hmm, perhaps they're in the same pathway, but maybe in a redundant way.

Wait, redundancy: if two genes are redundant, each can perform the same function. So, knocking out one doesn't cause a problem, but knocking out both leads to a problem.

Wait, in this case, the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance. If they were redundant, each could compensate for the other. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out G1 would leave G3 to function, and vice versa. But in the double mutant, neither is present, so the resistance drops more.

But looking at the data, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than both singles. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would lead to a much worse phenotype than either single. So that fits. So, that suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant, each contributing to the same function.

But how does this tie into the transcription factor?

Earlier, I thought that G2 might be the transcription factor because its knockout leads to 0% resistance. So, if G2 is a transcription factor, it might be activating G1 and G3. So, if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but in the mutant g1, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2, which is 0%. So, that would suggest that G1 is not downstream of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then knockout of G2 would also knockout G1, leading to G1's resistance. But g1's resistance is 75%, while g2 is 0%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps G2 is not upstream of G1, but maybe G2 is upstream of another factor, not G1 directly.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream of it. Wait, but the double mutant g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So, if g2 is already 0%, then adding g1 doesn't change it. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2.

Wait, let me think about epistatic relationships. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the mutant phenotype of gene B depends on the presence of gene A. So, for example, if A is epistatic to B, then a mutation in B only shows its phenotype when A is functional.

In the case of the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% (same as g2). So, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is already 0%. So, adding the knockout of G1 doesn't affect the resistance. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Because the pathway is blocked at G2, so G1's function isn't even needed. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the effect of G1's knockout is only seen when G2 is functional.

Wait, but in the single mutant g1, the resistance is 75%. So, when G2 is functional (wild type), knocking out G1 reduces resistance to 75%. But when G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%, regardless of G1's status. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 because the phenotype of G1's mutation is only visible when G2 is present. Without G2, the effect is more severe.

Hmm, so that would mean G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, looking at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, it's worse than either single. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, knocking out both would lead to a much worse phenotype.

So, for the epistatic relationships:

- G2 is epistatic to G1 (because knocking out G2 leads to a worse phenotype than G1, and the double mutant g1g2 is same as g2).

Similarly, looking at the double mutant g2g3: 0% (same as g2). So, knocking out G3 in the g2 background doesn't change the resistance. So, perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, or G2 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, in the single mutant g3, resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75% but better than g2's 0%. So, perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, because knocking out G2 leads to a worse phenotype. Or maybe G3 is in a separate pathway.

But in the double mutant g2g3, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, when G2 is knocked out, adding G3's knockout doesn't change anything. So, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Because without G2, the effect of G3's knockout is masked; the resistance is already at 0%, so adding G3's mutation doesn't make it worse.

So, from this, it seems that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So, G2 is acting upstream of both.

But wait, in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, suggesting that they function in parallel pathways. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but in separate pathways.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the single mutants, when G2 is present, knocking out G1 leaves G3 functional, leading to 75% resistance. Similarly, knocking out G3 leaves G1 functional, leading to 50% resistance.

Wait, but that doesn't quite fit because in the single mutant g3, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So, maybe G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

So, G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. So, knocking out G1 would leave G3 to contribute 50% resistance, but wait, no. Because in the single mutant g1, you have 75% resistance, which is better than g3's 50%. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is not activating G1 and G3 directly but is part of a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but in a linear pathway.

Wait, another approach: think about what each mutant's resistance level tells us.

G2 knockout (g2) is 0%: so without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all. So, G2 must be necessary for the resistance. So, G2 is essential for the resistance pathway.

G1 knockout (g1) is 75%: so without G1, the plant has 75% resistance. That's a 25% reduction. So, G1 contributes, but the pathway can function a bit without it.

G3 knockout (g3) is 50%: so without G3, the plant is 50% resistant. So, G3 is more critical than G1.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g2: 0%: same as g2. So, when you have both G1 and G2 knocked out, it's the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G1's function is only needed when G2 is present. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is knocked out, G1 isn't needed because the pathway is already blocked upstream.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So, knocking out G3 in a g2 background doesn't change the resistance. So, G3's function is only needed when G2 is present.

So, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes (G1 and G3) don't matter.

Now, looking at the g1g3 double mutant: 10% resistance.

In the g1g3 mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, what's the resistance? 10%.

If G2 is upstream, then in the presence of G2 (i.e., in the wild type), both G1 and G3 are contributing. So, without G1, G3 is still active (g1: 75%), and without G3, G1 is active (g3: 50%). So, that suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to the resistance.

So, when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance drops to 10%. So, the combined effect is much worse than either single mutant. So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant but are working in parallel pathways.

Wait, but what if they are redundant? If they are redundant, then knocking out either would have the same effect, but knocking out both would be worse. But in this case, the single mutants have different resistances: G1 knockout is 75%, G3's is 50%. So, if they were redundant, knocking out either should have the same effect. But they don't. So, that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, but that doesn't seem to fit. Let me think.

In a linear pathway, G2 activates G1, which then activates G3. So, if G1 is knocked out, G3 isn't expressed. But that's not the case here because in the single mutant g3, the resistance is 50% (so G3's product is still being made, since g3 is a knockout of G3).

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are expressed.

In the single mutants:

- g1: G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. So, resistance is 75% (maybe G3 contributes more or both contribute).

Wait, but without G1, the resistance is 75% (g1). But g3 has 50% resistance. So, without G3, the resistance is worse than without G1. So, maybe G1 is more important than G3, or they contribute differently.

If G2 is the transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. But in the presence of G2, that's not possible because G2 is still active. Wait, no: the double mutant g1g3 is the case where both G1 and G3 are knocked out. G2 is still functional because the mutation is only in G1 and G3.

So, G2 is still active, so if G2 activates downstream genes, but without G1 and G3, those downstream genes can't be expressed. So, the resistance is low.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates a downstream gene (let's say D), which in turn activates another layer. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to model this. Let's say:

G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

G1 and G3 are also transcription factors, each activating a set of downstream genes that contribute to resistance.

In the single mutants:

- g1: G1 is knocked out. So, G2 still activates G3. So, G3 is expressed and can activate its downstream genes. Resistance is 75%.

- g3: G3 is knocked out. So, G2 activates G1. So, G1 is expressed, leading to some resistance (50%).

- g2: G2 is knocked out. So, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. Resistance is 0%.

In the double mutants:

- g1g2: G1 and G2 are knocked out. So, G3 is not expressed (since G2 is needed for its expression). So, resistance is 0%, same as g2.

- g3g2: G3 and G2 are knocked out. G1 isn't expressed either, since G2 is needed. So, resistance is 0%.

- g1g3: G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional. So, G2 would activate... wait, but G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, perhaps G2 is trying to activate other downstream genes, but maybe those are not enough. So, resistance is 10% (very low).

Wait, but in this model, the double mutant g1g3 would have G2 active, but without G1 and G3, what happens? If G2 is a transcription factor for other genes downstream of G1 and G3, then without G1 and G3, those downstream genes might not be active because G2 can't activate them. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are intermediaries.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not part of the same pathway. Maybe G2 is upstream of some pathway that includes G1, and another independent pathway that includes G3. So, both pathways contribute to resistance.

In the double mutant g1g3, both pathways are disrupted, leading to a very low resistance (10%).

So, now, looking back at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, if G1 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would affect downstream genes. But according to the data, G2's knockout is worse than G1's, which is worse than G3's. So, maybe G2 is the transcription factor, not G1.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would mean they're coregulated, perhaps. But the data doesn't directly suggest that. Also, G3 epistatic to G1 would require that G1's effect is only seen when G3 is present. Not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means that a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that each can perform the same function. So, knocking out one doesn't affect the phenotype, but knocking out both does. In our case, the single mutants have different resistances, so redundancy might not fit.

Wait, but in the g1g3 double mutant, their combined resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So, if they were redundant, knocking out both would be worse than either single. So that fits. But in that case, the single mutants would have the same resistance if they are redundant. But g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, which are different. So, that suggests they are not redundant.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Another approach: what defines epistatic relationships? If two genes are in the same pathway, their epistatic relationships can tell us about the order.

In the case of the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is upstream of G3, then the double mutant would be as severe as the more downstream mutation. For example, if G1 is upstream of G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would be the same as g3. But in our case, the double is worse than either. So, that suggests they are in separate pathways.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both activated by G2.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways leading to resistance, both activated by G2. So, if either G1 or G3 is functional, some resistance is present. But if both are knocked out, resistance is minimal.

So, that would explain why the double mutant g1g3 is 10%: both pathways are disrupted.

In that case, G2 is the transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways.

Now, the question is, which option fits this?

Looking back at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, others pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. No, because if G2 is epistatic to G1, G1's effect is only seen when G2 is present. So, in g1, which has G2 functional, the resistance is 75%. But if G2 is a TF for G1, then knocking out G2 would mean G1 isn't expressed, but in reality, g1 has 75% resistance, so G1 must be expressed.

So, this suggests that G1 is not downstream of G2. So, option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so same regulation), G3 epistatic to G1.

If G1 and G3 have the same promoter, they are coregulated. So, knocking out G1 wouldn't affect G3's expression. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, g3 has 50%, and g1g3 has 10%. So, they are not coregulated, as their expression levels are different.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy would mean G1 and G3 affect multiple traits. Not sure. Also, G1 epistatic to G3 would mean that the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present.

Hmm, in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then without G1, the effect of G3's knockout is seen. But in g3, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than the wild type. So, maybe G1 being present can compensate for G3's knockout? Not sure.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy means that either gene can perform the same function. So, in the double mutant, you lose both, leading to a worse phenotype.

But in our case, the single mutants have different resistances (g1:75%, g3:50%), which suggests they're not redundant. So, this might not fit.

Wait, but perhaps the redundancy is in their functions, not in their expression levels. So, perhaps each can contribute to resistance in a way that is not additive. For example, in the presence of either G1 or G3, some resistance is maintained, but when both are knocked out, resistance is severely compromised.

In that case, the single mutants would have partial resistance, and the double mutant would be much worse. But in this case, the single mutants have different resistances (g1 is better than g3), so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing, but not redundant. So, knocking out either reduces resistance, but knocking out both reduces it further.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are additive, but not redundant. So, the double mutant's resistance is worse than either single, but it's not about redundancy.

But looking back at the options, none of them explicitly state additive effects. Let's review the options again.

Option D says gene redundancy. If they have redundancy, their single mutants would have the same phenotype, but that's not the case here. So, perhaps D is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but I don't think that's relevant here. Maybe it's a distractor.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would mean that G1 and G3 are co-regulated. But in the data, their single mutants have different resistances, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Back to the epistatic relationships.

In the double mutant g1g2: 0% (same as g2). So, the presence of a G1 knockout in a g2 background doesn't change resistance. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's mutation masks the effect of G1's mutation.

Similarly, in the double mutant g3g2: 0% (same as g2), so G2 is epistatic to G3.

In the double mutant g1g3: 10% (worse than either single). So, G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but their effects are additive or in parallel.

So, putting it all together, G2 is a transcription factor, epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both contributing to resistance when G2 is present. So, knocking out both leads to the most severe phenotype.

Looking at the options:

Option A says G1 is TF. No, because G2's knockout is worse, so G2 is more likely the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. So, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance would be same as g3. But in our case, it's worse. So, B doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure about pleiotropy here. Also, G1 epistatic to G3. If G1 is epistatic, then in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance would be same as g1. But our data shows 10%, worse than either. So, this doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3. Redundancy would require that single mutants have same resistance, which they don't. So, D doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G2 is upstream. So, if G2 is a transcription factor activating G1, which in turn activates G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would be same as g1. But in our data, it's worse, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. So, each contributes to resistance when G2 is present.

In that scenario, G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but their effects are additive or synergistic.

So, looking at the options, the only one that mentions G2 as TF and G1 and G3 in some relationship is option D and C.

But the only options that have G2 as TF are A, B, C, D.

So, looking for which option fits.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But gene redundancy would mean that g1 and g3 have same resistance, which is not the case here.

Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the epistatic relationships.

Wait, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning that G3's effect is only seen when G1 is present. So, in the double mutant g1g3, since G1 is knocked out, G3's effect isn't seen either, leading to a more severe phenotype than either single.

But in our data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both singles (75% and 50%). So, that suggests that G1 and G3 contribute in a way that their combined knockout is more severe than either alone, which could happen if they're in parallel pathways.

So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking for an option that says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (so their effects are additive), and G2 is epistatic to both.

Which option says that? Let's look again.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3. Doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

No, because pleiotropy isn't about the same trait.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1.

Wait, earlier I thought G2 is more likely the TF because its knockout is worse. But option A says G1 is the TF. Let me think.

If G1 is a TF, then knocking it out would lead to downstream genes not being expressed. So, g1's resistance would be lower than wild type. So, g1 is 75% resistance. So, perhaps some downstream genes are still active, leading to 75% resistance.

But in this case, G2's knockout (g2:0%) is worse. So, if G1 is the TF, why is G2's knockout worse? That suggests that G2 is acting downstream of G1, which doesn't make sense. Because if G1 is a TF, then without G1, G2 wouldn't be expressed. But that's not the case, since in g1, G2 is present and the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2's 0%.

Wait, perhaps G2 is downstream of G1. So, G1 is the TF, activates G2, which then activates other genes. So, when G1 is knocked out (g1), G2 isn't expressed. But the resistance is 75%, so perhaps G2 isn't the only gene downstream of G1.

But then, in the double mutant g1g2, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, when G1 is knocked out, G2 isn't expressed. So, in the double mutant, it's same as g2. But that would suggest that G2's downstream effects are worse than G1's.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by process of elimination.

Looking at the answer options, the correct answer is likely option A or D.

Wait, another approach: which option correctly describes the epistatic relationships?

We have:

- G2 is epistatic to G1 because g1g2 is same as g2.

- G2 is epistatic to G3 because g2g3 is same as g2.

So, both G1 and G3 are epistatic downstream of G2. So, G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So, yes.

Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1. No, because in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, worse than g3's 50%.

Wait, if G3 were epistatic to G1, then the double mutant g1g3 would show the same resistance as the more severe single mutant. But g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So, that suggests G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but are acting in parallel.

So, option B is incorrect.

Option C: G1 is epistatic to G3. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1 (75%). But in our case, it's 10%, so incorrect.

Option D: G1 is epistatic to G3. So, same logic as above; incorrect.

So, the only option that correctly says G2 is epistatic to G1 is option A and perhaps option D, but I'm not sure about D.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but earlier we thought that G2 is the transcription factor, not G1. So, if option A says G1 is TF, but the data suggests G2's knockout is worse, which would imply G2 is TF. So, perhaps option A is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would require that the single mutants have the same resistance, which they don't. So, D is incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because in option A, G2 is epistatic to G1. So, G2 is upstream of G1. But earlier analysis suggested that G2 is a transcription factor, but option A says G1 is a TF.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, because G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, which would suggest that G2 is a TF, as without it, the downstream genes aren't expressed. So, option A says G1 is TF, but that would mean G2 is downstream.

But in the single mutant g1, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2's 0%. So, that's inconsistent with G2 being downstream of G1.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's description.

Option A: G1 is TF. So, G1 activates some genes. G2 and G3 are downstream. G2 is epistatic to G1, meaning that G1's effect is only seen when G2 is present. But in g1, G2 is present, so G1's knockout would show the effect. But in g1, resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2's 0%. So, that suggests that in the absence of G1, G2's function is still 75% effective, which doesn't make sense if G1 is upstream.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. If G2 is a TF that activates G1, which in turn activates other genes. So, in g2, G1 is not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in g1, G2 is present and activates other downstream genes (not G1), leading to 75% resistance.

But then, G2 would be epistatic to G1. Hmm.

In this scenario, G2 is a TF activating G1 and possibly other genes. So, in g1, G2 is still functional and activates other genes, leading to 75% resistance. In g2, G2 is knocked out, so G1 isn't expressed, and other genes downstream of G2 (other than G1) might not be enough to provide resistance, leading to 0%.

But then, G1 is a TF as well, so in g1, G1 is knocked out, so the downstream genes of G1 wouldn't be expressed. But if G2 is also activating other genes, that's possible.

In the double mutant g1g2, G2 is knocked out, so G1 isn't expressed either. Resistance is 0%, same as g2.

In the double mutant g1g3: G1 and G3 are knocked out. But G2 is present, so if G2 activates other genes (like G3?), maybe G3's downstream genes are not enough. So, the resistance is 10%.

But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another angle: which option correctly states that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3?

Looking at the options, only options A and B have G2 as epistatic, but option A says G1 is TF, which we think is incorrect.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But, gene redundancy would mean that g1 and g3 have the same resistance, which they don't. So, that doesn't fit.

I think I've gone as far as I can. Given the data, G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream but in separate pathways. The double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, suggesting their contributions are additive.

Looking at the options, the one that says G2 is TF and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (but not necessarily redundant or pleiotropic) is probably not directly stated. However, option C says G1 is epistatic to G3. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either, which suggests they're not epistatic but additive.

Given all that, the only option that correctly identifies G2 as TF and G2 as epistatic to G1 and G3 is option A and maybe none of them correctly. Wait, looking back.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, if G2 is epistatic to G1, that fits with the data where the double mutant g1g2 has the same resistance as g2. So, regardless of G1's presence, when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

But the question says at least one is a TF. So, if G1 is the TF, but in the data, g2 has 0% resistance, which is worse. So, if G1 is the TF, then why is g2 worse than g1g2?

Hmm, I'm not confident, but I think the correct answer is option A. Because g2 is epistatic to g1, so G2 is epistatic, and G1 is a TF.

Wait, but in the data, G2's knockout is worse than G1's, which implies that G2 is more upstream. So, perhaps G1 is a TF, and G2 is downstream. But that doesn't explain why g2 is worse.

I'm getting stuck, but the correct answer is likely option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct, but I'm not confident.

The question involves determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants and their role in resistance to anthracnose. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer gene function and interactions.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (partial loss of resistance).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (complete loss of resistance).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderate loss of resistance).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

3. **Inferences**:
   - **G2 is critical**: The complete loss of resistance in g2 suggests G2 is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes.
   - **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**: The resistance of g1g2 and g2g3 is the same as g2, indicating that G2 masks the effects of G1 and G3 when knocked out.
   - **G1 and G3 are downstream**: The resistance levels of g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) suggest they contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2.
   - **G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways**: The resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, indicating their contributions are additive rather than redundant.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. This is inconsistent with the data because G2's knockout (g2) results in 0% resistance, which is worse than G1's knockout (g1: 75%), suggesting G2, not G1, is the transcription factor.

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1. The data does not support the idea that G1 and G3 have the same promoter, as their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). Additionally, G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the data does not support pleiotropy for G1 and G3. Furthermore, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Gene redundancy is inconsistent with the data because the single mutants g1 and g3 have different resistance levels (75% and 50%, respectively). Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in separate pathways, as their combined knockout (g1g3) results in a resistance level worse than either single mutant. None of the options perfectly fit the data, but **Option A** comes closest by correctly identifying G2 as epistatic to G1, even though it incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about gene interactions in white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They've done some knock-out experiments and are testing the resistance levels. The results are given, and we have to figure out the interactions between the genes G1, G2, and G3.

First, let's parse the information. We have three single mutants: g1, g2, g3. The resistance levels are 75%, 0%, and 50% respectively. Then, the double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, g2g3 is 0%, and g1g2 is 0%.

The question says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are regulatory proteins that control the expression of other genes. If a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes it regulates won't be expressed, which would affect the phenotype.

In the mutants, if a gene is a transcription factor, its knockout would lead to a more severe phenotype because it's not activating other genes. So, a gene being a transcription factor would have a big effect on the resistance, probably a higher susceptibility (lower resistance) because without the transcription factor, the downstream genes aren't activated to fight the disease.

Looking at the data:

- g1 has 75% resistance. So, it's less resistant than the wild type (100%) but not completely susceptible. So, maybe G1 is not the main transcription factor, or perhaps it's one of the downstream genes.

- g2 has 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So, G2's product is probably crucial. The plant can't resist the pathogen at all when G2 is knocked out. This suggests that G2 might be acting upstream, perhaps as a transcription factor. Because without it, the downstream resistance genes aren't activated.

- g3 has 50% resistance. So, it's still half as resistant. Not as severe as g2, but worse than g1.

So, considering that, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor because its knockout leads to complete susceptibility. But I'm not sure yet. Let's see the double mutants.

The double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% resistance. Both G1 and G2 are knocked out. Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking out G2 would already give 0% resistance. So, adding g1 doesn't change the result, which makes sense because if the pathway is already non-functional due to G2 knockout, adding another mutation won't make it worse.

- g1g3: 10% resistance. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is lower than either single mutant. G1 alone was 75%, G3 alone was 50%, and together it's 10%. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be involved in the same pathway, perhaps acting redundantly or in a linear pathway. Let me think about what that would mean.

- g2g3: 0% resistance. Hmm, but g2 alone is already 0%, so adding g3 doesn't change it. So, it's the same as g2. So, again, G2 is the main factor here.

Wait, what about epistasis? Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of gene B's mutations depends on the presence of gene A.

Alternatively, if gene B is epistatic to gene A, then the effect of A is dependent on B.

In the results, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% resistance. Neither single mutant has 10% on their own. So, the double mutant is worse than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in parallel pathways contributing to resistance, perhaps. Alternatively, G3 could be downstream of G1, but that doesn't quite fit because in the double mutant, the resistance is lower than G3 alone.

Wait, if G3 is downstream of G1, then knocking out both would be the same as knocking out G1 (if G3 is downstream and doesn't contribute anything when G1 is already knocked out). But in this case, the double mutant is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 could be acting in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, without G1, the other pathway (maybe via G3) can take over. But if both are knocked out, that pathway is gone, leading to worse resistance.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So, maybe each contributes a portion. If they are additive, then the double mutant would be 75 +50? No, that's not how it's working. The double mutant is 10% which is lower than either. Hmm, perhaps they're in the same pathway, but maybe in a redundant way.

Wait, redundancy: if two genes are redundant, each can perform the same function. So, knocking out one doesn't cause a problem, but knocking out both leads to a problem.

Wait, in this case, the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance. If they were redundant, each could compensate for the other. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out G1 would leave G3 to function, and vice versa. But in the double mutant, neither is present, so the resistance drops more.

But looking at the data, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than both singles. So, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would lead to a much worse phenotype than either single. So that fits. So, that suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant, each contributing to the same function.

But how does this tie into the transcription factor?

Earlier, I thought that G2 might be the transcription factor because its knockout leads to 0% resistance. So, if G2 is a transcription factor, it might be activating G1 and G3. So, if G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 would be expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but in the mutant g1, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2, which is 0%. So, that would suggest that G1 is not downstream of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then knockout of G2 would also knockout G1, leading to G1's resistance. But g1's resistance is 75%, while g2 is 0%, which is worse. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps G2 is not upstream of G1, but maybe G2 is upstream of another factor, not G1 directly.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream of it. Wait, but the double mutant g1g2 is 0%, same as g2. So, if g2 is already 0%, then adding g1 doesn't change it. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2.

Wait, let me think about epistatic relationships. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the mutant phenotype of gene B depends on the presence of gene A. So, for example, if A is epistatic to B, then a mutation in B only shows its phenotype when A is functional.

In the case of the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% (same as g2). So, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is already 0%. So, adding the knockout of G1 doesn't affect the resistance. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Because the pathway is blocked at G2, so G1's function isn't even needed. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the effect of G1's knockout is only seen when G2 is functional.

Wait, but in the single mutant g1, the resistance is 75%. So, when G2 is functional (wild type), knocking out G1 reduces resistance to 75%. But when G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%, regardless of G1's status. So, G2 is epistatic to G1 because the phenotype of G1's mutation is only visible when G2 is present. Without G2, the effect is more severe.

Hmm, so that would mean G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, looking at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, it's worse than either single. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So, knocking out both would lead to a much worse phenotype.

So, for the epistatic relationships:

- G2 is epistatic to G1 (because knocking out G2 leads to a worse phenotype than G1, and the double mutant g1g2 is same as g2).

Similarly, looking at the double mutant g2g3: 0% (same as g2). So, knocking out G3 in the g2 background doesn't change the resistance. So, perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, or G2 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, in the single mutant g3, resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75% but better than g2's 0%. So, perhaps G3 is downstream of G2, because knocking out G2 leads to a worse phenotype. Or maybe G3 is in a separate pathway.

But in the double mutant g2g3, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, when G2 is knocked out, adding G3's knockout doesn't change anything. So, G2 is epistatic to G3 as well.

Because without G2, the effect of G3's knockout is masked; the resistance is already at 0%, so adding G3's mutation doesn't make it worse.

So, from this, it seems that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So, G2 is acting upstream of both.

But wait, in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either, suggesting that they function in parallel pathways. So, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but in separate pathways.

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, when G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the single mutants, when G2 is present, knocking out G1 leaves G3 functional, leading to 75% resistance. Similarly, knocking out G3 leaves G1 functional, leading to 50% resistance.

Wait, but that doesn't quite fit because in the single mutant g3, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So, maybe G1 contributes more to resistance than G3.

So, G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. So, knocking out G1 would leave G3 to contribute 50% resistance, but wait, no. Because in the single mutant g1, you have 75% resistance, which is better than g3's 50%. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is not activating G1 and G3 directly but is part of a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but in a linear pathway.

Wait, another approach: think about what each mutant's resistance level tells us.

G2 knockout (g2) is 0%: so without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all. So, G2 must be necessary for the resistance. So, G2 is essential for the resistance pathway.

G1 knockout (g1) is 75%: so without G1, the plant has 75% resistance. That's a 25% reduction. So, G1 contributes, but the pathway can function a bit without it.

G3 knockout (g3) is 50%: so without G3, the plant is 50% resistant. So, G3 is more critical than G1.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g2: 0%: same as g2. So, when you have both G1 and G2 knocked out, it's the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G1's function is only needed when G2 is present. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is knocked out, G1 isn't needed because the pathway is already blocked upstream.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So, knocking out G3 in a g2 background doesn't change the resistance. So, G3's function is only needed when G2 is present.

So, G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes (G1 and G3) don't matter.

Now, looking at the g1g3 double mutant: 10% resistance.

In the g1g3 mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, what's the resistance? 10%.

If G2 is upstream, then in the presence of G2 (i.e., in the wild type), both G1 and G3 are contributing. So, without G1, G3 is still active (g1: 75%), and without G3, G1 is active (g3: 50%). So, that suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to the resistance.

So, when both are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance drops to 10%. So, the combined effect is much worse than either single mutant. So, this suggests that G1 and G3 are not redundant but are working in parallel pathways.

Wait, but what if they are redundant? If they are redundant, then knocking out either would have the same effect, but knocking out both would be worse. But in this case, the single mutants have different resistances: G1 knockout is 75%, G3's is 50%. So, if they were redundant, knocking out either should have the same effect. But they don't. So, that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are in a linear pathway, but that doesn't seem to fit. Let me think.

In a linear pathway, G2 activates G1, which then activates G3. So, if G1 is knocked out, G3 isn't expressed. But that's not the case here because in the single mutant g3, the resistance is 50% (so G3's product is still being made, since g3 is a knockout of G3).

Wait, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So, when G2 is present, both G1 and G3 are expressed.

In the single mutants:

- g1: G2 is functional, so G3 is expressed. So, resistance is 75% (maybe G3 contributes more or both contribute).

Wait, but without G1, the resistance is 75% (g1). But g3 has 50% resistance. So, without G3, the resistance is worse than without G1. So, maybe G1 is more important than G3, or they contribute differently.

If G2 is the transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. But in the presence of G2, that's not possible because G2 is still active. Wait, no: the double mutant g1g3 is the case where both G1 and G3 are knocked out. G2 is still functional because the mutation is only in G1 and G3.

So, G2 is still active, so if G2 activates downstream genes, but without G1 and G3, those downstream genes can't be expressed. So, the resistance is low.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates a downstream gene (let's say D), which in turn activates another layer. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to model this. Let's say:

G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

G1 and G3 are also transcription factors, each activating a set of downstream genes that contribute to resistance.

In the single mutants:

- g1: G1 is knocked out. So, G2 still activates G3. So, G3 is expressed and can activate its downstream genes. Resistance is 75%.

- g3: G3 is knocked out. So, G2 activates G1. So, G1 is expressed, leading to some resistance (50%).

- g2: G2 is knocked out. So, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. Resistance is 0%.

In the double mutants:

- g1g2: G1 and G2 are knocked out. So, G3 is not expressed (since G2 is needed for its expression). So, resistance is 0%, same as g2.

- g3g2: G3 and G2 are knocked out. G1 isn't expressed either, since G2 is needed. So, resistance is 0%.

- g1g3: G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional. So, G2 would activate... wait, but G1 and G3 are knocked out. So, perhaps G2 is trying to activate other downstream genes, but maybe those are not enough. So, resistance is 10% (very low).

Wait, but in this model, the double mutant g1g3 would have G2 active, but without G1 and G3, what happens? If G2 is a transcription factor for other genes downstream of G1 and G3, then without G1 and G3, those downstream genes might not be active because G2 can't activate them. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are intermediaries.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are not part of the same pathway. Maybe G2 is upstream of some pathway that includes G1, and another independent pathway that includes G3. So, both pathways contribute to resistance.

In the double mutant g1g3, both pathways are disrupted, leading to a very low resistance (10%).

So, now, looking back at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, if G1 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would affect downstream genes. But according to the data, G2's knockout is worse than G1's, which is worse than G3's. So, maybe G2 is the transcription factor, not G1.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would mean they're coregulated, perhaps. But the data doesn't directly suggest that. Also, G3 epistatic to G1 would require that G1's effect is only seen when G3 is present. Not sure.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy means that a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that each can perform the same function. So, knocking out one doesn't affect the phenotype, but knocking out both does. In our case, the single mutants have different resistances, so redundancy might not fit.

Wait, but in the g1g3 double mutant, their combined resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single. So, if they were redundant, knocking out both would be worse than either single. So that fits. But in that case, the single mutants would have the same resistance if they are redundant. But g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, which are different. So, that suggests they are not redundant.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Another approach: what defines epistatic relationships? If two genes are in the same pathway, their epistatic relationships can tell us about the order.

In the case of the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is upstream of G3, then the double mutant would be as severe as the more downstream mutation. For example, if G1 is upstream of G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would be the same as g3. But in our case, the double is worse than either. So, that suggests they are in separate pathways.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both activated by G2.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways leading to resistance, both activated by G2. So, if either G1 or G3 is functional, some resistance is present. But if both are knocked out, resistance is minimal.

So, that would explain why the double mutant g1g3 is 10%: both pathways are disrupted.

In that case, G2 is the transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways.

Now, the question is, which option fits this?

Looking back at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, others pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. No, because if G2 is epistatic to G1, G1's effect is only seen when G2 is present. So, in g1, which has G2 functional, the resistance is 75%. But if G2 is a TF for G1, then knocking out G2 would mean G1 isn't expressed, but in reality, g1 has 75% resistance, so G1 must be expressed.

So, this suggests that G1 is not downstream of G2. So, option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so same regulation), G3 epistatic to G1.

If G1 and G3 have the same promoter, they are coregulated. So, knocking out G1 wouldn't affect G3's expression. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, g3 has 50%, and g1g3 has 10%. So, they are not coregulated, as their expression levels are different.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy would mean G1 and G3 affect multiple traits. Not sure. Also, G1 epistatic to G3 would mean that the effect of G3 is only seen when G1 is present.

Hmm, in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out. So, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then without G1, the effect of G3's knockout is seen. But in g3, the resistance is 50%, which is worse than the wild type. So, maybe G1 being present can compensate for G3's knockout? Not sure.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy means that either gene can perform the same function. So, in the double mutant, you lose both, leading to a worse phenotype.

But in our case, the single mutants have different resistances (g1:75%, g3:50%), which suggests they're not redundant. So, this might not fit.

Wait, but perhaps the redundancy is in their functions, not in their expression levels. So, perhaps each can contribute to resistance in a way that is not additive. For example, in the presence of either G1 or G3, some resistance is maintained, but when both are knocked out, resistance is severely compromised.

In that case, the single mutants would have partial resistance, and the double mutant would be much worse. But in this case, the single mutants have different resistances (g1 is better than g3), so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing, but not redundant. So, knocking out either reduces resistance, but knocking out both reduces it further.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are additive, but not redundant. So, the double mutant's resistance is worse than either single, but it's not about redundancy.

But looking back at the options, none of them explicitly state additive effects. Let's review the options again.

Option D says gene redundancy. If they have redundancy, their single mutants would have the same phenotype, but that's not the case here. So, perhaps D is incorrect.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits, but I don't think that's relevant here. Maybe it's a distractor.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic to G1.

Same promoter would mean that G1 and G3 are co-regulated. But in the data, their single mutants have different resistances, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Back to the epistatic relationships.

In the double mutant g1g2: 0% (same as g2). So, the presence of a G1 knockout in a g2 background doesn't change resistance. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's mutation masks the effect of G1's mutation.

Similarly, in the double mutant g3g2: 0% (same as g2), so G2 is epistatic to G3.

In the double mutant g1g3: 10% (worse than either single). So, G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but their effects are additive or in parallel.

So, putting it all together, G2 is a transcription factor, epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, both contributing to resistance when G2 is present. So, knocking out both leads to the most severe phenotype.

Looking at the options:

Option A says G1 is TF. No, because G2's knockout is worse, so G2 is more likely the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. So, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance would be same as g3. But in our case, it's worse. So, B doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. I'm not sure about pleiotropy here. Also, G1 epistatic to G3. If G1 is epistatic, then in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance would be same as g1. But our data shows 10%, worse than either. So, this doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3. Redundancy would require that single mutants have same resistance, which they don't. So, D doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G2 is upstream. So, if G2 is a transcription factor activating G1, which in turn activates G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would be same as g1. But in our data, it's worse, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3, which are in separate pathways. So, each contributes to resistance when G2 is present.

In that scenario, G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other, but their effects are additive or synergistic.

So, looking at the options, the only one that mentions G2 as TF and G1 and G3 in some relationship is option D and C.

But the only options that have G2 as TF are A, B, C, D.

So, looking for which option fits.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But gene redundancy would mean that g1 and g3 have same resistance, which is not the case here.

Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the epistatic relationships.

Wait, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3, meaning that G3's effect is only seen when G1 is present. So, in the double mutant g1g3, since G1 is knocked out, G3's effect isn't seen either, leading to a more severe phenotype than either single.

But in our data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than both singles (75% and 50%). So, that suggests that G1 and G3 contribute in a way that their combined knockout is more severe than either alone, which could happen if they're in parallel pathways.

So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, and G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking for an option that says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (so their effects are additive), and G2 is epistatic to both.

Which option says that? Let's look again.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 epistatic to G3. Doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3.

No, because pleiotropy isn't about the same trait.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 epistatic to G1.

Wait, earlier I thought G2 is more likely the TF because its knockout is worse. But option A says G1 is the TF. Let me think.

If G1 is a TF, then knocking it out would lead to downstream genes not being expressed. So, g1's resistance would be lower than wild type. So, g1 is 75% resistance. So, perhaps some downstream genes are still active, leading to 75% resistance.

But in this case, G2's knockout (g2:0%) is worse. So, if G1 is the TF, why is G2's knockout worse? That suggests that G2 is acting downstream of G1, which doesn't make sense. Because if G1 is a TF, then without G1, G2 wouldn't be expressed. But that's not the case, since in g1, G2 is present and the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2's 0%.

Wait, perhaps G2 is downstream of G1. So, G1 is the TF, activates G2, which then activates other genes. So, when G1 is knocked out (g1), G2 isn't expressed. But the resistance is 75%, so perhaps G2 isn't the only gene downstream of G1.

But then, in the double mutant g1g2, resistance is 0%, same as g2. So, when G1 is knocked out, G2 isn't expressed. So, in the double mutant, it's same as g2. But that would suggest that G2's downstream effects are worse than G1's.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by process of elimination.

Looking at the answer options, the correct answer is likely option A or D.

Wait, another approach: which option correctly describes the epistatic relationships?

We have:

- G2 is epistatic to G1 because g1g2 is same as g2.

- G2 is epistatic to G3 because g2g3 is same as g2.

So, both G1 and G3 are epistatic downstream of G2. So, G2 is epistatic to both.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So, yes.

Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1. No, because in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, worse than g3's 50%.

Wait, if G3 were epistatic to G1, then the double mutant g1g3 would show the same resistance as the more severe single mutant. But g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So, that suggests G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other but are acting in parallel.

So, option B is incorrect.

Option C: G1 is epistatic to G3. So, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1 (75%). But in our case, it's 10%, so incorrect.

Option D: G1 is epistatic to G3. So, same logic as above; incorrect.

So, the only option that correctly says G2 is epistatic to G1 is option A and perhaps option D, but I'm not sure about D.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but earlier we thought that G2 is the transcription factor, not G1. So, if option A says G1 is TF, but the data suggests G2's knockout is worse, which would imply G2 is TF. So, perhaps option A is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would require that the single mutants have the same resistance, which they don't. So, D is incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because in option A, G2 is epistatic to G1. So, G2 is upstream of G1. But earlier analysis suggested that G2 is a transcription factor, but option A says G1 is a TF.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, because G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance, which would suggest that G2 is a TF, as without it, the downstream genes aren't expressed. So, option A says G1 is TF, but that would mean G2 is downstream.

But in the single mutant g1, the resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2's 0%. So, that's inconsistent with G2 being downstream of G1.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's description.

Option A: G1 is TF. So, G1 activates some genes. G2 and G3 are downstream. G2 is epistatic to G1, meaning that G1's effect is only seen when G2 is present. But in g1, G2 is present, so G1's knockout would show the effect. But in g1, resistance is 75%, which is higher than g2's 0%. So, that suggests that in the absence of G1, G2's function is still 75% effective, which doesn't make sense if G1 is upstream.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is upstream of G1. If G2 is a TF that activates G1, which in turn activates other genes. So, in g2, G1 is not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in g1, G2 is present and activates other downstream genes (not G1), leading to 75% resistance.

But then, G2 would be epistatic to G1. Hmm.

In this scenario, G2 is a TF activating G1 and possibly other genes. So, in g1, G2 is still functional and activates other genes, leading to 75% resistance. In g2, G2 is knocked out, so G1 isn't expressed, and other genes downstream of G2 (other than G1) might not be enough to provide resistance, leading to 0%.

But then, G1 is a TF as well, so in g1, G1 is knocked out, so the downstream genes of G1 wouldn't be expressed. But if G2 is also activating other genes, that's possible.

In the double mutant g1g2, G2 is knocked out, so G1 isn't expressed either. Resistance is 0%, same as g2.

In the double mutant g1g3: G1 and G3 are knocked out. But G2 is present, so if G2 activates other genes (like G3?), maybe G3's downstream genes are not enough. So, the resistance is 10%.

But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another angle: which option correctly states that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3?

Looking at the options, only options A and B have G2 as epistatic, but option A says G1 is TF, which we think is incorrect.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But, gene redundancy would mean that g1 and g3 have the same resistance, which they don't. So, that doesn't fit.

I think I've gone as far as I can. Given the data, G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream but in separate pathways. The double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, suggesting their contributions are additive.

Looking at the options, the one that says G2 is TF and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (but not necessarily redundant or pleiotropic) is probably not directly stated. However, option C says G1 is epistatic to G3. But in the data, the double mutant is worse than either, which suggests they're not epistatic but additive.

Given all that, the only option that correctly identifies G2 as TF and G2 as epistatic to G1 and G3 is option A and maybe none of them correctly. Wait, looking back.

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, if G2 is epistatic to G1, that fits with the data where the double mutant g1g2 has the same resistance as g2. So, regardless of G1's presence, when G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

But the question says at least one is a TF. So, if G1 is the TF, but in the data, g2 has 0% resistance, which is worse. So, if G1 is the TF, then why is g2 worse than g1g2?

Hmm, I'm not confident, but I think the correct answer is option A. Because g2 is epistatic to g1, so G2 is epistatic, and G1 is a TF.

Wait, but in the data, G2's knockout is worse than G1's, which implies that G2 is more upstream. So, perhaps G1 is a TF, and G2 is downstream. But that doesn't explain why g2 is worse.

I'm getting stuck, but the correct answer is likely option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct, but I'm not confident.


The question involves determining the interactions between three genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine plants and their role in resistance to anthracnose. The experimental data provides resistance levels for single and double mutants, and the goal is to infer gene function and interactions.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (partial loss of resistance).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (complete loss of resistance).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderate loss of resistance).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

3. **Inferences**:
   - **G2 is critical**: The complete loss of resistance in g2 suggests G2 is a transcription factor (TF) acting upstream of other genes.
   - **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**: The resistance of g1g2 and g2g3 is the same as g2, indicating that G2 masks the effects of G1 and G3 when knocked out.
   - **G1 and G3 are downstream**: The resistance levels of g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) suggest they contribute to resistance but are not as critical as G2.
   - **G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways**: The resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than either single mutant, indicating their contributions are additive rather than redundant.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic to G1. This is inconsistent with the data because G2's knockout (g2) results in 0% resistance, which is worse than G1's knockout (g1: 75%), suggesting G2, not G1, is the transcription factor.

- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic to G1. The data does not support the idea that G1 and G3 have the same promoter, as their single mutants have different resistance levels (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). Additionally, G3 is not epistatic to G1, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the data does not support pleiotropy for G1 and G3. Furthermore, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic to G3. Gene redundancy is inconsistent with the data because the single mutants g1 and g3 have different resistance levels (75% and 50%, respectively). Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that G2 is the transcription factor and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 contribute to resistance in separate pathways, as their combined knockout (g1g3) results in a resistance level worse than either single mutant. None of the options perfectly fit the data, but **Option A** comes closest by correctly identifying G2 as epistatic to G1, even though it incorrectly identifies G1 as the transcription factor.
