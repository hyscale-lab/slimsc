Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions, and I need to figure out which sequence will give the desired product with high yield.

I remember that when synthesizing aromatic compounds, the order of substituents matters because of the directing effects of the substituents. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions, and each substituent added will direct the next substitution. Also, activating and deactivating groups affect where the next substitution occurs.

Looking at the target compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Breaking down the structure, the benzene ring has three substituents. Let me number the ring positions for clarity. Let's say position 1 is the ethoxy group. Then, position 2 is the tert-butyl group, and position 3 is the nitro group.

Wait, wait, the numbering might be different. Let me draw it out mentally. The substituents are on positions 1, 2, and 3. Since benzene is a six-membered ring, adjacent positions are 1,2 and 2,3, etc.

So the substituents are ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the three substituents are meta to each other? Or maybe ortho and meta... Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the directing effects.

The target has three substituents: two are activating groups (ethoxy is activating, tert-butyl is a bulky activating group?), and nitro is a deactivating group.

Wait, ethoxy is an activating (ortho/para-directing) group. tert-Butyl is also an activating group (since it's an alkyl group), and it's a bulky substituent, so it's para/ortho-directing but more likely to direct incoming groups to the para position because of steric hindrance. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

But in the target molecule, ethoxy is at position 1. Let me think about the order of adding substituents:

Benzene can be first substituted with ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The order of addition will determine the positions.

I think some groups are better introduced early because they might block certain positions or direct others. Let's think about each step.

First, benzene can undergo substitution. Let's consider the first substituent. The options involve using tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (which is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation) or nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) as the first step.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires activating groups. Benzene is activated enough for that, but it can be tricky because the tert-butyl group is bulky. Alternatively, nitration would add a nitro group, which is a deactivating meta director. But that's a deactivating group, which might make subsequent substitutions harder.

Let me outline the target structure again. It has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let's think about which substituents are introduced first.

If I introduce the nitro group first, that would deactivating the ring, making other substitutions harder. So maybe it's better to introduce the activating groups first to facilitate the other reactions.

So perhaps the order is: introduce an ethoxy group, then a tert-butyl group, and then a nitro group. Or another order?

Wait, but the nitro group is meta-directing, so in the target, the nitro is at position 3. Let's see the positions. Suppose we have benzene, and we first add ethoxy group at position 1. Then, the next group would be added either ortho, meta, or para to that.

Wait, ethoxy is an activating group with strong ortho/para-directing. So the next substitution would go to ortho or para positions relative to the ethoxy.

But in the target, the tert-butyl is at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy) and nitro is at position 3 (meta to ethoxy? No, because ethoxy is at position 1. So position 3 is meta to position 1. Hmm, but ethoxy is activating, so the next substitution would be ortho or para. So if the nitro group is meta to ethoxy, that's not possible if ethoxy is the first substituent.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added after another substituent. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after some other groups have been introduced.

Wait, another approach: the target has three substituents. Let me think about the order in which they could be added.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Option 2: Add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Option 3: Add nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl.

But adding nitro first would deactivating the ring, which makes subsequent substitutions (like Friedel-Crafts) difficult because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating ring. So Option 3 might not be feasible unless the nitro is added at a position that's still reactive enough.

So probably, we should add the activating groups first.

Ethoxy is an activating group, and tert-butyl is also activating (since it's an alkyl group). So maybe adding ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so after adding nitro, any further reactions would be harder because the ring is deactivating. So which substituent is added last?

In the target, the nitro is in position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because once nitro is present, it's difficult to add more groups, but perhaps in this case, the last substituent is nitro.

Wait, perhaps the steps are as follows:

1. Benzene first undergoes ethoxylation. So, introduce an ethoxy group. Let's say at position 1.

2. Next, introduce the tert-butyl group. Since ethoxy is ortho/para-directing, the tert-butyl could go ortho (position 2) or para (position 4). But in the target, it's at position 2. So that's possible.

3. Then, introduce the nitro group. But where? Nitro is meta to ethoxy would be position 3 or 5. Since in the target, nitro is at position 3, which is meta to position 1 (ethoxy). So that's correct.

Wait, but after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl (positions 1 and 2), the ring has two substituents. Now, the nitro group would be directed by the activating groups or deactivating groups.

Wait, the ring at this point has ethoxy (activating) and tert-butyl (activating) groups. The next substitution (nitro) would be determined by the directing effects of the existing substituents. The ethoxy and tert-butyl are both ortho/para directors, so the incoming nitro (which is an electrophilic substitution) would go to positions that are ortho or para to either substituent.

Wait, benzene is a ring, and when multiple substituents are present, their combined directing effects determine where the next group goes. But when multiple substituents are present, sometimes the most activating group or the one that's ortho/para to more substituents can direct the incoming group.

In this case, the ethoxy is at 1, and the tert-butyl is at 2. So possible positions for nitration are:

Looking at the ring, position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl), and position 4 is across from ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the nitration occurs at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1) and ortho to tert-butyl (position 2). So how would that happen?

Wait, when two substituents are present, the incoming group tends to go to a position that is ortho or para to both substituents if possible, or if not, to the most activating group. Alternatively, the substituents can have a combined effect.

But in this scenario, after ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2), where would the nitro group go?

Another thought: the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so it's better to add it last. But wait, if we add nitro last, the ring might already have two activating groups, making the nitration easier. But nitration is a strong reaction, so perhaps it's possible.

But wait, nitration is a strong electrophilic substitution. The substituents present would influence where the nitro group is added.

So, the substituents are ethoxy and tert-butyl. Both are activating, so the ring is still reactive. The nitration would occur where? Let's think about the possible positions.

Ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

The positions available are 3,4,5,6.

Position 3: adjacent to tert-butyl (position 2) and meta to ethoxy.

Position 4: para to ethoxy (position 1) and meta to tert-butyl (position 2).

Position 5: meta to ethoxy (position 1) and across from tert-butyl (position 2).

Position 6: adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and meta to tert-butyl.

Wait, so when you have a di-substituted ring with substituents at 1 and 2, the nitration could go into position 3 or 4. Let me visualize:

Positions are numbered as follows:

1: ethoxy
2: tert-butyl
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?
6: ?

The positions available for substitution are 3,4,5,6.

The ethoxy is an ortho/para director, so the nitro would prefer positions ortho (2 and 6) or para (4) relative to ethoxy. But position 2 is already occupied by tert-butyl, so possible are positions 6 (ortho to ethoxy) and 4 (para).

Tert-butyl is also an ortho/para director. Its ortho positions are 1 and 3, but position 1 is occupied. So possible ortho is position 3. Para would be position 5.

So the nitro group would have two possible preferred positions: 3 (ortho to tert-butyl) and 4 (para to ethoxy). But which is more favorable?

I think when multiple substituents are present, the substituent with the strongest activating effect may have a greater influence. Both ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating, but ethoxy is more activating (since it's an electron-donating group through resonance), compared to the inductive effect of the alkyl group.

Alternatively, the substituents could compete, and the nitro group could end up in a position that's ortho to one and meta to another.

In this case, position 3 is meta to ethoxy (1) and ortho to tert-butyl (2). Position 4 is para to ethoxy (1) and meta to tert-butyl (2).

Which is more favorable? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the nitro group would end up in position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl group. Since the tert-butyl is a bulky group, maybe steric effects cause the nitration to occur in a less hindered position.

Alternatively, the nitro group could go to position 4, which is para to ethoxy. Since ethoxy is a strong activating group, the nitro might prefer to go para to it, which is position 4.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3. So that suggests that the nitro group was added to position 3, which is the ortho position to the tert-butyl group (position 2), and meta to the ethoxy (position 1). So how does that happen?

Hmm, perhaps the ethoxy group is the major director because it is a stronger activating group. So the nitro group would go to the para position relative to ethoxy, which is position 4. But the target has nitro at position 3, not 4.

This is confusing. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of adding substituents is different. Let's consider that the nitro group is added second, and the tert-butyl is added third.

Wait, would that work? If we first nitrate benzene, that would create a meta-directing group, making subsequent substitutions harder. Because nitro is deactivating, adding the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups might be difficult. So that's probably not the case.

So perhaps the nitro is added last, after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are in place.

But in that case, the ring would have two activating groups. The nitration would be directed by both. The possible positions are 3 and 4.

But in the target, the nitro is at 3. So perhaps, under these conditions, the nitro group goes to position 3.

But I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should look at each of the options and see which sequence matches the correct order of substituents.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps are:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation)
ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
iv) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?)
Wait, the options have some missing steps, but let me look again.

Wait, the options have multiple steps. Let's take option D as an example:

Option D:
i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration
ii) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction step or something else
iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts
iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again?
v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization
vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation?
vii) dilute H2SO4 → maybe hydrolysis or acid workup
viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → perhaps acid workup
ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution via SN2?

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me think about each option's steps.

Option D: First step is nitration (i). So benzene becomes nitrobenzene. Nitro is a meta director. Next step ii is Fe/HCl. Fe in HCl is probably for something else. Wait, Fe in HCl and then a nitration again? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step ii is something else. Wait, Fe and HCl might be part of a nitration step—like using a mixed acid with Fe as a catalyst. Or maybe it's a reduction step. Hmm, nitro to amine? No, because Fe/HCl isn't a typical reducing agent for nitro to amine. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis condition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in the options involve multiple functional group transformations. Maybe some steps are for introducing substituents via other methods, like using a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the sequence of reactions.

Let me outline the required steps to get 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

Starting with benzene, we need to add three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro.

Which order of addition would lead to the correct positions?

Let me think again.

Case 1: Add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

- Benzene → ethoxybenzene (using ethyl chloride and AlCl3 for Friedel-Crafts, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation. For ethoxy, which is an O-alkylation, I think we use something like ethyl chloride with AlCl3, but that's for alkylation. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts alkylation would add an alkyl group. But ethoxy is an ether, so perhaps it's added via nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, no, ethoxy as a substituent would require an O-alkylation. How is that done? Maybe using an ethyl halide, but with a Lewis acid catalyst. Wait, benzene's Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, but adding an oxygen-containing group like ethoxy would require a different approach. Or perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via another method, like using ethyl nitrite or something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me recall: to introduce an ethoxy group into benzene, we can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's typically under strong activating conditions or using a directing group. Alternatively, perhaps it's done through a diazonium salt. But benzene itself is not easily diazotized.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via the ethyl group first, then converted. No, that's getting complicated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an ether-forming reaction. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced as a substituent via a directing group. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after a nitration step.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction, such as using a bromide and a nucleophilic substitution. But that would require a leaving group on the ring, which isn't present in benzene. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts typically adds an alkyl group, not an ether. So maybe the ethoxy group is added via a different method, like using an ethyl chloride and a Lewis acid, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that usually requires a strongly activating group, such as a nitro group in the meta position, to make the ring electron-deficient. But in this case, benzene is electron-rich, so nucleophilic substitution isn't common unless under specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution using a diazonium salt. For that, we can form a diazonium salt, then perform a coupling reaction. But I think that's more for adding groups like Cl, Br, etc., under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options and see which one could lead to the target.

Looking at option D again: steps are HNO3/H2SO4 (i), then Fe/HCl (ii), then tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (iii), then HNO3 again (iv), and so on.

If the first step is nitration, we get nitrobenzene. Then Fe and HCl: maybe this is a reduction step, like the reduction of nitro group to amine. So nitro → amine. Then, step iii is Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. Since the amine is a strong activating group, but it's a meta director, right? Because amines are ortho/para directors but are activating. Wait, nitro is deactivating and meta, but an amine is activating and ortho/para.

Wait, so if we have an amine group, then adding a tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts would direct it to the ortho or para positions relative to the amine.

But wait, the target has nitro at position 3. So if the amine is at position 1, and we add a tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para), then nitration would come next.

Wait, but option D's step iv is another nitration. So after adding the tert-butyl, the next step is to nitrate again. Hmm. Let me try to map this.

First, benzene → nitrobenzene (step i). Then, nitrobenzene → aniline via reduction (Fe/HCl). Then, Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl to the aniline. Aniline is an activating group, so the tert-butyl would go ortho or para. Suppose it goes ortho to aniline (position 2).

So now the structure is 2-tert-butylaniline (aniline with tert-butyl at position 2).

Next step iv is another nitration. Where would the nitro group go? Aniline is a strong activating group (ortho/para). The tert-butyl is at position 2. So if we nitrate, the nitro group would go to position 3 (meta to aniline and ortho to tert-butyl? Or perhaps para to aniline (which would be position 5) but that's blocked). Hmm. Alternatively, let's think about the substituents present: aniline (position 1), tert-butyl (position 2). The para position to aniline is 4, which is empty.

So when nitration occurs, the nitro group would be directed by the activating aniline group and the bulky tert-butyl group.

The possible positions are 3, 4, 5, 6. Since the aniline is at 1, the ortho positions are 2 and 6, but 2 is occupied by tert-butyl. Para is position 4.

So the nitro group would likely go to position 4. But in the target, the nitro is at position 3.

Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe option D isn't the right sequence.

Wait, another way: perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups. Let me look for an option where nitration is the last step.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene to get tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate tert-butylbenzene. Where does nitration occur? tert-Butyl is an activating group, ortho/para director. So the nitro group would go to position 2 or 4, but in the target, it's at position 3. Hmm, not sure.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl → position 1 (let's say)

ii) nitration → positions 2 or 4.

So now, the structure is either 2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene or 4-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.

Next step iii is Fe/HCl, which could be a reduction (like nitro to amine).

Then step iv is another nitration. Hmm, maybe not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via another step.

Looking at option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group. But sulfonic acid is a strong activating group (since it's -SO3H), which is a meta director.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So sulfonation might not be part of the desired product. So perhaps option C isn't the right path.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → nitro at position 2 or 4.

Then step iv (but the option says iii) SO3/H2SO4; perhaps I'm misreading the steps.

Wait, looking back, the options have some steps missing or misnumbered. Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis (like in diazonium salt formation).

vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps ethoxylation via SN2.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → another substitution.

Wait, perhaps this is a bit convoluted. Let me think about the steps.

After adding tert-butyl and nitro groups, the next steps involve sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group. Then, reduction of nitro to amine, diazotization, and so on. But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps this isn't the correct path.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve substituting a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitration. For example, introduce a nitro group, then convert it to a leaving group, then substitute it with ethoxy.

Wait, let me think. Nitro group → amine (using Fe and HCl), then amine → diazonium salt (using NaNO2 and HCl), then diazonium salt can be replaced with another group, like ethoxy via a substitution.

But that's speculative. Let me look at the steps in option A:

After step ii (nitration), we have a nitro group. Then step iii is sulfonation, which adds a sulfonic acid group. Then step iv is Fe/HCl, which may reduce the nitro group to an amine. Then step v is diazotization (NaNO2/HCl), which converts the amine to a diazonium chloride. Step vi is H3O+ and heat, which might decompose the diazonium salt to form a benzoic acid or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, step vii is NaOH with EtBr, which could be an SN2 reaction to substitute a Br with ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation: add tert-butyl group.

2. Nitration: add nitro group.

3. Sulfonation: add sulfonic acid group (but this might not be part of the target, so perhaps not the right approach).

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option's steps and see which sequence makes sense.

The target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Let me think about possible orders:

Order 1: Ethoxy → tert-butyl → nitro.

Order 2: tert-butyl → ethoxy → nitro.

Order 3: ethoxy → nitro → tert-butyl.

But nitro is deactivating, so Order 3 might not work for adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

Order 1: First, ethoxy is added. Then, tert-butyl is added ortho to ethoxy. Then, nitro is added meta to ethoxy (which would be position 3, but let me check).

In this case, the substituents after ethoxy and tert-butyl are at 1 and 2. Then, nitration would be directed by both. The ethoxy directs to 3 (meta) and 6 (ortho). The tert-butyl directs to 1 (occupied) and 3 (ortho). So the nitro would go to position 3.

That would give the desired structure.

So the order is: ethoxy → tert-butyl → nitro.

But how to introduce each group.

Ethoxy can be introduced via an O-alkylation, which is tricky. Or perhaps via another method.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction. For benzene, that's not straightforward. Maybe via a diazonium salt. Wait, perhaps a two-step process.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's difficult without a strong electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to introduce the ethoxy group after nitration.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine, then convert to a good leaving group (like a tosylate or bromide).

3. Substitute that leaving group with ethoxy.

4. Then, perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl.

But I'm not sure if that's the case in any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve introducing the ethoxy group via a coupling reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitration and reduction.

Let me think about option D again.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butylaniline.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → where? The substituents are aniline (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). Nitration would be directed by aniline (ortho/para). So possible positions are 3 (ortho to tert-butyl?), 4 (para to aniline).

Wait, the structure after step iii is 2-tert-butylaniline. Now, when nitrated (step iv), the nitro group would likely go to position 4 (para to aniline) because aniline is a strong activating group and the para position is available. So we get 4-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline.

Then, step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the aniline group.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, it's treated with something else. Then, in step vii, dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis? Maybe forming a hydroxyl group.

Step viii: H3O+ and heat → another reaction, perhaps introducing a nitro group again?

I'm getting lost here. Maybe it's better to think that the correct order of substituents is ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro, and find which option has that sequence.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl → added to benzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro at position 2 or 4.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) nitrate again → but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is adding ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how is the ethoxy group introduced?

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after a leaving group is introduced. For example:

1. Benzene → nitrate to nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Convert amine to a good leaving group, like a tosylate or bromide.

4. Substitute that group with ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

5. Then perform Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl group, which would be directed by ethoxy.

But I'm not sure if any option follows this.

Looking at option D again, which starts with nitration. Let me map it:

1. Nitrobenzene (step i).

2. Reduce nitro to aniline (step ii).

3. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride → aniline directs to ortho or para, so tert-butyl at position 2 or 4. So structure is 2-tert-butylaniline or 4-tert-butylaniline.

Assuming position 2.

4. Nitrate again (step iv) → nitro will go to position 4 (para to aniline, as aniline is activating and position 4 is available).

Now structure is 4-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline.

Then, step v: diazotization (turns amine into diazonium salt).

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonating? Not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps after diazotization, the diazonium group is replaced with something else.

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolyzing the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group? So replacing the amine (position 1) with -OH.

Then step viii: H3O+ and heat → maybe acid workup.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → perhaps SN2 reaction to substitute OH with OEt (ethoxy group).

Wait, so putting it all together:

After step i: nitrobenzene.

Step ii: reduce nitro to aniline → aniline.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butyl at position 2 → 2-tert-butylaniline.

Step iv: nitrate → nitro at position 4 → 4-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline.

Step v: diazotize the aniline → 4-nitro-2-tert-butylbenzenediazonium chloride.

Step vi: treat with SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate? I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, when you treat it with H2O and acid, you get a phenol. But here, perhaps it's treated with something else.

Alternatively, step vi: treating with SO3/H2SO4 could be sulfonation, adding a sulfonic acid group. But that's not part of the target molecule.

Hmm, maybe this isn't the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is moved.

Wait, maybe in option D, the nitro groups are added in such a way that one is replaced by ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps after getting 4-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline, the amine is converted to a diazonium salt, which is then replaced with ethoxy.

Let me think:

After step iv: 4-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline.

Step v: diazotization → forms benzene diazonium salt at position 1.

Step vi: maybe hydrolysis → replaces the diazonium group with -OH, giving 4-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → perhaps acid workup.

Step viii: H3O+ and heat → maybe nothing, or perhaps another reaction.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → perhaps the -OH is replaced with OEt via SN2, giving 4-nitro-2-tert-butylphenyl-OEt.

Wait, but the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

In this scenario, the nitro is at position 4, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. But the target has nitro at 3. So this doesn't match.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me think about each substituent's position relative to each other.

The target has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.

So, substituent at position 1: ethoxy.

Position 2: tert-butyl.

Position 3: nitro.

So, the nitro is at the meta position relative to ethoxy (since 1 and 3 are meta), and ortho to the tert-butyl (since 2 and 3 are adjacent).

So, the nitro is directed by the tert-butyl group or the ethoxy group.

Wait, when both ethoxy and tert-butyl are present, which group directs the nitration?

Ethoxy is a strong activating, ortho/para director.

tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director.

So, when two activating groups are present, the incoming nitro group would tend to go to a position that is ortho or para to either substituent.

In this case, position 3 is ortho to the tert-butyl (position 2) and meta to the ethoxy (position 1). So, for the nitro to end up at position 3, it must be directed by the tert-butyl group.

But ethoxy is a stronger activating group, so I'm not sure why the nitro would prefer to go to position 3, which is meta to ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl group is larger and has a stronger steric effect, making the ortho position to it more accessible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl group.

2. Add ethoxy group.

3. Add nitro group.

So, let's think:

After step 1: tert-butylbenzene.

Step 2: introduce ethoxy group. Since tert-butyl is ortho/para-directing, the ethoxy would go to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) relative to tert-butyl (position 1).

So after step 2: 2-ethoxy-tert-butylbenzene (ethoxy at 2, tert-butyl at 1).

Wait, but the target has ethoxy at 1. Hmm, maybe that's not the right order.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added at position 1, then tert-butyl at position 2, then nitro at 3.

So, the steps would be:

1. Introduce ethoxy group at position 1.

2. Introduce tert-butyl group at position 2.

3. Introduce nitro group at position 3.

But how to introduce the ethoxy group.

Friedel-Crafts alkylation can add an alkyl group, but not an ether (ethoxy) directly. So maybe the ethoxy group is added through another method.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after making a suitable leaving group.

For example:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Convert amine to a good leaving group, like a bromide (using H2SO4, HBr, etc.), making benzyl bromide.

4. Treat with ethanol in the presence of a base → nucleophilic substitution, replacing Br with OEt (ethoxy group). But wait, in aromatic substitution, that's not straightforward unless under specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reagent, but that's not applicable to aromatic rings.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction, but that seems too involved.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution using a directing group.

But I'm getting stuck on this point. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → nitro group added.

tert-Butyl is ortho/para director, so nitro could be at position 2 or 4.

Assuming it's added at position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl), structure is 2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.

But the target has nitro at position 3, relative to ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, but in option B, the next steps are:

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotize.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolyze.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitute.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an O-alkylation after introducing a leaving group.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group could be introduced via a substitution of a bromide after the ring has activating groups.

For example:

1. Add tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylbenzene.

2. Nitrate → nitro at position 2.

3. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

4. Convert aniline to a leaving group, like benzyl bromide.

5. Substitute with ethoxy via nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

But I'm not sure if this is part of any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

I'm starting to think that the correct option is D.

Wait, let me map option D again.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylaniline.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → nitro group added.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → ?

ix) NaOH/EtBr → ethoxy substitution.

Wait, let me think:

After step i: nitrobenzene.

Step ii: reduce to aniline.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butyl group at position 2 (ortho to aniline at position 1).

So structure is 2-tert-butylaniline.

Step iv: nitrate → where? Aniline is activating, so nitro goes to position 4 (para to aniline at 1) or position 3 (ortho to tert-butyl at 2).

But let's think: after adding tert-butyl at 2, the next nitration would be directed by both aniline (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para).

So, possible positions for nitration are 3 (ortho to tert-butyl at 2) and 4 (para to aniline at 1), or 6 (ortho to aniline at 1, but that's position 6, which is meta to tert-butyl at 2).

But which is more likely? Aniline being a stronger activating group, the nitro would prefer to go para to aniline, which is position 4. So after step iv: 4-nitro-2-tert-butylaniline.

Step v: diazotize the aniline (position 1) → benzene with tert-butyl (2), nitro (4), and diazonium salt (1).

Step vi: treat with SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Wait, but sulfonic acid is a strong activating group. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps after diazotization, the diazonium group is replaced with something else. For example, in the presence of H2O, it would become a phenol.

So, after step vi, perhaps the structure is 4-nitro-2-tert-butylphenol.

Step vii: dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

Step viii: H3O+ and heat → perhaps nothing.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr → substitute the OH group with OEt (ethoxy).

So, the structure becomes 4-nitro-2-tert-butyl-phenyl-OEt.

But the target has ethoxy at position 1, nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2. So this doesn't match. The nitro is at 4, which is not correct.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck again.

Maybe the correct option is option B.

Option B steps:

i) tert-butyl chloride → Friedel-Crafts → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → nitro at position 2 or 4.

Assume position 2.

Structure: 2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → 2-amino-tert-butylbenzene.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again → where? The amine (position 2) is a strong activating group, ortho/para director. So nitro would go to position 1 (ortho to amine at 2) or position 3 (meta? No, because amine is activating, so nitro would go ortho or para.

Wait, the substituents are tert-butyl at 1, amine at 2. Nitration would be directed by the amine (position 2). So possible positions are 1 (occupied by tert-butyl), 3 (para to amine), or position 6 (ortho to amine).

But tert-butyl is at 1, so position 3 is available. So nitro goes to position 3.

So now structure is 3-nitro-2-amino-tert-butylbenzene.

But that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps in this scenario, after nitrating, we have nitro at 3.

Then step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amino group (position 2) → forms a diazonium salt.

Step vi: H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis, replacing amino group with OH.

So structure becomes 3-nitro-2-hydroxy-tert-butylbenzene.

Step vii: NaOH/EtBr → substitution of OH with OEt.

So, structure now is 3-nitro-2-ethoxy-tert-butylbenzene.

But wait, the target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So this doesn't match, as in this case, ethoxy is at 2, and tert-butyl is at 1.

Hmm, perhaps this is not the correct path.

I think I'm running out of time, and perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me try to think why.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl at position 2.

iv) Nitrate → nitro at position 4.

v) Diazotization → replace aniline (position 1) with diazonium.

vi) Treat with H2SO4 → replace with OH.

vii) Dilute H2SO4 → ? Maybe nothing.

viii) Acid workup → ?

ix) NaOH and EtBr → replace OH with OEt.

So, after these steps, the structure would be 4-nitro-2-tert-butyl-phenyl-OEt.

But the target is 2-tert-butyl-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which is ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, this isn't matching. Hence, perhaps option D isn't the right one.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the steps. Let me map option B.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl at position 1.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at position 2 (ortho to tert-butyl).

Structure: 2-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → 2-amino-tert-butylbenzene.

iv) Nitrate again → where? The amine (position 2) is an ortho/para director. So nitro would go to position 1 (occupied by tert-butyl), 3 (para to amine), or 6 (ortho).

Assuming position 3 is available, so nitro at 3.

Structure: 3-nitro-2-amino-tert-butylbenzene.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo at amine (position 2).

vi) H3O+/H2O/heat → replace amine with OH → 2-hydroxy-3-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitute OH with OEt → 2-ethoxy-3-nitro-tert-butylbenzene.

But the target has ethoxy at position 1, not 2. Hmm, this isn't matching. So perhaps option B isn't correct.

Wait, but perhaps I assigned the positions incorrectly. Let me try again.

In option B, after step iv: 3-nitro-2-amino-tert-butylbenzene.

Then, step v: diazo at position 2 → benzene with tert-butyl (1), nitro (3), and diazonium (2).

Step vi: hydrolysis → OH at 2.

Step vii: substitute OH with OEt → ethoxy at 2.

But the target has ethoxy at 1.

So, this isn't correct.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that perhaps none of the options are giving the correct order, but that's unlikely. Perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction after a nitro group is present. Let me think.

If we have a nitro group, which is meta-directing, and then introduce a substituent that can be converted into ethoxy, perhaps via a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after introducing a leaving group.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first introduce ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But how to introduce ethoxy without a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by reduction.

For example:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation → benzaldehyde derivative.

2. Reduce to benzyl alcohol.

3. Convert to bromide.

4. Substitute with ethoxy.

But that's a possible method.

But I'm not seeing that in any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using a diazonium salt.

Wait, benzene can't form a diazonium salt directly. But if we have a nitro group, perhaps we can form a diazonium salt.

Wait, let me think of option D step by step.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Reduction → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → add tert-butyl.

iv) Nitration → add another nitro.

v) Diazotization → convert aniline to diazonium.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) acid workup → ?

ix) NaOH and EtBr → substitute.

But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option B.

Wait, let me try to map it again.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl at 1.

ii) Nitrate → nitro at 2.

iii) reduction → amine at 2.

iv) Nitrate again → nitro at 4.

Wait, but that doesn't fit the target either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and I should look for the option where the nitro is added after ethoxy and tert-butyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Add nitro.

3. Add ethoxy.

But how to add ethoxy after nitro, which is deactivating.

Wait, let me think: after adding tert-butyl and nitro, the ring has a nitro group (deactivating, meta-directing) and a tert-butyl group (activating, ortho/para). So the ethoxy could be added where?

The ethoxy would be directed by the tert-butyl group (since it's activating) to ortho or para. But the nitro group is deactivating and directs meta.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after a leaving group is present.

But I'm not making progress, and time is limited. So I'll have to make an educated guess.

Given the target structure, the nitro group is at position 3, which is meta to the ethoxy group. So the nitro must be added after the ethoxy group, as nitro is a meta director. That suggests that the ethoxy is added first.

Then, the tert-butyl is added next, which would be ortho to ethoxy, and the nitro is added third, which is meta to ethoxy.

The steps would be:

1. Ethoxy group added.

2. tert-butyl group added (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Nitro group added (meta to ethoxy).

Looking for an option where nitro is added last.

Looking at option D:

Steps are:

i) Nitrate → first substituent.

Then, steps add tert-butyl, then nitrate again, and so on.

This seems to have nitrate as the first and third steps, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) sulfonate → SO3.

iii) Nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce.

v) Diazotize.

vi) Nitrate again.

Hmm, not matching.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) reduce.

v) diazotize.

vi) hydrolysis.

vii) substitute.

Perhaps in this path, the ethoxy is introduced via the substitution in step vii.

Wait, after step vi: hydrolysis → perhaps OH group.

Then step vii: NaOH and EtBr → substitute OH with OEt.

So, the substituents would be:

tert-butyl (from step i), nitro (from step ii), and OEt (from step vii).

But where are they positioned?

Assuming after step i: tert-butyl at 1.

Step ii: nitrate → could be at position 2 or 4.

Suppose nitro at 2.

Then, after step iv: reduce nitro to amine → position 2.

Step v: diazotization → forms diazonium at 2.

Step vi: hydrolysis → OH at 2.

Step vii: substitute OH with OEt → position 2 now has OEt.

But the target has OEt at position 1.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution in step vii replaces a different group.

Wait, maybe after step ii, we have tert-butyl at 1 and nitro at 3.

Then, step iv: reduce nitro to amine → position 3 becomes amine.

Step v: diazotize → position 3 becomes diazonium.

Step vi: hydrolysis → position 3 becomes OH.

Step vii: substitute OH with OEt → position 3 now has OEt.

But the target has OEt at 1, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps after step i: tert-butyl at position 1.

Step ii: nitrate at position 3 (meta to tert-butyl? No, tert-butyl is activating, ortho/para. So nitration would be at 2 or 4.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all options, and perhaps the correct answer is option D.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, another approach: the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. The nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1). So, the nitro must have been added after the ethoxy group.

Looking for an option where the nitro is added last.

Option D:

After step iii: tert-butyl is added.

Step iv: nitrate → so nitro is added after tert-butyl.

But ethoxy hasn't been added yet. So nitro is added before ethoxy.

So that can't be, because nitro is meta to ethoxy, which would have been added earlier.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. I think the correct option is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. The analysis focuses on the directing effects of substituents and the feasibility of each reaction sequence provided in the options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Target Structure and Substituent Positions**:
   - The ethoxy group (OEt) is at position 1.
   - The tert-butyl group is at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).
   - The nitro group is at position 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl).

2. **Directing Effects**:
   - Ethoxy (OEt) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - Tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group.
   - Nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group.

3. **Order of Substitution**:
   - The ethoxy group must be introduced first because the nitro group is meta to it, and nitro is a deactivating group that would make subsequent substitutions difficult if introduced early.
   - After ethoxy, the tert-butyl group is added ortho to ethoxy (position 2).
   - Finally, the nitro group is added meta to ethoxy (position 3).

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Begins with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by nitration and sulfonation. This sequence does not align with the required order of substituents.
   - **Option B**: Starts with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by nitration, reduction, and subsequent nitrations. This sequence does not introduce the ethoxy group correctly.
   - **Option C**: Begins with tert-butyl alkylation, followed by sulfonation and nitration. The sulfonation step introduces an additional group (sulfonic acid) that is not part of the target molecule.
   - **Option D**: Starts with nitration, followed by reduction, tert-butyl alkylation, and further nitrations. While this sequence introduces the nitro group first, it does not match the required order of substituents.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - None of the options perfectly match the required sequence of ethoxy → tert-butyl → nitro. However, based on the analysis, **Option D** is the closest match, as it involves nitration, reduction, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation steps that could potentially lead to the target structure, despite some discrepancies in the order of substituents.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: D**
