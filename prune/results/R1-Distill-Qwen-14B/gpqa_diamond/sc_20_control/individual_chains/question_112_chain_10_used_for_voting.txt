Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system. The question has two parts: first, to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and second, to find the average value of that operator.

The operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, okay. Wait, let's think about this matrix. For a 2x2 matrix (since we're dealing with spin up and down), the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are 0, and the off-diagonal elements A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2. So the matrix A looks like this:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Because in quantum mechanics, the matrix elements are usually written as A_ij where i and j are row and column indices. So if i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So for a 2x2 case, the matrix would be:

Row 1: [0, hbar/2]
Row 2: [hbar/2, 0]

But wait, isn't that the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2? Because the Pauli X matrix has 1s off the diagonal and 0s on the diagonal. So yes, A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

So the operator A is (hbar/2) * σ_x. That's important because σ_x has eigenstates that are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of σ_x, just scaled by the factor.

First, I think I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Then, I can express the given state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates to find the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without explicitly finding the eigenstates.

Wait, but the operator A is given, and the question is about the eigenstates of A. So the measurement is in the basis of A's eigenstates. So the state |alpha> will be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenstates, and the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to diagonalize matrix A first to find its eigenstates, then express |alpha> in that basis.

Let me think about the matrix A. Since A is (hbar/2) times σ_x, which has eigenvalues ± hbar/2. Because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1. So A has eigenvalues ± (hbar/2). The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, because A is a scalar multiple of σ_x.

So, the eigenstates |+> and |-> of A would be:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/√2
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/√2

Now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let's normalize |alpha> first.

Wait, the problem says it's proportional, but I think for probability calculations, the state is normalized. So perhaps the given state is already normalized. Let me check.

Compute the norm squared of the given state. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1^2 + 1^2) = 2.
|2 - i|^2: (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5.
So total is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/i) times that, so to normalize, it should be (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Alternatively, the state can be written as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7 ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/√7 ] |down>

So, when I express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates |+> and |->, the coefficients will give me the probability amplitudes for each eigenstate. The probability of measuring each eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of these coefficients.

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

We have:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/√2
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/√2

So, let's express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->. Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Substituting:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7 ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/√7 ] |down>
= c_+ (|up> + |down>)/√2 + c_- (|up> - |down>)/√2

Let me group terms:

= [ (c_+ + c_-)/√2 ] |up> + [ (c_+ - c_-)/√2 ] |down>

Comparing coefficients:

Coefficient of |up>:
(1+i)/√7 = (c_+ + c_-)/√2

Coefficient of |down>:
(2 -i)/√7 = (c_+ - c_-)/√2

So, we can set up two equations:

(1) (c_+ + c_-) = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)
(2) (c_+ - c_-) = (2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)

Let me solve these equations. Let me add equation (1) and equation (2):

2 c_+ = (1+i + 2 -i) * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So, c_+ = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = 3/(2) * sqrt(2/7) = sqrt(2/7) * 3/2.

Wait, wait, 3/(2) multiplied by sqrt(2/7). Alternatively, sqrt(2/7) is sqrt(2)/sqrt(7), so 3/(2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = (3 * sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

2 c_- = (1+i - (2 -i)) * sqrt(2/7)
= (1 +i -2 +i) * sqrt(2/7)
= (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)
So, c_- = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute c_+ and c_- by solving the two equations.

Let me write equation (1) and (2):

c_+ + c_- = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7) → equation (1a)
c_+ - c_- = (2-i) * sqrt(2/7) → equation (2a)

Adding (1a) and (2a):

2 c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= (3) * sqrt(2/7)
So c_+ = 3/2 * sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting (2a) from (1a):

2 c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)
= [ -1 + 2i ] * sqrt(2/7)
So c_- = [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

So now, the coefficients c_+ and c_- are known.

The probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+ |^2:

= [ (3 sqrt(2) ) / (2 sqrt(7)) ) ]²
= (9 * 2) / (4 *7 )
= 18 / 28
= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, |c_-|^2:

= | (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) ) |^2
= | (-1 + 2i) |^2 * (2) / (4*7)
= (1 +4) * 2/(4*7)
= 5 * 2/(28)
= 10/28 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357142...

Wait, wait wait. Wait, let me compute this correctly.

Wait, |a * b|^2 = |a|^2 * |b|^2.

So, for c_-, the absolute value squared is:

[ | (-1 + 2i) |^2 ] * [ (sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7))) ]^2.

Compute | (-1 + 2i) |^2: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5.

Then, (sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)))^2 = (2)/(4 *7) ) = 2/(28) = 1/14.

So |c_-|^2 = 5 * (1/14) ) = 5/14 ≈ 0.357.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.3571).

Wait, but the options given don't have exactly 9/14 and 5/14. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64 and 0.36 → which would be approx 9/14 (≈0.6428) and 5/14 (≈0.357). 0.64 is approx 9/14 (9/14 is about 0.6428), and 0.36 is 5/14 is about 0.357. So that's close.

But wait, let me compute 9/14: 9 ÷ 14 is approximately 0.642857, which rounds to 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.3571, which rounds to 0.36, so option A's first two numbers match that.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The expectation value <A> is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is given by the matrix:

[0   hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0 ]

So, when we compute <A>, we can compute the expectation value using the state |alpha> as given.

But wait, since |alpha> is a normalized state, we can compute <A> as the sum over the components. Let me write the state |alpha> as a column vector.

Given that |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, the expectation value <A> is (1/sqrt(7))² times the sum of the components:

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute it as:

<alpha| A |alpha> = ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )^* * (hbar/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) 
+ ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^* * (hbar/2) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) )

Because the matrix A has elements A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2, and A_11 = A_22 = 0.

So, <A> = (hbar/2) [ ( (1+i)* (2-i) )^* / 7 + ( (2 - i) (1+i) )^* /7 ]

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of matrix multiplication.

The expectation value is (1/sqrt(7)) (1-i) [0 (1+i) + hbar/2 (2 -i) ]

Plus (2 +i)/sqrt(7) [ hbar/2 (1 +i) + 0 (2 -i) ]

Wait, perhaps I should compute this as:

< A > = (1/sqrt(7)) * [ (1 - i) , (2 + i) ]  *  A   *  (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 +i) , (2 -i) ]^T

So, the vector is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, when you multiply the row vector (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 -i), (2 +i) ] by matrix A, which is [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]], you get:

First term: (1 - i) * 0 * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (1 - i) * (hbar/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7)
Second term: (2 + i) * (hbar/2) * (1 +i)/sqrt(7) + (2 +i)*0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

So, the product is:

= [ (1 - i) (hbar/2) (2 -i) + (2 +i) (hbar/2) (1+i) ] /7

Factor out hbar/2:

= (hbar/2) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] /7

Compute each term:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2
= 2 -i -2i + (-1)
= (2 -1) + (-3i)
= 1 -3i.

Similarly, (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i
= 2 + 2i + i + (-1)
= (2-1) + (3i)
= 1 + 3i.

So adding the two terms:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So, putting it back into <A>:

= (hbar/2) * (2) /7
= (hbar/2) * (2/7)
= hbar /7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average is hbar/7, and the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which match the 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.3571) that I calculated earlier.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7 → which matches.

Other options:

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 → perhaps different probabilities.

So, based on this, the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of the operator \( A \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Understanding the operator \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is equivalent to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the same as those of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \uparrow \rangle + | \downarrow \rangle), \quad | - \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \uparrow \rangle - | \downarrow \rangle),
\]
with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).

### Step 2: Normalizing the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)| \uparrow \rangle + (2-i)| \downarrow \rangle \). To normalize it, calculate the norm:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} | \uparrow \rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} | \downarrow \rangle.
\]

### Step 3: Expressing \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \uparrow \rangle + | \downarrow \rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \uparrow \rangle - | \downarrow \rangle).
\]
Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) as:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle.
\]
Substituting \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we solve for \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) by equating coefficients of \( | \uparrow \rangle \) and \( | \downarrow \rangle \):
\[
\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{c_+ + c_-}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{c_+ - c_-}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Adding and subtracting these equations gives:
\[
c_+ = \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2 \sqrt{7}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{7}}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculating probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are \( |c_+|^2 \) and \( |c_-|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|c_+|^2 = \left( \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2 \sqrt{7}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6428, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left( \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{2} \sqrt{7}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]
These approximate to \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

### Step 5: Calculating the average value of \( A \)
The expectation value \( \langle A \rangle \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \), the expectation value simplifies to:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \text{Re}[(1+i)(2-i)] + \text{Re}[(2+i)(1+i)] \right).
\]
After computation, \( \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of \( A \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
