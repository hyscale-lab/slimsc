Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. Oh right, the parallax of a star is the reciprocal of its distance. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution usually means the same number per unit volume. But wait, we're talking about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, maybe I need to think about how the number of stars changes as a function of parallax.

I think parallax (p) is measured in parsecs, and p = 1/d, where d is distance. So as d increases, p decreases. Now, if the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's say the number density is n.

But the question is about the number per unit parallax. So I need to relate the volume to the parallax. Let's imagine a spherical shell at a distance d with a thickness dd. The volume of this shell would be 4πd² dd. Since the number density is n, the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But since p = 1/d, d = 1/p. So substituting, the number of stars in a shell becomes n * 4π (1/p²)² * dd. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the volume is 4πd² dd. So d is 1/p, so d² is 1/p², right? So 4π (1/p²) * dd. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/p²) * (dd).

Wait, but we're considering the number per unit parallax. So how does the number of stars in a given range of parallax depend on p?

Hmm, maybe I should think about the differential number of stars. Let's say I have a range of parallax from p to p + dp. The corresponding distance would be from d = 1/p to d = 1/(p+dp). But wait, that's an infinitesimal range, so I can approximate it as dd = - (1/p²) dp. Oh, wait, because d = 1/p, so dd/dp = -1/p². So, dd = (-1/p²) dp. But since we're dealing with positive volumes, the negative would just indicate direction, but for our purposes, the magnitude is what matters.

So the number of stars in a shell at parallax p is n * 4π (1/p²) * (dp / p² ), wait. Or more accurately, substituting dd in terms of dp.

Wait, the number in this shell is n * 4π d² dd. But d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p². And dd = (1/p²) dp, but wait no, because d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. But since we're considering a small positive dp, the negative just tells us the direction; the actual volume is positive. So the number of stars would be n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp? So n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that would make the number of stars per unit parallax (dp) proportional to 1/p^4. But wait, that can't be right because that would mean the number drops off even more rapidly than I thought. But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the substitution. Let me go step by step.

We have N(p) = number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp.

Each star is at distance d = 1/p. The volume element (dV) for a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd.

The number of stars in this shell is N = n * dV = n *4π d² dd.

But since we're considering a change in parallax dp, and d = 1/p, we can express dd in terms of dp.

d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp.

The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But since we're considering the magnitude, we can write dd = (1/p²) dp.

So substituting into N:
N = n *4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * (1/p²) dp ) 
= n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So N is proportional to (1/p^4) dp. 

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx). So it's N per dp, which is proportional to 1/p^4.

But looking at the options, the first option is A) ~1/plx^4. So that's possible. But I'm a bit confused because I thought that the number of stars per unit volume is constant, so the number per unit distance would vary with distance squared, but here it's varying with 1/p^4, which is 1/(distance^4), which is more drastic.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check.

d = 1/p → p = 1/d.

dV = 4πd² dd.

Expressed in terms of p:

d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So, dV =4π ( (1/p)^2 ) * (1/p²) dp ) =4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in a thin shell at p is N =n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit range of p (dp) is proportional to 1/p^4. Hence, the number of stars per unit parallax interval decreases as 1/p^4.

But wait, I thought that when you have a uniform distribution in 3D space, the number of stars per unit distance increases with distance squared because the volume element increases with r squared. But here, since we're integrating over parallax, which is inverse of distance, the effect is different.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider that the number of stars per unit volume is n. So, in a volume dV, number is n dV.

dV is 4π d^2 dd. So number per unit volume is n, so number in that shell is n 4π d^2 dd.

But d = 1/p, so d^2 = 1/p^2; dd = 1/p² dp. So substituting, number = n4π (1/p^2) ( (1/p^2) dp ) = n4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit p is 1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4, which is option A.

Wait, but the question says 'number per unit range of parallax'. So if you have a given range of parallax (like from p to p + Δp), the number of stars in that range would be proportional to 1/p^4 multiplied by Δp. So the number per unit parallax is 1/p^4.

So the correct answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought for uniform distribution in space, the number per unit distance (d) would increase as d^2. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d^2, which makes sense because the volume element grows with d squared.

But in terms of parallax, since d =1/p, d^2 =1/p^2. So the number per unit distance (d) is proportional to 1/p^2. But the question is about number per unit parallax (p), which is a bit different.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the differential. The number of stars per unit volume is n. So, the number per unit distance is n * 4π d^2. So, when you're at a higher d, you have more stars in a shell because the volume of the shell is increasing.

But in terms of parallax, since d = 1/p, the number per unit p would be number per unit d multiplied by (dd/dp). Because d is 1/p, dd = -1/p^2 dp. So the number per unit p is (number per unit d) * (dd/dp).

Wait, number per unit d is n *4 π d^2. So, per unit d, it's n4π d^2. Then, per unit p, it's (n4π d^2) * (1/p^2) (since dd= -1/p^2 dp → dp = -p^2 dd → per unit p is per unit d divided by p^2).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me think in terms of variables.

Let me denote N(p) as the number of stars per unit parallax. So, N(p) dp is the number of stars in a parallax range dp around p.

We know that the number of stars in a distance range dd around d is n *4π d^2 dd.

Since d =1/p → p=1/d.

So, to find N(p), which is (dN/dp), I can take the derivative of the number of stars with respect to p.

The number of stars in a shell at distance d is n 4π d^2 dd.

But dd is related to dp. Since d=1/p, dd = -1/p² dp → dp = -p² dd.

So, the number of stars per unit p is (n 4π d^2 dd) / (dp) ) 

Wait, let me express it step by step.

dN = n *4π d^2 dd.

We can write dN as a function of p.

Express d in terms of p: d = 1/p.

So, d^2 = 1/p².

And dd = (1/p²) dp (taking the magnitude, since dp is positive). Wait, no. Because d =1/p → dd/dp = -1/p² → so dd = - (1/p²) dp.

But since we're considering an infinitesimal change, the sign indicates direction, but for the number of stars, we're interested in the magnitude.

So, dN = n *4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp → n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So, dN = n4π (1/p^4) dp → which means dN/dp = n4π (1/p^4).

Thus, the number per unit parallax (dN/dp) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer is option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely related to distance \( d \), such that \( p = 1/d \). The problem assumes a uniform distribution of stars in space, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant.

Consider a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \). The volume of this shell is \( dV = 4\pi d^2 dd \). The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the product of the number density \( n \) and the volume \( dV \), i.e., \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \).

Since \( d = 1/p \), we can express \( d^2 \) as \( 1/p^2 \). Additionally, \( dd \) can be related to \( dp \) using the chain rule: \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( dN/dp \)) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). Thus, as parallax increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases more rapidly than any of the other options provided.

From the given options:

- **A) ~ \( 1/p^4 \):** Matches the derived result.
- **B) ~ \( 1/p^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^2 \).
- **C) ~ \( 1/p^1 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p \).
- **D) ~ \( 1/p^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^3 \).

The correct answer is therefore **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p^4 \).
