Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking me to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle has energy levels given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And they've given E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), which means E_n = n² E. So each particle's energy depends on the square of their quantum number n.

But wait, these are spin-1/2 particles, which means for each particle, there are two possible spin states: up and down. So, the Pauli exclusion principle comes into play here because each quantum state can have at most two particles (with opposite spins).

Since it's a one-dimensional well, the particles are free to move along the x-axis only. The quantum numbers are determined by their energy levels, and each energy level can hold two particles because of spin.

So, when you have multiple particles, like four here, you need to determine how their quantum numbers are assigned to minimize the energy, which is what happens in the ground state. The particles will fill up the lowest energy levels first, up to two per level, and then move to higher levels.

Let me think about the possible quantum numbers. The first few levels are n=1, n=2, n=3, etc. Each can hold two particles.

So, for four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) can each hold two particles. Let me check: n=1 can have 2 particles, n=2 can have 2 particles. That's four in total. Wait, but wait, the number of particles is four, so the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Because each n can take two due to spin.

Wait no, each level can hold two particles. So for four particles, the first level (n=1) will have two (spin up and down), the second level (n=2) will have two as well. So all four are filled in the first two levels.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. The first excited state would be when one of the particles moves to the next available level. Wait, but how exactly does the excitation work?

Wait, no. The ground state is the arrangement with the lowest possible energy. So all four particles are in the lowest possible energy states. Since each n can take two, that's two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy for the ground state would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2). Since E_1 = (1)^2 E = E, E_2 = (2)^2 E =4E. So 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E. Wait, but wait, wait a minute. No, wait, each particle in the same n level doesn't affect each other's energy. So the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. So two particles at n=1: each contributes E, so 2E. Two at n=2: each contributes 4E, so 8E. Sum is 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But wait, looking at the options, option C says ground state is 4E, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Another possibility: perhaps the particles are fermions, so their quantum states are filled according to Pauli. But in a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n, and for spin-1/2, each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four identical fermions, how does it fill?

Wait, for four particles, the ground state is when they're all in the lowest possible states, so n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2. Or wait, maybe no. Because each n can hold two, so n=1 has two, n=2 has two. So all four are in n=1 and n=2 levels.

So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state in all options. Let me check the options:

Option A: 30E,39E,50E

Option B:4E,10E,50E

Option C:4E,10E,15E

Option D:10E,15E,18E

Wait, I must have confused the states. Let me think again. The question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

Wait, perhaps I have to think about the system's energy levels as a whole. For four particles, what's the ground state? It's when the particles occupy the lowest possible energy levels. Since each level can hold two, the four particles fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the total energy is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

So the ground state of the system has energy 10E. Then the first excited state would be when some particles are promoted to higher energy levels.

Wait, but how? Let me think about how the particles are arranged. The ground state configuration is n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2. The first excited state would be the next possible configuration with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps one particle moves from n=2 up to n=3.

So the configuration would be n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3. Let's calculate the energy here: 2*(1) + 1*(4) + 1*(9) = 2E +4E +9E =15E. So the first excited state is 15E.

Wait, but wait, maybe another configuration could have a lower energy. For example, maybe one particle jumps from n=2 to n=3, but another from n=2 to n=3 as well? No, because that would require four particles, but let's see. No, because each n can hold two, but in the ground state, n=1 and n=2 are filled. The first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3, leaving one spot in n=2 empty. No, wait, can you have more than two particles in a level? No, because of the Pauli exclusion principle. So each level can have at most two particles.

So, in the first excited state, you can't have three particles in n=2. So the next state is having one in n=3.

So the energies would be 2*(1) + 1*(4) + 1*(9) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but let me check another possibility. What if instead of moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, you move two from n=2 to n=3? No, because each n can have two. So if you have two in n=3, that's okay. But wait, that would leave one in n=2 empty? No, because in ground state, n=1 and n=2 are filled. So to get the first excited state, perhaps you can have two particles in n=3 and one in n=2? No, because that would mean n=2 has one, but originally it was filled with two. So you could have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (2). That would make four particles. So the energy would be 2*(1) +1*(4) + 2*(9) = 2E +4E +18E=24E. Hmm, but that's higher than 15E, so perhaps 15E is the first excited state.

Wait, but maybe I was wrong. Maybe the first excited state is when the highest n increases, but only by one.

Let me think again. The ground state is n=1 (2), n=2 (2): total energy 10E.

First excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. That's four particles. The energy would be 2*(1) + 1*(4) + 1*(9) =15E.

Alternatively, another configuration: n=1 (2), n=2 (2), and one particle promoted to n=3. But wait, that would require three particles in n=2, which is not allowed because each level can hold two. So that's not possible. So the first excited state must have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Total energy 2*1 + 1*4 +1*9=15E.

Then the second excited state would be next. Let's think: what's the next possible arrangement.

Another possibility is two in n=1, two in n=3. So that's two each in n=1 and n=3. The energy would be 2*(1) +2*(9) = 2E +18E=20E.

Alternatively, another configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That would give energy 2*1 +1*4 +1*16=2+4+16=22E.

Wait, but which is the lower energy between 20E and 22E? 20E is lower, so that would be the second excited state.

Wait, but perhaps the second excited state comes from moving another particle to n=3, making two in n=3.

Wait, let's think about the possible order of energies. The ground state is 10E. The first excited is 15E. Then the next possible step is to have the next possible lowest energy. So after 10E and 15E, the next would be when two particles are in n=3. So two in n=1, two in n=3: energy 2*(1) +2*(9) =2 +18=20E.

Alternatively, another way is to have one in n=2 and one in n=3, but that would require taking one from n=2. Let me think: if I have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, that's 15E. If I now promote another particle, perhaps from n=2 to n=3. So moving from n=2 (4E) to n=3 (9E), the energy increases by 5E. So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. The energy is 2*1 + 2*9= 2+18=20E.

Wait, but what about another scenario where another particle is promoted beyond n=3. For example, n=4. Let's see: if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4, that's 2*1 +1*4 +1*16=2+4+16=22E. That's higher than 20E, so the second excited state would be 20E.

Wait, but another possibility is having three particles in n=2 and one in n=3, but that's not allowed due to Pauli. So each level can have at most two particles.

So, to recap, the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 20E. But wait, looking at the options, none have 20E. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 4E,10E,15E. D is 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, none have 20E. Did I make a mistake in the configurations?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider that the particles are in different quantum states. Wait, maybe the way the particles are arranged isn't as I thought.

Another approach: each particle is in a state with quantum number n_i, and the total energy is the sum of each n_i squared multiplied by E.

So for four particles, the possible configurations (in terms of n_i) are:

Ground state: [1,1,2,2] → energy sum is (1+1 +4+4) =10E.

First excited state: [1,1,2,3] → sum is 1+1+4+9=15E.

Second excited state: [1,2,2,3] → sum 1+4+4+9=18E. Oh! Wait, that's 18E. So the energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). So looking at the options, option D says 10E,15E,18E. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, how did I get that configuration for the second excited state? Let me think. The second excited state would be the next lowest energy after the first excited state. So after [1,1,2,3] which sums to 15E, the next possible lower arrangement is when you have one in n=2 and one in n=3.

Wait, another configuration could be [1,2,2,3], which sums to 1+4+4+9=18E.

But why is that the next state? Let me think: All possible combinations in order of increasing energy.

After the ground state (10E), the next lowest is when the highest n is 3. So the next possible state could be when one particle is in n=3 and the rest are as low as possible.

Wait, another possibility: [1,1,3,3] would sum to 1+1+9+9=20E. That's higher than [1,2,2,3] which is 18E.

So the order of energies would be:

Ground state: [1,1,2,2] →10E.

First excited state: [1,1,2,3] →15E.

Second excited state: [1,2,2,3] →18E.

Yes, that makes sense. So the energies are 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). Looking at the options, option D matches this.

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we use the quantized energy levels given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
\]

Each energy level \( n \) can hold up to two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (Pauli exclusion principle). The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of all particles.

### Ground State:
In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest possible energy levels. The first two levels (\( n=1 \) and \( n=2 \)) are filled, with two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=2 \). The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes two particles in \( n=1 \), two particles in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** \( 30E, 39E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as these values are too high.
- **Option B:** \( 4E, 10E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as the ground state energy is \( 10E \), not \( 4E \).
- **Option C:** \( 4E, 10E, 15E \) — Incorrect, as the second excited state energy is \( 18E \), not \( 15E \).
- **Option D:** \( 10E, 15E, 18E \) — Correct, as it matches the calculated energies for the ground, first excited, and second excited states.

### Final Answer:
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 18E \), respectively.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking me to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

So the total energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but the options don't have 10E as the ground state in all options. Let me check the options:

Option A: 30E,39E,50E

Option B:4E,10E,50E

Option C:4E,10E,15E

Option D:10E,15E,18E

So the configuration would be n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3. Let's calculate the energy here: 2*(1) + 1*(4) + 1*(9) = 2E +4E +9E =15E. So the first excited state is 15E.

Wait, but wait, maybe another configuration could have a lower energy. For example, maybe one particle jumps from n=2 to n=3, but another from n=2 to n=3 as well? No, because that would require four particles, but let's see. No, because each n can hold two, but in the ground state, n=1 and n=2 are filled.

So the energies would be 2*(1) + 1*(4) + 1*(9) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but let me check another possibility. What if instead of moving a particle from n=2 to n=3, you move two from n=2 to n=3? No, because each n can have two. So if you have two in n=3, that's okay. But wait, that would leave one in n=2 empty? No, because in ground state, n=1 and n=2 are filled. So to get the first excited state, perhaps you can have two particles in n=3 and one in n=2? No, because that would mean n=2 has one, but originally it was filled with two. So you could have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (2). That would make four particles. So the energy would be 2*(1) +1*(4) + 2*(9) = 2E +4E +18E=24E. Hmm, but that's higher than 15E, so perhaps 15E is the first excited state.

Wait, but maybe I was wrong. Maybe the first excited state is when the highest n increases, but only by one.

Let me think again. The ground state is n=1 (2), n=2 (2): total energy 10E.

First excited state: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. That's four particles. The energy would be 2*(1) + 1*(4) + 1*(9) =15E.

Alternatively, another configuration: n=1 (2), n=2 (2), and one particle promoted to n=3. But wait, that would require three particles in n=2, which is not allowed because each level can hold two. So that's not possible. So the first excited state must have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Total energy 2*1 + 1*4 +1*9=15E.

Then the second excited state would be next. Let's think: what's the next possible arrangement.

Another possibility is two in n=1, two in n=3. So that's two each in n=1 and n=3. The energy would be 2*(1) +2*(9) = 2E +18E=20E.

Alternatively, another configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That would give energy 2*1 +1*4 +1*16=2+4+16=22E.

Wait, but which is the lower energy between 20E and 22E? 20E is lower, so that would be the second excited state.

Wait, but perhaps the second excited state comes from moving another particle to n=3, making two in n=3.

Wait, let's think about the possible order of energies. The ground state is 10E. The first excited is 15E. Then the next possible step is to have the next possible lowest energy. So after 10E and 15E, the next would be when two particles are in n=3. So two in n=1, two in n=3: energy 2*(1) +2*(9) =2 +18=20E.

Alternatively, another way is to have one in n=2 and one in n=3, but that would require taking one from n=2. Let me think: if I have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, that's 15E. If I now promote another particle, perhaps from n=2 to n=3. So moving from n=2 (4E) to n=3 (9E), the energy increases by 5E. So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. The energy is 2*1 + 2*9= 2+18=20E.

Wait, but what about another scenario where another particle is promoted beyond n=3. For example, n=4. Let's see: if we have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4, that's 2*1 +1*4 +1*16=2+4+16=22E. That's higher than 20E, so the second excited state would be 20E.

Wait, but another possibility is having three particles in n=2 and one in n=3, but that's not allowed due to Pauli. So each level can have at most two particles.

So, to recap, the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E, second excited is 20E. But wait, looking at the options, none have 20E. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 4E,10E,15E. D is 10E,15E,18E. Hmm, none have 20E. Did I make a mistake in the configurations?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider that the particles are in different quantum states. Wait, maybe the way the particles are arranged isn't as I thought.

Another approach: each particle is in a state with quantum number n_i, and the total energy is the sum of each n_i squared multiplied by E.

So for four particles, the possible configurations (in terms of n_i) are:

Ground state: [1,1,2,2] → energy sum is (1+1 +4+4) =10E.

First excited state: [1,1,2,3] → sum is 1+1+4+9=15E.

Second excited state: [1,2,2,3] → sum 1+4+4+9=18E. Oh! Wait, that's 18E. So the energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). So looking at the options, option D says 10E,15E,18E. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, how did I get that configuration for the second excited state? Let me think. The second excited state would be the next lowest energy after the first excited state. So after [1,1,2,3] which sums to 15E, the next possible lower arrangement is when you have one in n=2 and one in n=3.

Wait, another configuration could be [1,2,2,3], which sums to 1+4+4+9=18E.

But why is that the next state? Let me think: All possible combinations in order of increasing energy.

After the ground state (10E), the next lowest is when the highest n is 3. So the next possible state could be when one particle is in n=3 and the rest are as low as possible.

Wait, another possibility: [1,1,3,3] would sum to 1+1+9+9=20E. That's higher than [1,2,2,3] which is 18E.

So the order of energies would be:

Ground state: [1,1,2,2] →10E.

First excited state: [1,1,2,3] →15E.

Second excited state: [1,2,2,3] →18E.

Yes, that makes sense. So the energies are 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 18E (second excited). Looking at the options, option D matches this.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we use the quantized energy levels given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
\]

Each energy level \( n \) can hold up to two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (Pauli exclusion principle). The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of all particles.

### Ground State:
In the ground state, the particles occupy the lowest possible energy levels. The first two levels (\( n=1 \) and \( n=2 \)) are filled, with two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=2 \). The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
\]

### First Excited State:
In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes two particles in \( n=1 \), two particles in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \). The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** \( 30E, 39E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as these values are too high.
- **Option B:** \( 4E, 10E, 50E \) — Incorrect, as the ground state energy is \( 10E \), not \( 4E \).
- **Option C:** \( 4E, 10E, 15E \) — Incorrect, as the second excited state energy is \( 18E \), not \( 15E \).
- **Option D:** \( 10E, 15E, 18E \) — Correct, as it matches the calculated energies for the ground, first excited, and second excited states.

### Final Answer:
The energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E \), \( 15E \), and \( 18E \), respectively.
