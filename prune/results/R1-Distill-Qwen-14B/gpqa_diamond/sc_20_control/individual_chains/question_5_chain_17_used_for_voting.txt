Okay, let's see. I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. So, I'm supposed to find the eigenvector of a certain operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators have eigenvectors corresponding to eigenstates of certain directions.

Wait, but the operator here is P, which I think represents the momentum operator. Or maybe it's the angular momentum operator? Because the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as 2x2 matrices, which makes me think spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator components would be like S_x, S_y, S_z, but perhaps here P is the spin operator.

Wait, the operator is called P, but the components are given as 2x2 matrices, so maybe it's the spin operator. The problem says it's a quantum mechanical operator, so perhaps it's the spin component along a certain direction. Oh, wait, the question says it's the eigenvector for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is in the direction n, which is an arbitrary direction but lying in the x-z plane. So n could be represented as a unit vector (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or wait, wait, no, in the x-z plane, φ would be zero or pi/2? Wait, the x-z plane is where y=0. So the direction can be expressed as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), because theta would be the angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), no, wait, no, because if it's in the x-z plane, phi would be 0 or pi, but wait, actually, I think when the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, because phi is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis. So the direction vector would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where theta is measured from the z-axis.

But perhaps the exact parametrization isn't needed here. Because the eigenvector for the spin along an arbitrary direction n is given by the eigenstate of the spin component S·n. Alternatively, the eigenstate of S_n, where S_n is S_x n_x + S_y n_y + S_z n_z.

Since the problem states that the operator is P, which is along n. So the operator would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue for this operator is +ħ/2. So we're looking for an eigenvector |ψ> such that P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But wait, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by some matrix. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P along n is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n is in the x-z plane, n_y=0.

So P = n_x (ħ/2) σ_x + n_z (ħ/2) σ_z, where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So substituting P, we get:

n_x (ħ/2) σ_x |ψ> + n_z (ħ/2) σ_z |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

n_x σ_x |ψ> + n_z σ_z |ψ> = |ψ>

Which can be rewritten as:

( n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ>

So the operator inside the brackets is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), and |ψ> is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, but σ_x and σ_z are Pauli matrices. So I can write this as a matrix:

σ · n' where n' is (n_x, 0, n_z). Because sigma · vector is σ_x a + σ_y b + σ_z c. Here, since the y-component is zero, only σ_x and σ_z are present.

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So the matrix becomes:

n_x * [[0, 1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which gives:

[[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

And this matrix multiplied by the eigenvector |ψ> equals |ψ>.

Hmm, wait, the eigenvalues of the spin component along any direction are ±ħ/2. Oh wait, no, because the operator is scaled by ħ/2 in the components. Wait, no, the operator P is built from the components, each scaled by ħ/2. So the entire P matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix. Then, when we found that (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>, the eigenvalue for the operator (σ · n') is 1, because P is (ħ/2)(σ · n') ), so eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(±1), but in this problem, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue for (σ · n') is +1.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Where [a; b] is our eigenvector. So,

n_z a + n_x b = a,
n_x a - n_z b = b.

These are two equations.

Let's write them:

1) n_z a + n_x b = a => (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.

2) n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0.

So now, we can write these as:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.

Equation 2: n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0.

We can solve these two equations for a and b. Let's treat them as a system.

From equation 2, express a in terms of b: n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = ( (n_z +1)/n_x ) b.

Substitute this into equation 1:

(n_z -1) * ( (n_z +1)/n_x ) b + n_x b = 0.

Factor out b:

[ (n_z -1)(n_z +1) / n_x + n_x ] * b = 0.

Since b is not zero (it's an eigenvector), the bracket must be zero.

So:

(n_z^2 -1) / n_x + n_x = 0.

Multiply both sides by n_x:

n_z² -1 + n_x² = 0.

But n_x² + n_z² =1 (since n is a unit vector), so substituting:

(1 - n_x² ) -1 + n_x² = 0 → 0=0.

So the equations are consistent, which makes sense because we're dealing with an eigenvalue problem for a Hermitian operator, which has solutions.

So from equation 2, a = (n_z +1)/(n_x) * b.

But wait, n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ? Because in the x-z plane, the unit vector is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), so n_x=cosθ, n_z=sinθ.

So substituting, a = (sinθ +1)/(cosθ) * b.

Wait, but this leads to a ratio a/b = (sinθ +1)/(cosθ).

But perhaps there's a better way to parameterize the eigenvector.

Another approach: the eigenvector for spin-up along direction (n_x, 0, n_z) can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_z. The eigenstates are |+z> = [1; 0], |−z> = [0; 1].

The eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is a superposition of |+z> and |−z>:

|ψ> = α |+z> + β |−z>,

where α and β are coefficients to be determined.

So |ψ> = [α; β].

We can express this in terms of angles. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstate for spin up along direction (n_x, 0, n_z) is given by:

|ψ> = e^{-i φ/2} [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T,

where θ is the angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle (but in x-z plane, phi would be zero, perhaps? Wait, in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So the state becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, up to a global phase.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy here. Let me think again. For a general direction, the spin-up state is:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |−z>,

where theta is the angle from z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. But in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi is 0 or 180 degrees? Because the x-z plane has phi=0 or pi.

Wait, if our direction is along the x-axis, theta would be 90 degrees, phi=0. If along the z-axis, theta is 0, phi anything (but it doesn't matter because the state is |+z>).

So in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So the state becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

But wait, the phase factor e^{-i phi/2} comes into play. Since phi is zero, the state is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but actually, I think the correct expression is |+n> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard expression. The eigenstate for spin in direction n is given by:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T,

where theta is the polar angle (from z-axis), and phi is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane.

But in our problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the state becomes e^{-i 0/2} [ cos(theta/2), e^{i 0} sin(theta/2) ]^T = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, but normalized. Wait, but since it's a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates are normalized, so cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) =1, which is correct.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the direction of n, just that it's in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector is a general expression in terms of theta and phi. But in this case, since phi is zero, perhaps the answer is expressed in terms of theta/2.

Looking at the options:

Option C is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Option B is [cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)], but that's for a larger angle, perhaps.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar, but that seems odd because the eigenvectors should be dimensionless.

Wait, but in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would fit with what I'm thinking. But wait, why are the options giving different forms?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a normalization factor. Because the eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, but let's compute the normalization. The sum of squares is cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1, so it's already normalized.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2). Which matches option C.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed from its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as 2x2 matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $P_y$ component does not contribute, and the operator simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the components of the unit vector $\vec{n}$ along the x and z axes, respectively. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. $(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0$,
2. $n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0$.

From these, we find the ratio $a/b = (n_z + 1)/n_x$. Substituting $n_x = \cos\theta$ and $n_z = \sin\theta$ (since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane), the eigenvector takes the form:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing this result with the options provided:

- **Option A** includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B** involves $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$, which corresponds to a different parameterization.
- **Option C** matches the derived eigenvector: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
- **Option D** introduces additional normalization factors ($\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$), which are not present in the derived solution.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, let's see. I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. So, I'm supposed to find the eigenvector of a certain operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

The problem says it's a quantum mechanical operator, so perhaps it's the spin component along a certain direction. Oh, wait, the question says it's the eigenvector for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is in the direction n, which is an arbitrary direction but lying in the x-z plane. So n could be represented as a unit vector (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or wait, wait, no, in the x-z plane, φ would be zero or pi/2? Wait, the x-z plane is where y=0. So the direction can be expressed as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), because theta would be the angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), no, wait, no, because if it's in the x-z plane, phi would be 0 or pi, but wait, actually, I think when the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, because phi is the azimuthal angle around the z-axis.

But perhaps the exact parametrization isn't needed here. Because the eigenvector for the spin along an arbitrary direction n is given by the eigenstate of the spin component S·n. Alternatively, the eigenstate of S_n, where S_n is S_x n_x + S_y n_y + S_z n_z.

Since the problem states that the operator is P, which is along n. So the operator would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue for this operator is +ħ/2. So we're looking for an eigenvector |ψ> such that P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But wait, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by some matrix. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P along n is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n is in the x-z plane, n_y=0.

So P = n_x (ħ/2) σ_x + n_z (ħ/2) σ_z, where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So substituting P, we get:

n_x (ħ/2) σ_x |ψ> + n_z (ħ/2) σ_z |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

n_x σ_x |ψ> + n_z σ_z |ψ> = |ψ>

Which can be rewritten as:

( n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ>

So the operator inside the brackets is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), and |ψ> is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, but σ_x and σ_z are Pauli matrices. So I can write this as a matrix:

σ · n' where n' is (n_x, 0, n_z). Because sigma · vector is σ_x a + σ_y b + σ_z c. Here, since the y-component is zero, only σ_x and σ_z are present.

But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1. So the matrix becomes:

n_x * [[0, 1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which gives:

[[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

And this matrix multiplied by the eigenvector |ψ> equals |ψ>.

Hmm, wait, the eigenvalues of the spin component along any direction are ±ħ/2. Oh wait, no, because the operator is scaled by ħ/2 in the components. Wait, no, the operator P is built from the components, each scaled by ħ/2. So the entire P matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix. Then, when we found that (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z)|ψ> = |ψ>, the eigenvalue for the operator (σ · n') is 1, because P is (ħ/2)(σ · n') ), so eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(±1), but in this problem, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue for (σ · n') is +1.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Where [a; b] is our eigenvector. So,

n_z a + n_x b = a,
n_x a - n_z b = b.

These are two equations.

Let's write them:

1) n_z a + n_x b = a => (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.

2) n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0.

So now, we can write these as:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0.

Equation 2: n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0.

We can solve these two equations for a and b. Let's treat them as a system.

From equation 2, express a in terms of b: n_x a = (n_z +1) b → a = ( (n_z +1)/n_x ) b.

Substitute this into equation 1:

(n_z -1) * ( (n_z +1)/n_x ) b + n_x b = 0.

Factor out b:

[ (n_z -1)(n_z +1) / n_x + n_x ] * b = 0.

Since b is not zero (it's an eigenvector), the bracket must be zero.

So:

(n_z^2 -1) / n_x + n_x = 0.

Multiply both sides by n_x:

n_z² -1 + n_x² = 0.

But n_x² + n_z² =1 (since n is a unit vector), so substituting:

(1 - n_x² ) -1 + n_x² = 0 → 0=0.

So the equations are consistent, which makes sense because we're dealing with an eigenvalue problem for a Hermitian operator, which has solutions.

So from equation 2, a = (n_z +1)/(n_x) * b.

But wait, n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ? Because in the x-z plane, the unit vector is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), so n_x=cosθ, n_z=sinθ.

So substituting, a = (sinθ +1)/(cosθ) * b.

Wait, but this leads to a ratio a/b = (sinθ +1)/(cosθ).

But perhaps there's a better way to parameterize the eigenvector.

Another approach: the eigenvector for spin-up along direction (n_x, 0, n_z) can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_z. The eigenstates are |+z> = [1; 0], |−z> = [0; 1].

The eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is a superposition of |+z> and |−z>:

|ψ> = α |+z> + β |−z>,

where α and β are coefficients to be determined.

So |ψ> = [α; β].

We can express this in terms of angles. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstate for spin up along direction (n_x, 0, n_z) is given by:

|ψ> = e^{-i φ/2} [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T,

where θ is the angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle (but in x-z plane, phi would be zero, perhaps? Wait, in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So the state becomes [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, up to a global phase.

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T,

where theta is the polar angle (from z-axis), and phi is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane.

But in our problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the state becomes e^{-i 0/2} [ cos(theta/2), e^{i 0} sin(theta/2) ]^T = [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

So the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, but normalized. Wait, but since it's a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates are normalized, so cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) =1, which is correct.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the direction of n, just that it's in the x-z plane. So the eigenvector is a general expression in terms of theta and phi. But in this case, since phi is zero, perhaps the answer is expressed in terms of theta/2.

Looking at the options:

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed from its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as 2x2 matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $P_y$ component does not contribute, and the operator simplifies to:

\[
\vec{P} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]

where $n_x$ and $n_z$ are the components of the unit vector $\vec{n}$ along the x and z axes, respectively. Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

1. $(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0$,
2. $n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0$.

From these, we find the ratio $a/b = (n_z + 1)/n_x$. Substituting $n_x = \cos\theta$ and $n_z = \sin\theta$ (since $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane), the eigenvector takes the form:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing this result with the options provided:

- **Option A** includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B** involves $\cos(\theta)$ and $\sin(\theta)$, which corresponds to a different parameterization.
- **Option C** matches the derived eigenvector: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
- **Option D** introduces additional normalization factors ($\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$), which are not present in the derived solution.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
