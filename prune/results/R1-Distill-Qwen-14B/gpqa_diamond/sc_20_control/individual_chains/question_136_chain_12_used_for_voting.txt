Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field's magnitude is 1/r² and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember from my classes that divergence is a measure of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. So, if the field is radial and it's 1/r², this reminds me of an electric field, like Coulomb's law. But wait, the electric field due to a point charge is proportional to 1/r² and radial. Oh, right, and the divergence of such a field in free space is zero except at the origin. Because the divergence depends on the derivative of the field.

So, the field f(r) is only along the radial direction. Let's denote it as f(r) = f_r(r) * r_hat, where r_hat is the unit radial vector. The magnitude is given as 1/r², so f_r(r) = 1/r².

To find the divergence of f, I need to compute ∇·f. In spherical coordinates, the divergence for a vector field with only the radial component is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r). So substituting f_r, that becomes (1/r²) d/dr [r² * (1/r²)].

Let me compute that. r squared times 1 over r squared is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇·f is zero everywhere except at r=0, where the function isn't defined because f would be infinite there.

Wait, but the integral is over the volume inside a sphere of radius R. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, which is a point, then the integral over the entire volume should be zero, right? Because the integral of zero over any volume is zero, unless there's a delta function or something at a point.

Wait, but wait. There's a theorem called Gauss's theorem (or divergence theorem) that relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

But since flux would be the integral of f · n da over the sphere's surface, where n is the outward normal (which is r_hat here). So f · n is just f_r at r=R, which is 1/R². So the flux integral is (1/R²) times the surface area of the sphere.

The surface area is 4πR². So flux is (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

But wait, according to Gauss's theorem, that should equal the volume integral of ∇·f. But earlier I thought ∇·f is zero. So what's going on here?

Ah, because the divergence is only zero everywhere except at r=0. At r=0, the field has a singularity, right? So the divergence isn't actually zero everywhere. Wait, no—wait, when r approaches zero, the field becomes stronger, but in terms of the divergence calculation, we saw that the divergence is zero except at r=0. But wait, no: actually, when r approaches zero, you can't have a well-defined vector field because f(r) becomes infinite. So perhaps the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin where it's a delta function.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The divergence in the regions outside the origin is zero, but at the origin, the field's divergence would be a delta function, which Gauss's theorem would account for.

Wait, but the vector field is given as f(r) = 1/r² in the radial direction. So the divergence is only non-zero at r=0. So when I integrate the divergence over a volume that includes the origin, the integral would be the flux through the surface, which is 4π. But if the volume doesn't include the origin, the integral would be zero.

Wait, in this problem, the sphere of radius R is centered at the origin, so it definitely includes the origin. Hence, the volume integral of ∇·f would be 4π. But wait, earlier I thought that the divergence was zero everywhere except the origin, which contributes a delta function.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing ∇·f. Let me re-examine that.

So divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). So f_r(r) is 1/r².

So substituting, we get (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr [1].

The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero, so the divergence is zero. Wait, but that's only when r is not zero. Because at r=0, the function is singular. So the divergence is zero everywhere except r=0, where the function isn't defined, and the divergence isn't zero but rather involves a Dirac delta function to account for the point source.

Wait, so perhaps the divergence isn't zero, but instead, the volume integral ends up being non-zero because of the origin.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the divergence in more detail.

Wait, let me think about the electric field analogy. The electric field due to a point charge is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) r_hat. The divergence of E is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So the divergence is (ε₀) ∇·E = ρ/ε₀, where ρ is the charge density. So ∇·E = (ρ / ε₀ ), but since the charge is a point charge at origin, ρ is a delta function.

Wait, so applying that, for f(r) = 1/r² r_hat, perhaps the divergence is a delta function scaled by 4π.

But in our problem, the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r_hat. Let's compute ∇·f. So, mathematically, in the regions where r is not zero, the divergence is zero. But when integrating over a region that includes r=0, the divergence's integral would include a term for the singularity.

So the integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R is equal to the flux through the surface. As I calculated earlier, that flux is 4π.

Wait, but if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral would be the same as the integral over the entire space except the origin, which would be zero, but since the origin is included, the integral is 4π.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me try to think of this more formally.

The divergence theorem says that the volume integral of the divergence of f over a region V is equal to the flux of f through the surface S bounding V.

In our case, V is a sphere of radius R. So the flux is the integral of f dot n da over S. n is the outward normal, which is r_hat. So f · n is (1/R²) * 1, because at the surface r=R, f_r is 1/R².

So the flux is ∫ (1/R²) * da over the sphere's surface. The surface area of a sphere is 4π R², so the integral becomes (1/R²)*(4 π R²) )= 4π. So the flux is 4π.

But according to the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux, which is 4π. So that would suggest that the answer is 4π.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the divergence, I thought it was zero everywhere except at the origin. So how does that reconcile? Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except a point, then the volume integral would be the integral of a function that is zero almost everywhere except at a point, which would be zero, but that's not correct because flux shows it's 4π. So I must have made a mistake in the divergence calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the divergence more carefully.

The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field F = F_r r_hat + F_θ θ_hat + F_φ φ_hat is:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (F_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂F_φ / ∂φ.

But in our case, F_θ and F_φ are zero, so only the first term remains.

F_r is 1/r². So,

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr [1] = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except r=0, where the function is not defined, and the divergence doesn't exist either. But when calculating the integral, we have to account for the origin's contribution.

Ah, I see. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, so the volume integral would normally be zero. But wait, that contradicts the flux calculation which is 4π. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps in reality, the divergence is a delta function at r=0. So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r), because when integrating over any volume that includes the origin, the integral becomes 4π.

But how did I get that? Let me think again. Let's consider the flux through a sphere of radius R around the origin.

If I have a point charge, the flux is 4π if the charge is 1. Wait, in the electric field analogy, the divergence of E is ρ/ε₀. So, for E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) r_hat, the divergence is (q/(ε₀)) δ³(r).

So, let's compute the divergence of E:

∇·E = (1/(4πε₀)) * ∇· ( (q / r² ) r_hat )

We can compute this as (1/(4πε₀)) * [ (1/r²) d/dr (r² (q / r² )) ]

= (1/(4πε₀)) [ (1/r²) d/dr (q) ) ]

= (1/(4πε₀)) [ 0 ] = 0, except at r=0.

But wait, if I apply the divergence theorem to the sphere, the flux is (1/(4πε₀)) * (4π q) )= q / ε₀. So the integral of ∇·E over the volume would be q / ε₀, but since ∇·E is zero except at r=0, it must be that the divergence includes a delta function there. So, the correct expression for ∇·E is (q δ³(r)) / ε₀.

In our problem, f(r) is (1/r² ) r_hat. Let's compare this to E. Let me set E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) r_hat. So our f(r) would correspond to E where q/(4πε₀) = 1. So q = 4π ε₀. Wait, but that's getting a bit into the weeds.

Alternatively, perhaps f(r) = (1/r² ) r_hat is analogous to E with q/(4πε₀) = 1. So, in that case, the divergence of E would be (q/(ε₀ )) δ³(r). So for our f, ∇·f would be (4π ε₀ * (1/(4π ε₀ )) )) δ³(r) )? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, if E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) r_hat, then ∇·E = (q/(ε₀ )) δ^3(r).

So for our f, which is (1/r²) r_hat, perhaps f = (1/(4π ε₀)) (q/r²) r_hat, so q/(4π ε₀) ) =1 → q=4π ε₀.

Then, ∇·f = (q/(ε₀ )) δ³(r) ) → substituting q=4π ε₀, we get (4π ε₀ / ε₀) δ³(r) ) → 4π δ³(r).

So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r).

Ah, that makes sense. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's a delta function scaled by 4π.

So, when we compute the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R, it's the integral of 4π δ³(r) over the volume, which is 4π. Because the delta function integrates to 1 over any volume containing the origin.

So the integral is 4π.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the flux, I also got 4π. That's consistent. So whether I compute the volume integral directly (which gives 4π due to the delta function) or use the divergence theorem (flux through surface is 4π), both agree.

So the correct answer would be 4π. Looking at the options, option A is 4π.

So the answer should be A.

The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin. The vector field is radial, with a magnitude given by **f(r) = 1/r²**, and it has no components in the angular directions in spherical coordinates.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Divergence of the Vector Field**:
   - In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field with only a radial component **F_r** is given by:
     \[
     \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F_r \right).
     \]
   - Substituting **F_r = 1/r²**, we compute:
     \[
     \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0,
     \]
     everywhere except at **r = 0**, where the field becomes singular.

2. **Singularity at the Origin**:
   - The vector field **f(r)** has a singularity at the origin, where it becomes infinite. To account for this, the divergence at the origin is represented as a Dirac delta function:
     \[
     \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r).
     \]
   - This ensures that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it contributes a point-like source.

3. **Volume Integral of the Divergence**:
   - The volume integral of **∇ · f** over the sphere of radius **R** is:
     \[
     \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_V 4\pi \delta^3(r) \, dV.
     \]
   - The delta function integrates to 1 over any volume containing the origin, so the result is:
     \[
     \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
     \]

4. **Consistency with Gauss's Theorem**:
   - Gauss's theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the vector field through the surface of the sphere:
     \[
     \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA,
     \]
     where **n** is the outward unit normal vector to the surface. For the given vector field, the flux through the surface is:
     \[
     \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = \int_S \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 1 \, dA = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
     \]
   - This matches the result of the volume integral, confirming the consistency of the calculation.

### Conclusion:
The volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f(r)** inside the sphere of radius **R** is **4π**. This corresponds to option **A**.
