Okay, so I need to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. When heated with excess KOH, I think this is probably an elimination reaction. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. 

Wait, elimination usually involves the loss of two substituents (like X and H) to form a double bond. So, heating with KOH would likely produce 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Then, the product 1 is a light yellow solid. The NMR spectrum of product 1 has signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR shows a strong peak around 1720 cm-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group. Oh wait, that doesn't fit with an alkene. Maybe it's an epoxide or something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not elimination but substitution. If KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a double substitution. Each Br would be replaced by OH groups. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH would form 1,3-diol adamantane. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl peak? That doesn't fit. Oh, perhaps it's an oxidation process. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm, maybe it's elimination. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: if KOH is used, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something similar. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a diene. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But then where does the carbonyl come from? Alternatively, maybe it's not elimination but a substitution leading to a ketone. Wait, no, substitution of Br with OH wouldn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Because epoxides typically show an IR peak around 1240-1260 cm^-1, which isn't matching the given 1720. So that's probably not it. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. For a carbonyl, the IR is around 1700, so 1720 is a bit high. Maybe an ester or something else.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2- group or perhaps a vinyl proton. But in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether. Or perhaps an alcohol. But in the IR, the carbonyl suggests maybe an ester or ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene with some substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a diene. So the product is 1,3-adamantadiene. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, let me think differently. The IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How can that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Oh wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by keto-enol tautomerism? Or maybe it's a substitution where two Brs are replaced by something else, but I don't see how that leads to a carbonyl.

Wait another thought: maybe the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization? Or perhaps a neighboring group participation. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a cyclopropane ring? But that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, maybe I should look at the next steps. The product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst. So what kind of reaction occurs when product 1 is treated with a Lewis acid? If product 1 is an epoxide, perhaps it's ring-opening. Or if it's a diene, maybe some Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but product 1's IR has a peak at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is a ketone. Then, when treated with Al(isopropoxide)3, which is a Lewis acid, it could undergo some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, like a keto-enol tautomerism, or perhaps a rearrangement.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an ester (which would have a carbonyl), then heating with aluminum isopropoxide could lead to some kind of elimination or perhaps a Claisen rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about product 1. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), a multiplet around 2.4-2.23 (10H), and a triplet at 1.94 ppm (2H). The 10H region is probably the adamantane skeleton. The 2H at 4.79 could be an OCH2 group, but then why the carbonyl? Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group. For example, in an epoxide, the protons are around 3.5-4.5, so 4.79 seems a bit high.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution of Br with something else, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. If the two Br groups are replaced by ketones, but that would require two elimination steps, which seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, but I'm missing something. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings. 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons. So when two Brs are present, elimination would form a double bond between those positions. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, which would have a conjugated diene structure.

But then how does the IR show a carbonyl? That doesn't fit. Unless I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the product is not the diene but a diol. If KOH substitutes both Br with OH groups, product 1 would be 1,3-diol adamantane. Then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the next steps. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a diol, then heating with a Lewis acid could lead to some kind of cyclization, like forming an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a diene, perhaps when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of Diels-Alder reaction, but without a dienophile, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone and product 2 is an enol ether or something like that. Let me think. If product 1 is a ketone, then Al isopropoxide could help in some kind of enol formation.

Wait, but product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis typically cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have carbonyl-containing fragments.

But wait, the initial products: the first step produces product 1, then product 2 is formed from product 1, and product 3 is formed from product 2 via ozonolysis.

So putting it together: after KOH, product 1 is formed, then treated with Al isopropoxide to make product 2, which has a double bond, and then product 2 is ozonolyzed.

Wait, so product 2 must have a double bond. Because ozonolysis acts on alkenes. So product 2 has a double bond.

So, product 1 might be something that can form a double bond when treated with Al isopropoxide. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes elimination to form a diene (product 2). So, product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bonds into carbonyls.

But wait, 1,3-adamantadiene is a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would typically form two carbonyl groups. But the structure of adamantadiene is such that ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones, perhaps.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3. So product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would have carbonyl groups. But in the NMR, they're asking about the coupling of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

Wait, maybe the most deshielded hydrogen is on a carbonyl adjacent position. Or perhaps it's a hydrogen next to an oxygen.

Wait, ozonolysis of a diene would break the molecule into two or more carbonyl compounds. Let me think about the structure. If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would likely break it into two carbonyl compounds connected by an oxygen bridge? Or maybe two separate carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane after KOH could form a diol. Then, upon treatment with Al isopropoxide (a strong Lewis acid), the diol could lose water to form a diene via elimination. So product 2 is the diene, 1,3-adamantadiene.

Then, ozonolysis of this diene would cleave each double bond. Wait, but 1,3-adamantadiene is a conjugated diene, so ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But in adamantane, the conjugated diene is in a bridge structure, so ozonolysis might produce two ketones or something similar.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to visualize the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So, if there's a double bond between 1 and 3, then ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups. But given the complex structure, the resulting product might have multiple carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would lead to the formation of two ketones, each on a bridgehead. But I'm not entirely sure about the structure.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded would be the one closest to the carbonyl group, perhaps. In an aldehyde, the alpha hydrogen is deshielded.

But wait, in ozonolysis, if the diene is cleaved, it would form carbonyl groups. For example, if the diene is a four-membered system, ozonolysis might give two ketones. Alternatively, if the diene is part of a larger ring, perhaps the ozonolysis would form two carbonyls connected by a chain.

But perhaps product 3 is a diketone. Let me think about the NMR of a diketone. The hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear downfield.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be a methylene group next to a carbonyl. Or perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, another angle: when ozonolysis is performed on a diene, each end of the diene becomes a carbonyl group. So, if the diene is in a bridge structure, the ozonolysis would break the bridge, leading to two carbonyl groups attached to the remaining structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is in a position where ozonolysis forms a single carbonyl group. Wait, no, ozonolysis of a diene would typically produce two carbonyls. For example, 1,3-pentadiene would become two aldehydes.

Wait, but in product 3, the NMR is the focus. The most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.

In the case of a ketone, the alpha hydrogens (next to carbonyl) would be deshielded. For a simple ketone like acetone, the methyl group is split into a singlet, but if it's part of a larger structure, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis, the product might have more than one adjacent hydrogen. Let me think of an example. If the diene is in a six-membered ring, ozonolysis might break it into two three-carbon fragments, each with a carbonyl group.

But in the case of adamantane's diene, the structure is more rigid. Maybe the ozonolysis leads to two ketones on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with adjacent carbonyl groups. Then, the hydrogen adjacent to two carbonyls would be deshielded and have coupling with neighboring hydrogens.

Alternatively, maybe each of the carbonyls is connected to a CH2 group. So, each CH2 would be next to a carbonyl.

Wait, if a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, the hydrogens on the CH2 would couple with each other and with any adjacent hydrogens. For instance, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would see two neighboring Hs on each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets or something more complex.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, the coupling would be more complex.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. Let me think of the possible structures.

Suppose product 3 has two carbonyl groups, and each is attached to a CH2 group. Then, each CH2 would have two Hs, which would couple with each other (as a triplet) and with any neighboring groups. If the neighboring group is another CH2, each H would see two Hs from their own CH2 and two from the adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets. Or perhaps more.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH that has two Hs, then each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but let's think about a specific case. Let's say after ozonolysis, each of the two carbonyl groups is attached to a CH2 group. So the structure is something like O=C-R-CH2-C=O. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, another possibility: the ozonolysis cleaves the diene into two carbonyl groups, each connected to a bridge structure. So the product might have two carbonyl groups connected to bridgehead CH2 groups.

In that case, each CH2 would be adjacent to a carbonyl. The Hs on these CH2 groups would couple with each other. Since each H is on a CH2, which has two Hs, each H would see two neighboring Hs from their own group and potentially others.

Wait, but if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H on the CH2 would see the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. So for each H, it would have coupling with two Hs on the same CH2 (as a triplet) and perhaps with Hs on adjacent CH2 groups (maybe leading to more splitting).

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, leading to a coupling pattern where each H is split by adjacent Hs from both the same and neighboring groups.

Wait, for example, consider a structure where two CH2 groups are adjacent, each next to a carbonyl. Each H on one CH2 would couple with the two Hs on that same CH2 (giving a triplet) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 which is adjacent to another CH2, the splitting could become more complex. But in the given options, the options don't go beyond triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, another consideration: the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to the carbonyl. Let's think about a simple case. If the structure is something like (CH2)2(C=O), then the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have Hs that are deshielded. Each H on that CH2 would see two Hs from the same group (giving a triplet) and perhaps any Hs from neighboring groups. If the adjacent group is another CH2, then each H would also see two Hs from that group, leading to each H being split into a triplet of triplets (each triplet from the same CH2 and another triplet from the adjacent CH2).

Alternatively, maybe each CH2 is next to a CH group, which has two Hs. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH. This would result in a quartet for each H because 2 + 2 = 4 neighbors, but wait, that's not matching the options. Alternatively, each H would see two from own CH2 and two from the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet of triplets (each coupling into a triplet from own group and another triplet from the adjacent group).

Wait, but let me think of a specific example. Suppose we have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each of the middle CH2 groups is adjacent to another CH2. Each H on the middle CH2 would have neighboring Hs on both sides. So each H on the middle CH2 would see two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So for each H, the splitting would be (n+1) for each neighboring group. So, each H would be a triplet from their own CH2, and a triplet from the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

That makes sense. So the most deshielded H would be in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H would be a triplet of triplets due to coupling with two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Looking at the options, that's option B) triplet of triplets.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction (KOH at 240°C):**  
   The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH produces product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the presence of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This indicates that the reaction likely forms a diketone or a compound with two carbonyl groups.

2. **Second Reaction (Aluminum Isopropoxide):**  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of product 2, which contains a double bond. This is inferred because the subsequent ozonolysis step targets alkenes.

3. **Ozonolysis (-78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide):**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, producing product 3. The cleavage of the double bond results in the formation of carbonyl-containing fragments. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is expected to be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3:**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (producing a triplet) and the two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (producing another triplet). This results in a "triplet of triplets" coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.

Okay, so I need to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. When heated with excess KOH, I think this is probably an elimination reaction. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. 

Wait, elimination usually involves the loss of two substituents (like X and H) to form a double bond. So, heating with KOH would likely produce 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Then, the product 1 is a light yellow solid. The NMR spectrum of product 1 has signals at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR shows a strong peak around 1720 cm-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group. Oh wait, that doesn't fit with an alkene. Maybe it's an epoxide or something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not elimination but substitution. If KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a double substitution. Each Br would be replaced by OH groups. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH would form 1,3-diol adamantane. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl peak? That doesn't fit. Oh, perhaps it's an oxidation process. Wait, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm, maybe it's elimination. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: if KOH is used, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something similar. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane would undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a diene. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But then where does the carbonyl come from? Alternatively, maybe it's not elimination but a substitution leading to a ketone. Wait, no, substitution of Br with OH wouldn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Because epoxides typically show an IR peak around 1240-1260 cm^-1, which isn't matching the given 1720. So that's probably not it. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. For a carbonyl, the IR is around 1700, so 1720 is a bit high. Maybe an ester or something else.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an -OCH2- group or perhaps a vinyl proton. But in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether. Or perhaps an alcohol. But in the IR, the carbonyl suggests maybe an ester or ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene with some substituent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination to form a diene. So the product is 1,3-adamantadiene. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, let me think differently. The IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How can that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Oh wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by keto-enol tautomerism? Or maybe it's a substitution where two Brs are replaced by something else, but I don't see how that leads to a carbonyl.

Wait another thought: maybe the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization? Or perhaps a neighboring group participation. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a cyclopropane ring? But that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, maybe I should look at the next steps. The product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst. So what kind of reaction occurs when product 1 is treated with a Lewis acid? If product 1 is an epoxide, perhaps it's ring-opening. Or if it's a diene, maybe some Diels-Alder reaction? Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but product 1's IR has a peak at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl, so maybe product 1 is a ketone. Then, when treated with Al(isopropoxide)3, which is a Lewis acid, it could undergo some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction, like a keto-enol tautomerism, or perhaps a rearrangement.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an ester (which would have a carbonyl), then heating with aluminum isopropoxide could lead to some kind of elimination or perhaps a Claisen rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again about product 1. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), a multiplet around 2.4-2.23 (10H), and a triplet at 1.94 ppm (2H). The 10H region is probably the adamantane skeleton. The 2H at 4.79 could be an OCH2 group, but then why the carbonyl? Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group. For example, in an epoxide, the protons are around 3.5-4.5, so 4.79 seems a bit high.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a double elimination, forming a cyclopropane ring. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution of Br with something else, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. If the two Br groups are replaced by ketones, but that would require two elimination steps, which seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination, but I'm missing something. Let me think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings. 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons. So when two Brs are present, elimination would form a double bond between those positions. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, which would have a conjugated diene structure.

But then how does the IR show a carbonyl? That doesn't fit. Unless I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the product is not the diene but a diol. If KOH substitutes both Br with OH groups, product 1 would be 1,3-diol adamantane. Then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at the next steps. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is a diol, then heating with a Lewis acid could lead to some kind of cyclization, like forming an epoxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a diene, perhaps when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of Diels-Alder reaction, but without a dienophile, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone and product 2 is an enol ether or something like that. Let me think. If product 1 is a ketone, then Al isopropoxide could help in some kind of enol formation.

Wait, but product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis typically cleaves alkenes into carbonyl compounds. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Then, product 3 would have carbonyl-containing fragments.

But wait, the initial products: the first step produces product 1, then product 2 is formed from product 1, and product 3 is formed from product 2 via ozonolysis.

So putting it together: after KOH, product 1 is formed, then treated with Al isopropoxide to make product 2, which has a double bond, and then product 2 is ozonolyzed.

Wait, so product 2 must have a double bond. Because ozonolysis acts on alkenes. So product 2 has a double bond.

So, product 1 might be something that can form a double bond when treated with Al isopropoxide. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes elimination to form a diene (product 2). So, product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene. Then, ozonolysis would break the double bonds into carbonyls.

But wait, 1,3-adamantadiene is a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would typically form two carbonyl groups. But the structure of adamantadiene is such that ozonolysis would cleave it into two ketones, perhaps.

But the question is about the NMR of product 3. So product 3 is the ozonolysis product, which would have carbonyl groups. But in the NMR, they're asking about the coupling of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

Wait, ozonolysis of a diene would break the molecule into two or more carbonyl compounds. Let me think about the structure. If product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would likely break it into two carbonyl compounds connected by an oxygen bridge? Or maybe two separate carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane after KOH could form a diol. Then, upon treatment with Al isopropoxide (a strong Lewis acid), the diol could lose water to form a diene via elimination. So product 2 is the diene, 1,3-adamantadiene.

Then, ozonolysis of this diene would cleave each double bond. Wait, but 1,3-adamantadiene is a conjugated diene, so ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But in adamantane, the conjugated diene is in a bridge structure, so ozonolysis might produce two ketones or something similar.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to visualize the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads.

Alternatively, maybe each of the carbonyls is connected to a CH2 group. So, each CH2 would be next to a carbonyl.

Wait, if a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl, the hydrogens on the CH2 would couple with each other and with any adjacent hydrogens. For instance, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would see two neighboring Hs on each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets or something more complex.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH group, the coupling would be more complex.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. Let me think of the possible structures.

Suppose product 3 has two carbonyl groups, and each is attached to a CH2 group. Then, each CH2 would have two Hs, which would couple with each other (as a triplet) and with any neighboring groups. If the neighboring group is another CH2, each H would see two Hs from their own CH2 and two from the adjacent, leading to a triplet of triplets. Or perhaps more.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to a CH that has two Hs, then each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but let's think about a specific case. Let's say after ozonolysis, each of the two carbonyl groups is attached to a CH2 group. So the structure is something like O=C-R-CH2-C=O. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, another possibility: the ozonolysis cleaves the diene into two carbonyl groups, each connected to a bridge structure. So the product might have two carbonyl groups connected to bridgehead CH2 groups.

In that case, each CH2 would be adjacent to a carbonyl. The Hs on these CH2 groups would couple with each other. Since each H is on a CH2, which has two Hs, each H would see two neighboring Hs from their own group and potentially others.

Wait, but if the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H on the CH2 would see the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. So for each H, it would have coupling with two Hs on the same CH2 (as a triplet) and perhaps with Hs on adjacent CH2 groups (maybe leading to more splitting).

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, leading to a coupling pattern where each H is split by adjacent Hs from both the same and neighboring groups.

Wait, for example, consider a structure where two CH2 groups are adjacent, each next to a carbonyl. Each H on one CH2 would couple with the two Hs on that same CH2 (giving a triplet) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 which is adjacent to another CH2, the splitting could become more complex. But in the given options, the options don't go beyond triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, another consideration: the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to the carbonyl. Let's think about a simple case. If the structure is something like (CH2)2(C=O), then the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have Hs that are deshielded. Each H on that CH2 would see two Hs from the same group (giving a triplet) and perhaps any Hs from neighboring groups. If the adjacent group is another CH2, then each H would also see two Hs from that group, leading to each H being split into a triplet of triplets (each triplet from the same CH2 and another triplet from the adjacent CH2).

Alternatively, maybe each CH2 is next to a CH group, which has two Hs. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH. This would result in a quartet for each H because 2 + 2 = 4 neighbors, but wait, that's not matching the options. Alternatively, each H would see two from own CH2 and two from the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet of triplets (each coupling into a triplet from own group and another triplet from the adjacent group).

Wait, but let me think of a specific example. Suppose we have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each of the middle CH2 groups is adjacent to another CH2. Each H on the middle CH2 would have neighboring Hs on both sides. So each H on the middle CH2 would see two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So for each H, the splitting would be (n+1) for each neighboring group. So, each H would be a triplet from their own CH2, and a triplet from the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

That makes sense. So the most deshielded H would be in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H would be a triplet of triplets due to coupling with two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Looking at the options, that's option B) triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction (KOH at 240°C):**  
   The reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH produces product 1. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the presence of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This indicates that the reaction likely forms a diketone or a compound with two carbonyl groups.

2. **Second Reaction (Aluminum Isopropoxide):**  
   Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates the formation of product 2, which contains a double bond. This is inferred because the subsequent ozonolysis step targets alkenes.

3. **Ozonolysis (-78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide):**  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, producing product 3. The cleavage of the double bond results in the formation of carbonyl-containing fragments. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is expected to be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3:**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the same CH₂ group (producing a triplet) and the two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group (producing another triplet). This results in a "triplet of triplets" coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.
