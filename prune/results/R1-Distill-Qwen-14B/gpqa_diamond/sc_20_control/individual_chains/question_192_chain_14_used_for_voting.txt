Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's try to think it through. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields. Oh right, in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor redistribute themselves.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So the cavity isn't centered, which is a bit unusual. Then, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. 

The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. 

Wait, so I need to find E at point P. Let me recall Gauss's Law. For a spherical symmetric charge distribution, the electric field outside depends only on the total enclosed charge. But in this case, the setup isn't symmetric because the cavity isn't at the center. So how does that affect things?

Wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. When the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in a conductor with a cavity, the charges will rearrange. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material must stay neutral overall. Because the conductor was uncharged, and +q is inside, the inner surface must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. 

Then, what about the outer surface? Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q. Because conductor's total charge is zero (initially), so inner surface -q, outer +q. 

But wait, the cavity is not at the center. Oh right, so the charge induced on the inner surface might not be uniformly distributed. The inner surface charge would be distributed in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. 

But wait, inside the conductor, the net field is zero. So the field due to all charges must cancel. The field from the +q in the cavity and the inner induced charge must produce zero inside the conductor. 

So, the induced charges on the inner surface will create a dipole or some other field? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, if the cavity is offset, the inner surface charge isn't symmetric. So the inner surface charge would arrange in a way that the field inside the conductor (the material) is zero. But how does that affect the field outside?

But when considering the electric field outside the conductor, what matters is the total enclosed charge within the Gaussian surface. The Gaussian surface here is outside the conductor, so it encloses the entire conductor. The conductor itself has a net charge of zero because initially it was uncharged, and then we added +q which must have induced a -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer. Wait, no: wait, the conductor was initially neutral. When we put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. Then, the outer surface must have +q because the conductor's total charge is zero (since it was initially neutral, and the +q inside the cavity is not part of the conductor's material). 

So the outer surface has +q. But wait, no, the conductor's material is neutral. The conductor's total charge is zero. The inner surface has -q, the outer surface has +q to make the total charge zero. So any Gaussian surface outside the conductor would enclose the +q on the outer surface. 

Wait, but wait a minute. The conductor's total charge is zero, but the outer surface's charge is +q. So when I use Gauss's law outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface will enclose the outer charge, which is +q. So the electric field outside would be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center, right? Because the Gaussian surface would be a sphere with radius L, so the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²) directed radially outward. 

But wait, wait. The charge inside the conductor's cavity is +q, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the total enclosed charge in the Gaussian surface outside is +q. So the electric field at point P (outside) would be as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. So the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). 

But wait, the position of the cavity's center is s away from the conductor's center. Would that affect the field outside? Because in a Gaussian surface outside, the conductor's induced charge is symmetrically distributed. Because the outer surface's charge distribution is determined by the shape of the conductor, but in this case, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution regardless of the cavity's position. Because the conductor is a sphere, any excess charge on the outer surface would distribute uniformly, regardless of what's going on inside. 

So even if the cavity is off-center, the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed. So the field outside is the same as a point charge +q at the center. So the answer should be option B, which is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). 

Wait, but let me think again. The point P is outside the conductor. But the question gives l, which is the distance from P to the cavity's center. Hmm, but the conductor's radius is R, and l is greater than R. So point P is outside the conductor (since L > R). So the field at P depends on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface that encloses point P. 

The Gaussian surface is a sphere of radius L, centered at the conductor's center. The conductor's material has a net charge of zero, but the outer surface has +q. So the Gaussian surface encloses +q, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). So the answer is B. 

Looking at the options, B is that expression. 

Wait, but why are the other options considered? Option A and C involve l and s and cosθ. But I thought the field outside only depends on the total charge, which is +q, and the distance from the center, so L. Option D uses l squared, but l is the distance from the cavity center, not the conductor's. 

So yeah, the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small off-center cavity of radius $r$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and $l, L > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ (the distance between the centers of the cavity and the conductor) is $\theta$.

To solve this, we analyze the charge distribution and apply Gauss's law. Initially, the conductor is neutral. When $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor then has a charge of $+q$ to ensure the conductor remains neutral overall.

For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (radius $L$), the total enclosed charge is $+q$ (from the outer surface). By Gauss's law, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on this total charge and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The field is radial and uniform, as the outer surface of the conductor, being spherical, distributes the charge uniformly regardless of the cavity's position.

The electric field at point $P$ is therefore given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A and C involve $l$, $s$, and $\cos\theta$, which are irrelevant for the field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on the total charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface.
- Option D uses $l^2$, which is the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center, but the field outside the conductor depends on the distance $L$ from the conductor's center, not the cavity's center.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
