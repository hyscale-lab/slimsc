Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which of the options could be their energy difference so that they can be resolved?

Hmm. I remember that the uncertainty principle might come into play here. Oh wait, yes, the energy-time uncertainty principle. I think it's something like ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time should be on the order of ħ.

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. So the lifetimes are the time uncertainties, right? Because the lifetime is how long the state exists before decaying or something. So the time uncertainty Δt would be the lifetime of each state.

Wait, but wait, do I take the average lifetime, or each state's lifetime? Or perhaps the time between measurements or something else? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think: the energy difference needs to be such that the broadening from each state's lifetime doesn't wash out the distinction between the two energies.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the minimum energy difference needed for the two states to be resolvable. That probably relates to the uncertainty principle because if the energy difference is too small, the uncertainty in energy (from the lifetime) would make the two levels appear the same.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt), where Δt is the lifetime of each state.

So first, let's compute the uncertainty for each state.

Wait, but wait, both states have different lifetimes. So for E1, with lifetime τ1 =1e-9 sec, the uncertainty ΔE1 would be ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, for E2, τ2 =1e-8 sec, so ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2).

Wait, but wait, when we're talking about distinguishing two energy levels, perhaps the key is that the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because otherwise, their energy intervals might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

Alternatively, perhaps each state has its own uncertainty, and for the two energies to be clearly separated, their energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Hmmm. Let me think. The energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 needs to be larger than the uncertainty in each energy so that the two levels don't overlap in the energy spectrum.

Wait, the uncertainty in E for each state is given by ΔE = ħ/(2τ). So for E1, τ=1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = ħ/(2e-9). Similarly, for E2, τ=1e-8 s, so ΔE2= ħ/(2e-8). Wait, but since E2 has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller than E1's.

Wait, because τ is larger, the denominator is bigger, so ΔE is smaller. So for E1, which has a shorter lifetime, the uncertainty is larger. So the broader peak is for E1.

So, to resolve the two states, the energy difference between them (ΔE) must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or actually, perhaps the difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, they can be distinguished.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to ensure that the energy difference is greater than the uncertainty of each state's energy. So both ΔE must be larger than ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, but if ΔE is the difference between E2 and E1, say E2 is higher, then the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if it's larger than the maximum, then it's larger than both. So which of the options would satisfy that?

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal required energy difference is the sum of the two uncertainties. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The energy uncertainty for each state is given by ΔE = ħ/(2τ). So for E1, τ=1e-9 s, so ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * 1e-9).

Similarly, for E2, τ=1e-8 s, so ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8).

Since ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let me compute these values.

First, compute ΔE1:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

To convert that to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So ΔE1 = 5.272859e-26 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-27 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the larger uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

So to distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be greater than ΔE1, which is about 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is smaller than 3.29e-7, so no.

B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → much larger than 3.29e-7.

D) 1e-8 eV → which is larger than ΔE2=3.29e-8? Wait, 1e-8 is 1e-8, and ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8, which is larger than 1e-8. Wait, no, 3.29e-8 is 3.29 x 1e-8, which is about 3.29 x 1e-8. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.29e-8.

Wait, no. Let me calculate:

ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, which is 329e-9 eV. So 3.29e-7 eV is 0.329e-6 eV.

ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV, which is 0.0329e-6 eV.

So the maximum uncertainty is 3.29e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this maximum uncertainty.

Looking at the options, which one is bigger than 3.29e-7 eV.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 100e-6, which is way bigger than 3.29e-7.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8, which is smaller than 3.29e-7 (since 3.29e-7 is larger than 1e-8).

Wait, 3.29e-7 is 3.29 x 1e-7, which is 329 x 1e-9, which is 329 n eV. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 10 x 1e-9 eV, which is 10 neV. So 329 neV is much larger than 10 neV.

Wait, so the energy difference must be larger than the maximum uncertainty, which is 3.29e-7 eV. So which option is larger than that?

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3.29e-7 eV.

So the correct option would be C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the energy difference is E2 - E1. The uncertainty of each is their respective ΔE. So if the actual energy difference is larger than both uncertainties, then they can be resolved.

So, for example, if ΔE (the difference) is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the two levels can be distinguished. Because their separation is larger than the uncertainty in each.

So for ΔE to be resolvable, it must be larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

In this case, ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So the maximum is 3.29e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than that would satisfy, making it resolvable.

So looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 * 1e6 neV = 1e2 neV, which is way larger than 3.29e-7 eV (which is 329 neV), so that's good.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 10 neV, which is less than 329 neV. So that's not enough.

So the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV.

To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between them must be larger than the uncertainties in energy for each state. The energy uncertainty for a state with lifetime \( \tau \) is given by the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Converting \( \Delta E \) to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

1. For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The maximum uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be larger than this maximum uncertainty.

Now, evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also much smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.

Similarly, for E2, τ=1e-8 s, so ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8).

Since ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let me compute these values.

First, compute ΔE1:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s

ΔE1 = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

To convert that to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So ΔE1 = 5.272859e-26 J / 1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-8) = 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-27 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the larger uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

So to distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be greater than ΔE1, which is about 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is smaller than 3.29e-7, so no.

B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → much larger than 3.29e-7.

D) 1e-8 eV → which is larger than ΔE2=3.29e-8? Wait, 1e-8 is 1e-8, and ΔE2 is about 3.29e-8, which is larger than 1e-8. Wait, no, 3.29e-8 is 3.29 x 1e-8, which is about 3.29 x 1e-8. So 1e-8 is smaller than 3.29e-8.

Wait, no. Let me calculate:

ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, which is 329e-9 eV. So 3.29e-7 eV is 0.329e-6 eV.

ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV, which is 0.0329e-6 eV.

So the maximum uncertainty is 3.29e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than this maximum uncertainty.

Looking at the options, which one is bigger than 3.29e-7 eV.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 100e-6, which is way bigger than 3.29e-7.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 1e-8, which is smaller than 3.29e-7 (since 3.29e-7 is larger than 1e-8).

Wait, 3.29e-7 is 3.29 x 1e-7, which is 329 x 1e-9, which is 329 n eV. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 10 x 1e-9 eV, which is 10 neV. So 329 neV is much larger than 10 neV.

Wait, so the energy difference must be larger than the maximum uncertainty, which is 3.29e-7 eV. So which option is larger than that?

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3.29e-7 eV.

So the correct option would be C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the energy difference is E2 - E1. The uncertainty of each is their respective ΔE. So if the actual energy difference is larger than both uncertainties, then they can be resolved.

So, for example, if ΔE (the difference) is larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the two levels can be distinguished. Because their separation is larger than the uncertainty in each.

So for ΔE to be resolvable, it must be larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

In this case, ΔE1 is 3.29e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 3.29e-8 eV. So the maximum is 3.29e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than that would satisfy, making it resolvable.

So looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV = 1e-4 * 1e6 neV = 1e2 neV, which is way larger than 3.29e-7 eV (which is 329 neV), so that's good.

Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 10 neV, which is less than 329 neV. So that's not enough.

So the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV.


To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between them must be larger than the uncertainties in energy for each state. The energy uncertainty for a state with lifetime \( \tau \) is given by the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau},
\]

where \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Converting \( \Delta E \) to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

1. For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to eV:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-27}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

The maximum uncertainty is \( \Delta E_1 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be larger than this maximum uncertainty.

Now, evaluate the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also much smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.

Answer: C
