Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is like the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured the spin many times on identically prepared systems.

The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a column vector. So the state vector is [3i, 4]^T. Oh right, the expectation value is calculated using the formula <S_y> = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, where S_y is the spin operator along the y-axis.

But wait, what's the form of the spin operator S_y? Oh, right, the Pauli matrices. The spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma_y matrix. The sigma_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so S_y would be (ħ/2) times that matrix.

So first, I need to compute the matrix product of the state vector, the operator S_y, and the adjoint of the state vector. Let me write that out.

The state vector is ψ = [3i; 4]. To compute ⟨ψ|, I take the conjugate transpose, which would be [ -3 (because (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, wait. Let me think: the conjugate transpose of 3i is -3i, and the conjugate of 4 is 4. So ⟨ψ| is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the operator S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let me write that matrix as (ħ/2) multiplied by sigma_y.

So the expectation value <S_y> would be ψ† S_y ψ. Let's compute that.

Wait, actually, the calculation steps: I'll compute ψ† multiplied by S_y, then multiply that by ψ.

Alternatively, since S_y is a scaled version of sigma_y, and sigma_y is Hermitian, perhaps I can compute the expectation value by taking the inner product of ψ with sigma_y ψ, and then scaling by ħ/2.

Let me compute sigma_y multiplied by ψ first.

Sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply sigma_y with ψ, which is [3i, 4], I get:

First element: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second element: i*(3i) + 0*4 = i*(3i) = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So sigma_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, take the inner product of ψ† with sigma_y ψ.

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So inner product is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So total is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

But wait, wait, wait. No, wait, the inner product is ψ† (sigma_y ψ). So it's the sum of the two products.

Wait, let me redo this part.

ψ† is [a*, b*] for ψ = [a, b]^T. So ψ is [3i,4], so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Sigma_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ] as I calculated earlier.

So the inner product is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Calculating first term: (-3i)(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, no, wait! Wait, that can't be right. Because the inner product is a scalar. Let me recheck.

Wait, σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ].

So ψ† (σ_y ψ) = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

So (-3i)*(-4i) = (12)(i^2) = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the inner product is -24. Then, the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this inner product. So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options have fractions. Did I make a mistake in calculating the inner product?

Wait, let me recalculate the inner product step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix multiplication. Let me recheck σ_y * ψ.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

ψ is [3i, 4].

So the first entry of the product is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second entry: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So yes, σ_y ψ is [-4i, -3]^T.

So when I take ψ† (σ_y ψ), it's [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, wait, the inner product is the sum of products of corresponding components. So:

(-3i) * (-4i) + (4) * (-3) =

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Sum: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So inner product is -24. So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

But looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are:

A) -12ħ/25

B) 12ħ/25

C) 25ħ/2

D) -25ħ/2

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Because none of the options match -12 ħ. Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the normalization of the state vector.

Wait, the state vector (3i,4) must be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized to 1.

So let's compute the norm of ψ: |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is sqrt(25)=5. Therefore, the normalized state would be ψ_normalized = (3i/5, 4/5)^T.

But in the given problem, the state is (3i,4). So perhaps it's not normalized. So does that affect the expectation value? Because expectation values don't require the state to be normalized. Wait, no, wait. The expectation value formula is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, but if the state isn't normalized, then you need to normalize it by dividing by ⟨ψ| ψ⟩.

Wait no, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ| ψ⟩ only if ψ isn't normalized. But wait, in this case, the state is given as (3i,4). So I think the problem assumes that the state is not normalized, and I have to compute the expectation value accordingly.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized, but perhaps the problem doesn't require that. Hmm, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without normalizing, since the operator is scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, let me think again. The expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of sigma_y.

So the expectation value of sigma_y is the inner product of ψ† sigma_y ψ, divided by the inner product of ψ† ψ, if the state is not normalized.

Wait, no. Wait, the expectation value is [⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩] / [⟨ψ| ψ⟩] because the state isn't normalized. Because ⟨S_y⟩ = (1/⟨ψ|ψ⟩) * (⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩).

Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * [⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩ ] / [⟨ψ| ψ⟩ ].

So perhaps I've missed the normalization factor.

So let's calculate the denominator first: ⟨ψ| ψ⟩.

ψ is [3i,4]^T.

⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (3i)*3i + (4)*4.

Wait, (3i)*(3i) is 9 i² = 9*(-1) = -9. And 4*4 is 16. So total is (-9) +16 =7? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the inner product is (a*, b*) multiplied by (a, b). So each component's product is a* a + b* b.

So ψ is [3i,4], so ψ† is [-3i,4].

So ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4).

Let's compute each term:

(-3i)(3i) = -9 i² = -9*(-1) = 9.

(4)(4) =16.

So sum is 9+16=25. So the norm is 25.

So the inner product is 25. So the normalization factor is 25.

So when I compute the expectation value of sigma_y, it's [⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩ ] /25.

Earlier, I found ⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩ = -24.

So ⟨sigma_y⟩ = (-24) /25.

Therefore, <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24 ħ) /50 = (-12 ħ)/25.

Which is option A: -12 ħ/25.

Wait, looking back, option A is -12 hbar/25. That's what I got.

So the correct answer is option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the given spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle},
\]

where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle \) (Normalization Factor)
The inner product \( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = (3i)^* \cdot (3i) + (4)^* \cdot (4) = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4).
\]

\[
(-3i)(3i) = -9i^2 = -9(-1) = 9, \quad (4)(4) = 16.
\]

\[
\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \( \frac{1}{25} \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)
The action of \( \sigma_y \) on \( \psi \) is:

\[
\sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First entry:
\[
(0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = -4i.
\]

Second entry:
\[
(i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i^2 = 3(-1) = -3.
\]

Thus:
\[
\sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)
The inner product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \) is:

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = (3i)^* \cdot (-4i) + (4)^* \cdot (-3).
\]

\[
(3i)^* = -3i, \quad (4)^* = 4.
\]

\[
(-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12, \quad (4)(-3) = -12.
\]

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = -12 + (-12) = -24.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle}{\langle \psi | \psi \rangle} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25}.
\]

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( \frac{-12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
