Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product when a specific compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, let me break this down.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. So it's a cyclohexene ring, right? The numbering is such that the formyl group is at carbon 2, the vinyl group is at carbon 5, and there's a double bond at position 3, which is between carbons 3 and 4 I think.

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would imply the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, yes. So the ring has a double bond there. Also, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Or wait, vinyl is CH2CH-, I think. So the substituents are at positions 2, 3, 5.

So the molecule has a cyclohexene ring, with a double bond, and two substituents: a formyl and a vinyl group. So that's three rings? Wait, no, it's a single cyclohexene ring with substituents.

Now, reacting this with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, another reaction: when alkenes or alkynes are treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a type of addition reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's for the hydration of alkynes? Or perhaps it's the hydrohalogenation of alkynes? Or wait, another possibility: when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with HI and red phosphorus, it's the Wittig reaction? No, the Wittig reaction uses triphenylphosphine and an azo compound, I think. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when an alkyne is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction called the hydrohalogenation. For example, maybe it's adding HI to triple bonds. Or perhaps the reaction is about adding across double bonds. Wait, but also, the compound has an aldehyde group (formyl), which is a carbonyl. So maybe the aldehyde is reacting here.

Wait, another approach: red phosphorus and HI together are often used in the hydroboration reaction... No, wait, that's with BH3. Hmm.

Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce carbonyl groups. Like, maybe the formyl group (CHO) is being converted into something else. Because I remember that when you have a carbonyl, sometimes under certain conditions, like with excess HI and red phosphorus, it can undergo a reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a reduction. For example, the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to a CH2OH group or something else. Or maybe it's a process called the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl. But Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg), not red phosphorus. Hmm.

Wait, alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI can be used to perform a deoxygenation of aldehydes and ketones. Oh! Maybe it's the Staudinger reaction? No, that's for azides. Wait, perhaps it's the Appel reaction? No, Appel is for converting alcohols to halides using PCl5 or similar.

Wait, another thought. Oh, I think that when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a process called the hydrohalogenation, but more specifically, it might be for adding HI across double bonds. So, the double bond in the cyclohexene ring would react with HI. Also, the vinyl group is a substituted double bond, which is CH2-CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So in the starting molecule, we have both the cyclohexene ring (with a double bond) and a vinyl substituent (another double bond). So two double bonds in the molecule.

So when reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong acid and a good nucleophile, perhaps each double bond will undergo addition reactions.

Wait, but wait, how does red phosphorus fit into this? Because I'm a bit confused about the exact reaction conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, but that's for adding bromine to alpha positions of carboxylic acids. But here, we have HI, not HBr.

Wait, another angle. The starting material has a formyl group (CHO), a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), and a cyclohexene ring. So, three double bonds in total: the cyclohexene ring (1), the vinyl group (2), and the formyl group (3, the carbonyl double bond). Wait, no, the formyl is a carbonyl, which is a double bond. So that's three double bonds. Then, if each reacts with HI, how does that affect the product?

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Maybe the double bonds are being hydrogenated or undergoing some addition or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but I don't think that uses HI and red phosphorus. Another possibility: the reaction could be a hydration of the alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the addition of HI to each double bond. So each double bond in the starting molecule would become a single bond, with HI adding across them.

But wait, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring with a double bond, a vinyl group (which is a double bond between carbons), and the formyl group (a carbonyl double bond). So three double bonds in total.

So, if each double bond reacts with HI, then each would add two H and I. For each double bond, adding HI would add two I atoms and two H atoms, right? But wait, in the case of a cyclic system like cyclohexene, adding HI would lead to a diiodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that would be elimination, which doesn't make sense here. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated based on the degrees of unsaturation. Each degree is a double bond, ring, or triple bond. So the original molecule has several degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but the question is about the product's index. So maybe the reaction is reducing the number of double bonds, thus lowering the index.

So, if the reaction adds HI across each double bond, each addition would reduce the index by 1, since a double bond (1) becomes a single bond (0).

But let's count the initial degrees of unsaturation in the starting material. How many rings and double bonds does it have?

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So:

- Cyclohexene ring: that's a six-membered ring with one double bond. Each ring contributes one degree (for the ring closure), and the double bond adds another. So cyclohexene has two degrees: 1 for the ring, 1 for the double bond.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But perhaps it's easier to count rings and double bonds.

Cyclohexene has a ring (counts as 1) and a double bond (counts as 1), so 2 degrees.

The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so that's another degree.

The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is a double bond, another degree.

So in total, the starting molecule has 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (formyl) +1 (vinyl) =4 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, wait, but the cyclohexene has a ring and a double bond. So that's two degrees. Then the formyl adds another one, and the vinyl another one. So total of four.

Now, when we react with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps each double bond is being hydrogenated. So adding H and I across each double bond. So each double bond would be converted into a single bond.

Wait, but wait, HI is a diatomic molecule, so adding across a double bond would add two atoms: H and I. So each double bond would become a single bond, adding two substituents.

So, each double bond in the starting molecule would be converted to a single bond, meaning each would reduce the degrees of unsaturation by 1.

So, starting with four degrees, after reaction with HI, all four would be saturated. So the product would have zero degrees of unsaturation, right?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about each part.

The cyclohexene ring has a double bond. Adding HI across it would make it a cyclohexane ring with two substituents (from the addition of HI). So the ring would become saturated.

The formyl group (CHO) would react with HI. How? Maybe the carbonyl is attacked by HI, leading to a geminal diiodide. So, the CHO becomes CH(I)OH? Or perhaps it's converted into CH2I2. Wait, no, perhaps it's a reduction. Wait, the reaction of carbonyl with HI and red phosphorusâ€”maybe it's a reduction to a CH2I group.

Wait, another thought: when a carbonyl reacts with HI, especially in the presence of a reducing agent like red phosphorus, it might undergo the Appel reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is reduced. Wait, I think that red phosphorus and HI can reduce carbonyl groups. Let me recall: the formyl group (CHO) would be converted into CH2OH (if it's a reduction to an alcohol), but wait, no, using HI, perhaps it's a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl group is converted into a diiodide. So, CHO would become CH(I)OH. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Another possibility is that the carbonyl is reduced to a methylene group. For example, using a strong reducing agent, the carbonyl (O) is replaced with CH2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact reaction here. Let me think about the formyl group reacting with HI and red phosphorus. Maybe it's a matter of adding HI to the carbonyl group. But the carbonyl is more reactive towards nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the formyl group being converted into a CH2I group. So, the double bond (CHO) would be replaced with CH2I. So that's a reduction, perhaps.

Wait, if the formyl group is reduced to CH2I, that would eliminate a degree of unsaturation. Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would react with HI to become CH2-CH2I (but that's not possible because adding HI across the double bond would give CH2-I and I-CH2, but wait, perhaps it becomes CH2CH2I, but that's not possible because you can't have two I's on adjacent CH2 groups. Maybe it's more like CH2-CH2I, but that's a single bond. So each double bond is being converted into a single bond, adding I and H.

Wait, but the vinyl group is part of a substituent. So the starting molecule's structure: the cyclohexene has a substituent at position 2 (CHO) and position 5 (CH2=CH-).

When all the double bonds are saturated, the product would have no double bonds, so the degrees of unsaturation would be zero.

Wait, but wait. The starting material has a formyl group, a vinyl group, and the cyclohexene ring, each contributing a double bond. So three double bonds in total. Or was it four?

Wait, earlier I thought the cyclohexene contributes two degrees (ring and double bond). But wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so the degrees of unsaturation for the ring is one (the ring itself is one degree, and the double bond within it adds another, making two for the cyclohexene part).

Then, the formyl group adds another degree (the carbonyl double bond), and the vinyl group adds another (the double bond in CH2=CH-). So that's 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 degrees of unsaturation.

If each of these double bonds is saturated, then the product would have zero degrees of unsaturation. So the index would be zero.

Wait, but let me think about the reaction. Does HI and red phosphorus add to all the double bonds?

I think in this reaction, each double bond would undergo addition of HI. So the cyclohexene ring's double bond becomes a single bond with two substituents (so it's a diiodide), the vinyl group's double bond becomes a single bond with two substituents (so a diiodide there as well), and the formyl group's carbonyl is also converted.

Wait, but what about the formyl group? Adding HI across the carbonyl would give a diiodide? Or perhaps the carbonyl is transformed into something else.

Wait, another angle: in the presence of red phosphorus and excess HI, the carbonyl group (CHO) might undergo a reaction called the hydroboration-oxidation, but I think that's more for alkenes.

Alternatively, I've read that red phosphorus can facilitate the addition of HX (like HI) to carbonyl groups. So perhaps the carbonyl group (CHO) would react with HI to form CH2(OH)I. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is converted into a CH2OH group. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is reduced to a CH2I group. So the CHO becomes CH2I.

Wait, maybe the formyl group is being reduced. Because, red phosphorus and HI can sometimes act as reducing agents. For example, the formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl, and upon reduction, it would become CH2OH (alcohol), but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is converted into CH2I. So, the CHO is transformed into CH2I, which would eliminate the double bond (the carbonyl becomes a single bond), thus reducing the degree of unsaturation.

So, if each of the three double bonds (cyclohexene's, vinyl, and formyl) is saturated, each contributes a reduction of one degree of unsaturation. So the starting material has four degrees, and each addition would reduce it by one. So after three additions, it would be 4 -3=1? But wait, the cyclohexene has two degrees, so perhaps I'm double-counting.

Wait, let me recount the degrees.

The starting molecule has:

1. A six-membered ring (cyclohexene) â†’ 1 degree (ring) + 1 (double bond) â†’ 2 degrees.

2. A formyl group (CHO) â†’ 1 degree (carbonyl).

3. A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) â†’ 1 degree (double bond).

So total of 2 +1 +1 =4 degrees.

Now, if each double bond is saturated, each would lose one degree. So:

- The cyclohexene's double bond is saturated â†’ loses 1 (but the ring remains, so that's still 1 degree).

Wait, no: the cyclohexene has a ring (1) and a double bond (1). If the double bond in the ring is saturated, the ring is still present, so the degrees contributed by the cyclohexene part would go from 2 to 1 (just the ring remains, and the double bond is gone).

Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond is gone â†’ that's another degree removed.

The formyl group's carbonyl is gone â†’ another degree removed.

So, starting with 4 degrees, after reaction:

- Cyclohexene: 1 degree (ring).

- Vinyl: 0 (no double bond).

- Formyl: 0.

So total degrees =1.

But wait, the formyl group is on a carboxylic acid. Wait, wait the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, perhaps, but the formyl is at 2. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl), and a COOH group at some position.

So the reaction would affect each of the double bonds:

1. The cyclohexene's double bond is saturated, so the ring contributes 1 (the ring) and the double bond is gone â†’ 1 degree.

2. The vinyl group's double bond is saturated â†’ removes 1 degree.

3. The formyl group's carbonyl is saturated â†’ removes 1 degree.

So from 4 degrees (2 from cyclohexene, 1 formyl, 1 vinyl), after reaction, degrees are:

- Cyclohexene: 1 (ring).

- Vinyl: 0.

- Formyl: 0.

Total: 1.

So the index of hydrogen deficiency (which is the same as degrees of unsaturation) would be 1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the cyclohexene's ring is still contributing a degree of unsaturation. Because the ring is a closed structure, which is one degree of unsaturation regardless of any double bonds within it.

So if the cyclohexene ring remains, that's 1 degree. The double bond in the ring is gone, so that's another degree gone. So cyclohexene's contribution goes from 2 to 1.

Then, the vinyl group's double bond is gone â†’ another 1 degree.

Formyl group's double bond is gone â†’ another 1 degree.

So initial degrees: 2 (cyclohexene) +1 (formyl) + 1 (vinyl) =4.

After reaction:

Cyclohexene: 1 (ring).

Vinyl: 0.

Formyl: 0.

Total: 1.

So the product has 1 degree of unsaturation.

But wait, the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency. So the answer would be 1. But let me check the options.

The options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

So the correct answer would be A)1.

But wait, earlier I thought that all double bonds are saturated, leading to zero degrees, but that's not correct because the cyclohexane ring still contributes one degree.

Ah, so the product would have a cyclohexane ring (which is a six-membered ring with no double bonds), so it has one degree (the ring). The other substituents would have their double bonds saturated.

So the product's index is 1, which is option A.

To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (degrees of unsaturation) of the product, we analyze the starting material and the reaction conditions. The starting compound, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, contains the following structural features:

1. **Cyclohexene ring**: This contributes 2 degrees of unsaturation (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond within the ring).
2. **Formyl group (CHO)**: This contributes 1 degree of unsaturation (the carbonyl double bond).
3. **Vinyl group (CHâ‚‚=CH-)**: This contributes 1 degree of unsaturation (the double bond in the vinyl group).

Thus, the starting material has a total of **4 degrees of unsaturation**.

When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the reaction conditions suggest that all double bonds in the molecule will undergo saturation. Specifically:

- The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is saturated, reducing the degrees of unsaturation by 1. The ring itself remains intact, contributing 1 degree of unsaturation.
- The double bond in the vinyl group is saturated, reducing the degrees of unsaturation by 1.
- The carbonyl double bond in the formyl group is saturated, reducing the degrees of unsaturation by 1.

After the reaction, the product retains only the degree of unsaturation from the cyclohexane ring (1 degree). All other double bonds are fully saturated.

Thus, the index of hydrogen deficiency (degrees of unsaturation) of the product is **1**.
