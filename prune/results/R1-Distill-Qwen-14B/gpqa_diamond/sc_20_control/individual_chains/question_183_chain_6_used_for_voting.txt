Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency for a product formed after a certain reaction. 

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Then it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the hydroboration reaction, but wait, or was that something else... Oh right! Red phosphorus is typically involved in the preparation of phosphorus ylides, like in the Wittig reaction. Oh wait, no, wait. No, the Wittig reaction uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide, but when you have phosphorus and HI, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, I think when you have red phosphorus and HI, it's the formation of a ylide. Or maybe it's the hydroiodination or something. Wait, what's the reaction between alkenes and red phosphorus with HI?

Wait, another thought: I think that when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's the so-called "reduction" or maybe a cleavage reaction. Oh wait, I remember now! Red phosphorus in the presence of HI can cause the cleavage of alkenes, especially conjugated dienes, but wait, wait. Wait, or is it more about the addition? No, wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, I think that when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to perform an addition reaction where the HI adds across the double bond. But wait, red phosphorus is a catalyst or a participant? Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh right! Oh wait, I think that in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can add to alkenes in a 1,2-addition, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I've heard that when HI is used with excess, it can cause multiple additions if the alkene is conjugated or part of a ring.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the starting material first. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's draw that. So, cyclohexane ring. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO). At position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-). And the cyclohexene part is at position 3, so the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would be a double bond between C3 and C4 of the cyclohexane ring. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with substituents at positions 2, 3 (double bond), and 5.

Wait, no, wait. The substituents are at positions 2 (formyl), 3 (double bond, since it's cyclohex-3-ene), and 5 (vinyl). So the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. Then, the substituents are at C2 (CHO), C5 (vinyl group, which is CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group at C2 and a vinyl group at C5.

So the molecule has three double bonds? Wait, no. Wait, the ring is cyclohexene (so one double bond in the ring), plus the vinyl group (another double bond). And the formyl group is a carbonyl, so another double bond. So the molecule has three double bonds in total: the ring (cyclohexene), the vinyl group (CH2=CH-), and the formyl (CHO).

Wait, but wait. Let's recount. The cyclohexene has a double bond (1), the vinyl group is CH2-CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so that's another double bond (2), and the formyl group is CHO, which is a carbonyl (3). So three double bonds in the molecule.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I'm trying to remember what reaction this combination induces. Oh, wait, I think it's the Cleve reaction, which is used to cleave alkenes. But wait, Cleve's conditions usually involve HI with a dihalide and a metal, or maybe it's the oxy-Cleve. Alternatively, maybe it's the addition of HI to the double bonds.

Wait, another angle: Red phosphorus is used in the presence of HI to form a ylide. The ylide would then react with carbonyl groups in the Wittig reaction. But wait, the starting material has a formyl group (CHO), which is a carbonyl. But wait, the question says reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. So perhaps the reaction is a Wittig reaction, but then what happens to the other double bonds.

Wait, the molecule has two double bonds besides the formyl? No, the cyclohexene ring has one, the vinyl group another, and the formyl a third. So three double bonds. So, when reacted with HI and red phosphorus, would this cause a Wittig reaction, introducing a new double bond, or cleaving existing ones?

Alternatively, perhaps the double bonds are being hydrogenated. No, because HI is a source of H and I. Wait, but in the presence of red phosphorus, I think it's more about addition rather than hydrogenation.

Wait, another thought. Red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydroxymercuration or other additions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an example of the "Cleve reduction," which cleaves alkenes into diols, but that usually involves OsO4 followed by NaHSO3, or something else.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrohalogenation, but with excess HI, which would lead to the most substituted product. But wait, the starting material has multiple double bonds, so perhaps each is reacting.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is adding HI to each double bond. But I don't think HI would add to a carbonyl group. Wait, formyl groups (CHO) are carbonyl groups, and HI would typically not add to those, unless under specific conditions. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the addition of HI to the alkenes. Let's think: each double bond in the molecule would react with HI. Since the molecule has three double bonds (ring, vinyl, formyl?), wait actually the formyl is a carbonyl, which is a double bond. So, three in total.

But wait, the reaction would add HI across each double bond. So each double bond would become a single bond with adjacent H and I atoms. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the formyl group is a carbonyl (C=O), which is a carbonyl group. HI addition to a carbonyl would lead to some kind of iodination? Or perhaps in the presence of red phosphorus, something else happens.

Wait, no. Red phosphorus is used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reagent is formed from an alkyl halide and triphenylphosphine, but I'm not sure if this reaction is that. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the hydroboration-oxidation, but that uses BH3.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Cleve reaction, which is a method for cleaving alkenes. The Cleve reaction involves treatment of an alkene with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, leading to the cleavage of the double bond and the formation of a diiodide. So, for each double bond, it would cleave.

So, if each double bond is cleaved, then the product would have each of those bonds broken, leading to different structures.

But wait, the starting material has three double bonds: the cyclohexene ring, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-), and the formyl (CHO). So that's three. If each is cleaved, what would happen?

Wait, the formyl group is a carbonyl (C=O). I'm not sure if the Cleve reaction affects that. Wait, the Cleve reaction specifically targets alkenes, not aldehydes. So perhaps only the two alkenes in the molecule—the cyclohexene and the vinyl group—are cleaved. The formyl group's double bond is a carbonyl, which is generally not cleaved under Cleve conditions.

So, initial structure:

- Cyclohexene ring (double bond between C3 and C4)
- At C2: CHO (carbonyl)
- At C5: CH2-CH2? No, at C5: it's a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So, reaction: Cleve reaction on the two alkenes.

Let me think about each of these. First, the cyclohexene. Cleaving the double bond would break it into two carbons connected to each other, but with adjacent I atoms.

Wait, the Cleve reaction for a cyclohexene would break the ring open. Let me imagine: when cyclohexene is treated with HI and red phosphorus, the double bond is cleaved, and each adjacent carbon gets an I and a H, perhaps.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact products. When an alkene undergoes Cleve cleavage, each carbonyl group (if any) would form, but no, wait. I think that in the Cleve reaction, the double bond is broken, and each former double bond carbon gets an X (like I) and a H. So, for a simple alkene like ethylene, it would become HI in some way, but in a cyclic structure, it would break the ring and form two carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe for a cyclohexene, the Cleve reaction would break the ring, opening it into a diacid or something else. Wait, but the starting material is a cyclohexene ring substituted with formyl and vinyl.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each double bond separately.

First, the cyclohexene ring: the double bond between C3 and C4. Cleaving this would convert it into two carbonyl groups. So, C3 and C4 would each have a carbonyl. But wait, the ring is six-membered. Cleaving the double bond would break the ring, making it a diacid or something else. Alternatively, maybe it would form two ketones, but with the substituents present, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the Cleve reaction adds HI across each double bond, leading to vicinal diiodides, but with the ring opening.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the vinyl group. The vinyl group is CH2-CH2? No, it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, the vinyl group's double bond would be cleaved as well. So that would convert the CH2=CH- into CH2-I and CH2-I? Or perhaps into two carbonyl groups. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction adds HI across each double bond. So, each double bond becomes a single bond with adjacent H and I. So for each double bond, two new I atoms are added.

But wait, the formyl group is a carbonyl, which is a double bond. Would that react as well? I don't think so. So, the formyl group (CHO) would remain as is.

So, after the reaction, the product would have the formyl group (CHO), and the other two double bonds (cyclohexene and vinyl) would have been converted into single bonds with I atoms.

Wait, but the reaction is with excess HI. So perhaps each double bond is fully hydrogenated, but I don't think that's the case. More likely, each double bond is cleaved, adding HI across them.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the opening of each double bond, adding HI.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure after reaction.

Original molecule: 

- A cyclohexene ring (C3-C4 double bond)
- At C2: formyl (CHO)
- At C5: vinyl group (CH2-CH2? No, CH2=CH-)

So, reacting each double bond with HI and red phosphorus (Cleve reaction).

1. The cyclohexene ring's double bond (C3-C4) is cleaved, adding HI across the bond. So the cyclohexene (six-membered ring) would open into a four-membered chain (since breaking the double bond would take two carbons and connect them each to H and I).

Wait, no. Cleaving the cyclohexene would break the ring. The six-membered ring would become a five-membered diacid or something else. Alternatively, each of the two carbons (C3 and C4) would have an -I and -H added.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the Cleve reaction as the addition of HI across each double bond, leading to diiodides.

So, the cyclohexene would become a diiodide, and the vinyl group would become another diiodide.

So, after the reaction, the molecule would have:

- The formyl group (unchanged, as it's a carbonyl)
- The cyclohexene becomes two adjacent carbons each with an I and H (so maybe a single bond with I on each)
- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2-I and CH2-I?

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, when an alkene reacts with HI under Cleve conditions, each of the two carbons of the double bond gains an iodine atom. So, the double bond becomes a single bond with iodine on each carbon. So, for the cyclohexene, the ring would open, and the two carbons (C3 and C4) would each have an I attached.

So, the ring would be broken between C3 and C4. The ring would become a chain with the two I atoms on the adjacent carbons. Then, the other substituents (formyl and vinyl) would be attached to these.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Original structure:

Positions 1 to 6 in the ring. C3 and C4 are double-bonded.

After cleavage of the cyclohexene double bond, the ring opens between C3 and C4. So, the ring becomes a chain with C3 and C4 connected by single bonds, each with an I and H. So, the ring is broken, and the structure is now a straight chain with the substituents.

Additionally, the vinyl group's double bond would also be cleaved, adding I atoms to each end.

Wait, but the vinyl group is at C5, which is part of the ring. So, when the vinyl group's double bond is cleaved, that would convert the CH2=CH- into CH2-I and CH2-I. So that would break the chain there as well.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond is cleaved, leading to multiple iodides.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's easier to count the number of rings and double bonds in the product.

The starting material has:

- One ring (cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond)
- Three double bonds: the ring, the vinyl group, and the formyl.

After reaction with HI and red phosphorus, the alkenes (the ring and the vinyl group's double bond) are cleaved, converting each into single bonds with I atoms attached. The formyl group remains as a carbonyl.

So, the product would have:

- No rings, because the cyclohexene would have been opened.
- No double bonds, because the two alkenes (cyclohexene and vinyl group) are cleaved, and the formyl is a carbonyl (which is a double bond, but perhaps not affected).

Wait, but the formyl is a carbonyl, which is a double bond, so it would count towards the index of hydrogen deficiency. Wait, but the Cleve reaction only affects alkenes (sp² carbons), not carbonyls. So the formyl group remains as a double bond.

So, the product would have only the formyl group's double bond. So the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1, right? Because the product has one double bond (from the formyl group) and no rings.

Wait, let me think again.

The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated by the formula:

Index = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

Assuming no nitrogen or halogens in the formula, but perhaps I should think in terms of rings and double bonds.

Each ring or double bond contributes 1 to the index.

So, for the product:

- Does it have any rings? No, because the cyclohexene was cleaved, so it's a straight chain.
- How many double bonds? Only the formyl group's carbonyl is a double bond (since the other double bonds were cleaved).

So, the index is 1. So, the answer would be option A) 1.

Wait, but the product may have more than one double bond. Let me double-check.

After the reaction:

- The cyclohexene's double bond is cleaved; so no double bond there.
- The vinyl group's double bond is cleaved; so no double bond there.
- The formyl group's double bond remains.

So, only one double bond remains. No rings are present. So the index is 1.

So the answer is A) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, contains three double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring, one in the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-), and one in the formyl group (CHO). When reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI, the Cleve reaction occurs, which cleaves alkenes (double bonds in alkenes) by adding HI across them. However, the carbonyl group (formyl group) is not affected by this reaction.

1. **Cyclohexene Ring**: The double bond in the cyclohexene ring is cleaved, breaking the ring and converting it into a single bond with iodine atoms on the adjacent carbons.
2. **Vinyl Group**: The double bond in the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) is also cleaved, converting it into a single bond with iodine atoms on the adjacent carbons.
3. **Formyl Group**: The carbonyl group (CHO) remains unchanged, as the Cleve reaction does not affect carbonyl double bonds.

After the reaction, the product contains no rings and only one double bond (from the formyl group). The index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated based on the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule. Since there are no rings and only one double bond, the index of hydrogen deficiency is **1**.
