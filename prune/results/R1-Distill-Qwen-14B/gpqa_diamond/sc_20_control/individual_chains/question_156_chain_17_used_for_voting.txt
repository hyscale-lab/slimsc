Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reactions involving alkenes and mCPBA. Hmm, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, right? I remember it's used in epoxidation reactions. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. 

The question says there are two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: one standard (achiral) and one chiral. The options are about how many peaks each shows.

Wait, so what happens in each reaction? Let me think. Epoxidation of an alkene with mCPBA. The configuration of the alkene (E or Z) would affect the epoxide's stereochemistry, right? Because mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond in a stereospecific way. 

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite (trans). When mCPBA reacts, it forms an epoxide. Since the starting alkene is trans, the resulting epoxide would have two different configurations depending on how the oxygen adds. Or wait, no—epoxidation typically forms an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry based on the starting alkene. 

Wait, no, more accurately: mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond, and the configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. So for a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide would form in a certain way, perhaps leading to a trans-dihydroxy structure when acid is added. Or wait, after epoxidation, when you treat with aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. Epoxidation is a peracid reaction. It adds an oxygen across the double bond to form an epoxide. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form in a way that the two new oxygen bonds are on the same side or opposite. Wait, no. The peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen adds with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. So, for example, in a trans double bond (E), the epoxide would form with the two new oxygen substituents on opposite sides—so the epoxide would be a trans-diol after acid hydrolysis. 

Wait, no, when the epoxide is treated with acid, it undergoes ring-opening. The epoxide is a three-membered ring with two adjacent oxygens. In acid, it protonates an oxygen, making the ring more strained, leading to nucleophilic attack. For a trans epoxide, the ring-opening would proceed in a certain way. But wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction with mCPBA forms an epoxide, and then in acid workup, the epoxide opens to form a diol. So let me think of each step.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide; then, acid workup. The epoxide would form a trans diol, right? Because the starting alkene is trans, the new oxygen groups would be on opposite sides. Then, in acid, the epoxide opens to form a diol with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe I should consider the diastereomer situation. When you have an epoxide, the ring opening under acidic conditions can lead to different diastereomers depending on the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the actual products.

Wait, so (E)-oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond, but E configuration. So, imagine:

CH2-CH2
   \ /
    C=C
   / \
CH2-CH2

Wait, no, for oct-4-ene, it's CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 on each end of the double bond. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2 on either side of the double bond. So, the substituents on each side of the double bond are each two CH2 groups and a CH3. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 CH2-CH2 on each end of the double bond. No, wait, octene is eight carbons. So, structure is:

CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but double bond is between carbons 4 and 5. So, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, with the double bond between C4 and C5.

But regardless, for the stereochemistry: Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene. So, the substituents on each end of the double bond are higher priority groups on opposite sides.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. Let me think about the stereochemistry. mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond. For a trans (E) starting alkene, the epoxide would form such that the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. So, the initial epoxide would have a specific stereochemistry based on the starting geometry.

Then, when acid is added, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening. In acidic conditions, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, water (or another nucleophile) attacks the more substituted carbon because of the partial positive charge being more there. Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, like in oct-4-ene, maybe the ring-opening leads to a diol.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, meaning the two ends of the double bond are the same. So, the epoxide would be a symmetric epoxide, maybe leading to a diol that's a single compound, not diastereomers. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but actually, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that for Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene gives a certain epoxide, which upon acid workup gives a diol with specific stereochemistry. Similarly, Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene, gives a different epoxide, which upon acid workup gives a different diol.

Wait, but wait: when you open an epoxide with acid, the nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon because the positive charge is more stabilized there, but in symmetric epoxides, the two carbons are equally substituted, so perhaps the attack can occur from either side, leading to a racemic mixture. Or maybe it's not symmetric?

Wait, let's think about the specific case of oct-4-ene. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3; the double bond is between C4 and C5. So, each end of the double bond is attached to a CH2CH2CH2 group and a CH2CH2CH3 group? Or no, wait. Let me number the carbons:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

So, structure is CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the double bond is between C4 and C5. So, each of these carbons (C4 and C5) is bonded to two CH2 groups on each end. Wait, no, C4 is connected to C3 and C5. C5 is connected to C4 and C6.

Wait, the structure would be:

CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

No, wait, it's more like:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with double bond between C4 and C5. So, the structure would be CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that double bond is in the middle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the epoxide is formed between C4 and C5, making a three-membered ring. Depending on the starting E or Z configuration, the epoxide will have a specific stereochemistry.

But in any case, when the epoxide is formed, the two adjacent oxygen atoms are either on the same face (cis) or opposite faces (trans).

Wait, but for (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxidation would lead to different epoxide structures. For (E) starting material, the epoxide would form with the oxygen atoms on opposite sides (trans), but for (Z), same side (cis), perhaps. Or maybe vice versa. Wait, actually, the configuration of the epoxide depends on the approach of the peracid.

Wait, mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond. The addition is such that the oxygen adds from the same face (cis addition). So, for a trans (E) double bond, the addition would lead to the epoxide with the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides. Because the starting alkene is trans, and the oxygen adds on the same face, so the epoxide ends up as a trans arrangement.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The peracid adds across the double bond in a way that forms the epoxide. The mechanism is that the peracid's O-O breaks, and one oxygen adds to each carbon of the double bond. The approach is such that the peracid adds from the same face of the double bond. So, if the double bond is E (trans), the two substituents on each end are opposite, so adding the oxygen from the same face would lead to the epoxide with the two new oxygen on the same face, making a cis epoxide? Or wait.

Wait, maybe when the alkene is E, the substituents are opposite, so when the peracid adds from the same face, the oxygen adds to each carbon from the same face. So, for the E isomer, the two substituents (the groups on each carbon of the double bond) are opposite. So, adding oxygen from the same face would result in the two oxygen atoms being on the same side, but for the E starting material, the substituents are opposite, so the epoxide would have the O's on the same side relative to the substituents.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the resultant diol after acid workup.

When the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it protonates and then opens up. The ring opening can form diols. For an epoxide derived from a trans (E) alkene, what's the diol structure? Similarly for a cis (Z) alkene.

Wait, I think that for a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide is a trans-dihydroxy structure, and for the cis (Z) epoxide, it's a cis-dihydroxy. But wait, no, that's not correct. The diol's configuration depends on the way the epoxide opens.

Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomer formed depends on the starting alkene's geometry. So, each starting material (E and Z) would lead to a different diol.

Wait, let me remember: when epoxides are treated with acid, the ring-opening tends to proceed with nucleophilic attack on the more substituted carbon. But if the epoxide is symmetric, both ends are equally substituted, so attack can happen from either side, leading to a racemic mixture, or maybe just a single product if the epoxide is symmetric.

Wait, but in the case of oct-4-ene, the epoxide is symmetric. Because the groups on either side of the double bond are the same (each end is a CH2CH2CH2 group and a CH2CH2CH3 group?), so perhaps the epoxide is symmetric. So, when it opens in acid, the diol formed would have two stereocenters, but if the epoxide is symmetric, maybe the diastereomer possibilities are limited.

Wait, perhaps for each starting material (E and Z), the epoxide formed is different, leading to different diols upon ring-opening.

Wait, let me think of the products.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (E-derived), then acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (Z-derived), then acid → diol.

So, maybe each reaction produces a different diol.

But wait, are the diols from E and Z starting materials enantiomers or diastereomers?

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, but when you combine both, you get multiple products.

Wait, but the question says each reaction goes to 100% completion, so for each reaction, you get a single product? Or maybe each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers, but when you run them on a standard HPLC, they would co-elute, while a chiral column would separate them.

Wait, but for Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, the products could be different diastereomers or enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from the E-epoxide and the diol from the Z-epoxide are diastereomers, not enantiomers. So, combining both products would result in two different diastereomers.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. Let's consider that when the alkene is trans (E), the epoxide is formed with the two oxygen atoms on the same face (cis) because the peracid adds from the same face. So, the epoxide would be a cis epoxide.

Then, when the cis epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. The ring-opening of a cis epoxide in acid would lead to the diol with the two hydroxyl groups on the same face, leading to a trans-diol? Or perhaps a cis-diol.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the actual diastereomers. For an epoxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of a trans-diol. But that's more about the diol's configuration.

Wait, maybe I should look up what happens when an epoxide is treated with acid. So, epoxide ring-opening in acid:

The epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then, a nucleophile (like water) attacks the less substituted carbon because the more substituted carbon is more stabilized (so maybe I'm getting this wrong). Or, perhaps the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more positively charged due to adjacent R groups.

Wait, no, the nucleophile tends to attack the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized when the leaving group departs. So, in an asymmetric epoxide, the attack occurs at the more substituted carbon.

But in our case, the epoxide is symmetric (from oct-4-ene). So, each carbon is equally substituted, meaning that the attack can occur at either carbon, leading to a mixture.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the ring-opening would lead to a single product. Because both ends are the same, so the diol would be the same regardless of which side the attack happens.

Wait, but that's not possible, because the attack could occur from either face, leading to different diastereomers.

Wait, no, because if the epoxide is symmetric, then the attack from either face would lead to the same product, because the two faces are equivalent.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Suppose the epoxide is a symmetric, trans arrangement. Then, upon attack from either face, the diol would form with the hydroxyl groups on the same face (cis) or opposite face (trans).

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the key point is that each starting material (E and Z) leads to different epoxide structures, which upon ring-opening give different diols. So, for reaction 1, perhaps the diol is a single product (racemic?), and for reaction 2, another diol.

Wait, but when the epoxide is formed from (E)-oct-4-ene, it's a trans epoxide. Then, when ring-opened, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides (trans) or same sides (cis) depending on how the epoxide opens.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from E-epoxide is a trans-diol, and the diol from Z-epoxide is a cis-diol. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, but in any case, the products of Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 would be diols. Now, each of these diols could be either a pair of enantiomers or a single compound.

Wait, but if the diol has two stereocenters and the configuration is such that the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, then it's a pair of enantiomers. But if the diol has internal planes of symmetry, it might be a meso compound, which would be achiral.

So, let's think about the diols. Let's imagine the structure of the diol from each reaction.

Assuming oct-4-ene is symmetric, the diol would have two stereocenters at C4 and C5. But whether it's a meso compound or not depends on the configuration.

Case 1: Reaction 1 (E-ene) → epoxide → diol.

Suppose the diol from Reaction 1 is a meso compound. That would mean it's achiral, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, it would not show any peaks on a chiral HPLC, but show a single peak on a standard HPLC.

Case 2: Reaction 2 (Z-ene) → epoxide → diol.

If this diol is a meso compound as well, then it's also achiral. But perhaps the diols from E and Z are different.

Wait, perhaps the diol from E-ene is a meso compound, while the diol from Z-ene is a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but that depends on the configuration of the diol. Let me imagine the diol structure.

If the diol has two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons, and each is a stereocenter.

For the diol from E-ene, perhaps the configuration is (R,S) and (S,R), which would be a meso compound because the molecule has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, no, if the diol is (R,S) and (S,R), but since the molecule is symmetric, these configurations would actually be the same, making it a meso compound.

Wait, another approach: the diol from the E-ene (trans) would be a meso compound, so it's achiral. Therefore, it would elute as a single peak on standard HPLC and not show any peaks on a chiral column.

The diol from the Z-ene (cis) would have two stereocenters. Let's see, for Z-ene, the epoxide would be formed with cis stereochemistry. Upon ring-opening, perhaps the diol would be a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but if the diol is a pair of enantiomers, then on a standard HPLC, they would co-elute as a single peak. But on a chiral HPLC, they would separate into two peaks.

Wait, but wait, the diol from Z-ene would have a certain configuration. Suppose the diol from Z-ene is a racemic mixture, which is achiral overall but consists of two enantiomers. Then, when you run it on a standard HPLC, you'd see one peak, but on a chiral column, it would split into two peaks.

But wait, in the problem statement, each reaction goes to 100% completion. So, in Reaction 2, does the product consist of a racemic mixture (50:50 R,S and S,R, which is a meso compound?) or a single enantiomer? Wait, no, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the ring-opening would produce a single product that is a meso compound, right? Because the attack can happen from either face, but the product is the same.

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, for the Z-ene, the epoxide would have both oxygens on the same face. When the epoxide is treated with acid, the ring opens, leading to the diol. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would have two stereocenters, but perhaps be a meso compound. So, even the Z-ene would produce a meso diol.

Wait, but that can't be right because the E and Z starting materials would then both produce the same product. That can't be the case. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the diols from E and Z starting materials are different. Let me think about the diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from E-ene is a meso compound, and the diol from Z-ene is also another meso compound, but different.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because E and Z would lead to different diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer.

Wait, maybe the diols from E and Z are diastereomers. So, when combined, there are two diastereomers.

Wait, but in that case, each reaction produces a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers (since it's a meso compound or not). No, a meso compound is a single compound.

Wait, perhaps the diol from E-ene is a meso compound (so, a single peak on standard HPLC and nothing on chiral), and the diol from Z-ene is a pair of enantiomers (so, one peak on standard HPLC, two on chiral).

Wait, but if the diol from Z-ene is a pair of enantiomers, but the reaction is 100% complete, how does that happen? Because in a symmetric epoxide, the attack would produce a single product that's a meso compound. So, perhaps both reactions produce meso diols.

Wait, that can't be. Because (E) and (Z) would give different epoxides, leading to different diols.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the actual diastereomer possibilities.

Okay, perhaps each starting material gives a diol with two stereocenters that are either both R and S in a way that's a meso compound or not. Let's imagine:

For the E-ene, the diol is (2R,3S) and (2S,3R), which would be a meso compound (because of the plane of symmetry), so it's achiral.

For the Z-ene, the diol is (2R,3R) and (2S,3S), which are enantiomers, making it a racemic mixture. But wait, if the diol from Z-ene is a racemic mixture, it's a 50:50 of two enantiomers. However, since the reaction goes to 100% completion, perhaps each diol is formed as a racemic mixture, meaning each reaction produces two enantiomers.

Wait, but then each reaction's product would be a racemic mixture. So, combining the products of both reactions, you would have four possible compounds: the diol from E (which is a meso, so one compound) and the two enantiomers from Z.

Wait, let me clarify:

Reaction 1: (E)-ene → diol A (meso compound, one peak on standard HPLC, nothing on chiral).

Reaction 2: (Z)-ene → diol B (racemic mixture, which on standard HPLC would be a single peak, but on chiral would split into two peaks).

So, when the products are combined, you have diol A and diol B.

Diol A is a single compound (meso, so one peak on standard, none on chiral).

Diol B consists of two enantiomers (so on standard, one peak; on chiral, two peaks).

So, when the products are combined, the total mixture has diol A and diol B.

When run on standard HPLC, diol A and diol B are both single compounds, so two peaks.

On the chiral HPLC, diol A (meso) would not separate, so one peak. Diol B's two enantiomers would split into two peaks. So total of three peaks on chiral HPLC.

Wait, but wait: diol B is a racemic mixture. On standard HPLC, it's a single peak because it's a mixture of two enantiomers. On chiral HPLC, they split into two peaks.

Diol A is a single compound (meso), so on standard HPLC, it's another peak. On chiral HPLC, it's also a single peak because it's not chiral.

So, the standard HPLC would show two peaks: diol A and diol B.

The chiral HPLC would show diol A as one peak and diol B as two peaks, so total of three peaks.

But looking at the options, let's check what is available.

Options:
A) 4 peaks in both → No.

B) 2 in standard, 3 in chiral → Yes, this matches what I thought.

C) 2 in both → No.

D) 3 in standard, 4 in chiral → No.

So the correct answer would be option B: 2 peaks in standard (achiral) HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral.

Wait, but wait another thing. Reaction 1: (E)-ene → diol A (meso). So, in standard HPLC, it's a single peak. Reaction 2: (Z)-ene → diol B (racemic, so on standard, it's a single peak because it's a 50:50 mix of enantiomers).

When you combine diol A and diol B, the mixture has diol A (one compound) and diol B (racemic). So on standard HPLC, diol A and diol B would each be a single peak (since diol B is a racemic mixture and standard HPLC can't distinguish enantiomers), so two peaks total on standard.

On chiral HPLC, diol A (meso) would still be a single peak because it's achiral. Diol B would split into two peaks because the chiral column separates enantiomers. So overall, three peaks on chiral.

So the answer is option B, which says 2 peaks in standard, 3 in chiral.


--- Final Answer Content ---


When (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, the reactions proceed as follows:

1. **Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene**  
   - The (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. Due to the trans (E) configuration of the starting alkene, the epoxide formed is a **trans epoxide**.  
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the trans epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a **meso diol**. This meso diol is achiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.  
   - On a standard (achiral) HPLC column, the meso diol will elute as a single peak. On a chiral HPLC column, it will also elute as a single peak because it is not chiral.

2. **Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene**  
   - The (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. Due to the cis (Z) configuration of the starting alkene, the epoxide formed is a **cis epoxide**.  
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the cis epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a **racemic mixture** of two enantiomers.  
   - On a standard (achiral) HPLC column, the racemic mixture will elute as a single peak because the enantiomers cannot be distinguished. On a chiral HPLC column, the enantiomers will separate into two distinct peaks.

3. **Combining the Products**  
   - The products of the two reactions are combined. This mixture contains:  
     - The meso diol from Reaction 1 (achiral, single compound).  
     - The racemic mixture from Reaction 2 (two enantiomers).  
   - On a standard (achiral) HPLC column:  
     - The meso diol and the racemic mixture will each elute as single peaks.  
     - Total peaks: **2**.  
   - On a chiral HPLC column:  
     - The meso diol will elute as a single peak.  
     - The racemic mixture will split into two peaks (one for each enantiomer).  
     - Total peaks: **3**.

Thus, the chemist observes **2 peaks** on the standard HPLC and **3 peaks** on the chiral HPLC.

**Answer: B**
