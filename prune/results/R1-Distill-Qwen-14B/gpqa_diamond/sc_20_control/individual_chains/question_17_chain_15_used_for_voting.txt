Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The given data: the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K, is 5x10^10. Oh wait, but wait, what does K represent here? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is for the reaction where Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex. The formula, I think, is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the solution says the pH is ideal. That probably means that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, which is EDTA^4-. So we don't have to worry about the different protonated forms of EDTA, which simplifies things.

The complex is stoichiometric, which I think means that the molar ratio of Ca^2+ to EDTA is 1:1. So each mole of Ca-EDTA complex comes from one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

Let me try to write the reaction. The formation of the complex would be:
Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

I need to find [Ca^2+]. Let's denote [Ca^2+] as x. But since the complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-, the concentration of each would be x, assuming that the EDTA is in excess or that the dissociation is minimal. Wait, but wait, if the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates, then the sum of [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] would relate to the initial concentration, but perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, considering that the solution is made by adding Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- to form the complex. But maybe the assumption is that the solution is saturated with the complex, but the K is so large that the dissociation is minimal. Wait, K is 5e10 which is a big number. That suggests the complex is very stable, so dissociation is minimal.

So, the K expression is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) =5e10.

But if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, then [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M.

Wait, but in solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So [CaEDTA] = 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = y.

But from the stoichiometry of the reaction, for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4- are produced. But wait, the initial situation is that the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So if the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are zero. But that's not possible because the K is so large, but wait, perhaps the solution is at equilibrium.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is such that the Ca-EDTA is the only source of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, perhaps I should model the equilibrium.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca^2+ as x, and EDTA^4- as y. Then, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - (x + y)/something? Wait, no, because each complex dissociates into one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, no, because each complex when it dissociates releases one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates by an amount α (the degree of dissociation), then:

[Ca^2+] = α * 0.02
[EDTA^4-] = α * 0.02
And [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 - α * 0.02 ≈ 0.02 (since α is small, because K is large).

Wait, because K is 5e10, which is very large, the complex is almost completely dissociated? No, wait, no: a large K means the reaction favors the products, which in this case are the complex. Wait, wait, K is the formation constant, which is Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

If K is large, that means that the complex is favored, so the dissociation is minimal, because the complex is stable. So the degree of dissociation α would be very small. So [Ca^2+] is small, which makes sense because the complex is stable.

So, making that assumption, [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] are both equal to x, since for each mole of complex that dissociates, each produces one mole of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So,

K = [CaEDTA]/( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] ) = 5e10 = 0.02/(x^2)

Because [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

So,

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) 

x^2 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = 4e-13 / 1e10? Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, so square root is 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2e-6.5 is about 6.32e-7.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M, which matches.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Because 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. The square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5? Because 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5 which is about 3.16e-7. So 2*3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7, which is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the large \( K_f \). Let the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium both be \( x \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Because [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

So,

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) 

x^2 = (2e-2) / (5e10) = 4e-13 / 1e10? Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M, which matches.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Because 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is 4e-13. The square root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5? Because 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5 which is about 3.16e-7. So 2*3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7, which is option C.
