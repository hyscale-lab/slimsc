Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the problem is: mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change, and the options are given in various units, so I'll have to pay attention to that.

Wait, neutralization reactions typically involve acids and bases reacting to form water. But wait, here we have two acids and a base. Oh wait no, HCl and H2SO4 are acids, Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the reaction is between the acids and the base.

But wait, when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. The general reaction is: acid + base → salt + water. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base.

But in this case, there are two different acids and one base. So I need to consider the stoichiometry between each acid and the base.

First, I should calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl.

H2SO4 is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3, so moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4.

Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL, 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5, so moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

So the total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, for the acids: HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl^-.

H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, but it's diprotic. Wait, does it dissociate completely in two steps? In strong acid context, yes. So each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions. So moles of H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

HCl gives 0.1 moles H+.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

But wait, the base is OH-: 0.2 moles.

Now, when H+ and OH- react, they form water. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the available H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 is less than 0.28.

So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and the remaining H+ would be 0.08 moles.

But wait, what about the nature of the acid and base? Since some of the H+ comes from H2SO4 which is diprotic, but in this case, it's a strong acid, so all H+ ions are available for reaction.

Wait, but the neutralization reaction is the H+ from both acids reacting with the OH- from the base.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So they'll neutralize each other, producing 0.2 moles of water.

Wait, but the problem is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is the heat released per mole of reaction. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases, assuming it's an exothermic reaction.

But wait, the question isn't assuming standard conditions because the concentrations and volumes are given. So perhaps I need to compute the moles of H+ and OH- and find out how much can react, then multiply by the enthalpy per mole.

Alternatively, maybe each acid and base contributes to the neutralization and I have to calculate the total moles of H+ neutralized by OH-.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

HCl provides 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 provides 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2, which is 2 OH- per molecule. So 0.2 moles OH-.

So when we mix them, the OH- will react with H+.

The reaction is: H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles of H+ available: 0.28

Moles of OH- available: 0.2

So the OH- is the limiting reagent, all 0.2 moles will react.

The amount of H+ consumed is 0.2 moles, leaving 0.08 moles unreacted.

So the net reaction is 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

So the enthalpy change is based on the heat of neutralization for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting.

Standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), assuming it's a strong acid and strong base.

Wait, but wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. When it reacts with a base, the first H+ is more acidic and dissociates completely. The second H+ may not, but in strong acid conditions, it does. So in this case, both H+ from H2SO4 are available.

So for the neutralization, each mole of H+ (whether from HCl or H2SO4) reacts with OH-.

So the total neutralization is 0.2 moles.

Therefore, the enthalpy change is 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, B is -11.42 kcal, but wait, units are mixed.

Wait, the options have kcal and kJ. Oh, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ.

Wait, wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as -57 kJ/mol, but sometimes in calories. Wait, 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ is about 13.63 kcal.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of acid (or base) when a strong acid is neutralized by a strong base. So for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, it's -57 kJ.

But wait in this problem, the total moles of H+ reacting is 0.2. So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't -11.4. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but I have to be careful about the units.

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization. So perhaps I should calculate in calories, but the options have mixed units.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate it in terms of the total moles of H+ and OH- and then multiply by the standard enthalpy.

Wait, but in the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48 kJ (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ), which would be close to -57 kJ for 0.2 moles.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 11.4 kJ is how many kcal. 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the calculation gives -11.4 kJ, which isn't exactly any option. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal → -2.72 *4.184≈-11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → around -47.7 kJ.

C) -3.80 kcal → about -15.85 kJ.

D) -16.0 kJ → -16 kJ.

So, my calculation gives -11.4 kJ, which is approximately option A (-2.72 kcal) when converted. Because 2.72 kcal is about 11.4 kJ. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is the same as -11.4 kJ.

But wait, the options have D as -16.0 kJ, which is more than our calculated value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, let me recheck the moles.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 M = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 moles OH-.

So OH- is 0.2 moles. Thus, the neutralization is 0.2 moles H+ + 0.2 moles OH- → 0.2 H2O.

Thus, the moles of reaction are 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, the closest is option D, which is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, that's not matching. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the full neutralization of both H+ from H2SO4 and HCl. But in reality, the OH- is the limiting reagent, so only 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the total moles of H+ present, but that would be 0.28, which is more than the available OH- of 0.2.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, so the enthalpy is per mole of H+. So 0.28 moles H+ + 0.2 OH- → 0.2 H2O. So the moles of reaction is 0.2.

Wait, so 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting. So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer should be -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, let's compute 11.4 kJ in kcal.

11.4 kJ = 11400 J. Since 1 kcal is 4184 J, 11400 / 4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, why is option D there? Because D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, let me recheck the moles again.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 * 0.3 → 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.2 * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ totals 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

Thus, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized.

Hmm, so the calculation holds.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base is providing Ba^2+ ions, which might form a precipitate with sulfate ions from H2SO4. Wait, H2SO4 is providing SO4^2- ions. Ba(OH)2 is providing Ba^2+.

So Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 (s) + ... ?

Reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would form BaSO4, which is a precipitate, and water.

So maybe I need to calculate the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 first, before considering the HCl.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because if Ba(OH)2 reacts with H2SO4, the reaction is: Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

So, let's see the moles:

H2SO4 is 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 mol.

The reaction is 1:1 between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2. So H2SO4 is limiting: 0.09 mol.

So Ba(OH)2 would react with 0.09 mol H2SO4 to form 0.09 mol BaSO4 and release heat.

So after this reaction, how much Ba(OH)2 remains? Initially 0.1 mol, 0.09 reacts, so 0.01 mol left.

Wait, but wait, the reaction of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would also release heat. So perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization isn't just from H+ and OH-, but from the acid-base reaction and the precipitation.

So, the problem becomes more complicated because the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH)2, and the HCl is also reacting with the remaining OH-.

So the total enthalpy would be the sum of the neutralization from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, plus the neutralization from HCl and the remaining Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, that's a possibility I hadn't considered. So perhaps I need to break this into two parts.

First, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Second, the reaction between HCl and the remaining Ba(OH)2.

So let's proceed.

Step 1: Reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

The balanced equation is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

Molar ratio is 1:1. So H2SO4 is limiting.

So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

This reaction produces 0.09 mol BaSO4 precipitate and 0.18 mol H2O.

Enthalpy change for this reaction: each mole of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reacting releases, let's see, the standard enthalpy for this reaction. Wait, what's the enthalpy of this reaction?

Actually, the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is more involved. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the H+ and OH- involved in this reaction.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so when it reacts with a base, it donates two H+ per molecule. But in this case, since it's reacting with Ba(OH)2, a strong base, the reaction may involve both H+ from H2SO4 and OH- from Ba(OH)2, but since it's a neutralization, perhaps the H+ and OH- combine into water, and the sulfate and Ba^2+ form the precipitate.

Alternatively, considering the neutralization part, the reaction of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2 would produce water and BaSO4. So the moles of H+ from H2SO4 are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18.

The moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 (since 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 OH-.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the reaction, each mole of H2SO4 contributes 2 H+, and each mole of Ba(OH)2 contributes 2 OH-.

So when they react in a 1:1 ratio, all the H+ and OH- would neutralize each other, forming water, and BaSO4 precipitates.

So, moles of H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.09 * 2 = 0.18.

So all of these combine to form H2O, releasing heat.

So the moles of H+ and OH- reacting here are 0.18 each, so 0.18 moles of reaction (H+ + OH- → H2O).

But wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole. So 0.18 moles would release 0.18 * (-57) = -10.26 kJ.

Then, after this reaction, we have leftover Ba(OH)2: initial was 0.1 mol, used 0.09, so 0.01 mol left.

This remaining Ba(OH)2 would have 0.01 * 2 = 0.02 mol OH-.

Now, the HCl is 0.1 mol H+.

So the OH- from the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.02 mol.

So, how much reacts?

H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol. OH- is 0.02 mol.

All the OH- will react, and 0.08 mol H+ will remain.

So the moles of H+ and OH- reacting here are 0.02.

The enthalpy change is 0.02 * (-57) = -1.14 kJ.

So total enthalpy change is the sum of both reactions: -10.26 kJ + (-1.14 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

So the total enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 kJ = 2.72 kcal).

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches this.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is option D, but that's not the case.

Wait, but in the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, but according to this, it's -11.4 kJ, which is not an option. Wait, the options have -11.42 kcal (option B) which is about 48.07 kJ (since 11.42 * 4.184 ≈ 48.07 kJ).

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach. Because when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, the H+ and OH- are neutralized, but each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, so the moles of H+ is 0.18.

Wait, but when H2SO4 (0.09 mol) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (0.09 mol), each releases 2 H+ and 2 OH-, so 0.18 each. So 0.18 moles of H+ and OH- neutralize, giving 0.18 moles of water. So that's 0.18 mol reaction, each giving -57 kJ: 0.18 * (-57) = -10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol, which gives 0.02 mol OH-.

HCl provides 0.1 mol H+.

So OH- is 0.02, which reacts with 0.02 H+.

So that's another 0.02 mol reaction, giving 0.02 * (-57) = -1.14 kJ.

Total is -11.4 kJ.

Which is the same as before.

So the answer would be -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the enthalpy per mole.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 is different. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, perhaps each H+ has a different enthalpy.

Wait, standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids is about -57 kJ per mole of H+.

But for H2SO4, the first H+ is as strong as HCl, so its neutralization is exothermic around -57 kJ/mol. The second H+ is weaker, so maybe the enthalpy is less. Or perhaps, when H2SO4 is in excess, the second H+ may not dissociate as completely, but in this case, it's a neutralization with a strong base, so perhaps both H+ are available.

Wait, but in the first reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, both H+ from H2SO4 are neutralized because the reaction is 1:1.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 would be 2 * (-57) kJ per mole of H2SO4, because each mole produces 2 H+.

So the reaction of 1 mole H2SO4 with 1 mole Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of H2O, releasing 2 * (-57) kJ = -114 kJ.

Wait, that's a different approach.

Wait, that would change the calculation.

So, for the reaction of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

Each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+, each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So, when they react in 1:1 ratio, 2 H+ and 2 OH- combine to form 2 H2O, releasing 2 * (-57) kJ = -114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

So, for 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting, the enthalpy change is 0.09 * (-114) = -10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol, which provides 0.02 mol OH-.

HCl provides 0.1 mol H+.

So, OH- is 0.02 mol, which reacts with 0.02 H+ from HCl, releasing 0.02 * (-57) = -1.14 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: -10.26 -1.14 = -11.4 kJ.

Same result as before.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is option A in kcal, or not present in the options as kJ.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So, -11.4 kJ is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about the same as -11.4 kJ.

Alternatively, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 3.82 kcal.

But our calculation is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? Let me compute 11.42 kcal in kJ: 11.42 *4.184 ≈47.8 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization, like -45 kJ/mol instead of -57.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization is taken as -56.8 kJ/mol. Let me see: 0.18 moles (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction) would be 0.18 * (-56.8) = -10.224 kJ.

Then, 0.02 moles from HCl and Ba(OH)2: 0.02 * (-56.8)= -1.136 kJ. Total -11.36, which is about -11.4 kJ.

Still, that's about -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each component
1. **HCl**:  
   Moles = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \) HCl.  
   Each mole of HCl provides 1 mole of \( \text{H}^+ \), so \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **H₂SO₄**:  
   Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \) H₂SO₄.  
   Each mole of H₂SO₄ provides 2 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \), so \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

3. **Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \) Ba(OH)₂.  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 2: Total moles of \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{OH}^- \)
- Total \( \text{H}^+ \) = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).
- Total \( \text{OH}^- \) = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

The limiting reagent is \( \text{OH}^- \), as it is present in fewer moles. Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{OH}^- \) will react to form water, leaving \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \) of unreacted \( \text{H}^+ \).

### Step 3: Enthalpy of neutralization
The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \). Since \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of \( \text{H}^+ \) and \( \text{OH}^- \) react, the total enthalpy change is:  
\[
\Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert to kcal (if necessary)
To convert \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) to kcal:  
\[
-11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**: Matches \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) when converted to kcal.  
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it corresponds to approximately \( -48 \, \text{kJ} \), which is not the calculated value.  
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it corresponds to approximately \( -15.85 \, \text{kJ} \), which is not the calculated value.  
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value of \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

### Final Answer:
The correct choice is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.  
ANSWER: A
